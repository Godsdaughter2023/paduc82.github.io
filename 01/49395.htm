<h2>            Cannot change Windows Update settings since downloading Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I downloaded Windows 8.1 from the Windows Store October 17.&nbsp; Since then&nbsp;Action Center has been notifying me there is a problem with Windows Update. When I go to the settings, the "change settings" box is greyed out. A message along the top says " Some
 settings are managed by your system administration". I am the system administrator. This is a home computer, I am not part of a network. If anyone has any idea how to fix this it would be greatly appreciated.

            <p>I wanted to thank you for your assistance. After trying your suggestions and numerous others, I finally decided to refresh Windows and reinstall 8.1. This solved the problem, although it was a 2 day affair. I should mention it gave me another problem, my
 computer would no longer go to sleep mode after idling for the set amount of time. For some reason the download set me up with a home group, which I was not sharing anything because I don't belong to a home group. Once I withdrew from the group my computer
 was once again able to go to sleep again.</p>
<p>But once again thank you for your help.</p>

            You can't possibly be serious that reinstalling the OS is an acceptable solution! I'm on a surface RT with an administrator account and I have the same problem. Perhaps you should investigate the issue rather than THANK somebody for&nbsp;taking two days to
 work around what is an obvious software glitch.&nbsp;

<p>I was the one that originally started this page. After reinstalling the OS everything seemed fine, then all of a sudden the same thing happened. I searched all over the internet and found a suggestion I didn't place much faith in it worked. For some reason
 when I upgraded to Windows 8.1 it created a homegroup , which I did not have before. I quit the homegoup and set all advanced settings to not share anything and surprisingly it solved the problem. I hope it works for you, if the problem is the same.</p>

<h2>            Sound problems</h2>
                    <p>I have just installed Skype on my new HP computer (Windows 10). The first and second call has been working perfectly fine, but then I started having problems with my voice on every Skype to Skype call as well as Skype to landline calls - the other side would
 hear me fine for first 15 seconds and then my voice disappears for about 30 seconds and then appears again for another 15 seconds etc. I have tried to adjust microphone settings in Skype as well as deinstall and reinstall&nbsp;Skype, but it doesn't help. I can
 use video calls on other platforms normally, only Skype doesn't work properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is causing me quite a lot of problems as I need and use Skype a lot.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Oneguide not working in Guam&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dutch island  say:</h3>
<h2>            Oneguide not working in Guam&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've tried setting up the Oneguide using a zipcode for Guam (tried 96915, 96932 and several others) but no luck here. My DVR (ADB) and TV (Sony) are being recognized and can be controlled for the most part, but sadly not the guide. Now although I don't know
 the actual source of the metadata for the guide, on the Windows Media Center it used to be Zap2It.com and when I go there, I can find Guam using zipcode 96932 followed by selecting my TV provider GTA (see here:<a href="http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCGrid.do?method=decideFwdForLineup&amp;zipcode=96932&amp;setMyPreference=false&amp;lineupId=GU69567:X&amp;aid=zap2it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCGrid.do?method=decideFwdForLineup&amp;zipcode=96932&amp;setMyPreference=false&amp;lineupId=GU69567:X&amp;aid=zap2it)</a>
 I was wondering if it would be possible to have the guide for Guam's GTA Digital TV integrated as well so that here in Guam we can also enjoy the full power of the Xbox One!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Sorry, keeptrying6 but that is the ADB guide on GTA's digital TV. I know the person who did this post. &nbsp;Anyway, still not working though. I wish Xbox had some kind of site where you can view which TV providers were working. Sadly none available and from
 my own personal experience I'll doubt if they ever will do this for Guam. I hope I'm proven wrong :-)

<p>Xbox One Guide does not work with GTA (GudTV) &nbsp;Guess there is nothing GUD about it. &nbsp;However, if you are a Docomo formally MCV customer you are totally able to use the Guide exactly as it should work. &nbsp;Just enter 96912 as the zip and you will see Docomo
 pop up. &nbsp;All there is to it.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see GTA work on this, but I doubt it.</p>

<p>I was wondering how I can add the KPN Interactive TV guide (in the Netherlands) to the OneGuide. I already added the Motorola VIP1853 (it's not working like a charm but I see some controls) and need to add a zipcode. If I add the Zip-code (from where I live)
 it's not accepted. Any idea how to solve this in the Netherlands?</p>

<h2>            Mic is not picking up sound</h2>
                    OK so it took a while, but I got my bluetooth adapter working and paired my headset to the bluetooth. It shows up in the recording tab and connects whenever I turn my headset on. The audio comes through an optical cable that is hooked up to a the headset's
 transmitter so that isn't a problem. I just can't get the mic to pick up my voice. I know that it works because I use it for my phone and my PS3. I tried troubleshooting it, but it did not detect any problems.&nbsp;

            Hi,
<div>1. What is the make an d model of the Microphone?<br />
2. Have you made any changes prior to this issue?</div>
<div>3. WHat are the troubleshooting steps you have tried?</div>
<div>It seems the microphone is not configured properly on your computer. You may try resolving most microphone/line-in problems by following steps, in order, to test, check hardware and connections, update audio drivers, and configure Windows sound settings.
 If you follow these steps in proper order, you will fix the problem or you will find that the audio software being used needs to be configured or updated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>You may run the troubleshooter and check.</div>
<div><strong>Troubleshoot audio-recording problems</strong></div>
<div><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-audio-recording-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-audio-recording-problems</a></strong></div>
<div>Also applies for windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
Step 1: </strong><br />
<strong>Testing for an audio signal</strong><br />
a) Click Start, and then Control Panel. <br />
b) Click Hardware and Sounds, and then click Managing audio devices...<br />
c) Click the Recording tab. <br />
d) To test the microphone, speak into it. To test line-in, send a signal to the line-in port from the source audio device (press play from the audio player). Look at the gray bars next to the device name on the recording tab:<br />
i) If the gray bars next to the device name change to green, this device is active and an audio signal is being passed through the microphone or line-in port. This step shows that problem is related to sound settings in the software that uses the microphone.
 If you have not already done so, set the selected device to default and adjust the levels. Once the device is set to default and the levels are set, use and adjust the sound recording or voice carrying software.<br />
ii) If the gray bars remain gray and inactive, the device is not recognizing a signal. Leave the recording tab open and go to the next step.<br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Check volume levels and mute</strong><br />
The speaker volume for the microphone and line-in may be muted or turned down. Use the following steps to check the speaker volume levels for line-in and microphone.<br />
a) Click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
b) Click Hardware and Sound. <br />
c) Click Sound. <br />
d) Select Speakers, and then click Properties.<br />
e) Click the Levels tab. <br />
f) Click the Muted button next to Microphone and any other line-in that is muted.<br />
g) Use the slider bar to raise the level for Microphone and each line-in to at least 75.<br />
h) Click OK. <br />
<div><strong>Step 3:</strong><br />
You may try to update the latest audio driver from the manufacturing websites and check.</div>
<div>Refer the following link.</div>
<div><b><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></b>

Also applies for Windows 7.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Set Microphone as Default:<br />
</strong>a) Perform the task mentioned below to set Microphone as default:<br />
b) Go to Start and click on control Panel.<br />
c) Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.<br />
d) In the new windows click on the tab "Recording" and right click in the window and click on Show Disabled devices.<br />
e) Now check if Microphone is listed there and right click on it and choose enable.<br />
f) Highlight that Microphone and click on "Set as Default"</div>

            Hi Terry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Terry, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Here are methods to try to troubleshoot and fix the problem as well as how to upload the DMP files so that I can analyze them to see if they reveal a possible cause.

<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />   
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics at top of the list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory

<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run

<h2>            Skype calls from the US to the UK are being rejected</h2>
                    I try making calls to friends in the UK and some are being rejected. I get a message saying that the calling number is not recognized. I have contacted these people in other ways and established that they do not have any filters set up on their phone.
 Can you say if there is some setting on Skype or something else that will allow me to make all phone calls?

    <title>Windows Fails to Boot After Updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dylan_pyro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Fails to Boot After Updating</h2>
                    <p>After manually updating the updates for a newly built PC that Windows required and reccommended (gave two error codes when Windows tried to download them automatically, don't recall what they were but I ended up DL'ing each of the 20 updates manually). When
 I shutdown, it configured Windows and then I restarted it and it configured more. After it automatically shutdown before reaching the logon screen, the next time it started it kept crashing on the starting Windows screen after a minute sitting on that screen
 each time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I launched startup repair numerous times and received these problem details: </p>
<p>Problem Signature: </p>
<p>Problem Event Name: &nbsp;StartupRepairOffline </p>
<p>Problem Signature 01: 6.2.7600.16385 </p>
<p>Problem Signature 02: 6.2.7600.16385 </p>
<p>Problem Signature 03: unknown </p>
<p>Problem Signature 04: 21199326 </p>
<p>Problem Signature 05: ExternalMedia </p>
<p>Problem Signature 06: 6 </p>
<p>Problem Signature 07: BadPatch </p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1 </p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033 </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In the Startup Repair Diagnosis and Repair Details, at the very long list of things, it says the root cause is: "A patch is preventing the system from starting."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I tried to run sfc /scannow command and it keeps saying "There is a system repair pending which requires reboot to complete. Restart Windows and run sfc again." However, the message reappears over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also ran the chkdsk command and had to force it, but there is a lot of information and I don't know what I should post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I disabled the system restart after crash in the boot options, I got this Blue Screen error message: STOP: c000021a {Fatal System Error}
</p>
<p>The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000428 0x00010560).
</p>
<p>The system has been shutdown. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am unable to use the system restore as there are no points. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Bootrec does not see any Windows installations through the /ScanOs or /RebuildBCD option. I was reading around and one solution said it was the GINA.dll file that is damaged and running Drwtsn32.exe would give me a log of info to read, but I can't seem to
 get it running in Cmd, it does not recognize the command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks, Dylan&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Dylan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the information shared by you, it&nbsp;will help&nbsp;us to narrow down the troubleshooting. As&nbsp;per the start up&nbsp;repair&nbsp;logs provided by you it talks about a bad patch preventing start up repair to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
I would suggest you to try&nbsp;removing the pending update via Windows Recovery Environment (WIN RE) command prompt:
</p><p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Access advanced boot options menu by pressing&nbsp;
<strong>F8 key</strong> when computer restarts&gt;</span><span>On the&nbsp;<span><strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong></span> screen &gt;<strong>Select repair your computer</strong> option (As mentioned in the previous step)</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Now select command prompt recovery tool</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type&nbsp; </span>
<strong><span>Dism /online /get-packages&nbsp;</span></strong><span>and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>This will produce a list of installed updates and packages.&nbsp; They will look like this:</span></p>
<p><em><span>Package Identity: WUClient-SelfUpdate-Core-TopLevel~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~7.4.7600.226</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>State: Installed</span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Release Type: Feature Pack<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></em></p>
<p><em><span>Install Time: 9/25/2009 12:02 AM</span></em><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
</span></strong><strong><span>Find the most recent one and then make a note of the package name.<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Then run the command:<strong> dism /online /remove-package /PackageName</strong>:<strong>WUClient-SelfUpdate-Core-TopLevel~31bf3856ad364e35~x86~~7.4.7600.226</strong> (<em>name of update from previous step</em>)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and test to see if the issue persists</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the&nbsp;above suggestion helps. Please revert with the status of the issue.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>However, when I make the "<strong><span>Dism /online /get-packages</span></strong>" call I get the following error (translated from Dutch - so it may be slightly different in English):

</p><p>DISM provides no support for the execution of Windows PE with the option /online. The DISM logbook can be found at x:\windows\Logs\DISM\dism.log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a look at that dism.log. But it doesn't contain anything interesting. I tried too to skip the online part and just run&nbsp;"<strong><span>Dism /get-packages</span></strong>" but it says that get-packages is an unknown option.</p>

            <p>Hi Ben, thanks for replying.&nbsp; No I am using Internet Explorer not the Edge Browser.&nbsp; The game that continues to come up with the problem is Cookie Jam (yes sad I know, but it uses a different part of my brain from my work).&nbsp; I have made sure ActiveX is not
 ticked, and Shockwave is enabled as per the instructions on 'trouble shooting' from Adobe.&nbsp; Everything else is now fine, not Cookie Jam.&nbsp; Definitely Windows 10 related&nbsp;as it works on my son's Windows 8 PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

            <p>All the street games where good. EA Sports BIG was a huge part of my life. From all of the&nbsp;SSX games,&nbsp;to NBA Street V1-V3 &amp; Home Court,&nbsp;to NFL Street 1-3, to Fifa Street 1-3. Bring them all back with backwards compat!!!!! I shouldn't have to dust off my old xbox or 360 just to play these great&nbsp;games that I should be able to play on my one.&nbsp; The&nbsp;NBA Street games&nbsp;was my jam tho with my friends. I whooped everyone in those&nbsp;games. I was undefeated.&nbsp;Street hoops was good too, But I like the arcade style game play like NFL Blitz. The new Blitz The League was more realistic with actual injuries and medical needs, but was still good. I like all sports games. I still love NFL Fever from Xbox. Microsoft needs to make more sports games and bring their own MLB game to the mix which will be way&nbsp;better then The Show.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Come on Microsoft stop being so soft and bring the pain to the game.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            MS Family Screen Time keeps resetting to unlimited</h2>
                    <div>I used screen time limiting successfully in the past. But since a few months it doesn't work anymore.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I set device limits to ON and configure time limits and allowance windows, it works for maybe 12-24 hours but later I find out that my children have unlimited screen time. I go back to the family options to find that device limits are turned off, so the
 time limits and allowance windows dont apply anymore.</div>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this topic opened (and closed) before, but without a helpful solution. I would appreciate if this could be fixed.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />To fix this, you need to delete any corrupted files, and re-download your settings from the Family Safety website.
<br />
<br />If you experience more problems with Family Safety time limits and PC activity reporting, please re-run the Family Safety Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9836307" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9836307</a>
<br />
<br />If you wish to delete the corrupted files yourself without using the troubleshooter, please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1)      Make sure your children are signed out of any monitored accounts.
<br />
<br />2)      Sign in with an administrator account and find the folder that contains the corrupted files. 
<br />
<br />There are two ways to do this. The easiest way is to enter the complete file path:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />On the Start screen, type C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Parental Controls and press Enter.  
<br />
<br />If you’d rather open each folder individually, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />a.       Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.
<br />(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)
<br />
<br />b.      Make sure that Apps is selected, and then enter Computer in the Search box.
<br />
<br />c.       Tap or click to open the Computer app. Open C:, open the ProgramData folder, open the Microsoft folder, open the Windows folder, and open the Parental Controls folder.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3)      Delete all contents of the Parental Controls folder.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />This will delete any corrupt files. Your settings will be downloaded again from familysafety.microsoft.com the next time you sign in.

            Hi Arun
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. I am assuming you are having US calling subscription plan or credits. If yes, read on.
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            <p>I tried Internet troubleshooting, however there is no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried "uninstalling" windows 10 drivers and installing windows 8.1 - because I am facing other problems - Microsoft word, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Power Point are not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>does it mean that I will have to make earlier version compatible to windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it means that :</p>
<p>1. Windows 10 to be reloaded on my Laptop?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please suggest steps steps to resolve above issues.</p>

    <title>Problems with clean booting - cannot restore normal boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ptoye  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with clean booting - cannot restore normal boot</h2>
                    <p>I used the "clean boot" procedure to disable non-MS services while doing some debugging. (Ran msconfig as admin, selected "selective startup" and disabled startup item and non-MS services).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I can't get back to "normal boot" - clicking the radio button and "apply" switches the radio button back to "Selective" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Digging deeper, one of the services won't enable - it's my firewall. I tick the check box and "apply" and the check box just goes blank again. the Event log shows an error 7006: The ScRegSetValueExW call failed for Start with the following error: Access
 is denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone here got any idea how to get round this? I'm also putting this up on the firewall manufacturer's site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely worrying as I wasn't protected until I noticed it. Now I've enabled the Windows firewall which seem to be working (but how does one tell - there's no icon to click on?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OS is Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I appreciate your efforts taken to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to turn on the third party firewall from the anti-virus. However, I would like to know some more information to narrow down the issue and provide you with better assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Are you using Kaspersky anti-virus program for your system security?</li><li>Which firewall are you referring to, when you say, "it's my firewall"?</li><li>Is the issue specific to the third party firewall only?</li><li>Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>As per the error message mentioned, your anti-virus program might needs to be updated. If you have any third party anti-virus program (Kaspersky, AVG etc.)&nbsp;installed in your system, then I would suggest you to update program with its latest update and check
 if that helps you fix the issue.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, then, I would suggest you to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for system file corruption.</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Go to&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>, click&nbsp;</span><strong>All Programs</strong><span>&nbsp;and open&nbsp;</span><strong>Accessories</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on&nbsp;</span><strong>Command Prompt</strong><span>&nbsp;in the Program list and then select&nbsp;</span><strong>Run as administrator</strong><span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click&nbsp;</span><strong>OK</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />

            <p>Hi Harkanwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for this help. To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1&amp;2) My anti-virus is MSE. My Firewall is Agnitum Outpost. Or rather, it was. Now I've enabled the Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>3) The Agnitum Client Security Service is the only service which isn't enabled. The others all re-enabled OK.</p>
<p>4) There were no significant changes to the computer between disabling the services and re-enabling them. all I did was to try the debugging to see if it had made any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An Agnitum engineer has suggested going back to a system restore point. Unfortunately I don't have one which predates the issue (I didn't have enough disk space allocated - I have now!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC didn't find any problems. So I'm still stuck! My guess is that there's a registry item as part of the Outpost system which is heavily protected (quite reasonable for a firewall), but the event log doesn't say which one it is. Here's the XML for the event
 log if it makes any sense to you:</p>

            <p>The plot thickens. At Agnitum's suggestion I downloaded and installed Outpost Firewall. This went OK, and I'm now protected as I was.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>However, there is still some sort of a problem with msconfig. I tried to restore the "normal boot" configuration and it still won't allow me. The problem seems to be that there are two registry entries in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
 which were removed at the same time that I was setting up the selective boot (but not by me - it must have been automatic somehow), and which it can't restore for some reason. They're both marked as disabled, but attempts to enable them just result in the
 tick box being cleared. See the screenshot below.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's not a major issue, as one of the disabled entries is identical to one of the missing ones - I have no idea what the other is meant to do - and Outpost seems to be working OK.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But this does raise the issue - how do I get rid of the offending entries? I assume that msconfig must keep a list of the things that it's deleted - but where?</p>

            <p>Thanks again, Gerry. I cleaned the drives and ran ADWcleaner. It found a few things, some of which I don't recognise at all. Others were probably left behind by old software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The log is at http://1drv.ms/1sFP7Q4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd already run Malwarebytes (I do it regularly) and it showed nothing on Tuesday (after the problem started), so probably not worth while doing it again - it takes about 3 hours for a full scan of all my drives.</p>

            <p>Have you removed what ADW Cleaner found?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To identify what loads when you boot use Autoruns (freeware from Microsoft).<br />
</span></span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902</span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right click an item and then delete it. If you uncheck you can recheck to re-enable the item. It is
 a </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">much safer approach than editing the Registry and better than using msconfig.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run Autoruns and select the
<strong>Everything</strong> tab. Click <strong>File</strong>, <strong>Save</strong> and, using the scroll to the right, change the “<strong>Save as type</strong>” option from Autoruns Data (*.arn) to
<strong>Text (*txt)</strong>. The file name changes to <strong>AutoRuns.txt</strong>. Click the
<strong>Save</strong> button and upload the file to your OneDrive as a shared file and post as a link here.</span></span></p>

            <p>No. I wasn't going to do the remove until I heard back from you (sorry, I should have said that in my last post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>[later] I examined the report in more detail and found that the Firefox items are two mentions of the profile for another user. Certainly not to be deleted. And no idea why there are two - there's only one folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm well aware of Autoruns, but IMHO it has a problem: while it identifies all the startup items, it gives no indication of whether they are necessary or not. And I'm well aware that disabling a service or a driver that's necessary can make the machine unrunnable.&nbsp;
 The reason that I started this whole procedure is that a program crashes in normal mode, but not in safe mode - this is usually due to a rogue driver or service. I used msconfig to disable the non-MS services, and that's how this whole issue started when I
 couldn't re-enable Outpost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree totally about not editing the Registry except in extremis. Whether Autoruns is better or worse than msconfig is, I would suggest, a matter of opinion. It's probably horses for courses. And I have no idea how reliable the various proprietary cleaners
 (ccCleaner, SuperEasy - which ADW complains about, etc.) are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, here's the Autoruns file http://1drv.ms/1x53zrT</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's an awful load of **** in there I'm sure, but nothing that I can see which is likely to cause the sort of problem that I'm getting.</p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would not normally pick and choose on entries that are included in ADW Cleaner reports, although I think it errs on the safe side. By that I think it reports items that may not be absolute
 troublemakers.<span>&nbsp; </span>My feeling is that it is easier to restore anything that is removed than to devote a lot of time trying to determine whether ADW Cleaner got it right as regards every item.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>These are two entries that should go:<br />
Key Found : HKCU\Software\Conduit</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Key Found : [x64] HKCU\Software\Conduit</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SuperEasy Software looks to be potentially risky. It could also be something causing your problem. It is, however, not software I have encountered previously.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you remove something that causes a problem you can use a restore point to put it back.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I do not think ADW Cleaner ever reports cCleaner.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A useful feature of Autoruns is that you can right click an item and select Search Online to get information about the item selected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please use Autoruns to delete 14 entries where the words “<strong>File not found</strong>” appear. With Autoruns you can uncheck an item, which disables it from starting, or you can right
 click an item and then delete it. Click the <strong>Everything tab</strong> and look for the rows highlighted in
<strong>yellow</strong>. To delete a disabled item you need to recheck it before you can delete it. All 14 items are redundant and their removal simplifies researching errors in Event Viewer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have Superantispyware loading when the computer,. Is this necessary? It has a high impact on memory usage and your computer only has 4gb. I would use SAS on demand.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span><span>Please restart your computer, allow 30 minutes for the system to run before uploading further information so that the impact of making changes
 can become apparent.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please upload and share with everyone fresh copies of your System and Application logs from your Event Viewer to your One Drive (formerly Sky Drive) and post a link here. You can remove
 the earlier copies of the logs from your OneDrive.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            Backslash key not working in Windows 8 Command Prompt from Advanced Startup Options</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As part of my effort to move the C:/Users folder to another drive, I need to execute the robocopy command from the command prompt after using the Advanced Startup Options-&gt;Command Prompt. However when giving the command line arguments, I am finding that
 the backslash (\) key is not working and when I hit that key, it is showing up the # character in the command prompt window. Frustrating part is that this key is working absolutely fine, if I am using the command prompt (including elevated command prompt)
 from within the Windows after normally booting up. The problem is happening only when use the command prompt mode after entering the Advanced startup option. Can anyone help please? Thanks.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Ajax, <br />
<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. <br />
We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.
<br />
<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better: <br />
<br />
1. Have you installed all pending updates on the system?<br />
2. Does this issue occur on a local account or Microsoft account?<br />
3. Do you receive any error message or error code, while pressing Windows key and X key together?</p>
<p>
</p><div>I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the&nbsp;system and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the&nbsp;system to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Please follow these methods below, to resolve the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1:</span><br />
</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>SFC Scan: <br />
</strong><br />
I suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check, if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption .The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed,
 or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.<br />
<br />
Please click on the below link and follow the procedure to run SFC Scan.<br />
<br />
Click on, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Do not close the Command Prompt Window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.
<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, follow method 2.<br />
<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>
<p>Try to run the System Maintenance troubleshooter, the steps are mentioned below:<br />
<br />
1. Type ‘Troubleshooting’ in the search bar and press Enter. <br />
2. Click on ‘View all’ on the left panel of the ‘Troubleshooting’ window.<br />
3. Click on ‘System Maintenance' and follow on the screen instruction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;you to check, if&nbsp;you can right click on the start button (Windows Icon), to test, if that helps.</p>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please feel free to contact us, if you face any issues with Windows.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</p>

2. Type </span></span><strong>rstrui.exe </strong><span><span>and hit Enter.</span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>if&nbsp;you are&nbsp;unable to open the system restore Window, then follow these steps below.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>If your PC won't start and you haven't created a recovery drive, download installation media and use it to restore from a system restore point or reset your PC.
<div><br />
1. On a working PC, go to the&nbsp; Microsoft software download website: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<div>
<p>2. Download the media creation tool and then run it. </p>
<p>

<div>
<p>5. Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select Finish. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>

<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>7. On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select Next. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your
 PC's boot order, and then try again. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>8. Select Repair your computer. </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>9. On the Choose an option screen, select Troubleshoot. From there, you can: </p>

    <title>Cannot install drivers in Windows 10 test mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreiqt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install drivers in Windows 10 test mode</h2>
                    <p>I have a Konica Minolta bizhub 190f for which I need to install the printer and the scanner drivers. The last officially supported driver is Windows 7, and there's little to no chance that any newer OS will be officially supported (basically paying Microsoft
 to sign the old drivers) <a href="http://www.konicaminolta.eu/en/business-solutions/products/office/discontinued-products/multifunctional-printers/black-white/konica-minolta-190f/downloads.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Konica Minolta Bizhub 190f drivers">
http://www.konicaminolta.eu/en/business-solutions/products/office/discontinued-products/multifunctional-printers/black-white/konica-minolta-190f/downloads.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Up to Windows 7, the Windows 7 drivers from Konica-Minolta's website worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting with Windows 8 I had to use the test mode, but otherwise the drivers worked perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 the driver in the test mode also worked, until the automatic updates about a week ago (KB3176937, KB3176935, KB3194798, KB3194496or KB3176936, or all of them), which broke the printer and scanner. Now if I want to install the very same driver
 I get the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Window Title]<br />
Install Error<br />
<br />
[Main Instruction]<br />
The third-party INF does not contain digital signature information.<br />
<br />
[Close]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it is relevant, but when the update happened, I was in the test mode, because I could only use the printer and scanner in the test mode. After update, Windows stayed in test mode, but the printer and scanner didn't work anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried:</p>
<p>1)Basically reenable the test mode</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit /set loadoptions ddisable_integrity_checks</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit /set loadoptions DDISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit /set loadoptions disable_integrity_checks</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit.exe /set nointegritychecks ON</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit.exe /set NOINTEGRITYCHECKS ON</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit.exe /set testsigning ON</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">bcdedit.exe /set TESTSIGNING ON</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all the commands above I got this return:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">The operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: Same error message as above, but the Test Mode watermark on the bottom right corner appears. More specifically, it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test Mode</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Build 14393.rs1_release_inmarket.161004-2338</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) change any group policy related to drivers or device installation</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gpedit--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;System--&gt;Device Installation--&gt;Prioritize all digitally signed drivers equally during the driver ranking and selection
 process=Disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gpedit--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;System--&gt;Device Installation--&gt;Device Installation Restrictions--&gt;Allow administrators to override Device Installation
 Restriction policies=Enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gpedit--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;Printers--&gt;Disallow installation of printers using kernel-mode drivers=Disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gpedit--&gt;Computer Configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;Windows Componentes--&gt;Device and Driver Compatibility--&gt;Driver compatibility settings=Enabled</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">gpedit--&gt;User configuration--&gt;Administrative Templates--&gt;System--&gt; Driver Installation--&gt;Code signing for device drivers--&gt;Disabled</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: Same error message as above</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3) this random software http://www.ngohq.com/?page=dseo which promises to enable test mode, thus enable me to install drivers without signature</p>
<p>
</p><p>Result: Same error message as above</p>
<p>
</p><p>After each of the above steps I rebooted, but it did not make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I haven't tried yet:</p>
<p>-Disable driver signature enforcement at boot. I haven't tried this option because, as far as I know, this can only be done locally, and I am working remotely. I will ask someone to try this locally for me, but didn't get the chance yet.</p>
<p>-Uninstall all the recent updates. I will do this as a last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I haven't tried, but I do not consider a solution (yet):-reinstall Windows 10 and then retry all of the above</p>
<p>-downgrade to Windows 7</p>
<p>-install a non-Microsoft OS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas are welcomed and much appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is not true that the test mode watermark appears if you install an application not digitally signed. It is actually the reverse, the watermark appears if you put the system in the test mode, with the specific purpose of installing an application that
 is not signed by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I want to turn off the test mode if my purpose is to run some drivers that are not signed by Microsoft, which is mentioned in the question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How did you conclude that I don't know what test mode is from my question? The problem is that test mode is not working as expected. And what I think it is expected of test mode is to be able to run unsigned drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I literally mention in my question that I do have the update that you mentioned and that that might be one of the causes of my current issue. Why are you suggesting me to install an update, that I already have, that caused the issue to begin with? Moreover
 this is an update, that cannot be uninstalled, that Microsoft forces everyone to have, at the cost of loosing functionality of the OS for users like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This policy, that I suppose Microsoft has, to answer every question is just a cheap gimmick, which wastes your client's time. If you cannot be bothered to read the question or if you don't have any clue about how to answer the question, please, just don't
 answer it!</p>

Some help would be greatly appreciated, considering I've been trying to buy movies, games, etc. missing out on some revenue here Xbox, let's step it up.</p>

Post back with either the results of that or an image of those results. For your network devices, I'd need both the manufacturer and model numbers from the router and the modem. If you have a two-in-one device, you would only need to provide the one set. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>I look forward to working with you!</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------<br /></p>
