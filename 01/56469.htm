<h2>            RAM detection in Windows7 Pro 32-bit</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm a user of Windows 7 professional 32-bit. There's nothing wrong with the system except:-<br />
<br />
It's only detect my RAM up to 3GB(BTW I'm using 6GB of RAM). <br />
<br />
My display card have their own dedicated memory of 1GB. <br />
I know the argument said that 32-bit OS only can use up to 3GB of RAM. But previously,during my Vista time , I managed to detect and use all the RAM I have (6GB) after installing SP1.<br />
<br />
So, what is your advise for my little problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advanced.

<p>Windows Vista 32-bit can determine that your computer has 6 GB of RAM installed.&nbsp; However,<strong> it can't actually use that much RAM</strong> .</p>
<p>I'm 99.99999% sure that if you could run the two tests that I asked you to do on 32- bit Windows Vista, it would show exactly what Windows 7 32-bit does: 3 GB of physical memory available for system use.</p>

                    <p>Original Title: ATL.DLL was not found.</p>
<p>I can't run applications in my pc somebody in my house couldnt get in the computer and changed the operation system to windows xp, which its downgrade from what t use to be. Now I keep&nbsp; getting this message when I try to run an application: The application
 has failed because ATL.DLL was not found Re-install the applicationmight solve the problem but I do get this message after re-installing and I don't know what else to do. The computer loads slow and its freezing, something it never done before this. Even IE
 got a problem, the only thing that works good its the remote assistant that allowed me to get here and to the intermet, actualy all this with the dll thing started after I deleted the firefox browser because it was freezing the computer. my recovery utility
 cant restore, I tried an it ran and told me it can't recover before i uninstalled firefox.</p>

            Unfortunately, the Support Engineer "expert" who is engaged by Microsoft advice to run sfc /scannow will not help you.
<br />
<br />
I would say that, as usual, the Support Engineer has not bothered to recreate the problem and tried their own suggestion.<br />
<br />
If your atl.dll file is missing, sfc /scannow will launch but it not run.<br />
<br />
It is just another Support Engineer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wild goose chase</a>.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Many things will not work if the atl.dll file is missing.&nbsp; System Restore will not work, Event Viewer will not work, you will not be able to get on the Internet, etc. until the file has been replaced.<br />
<br />
Trying to run System Restore you see the following message:<br />
<br />
rstrui.exe - Unable to Locate Component<br />
The application has failed to start because ATL.DLL was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Trying to open Event Viewer you see a message like this:<br />
<br />
MMC could not create the snap-in.<br />
MMC could not create the snap-in.&nbsp; The snap-in might not have been installed correctly.<br />
<br />
Name:&nbsp; Event Viewer<br />
CLSID: {975797FC-4E2A-11D0-B702-00C04FD8DBF7}<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will launch, but it will not run if the ATL.DLL file is missing and you will see events like this in the Event Log (when you get it working again:<br />
<br />
The server {8BC3F05E-D86B-11D0-A075-00C04FB68820} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.<br />
<br />
You will be unable to get on the Internet using any browser.<br />
<br />
You must somehow replace the missing or corrupted file.<br />
<br />
The file could really be missing if it was quarantined (effectively deleted) by your unspecified antivirus software.&nbsp; If the file is simply missing, you can just replace it and then figure out later what happened to the file and decide what to do about it.<br />
<br />
You can perform a Windows search on your system for ATL.DLL and replace the missing file.<br />
<br />
The ATL.DLL file should be in this folder (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Check and see if you can find the ATL.DLL file in this folder or if it is really missing, you will need to replace it:<br />
<br />
Depending on what applications you have installed, when you search your system for ATL.DLL, you may find ATL.DLL in several places on your system.&nbsp; You need to be sure you get the correct one that belongs in c:\windows\system32.<br />
<br />
The most likely place to find a good copy of ATL.DLL will be in either of these folders:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
c:\windows\system32\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
Locate a copy of the correct ATL.DLL file in one of those folders and copy/paste it into the c:\windows\system32 folder.<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the existing file.<br />
<br />
There is a copy of the file on my SkyDrive that you can download to an unaffiliated system and then copy the file to a USB thumb drive or floppy and apply it to the c:\windows\system32 folder of the afflicted system.&nbsp; Here's how:<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these two folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called atl when the file name really needs to be called atl.dll (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to
 change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows XP running in virtual machine on Windows 10</h2>
                    I was running Windows XP in a Oracle virtual machine on top of Windows 10. &nbsp;It was working fine but now when XP tries to start up, it says Windows must be activated. &nbsp;When I click OK to activate it, it says "Already Activated" and kicks me back to the
 XP login screen which puts me in a loop with same results. &nbsp;The Windows 10 runs fine but I have lost my virtual box. &nbsp;A friend set this up for me and I don't know how to re-install it. &nbsp;Can anyone help me. &nbsp;Thanks.

    <title>Error 1935 from installing various software&#40;s&#41; with .NET - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error 1935 from installing various software&#40;s&#41; with .NET errors</h2>
                    [repost from other subforum]<br />
Hello! I have been having the error, which I will describe below, for about a month. This laptop with the problem is now one month old, and I have had the problem about a week after I got it.<br />
It's an ASUS F50 running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit.<br />
<br />
The first instance of error was when I tried to install Microsoft Office 2007 and kept getting error 1935, regarding .net framework problems (and not completing installation).<br />
Other times when installing programs such as Matlab and some Microsoft games I could not complete installation and got similar problems.<br />
Finally, I have been getting a few BSODs with the error message Invalid Kernel Handle when my computer is basically on but not being used. I randomly look up at it and it suddenly goes to BSOD.<br />
<br />
I tried using a few KB articles but the only one that seemed especially applicable was ..one I cannot find anymore, but it recommended to run a .NET cleanup program, and if that didn't solve the problem, to install .NET 3.5 and then 1.1 and 1.0 in that order.
 I unfortunately cannot find the link to it nor remember the # for the article. I ran the program and it didn't work, and then I downloaded each installer, but the first one (3.5) wouldn't launch when I double clicked it, in many instances.<br />
<br />
Thoughts or help? Thanks!<br />
<br />
PS. In addition, I remembered that when I try to uncheck .NET from the Windows services box in Control Panel, it gives an error saying this could not be completed.<br />
PPS. Oh and I found the Office related error name:<br />
Error 1935 837BF1EB-D770-84EB-A01F-C8B3B9A1E18E HRESULT 0x800736B3

    <title>Choosing wallpapers from OneDrive Photos app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rapidkiller11b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Choosing wallpapers from OneDrive Photos app</h2>
                    <p>The new OneDrive Photos app that just got added to preview is great. I can transfer photos to my Xbox from my phone easily. Except I can't set any of them as my wallpaper. Currently the only way to get a custom image wallpaper that's not achievement art or a screenshot is to use a USB drive. Why not let users set their wallpaper using photos uploaded to the Onedrive photo app. It's a first party app after all. If we can't get wallpapers from the built in internet browser at least let us use OneDrive. What do you guys think?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade error OxC1900101 - Ox30018</h2>
                    <p>I have tried repeatedly to upgrade to Windows 10, each time trying various suggestions found on the community forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 11 attempts, I am no further forward - the upgrade always stops showing 6% "Installing Features and Drivers" and 32% overall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There do seem to be a number of people with this problem and I would have thought by now that Microsoft would have produced a comprehensive fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can appreciate that all machines around the globe&nbsp;running Windows 10 would be utopia from a support point of view but they (Microsoft) need to addressing these common faults in order to help them achieve their goal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>really, really, really frustrated,</p>

            <p>I still have the same problem, (32%/6%) after multiple attempts following the limited advice on assorted forums ( nothing understandable to a" non geek" emanating from Microsft). In desperation, I restored my Toshiba L300&nbsp; to factory settings, reloaded windows
 7, and tried again... got as far in the installation process as 36%/13%!. Next I reloaded all the updates to windows 7 and tried once more.....53% / 52%. What the devil can I do next?</p>
<p>This must be the most FAQ of all time, but there is little response from Microsoft that I can find. They don't even seem to have responded to the problem despite all the hype!</p>

            <p>Hi, Stephanie - no resolution as yet I am afraid, still soldiering on with good old windows 7. My worry is what to do when support for 7 is suspended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I see a contributor to this forum; "Rob Daddy" has posted that he has found a cure. I haven't tried it yet.</p>
<p>If you try it and it works, let me (and the other million or so with the same frustrating problem) know!</p>
<p>Best of luck!!</p>

<p>I don't think that Microsoft give a damn about its User Base or they would have been more active in providing a solution.</p>
<p>I have washed my hands of them and invested in an Apple MacBook. Admittedly, it's a very different beast but all my software works okay, and screen manipulation is very different but stay with it. It's definitely a rewarding and less-exasperating experience

<p>Yes Alan, I would like to switch to Apple but I have already invested so much time and money with Microsoft, it will have to wait. Although as a very "silver surfer" I 've not got much time left!</p>

    <title>Unable to open video files on external hard disc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to open video files on external hard disc</h2>
                    Hi, I'm running Windows 8 on a Toshiba laptop and am unable to play video files which are stored on a WD My Passport 500GB external hard drive. My video program VLC opens up, but an error message comes up, saying "File reading failed". I'm able to open
 other files on the HD, such as mp3s and Word files, but not videos.
<div>I've tried right clicking on a video file and going to Properties, then Security, then Advanced, then Change owner, but every name I type in is rejected with the message "An object with the following name cannot be found".</div>
<div>Does anybody have any suggestions as to how I can get permission to open the video files? Any help greatly appreciated! Thanks</div>
                </div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you set VLC player as the default player on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to test the issue using Windows Media Player or Videos app and check if you are able to open the videos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are facing the issue only with VLC player, you may refer to the link for VideoLAN support:</p>

            Hi Rohit,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. The video files won't open in Window Media Player either and yes, VLC is set as my default media player.</div>
<div>I can't think of any changes to the computer since this problem arose, with the exception of installing Tuneup Utilities 2013 - this has never caused problems with previous computers.</div>
<div>There have been times in the past when this particular WD My Passport HD has locked video files, but when using Windows 7, it was always easy to go into Properties and gain access.</div>
<div>I think the issue is getting the computer to allow me to open the files.</div>

<h2>            Dedicated graphic card not shown in the graphic options in Win10 settings.</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I am trying to fight a big problem with my new laptop that all games are super slow(even though the requirements should be far below the specs of the laptop). However, the dedicated card is not working at all. It is detected and present in the device manager
 and amd control panel. I installed all updates and newest drivers, tried various combinations and also updated BIOS, nothing changed. I noticed now that in Win10 settings for games I have, it doesn't matter which option I choose (batery saving or high performance)
 it makes no difference because both are set for the same integrated graphics card. How to add my other card (Radeon 535DX) so that this is the card responsible for games?

            Hello Inczi,
<br />
<br />I have noticed the same settings on every pc.
<br />THat doesn 't prevent dedicated c ard to be used when necessary.
<br />I think you can manage it in AMD settings, as I do in Nvidia control panel for my Nvidia graphics card.

<p>I honestly have no clue if it matters or not regarding the usage of graphic cards. All I know is that my dedicated graphics card is not used. Changing settings in AMD control app does nothing, this is my last hope that if I manage to change that to how it
 should be, games will start using the dedicated graphics card. Therefore I would be grateful if someone who actually knows how to attach my dedicated card to the high performance option in gaming spoke up.
</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            Hi  Inczi 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>

            In the AMD panel I can only choose between batery saving and high performance. Which in the end does not matter because in both cases, dedicated card is not working(I already wrote that changing anything in AMD settings doesn't turn on my dedicated card).
 I still want to know how to add my dedicated card to the options in Windows 10 settings(exactly in the place that I put in my screen, so that wzsoka wydajnosc(high performance) is not anymore Radeon R7 which is my integrated card but instead Radeon 535dx),
 I have already talked with the laptop manafacturer support and they couldn't help me. Do you understand what is my problem at least and what I want to do?

            Did all what you wrote, nothing changed, dedicated graphics card still not working and doesn't pop up in windows setting. Can someone just explain this? I have two graphic cards, but in gaming settings, both modes are operated by radeon R7.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/530b4885-dc81-4b90-b125-93ff9379df6c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/530b4885-dc81-4b90-b125-93ff9379df6c?upload=true" /></a>s

<p>Where did you buy it from? XP hasn't been&nbsp;manufactured for years now. There is most likely no legitimate stock remaining, though I cannot state this as a fact. Chances are that you have bought from a disreputable source. Did anything come with the key such
 as an installation CD? Was it in genuine Microsoft packaging.</p>

</p><p>To the best of my knowledge (I didn't see too many Upgrade packs and it was many years ago that I last saw one), they don't have a sticker inside, though they should have a product key printed on some part of the inner contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of whether or not&nbsp;there was a peel-off sticker inside, to install it you must apply it as an upgrade to an earlier version of Windows, e.g. Millenium Edition. As I said, its a long time ago but, if my memory serves me correctly, at some point
 in the installation process it will say something like "cannot find a qualifying product to upgrade". At that point, if you have one, I think you can show it an installation&nbsp;CD from a qualifying product and the procedure should continue. Failing that you will
 have to install a qualifying <strong><em>older</em></strong> version of Windows, then insert the upgrade CD and follow the instructions.</p>

<p>Well I spoke to a manager and they told me someone used this key on 2 different computers. Unfortunately, they said they cannot issue a new key or do anything about it because Microsoft has ended support for XP</p>

            <p>Maybe the MS manager/activation assistant were telling the truth as they knew it or maybe you were misinterpreting their assertions. Or maybe the place you bought it from was/is not reputable and has sold the key more than once. I have seen many activation

<h2>            New Surface Pro 6</h2>
                    <p>After watching video's on the browser (edge but same issue in other's chrome or firefox) and switching from a few different video's and tabs sometimes the video will start to stutter and it will keep stuttering as if it's playing at 0.25x speed. Even if
 I close the browser and open it again the problem will persist. Only when I actually restart the laptop will the problem temporarily go away. The video lagging will start to happen on any site ie. youtube. I've tried doing a system restore but the problem
 has come back again. Any suggestions on what I can do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a system restore and the problem has not disappeared. The video stutters do come back with some mild multitasking at times between various tabs within the browser. I also did a geekbench4 check to make sure there are no issues with CPU &amp; GPU (13100
 &amp; 32000 scores respectively) but all seems fine with the hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Gemma</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had this issue (as per my earlier post) and have spent the last few hours searching online trying to find a fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just successfully uninstalled iTunes&nbsp;now and have reinstalled to the newest version and thankfully it now registers my iPhone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the following - </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not an expert so I don't know if this part is necessary but firstly I deleted all the files following these instructions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204275#additional</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Under the make sure that iTunes and its related components are completely uninstalled).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still wasn't able to uninstall but then I found this one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.techradar.com/au/news/software/10-tips-for-removing-a-program-that-won-t-uninstall-907471/2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read this article and decided to try the iObit Installer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This one finally worked. It's a free download and hopefully ok (I'll likely uninstall it now) and I had to click through to the next option after uninstall and it brought up all these hidden files somewhere and I clicked to delete them as well and then it
 was FINALLY uninstalled. This has been very frustrating, was driving me insane as I use my iTunes music for teaching gym classes and have to regularly update it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway wanted to let you know how I went in case you haven't found a solution yet.

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker &#40;Trial Version&#41; Will not recognize my .mov files from my iPad in Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>I have just downloaded a trial version of the Windows Movie Maker because I used to love to make movies of my daughters volleyball games. I have just learned that it is no longer free as it was with my Windows Vista computer, which is fine, but I wanted
 to sample a video before paying the purchase price, I hate paying money for something that I am not going to like or just plain doesn't work. I am glad that I didn't pay for it yet, because I download the files to the window, as instructed, and it comes up
 with and "Exclamation Point" inside of a yellow triangle. When I double-click on the file, it gives me the following error:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Do you want to remove "XXX_XXXX.mov" from the project?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The file may be corrupted or in a format that Movie Maker doesn't recognize."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"This movie can't be saved or published until XXX_XXXX.mov is removed from the project"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error:0x87160139"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does this repeatedly for every file that I have tried so far and I have tried 100's of files. Please advise, because I really love this software but refuse to pay for something that isn't going to work.</p>

            <p>So, I have tried this 2 separate times, before your response, and again after your response. I have been unsuccessful on either of my attempts, but I am getting the same exact error message. I have tried to open the file in Windows Media Player, closing
 out all of the windows and re-opening them, and even re-booting the computer after the install with still no success. It did, however, Play the sound for the video, just no motion on the video screen.....PLEASE HELP ME!?!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really trying to get this DVD finished before this weekend so that I could bring a completed DVD to the coach that I am making it for so that they would have some game film to watch, it appears that I am not going to be able to do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded a trial version of another software and it appears to work just fine, should I just purchase that one? I already know how to work the Windows Movie Maker, and I would like to get that instead of trying to re-learn a completely new program.</p>

            Hi Jstar1,
<br />
<br />I would recommend running through the following website, starting at the section named 'Solution 1 – Use Command Prompt from Windows 10 Boot Options menu': <a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-automatic-repair-couldnt-repair-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-automatic-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can download the Windows 10 recovery media by selecting 'Download tool now' from the following website: <a href="https://microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</a>
<br />
<br />If you need to reinstall Windows, your Windows license should activate automatically as it will be tied to the hardware of your computer (specifically your motherboard). 
<br />
<br />If you can get into your computer after running repairs, I would recommend running a Malwarebytes scan, and AdwCleaner to clean any viruses/malware:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/adwcleaner/</a>

 stupid Microsoft Outlook pop-up window continues to pop up on my desktop every few seconds informing me that I don't have a default mail program set yet. The reason I don't is because I hate the default Microsoft email app!! I've searched all over the www
 for solutions on how to add the app but have been unsuccessful thus far. Thanks in advance!!

            Hello Krista,<br />
<br />
<br />
The AOL app most likely is on a class, type or category that doesn't meet the conditions to be qualified as a default Email app by the system. However, we encourage you to provide your suggestions and feedback using the Feedback app or contact AOL.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have other concerns.
