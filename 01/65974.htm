</p><p>I have "Get windows 10" icon on my laptop but could not go beyond 41% on several occasions that I tried upgrading to windows 10. I usually get an error code 80072EFE whenever the update gets to 41%. How do I fix this issue?</p>

<h2>            USB flash drive unreadable if unplugged&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>my usb flash drive got wiggled loose when one of my kids bumped into my dresser, when i plugged it back in the console is only giving me the option to re-format, doesnt recognize it as already sonfigured for use with the xbox, it is my understanding that
 xboxs do this on purpose now to stop people from messing with the game files, is there any way i can get back my data or get it to work again without reformatting it?</p>
<p>Lazy is Lazy microsoft simply needs to write a 1 page long program of boolean checks to compare timestamps and filesizes, and compare them to an internal database file, so simple, they are just dumb and this console is poorly made. I got a ps3 the first
 year it came out, it just recently died on me in september, so i got an xbox 360 this november, and already LB doesnt work on the controller and nothing but issues with the xbox.</p>
<p>someone please just answer this question for me (yes or no), if i use one of those big bad no-no third party programs, can i simply just open &amp; resign the usb flash drive to get it to work with my xbox again? i get charged based on usage of net (105 gigs/month&nbsp;and&nbsp;$2.50
 a gig afterwards) i dont care if i cant play online, i just dont want to lose my 30+ hours of playing and have to redownload the dlc. Because i already know from tlaking to reps they wont give me any compensation for the cost of redownloading even though they
 are directly responsible for me to have to re-download.</p>

<p>Hello LtAscott, </p>
<p>How much room do you have on your xbox 360 hard drive, I know its a silly question. But I was wondering if you could make room on your 360 hard drive and transfer your USB to your hard drive and then reformat the USB stick.</p>
<p>Also it shouldn't cost you a thing to re-download the DLC.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Knocking the USB wouldn't cause the Xbox to believe the content has been modified, at worst if the USB was knocked when a game was saving it could corrupt the save game.</p>
<p>Is the USB device damaged at all? You mentioned the USB wiggled loose but did the connector get damaged or anything you can see/feel when holding the USB. Is the storage a USB flash drive or a USB HardDrive?</p>
<p>I'm guessing you might have tried this but have you tried plugging the USB into one of the other USB ports on the 360 (try the back one if it was previously in the front and vice versa).
</p>
<p>If you plug the USB into a PC does it get recognised as a USB Storage device? Don't format it if prompted on a PC.</p>
<p>Do you have access to another 360 (friends etc) that you could try the USB drive on?</p>
<p>105 Gb a month is quite a lot so re-downloading DLC shouldn't put you over that limit.</p>

<h2>            What do YOU want outta GTA5&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>First and foremost, I hope we get an epic limited edition that far surpasses gta4's (lock box, duffel bag, etc.) second on my wishlist would be more water based activities...the maps of GTA have always been surrounded by water, but with little to do other
 than drive boats...how about FISHING?! submarines perhaps? And I guess the only other thing on my wishlist is the radio stations...I have been playing GTA 4 since I picked it up at the midnight release, and my major issue was the radio stations! just not enough
 music...bring back a Lazlow talk show...(a howard stern channel would be the ***) a variety of old school west coast rap would be great...and maybe some Ill bill, La coka Nostra, and Heavy Metal Kings..<a href="http://youtu.be/siY7mrqNEDY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youtu.be/siY7mrqNEDY</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/siY7mrqNEDY?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/siY7mrqNEDY?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>......<a href="http://youtu.be/oCRn_aQ2P9Q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youtu.be/oCRn_aQ2P9Q</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="htt

<p>All those other "wishes" seem likely to happen EXCEPT for the one about customizing your character. R*, as you can tell, likes you to play as the character they design and ONLY that character/ Multiplayer is another story and I would agree that we should
 be able to fully customize our Multiplayer characters with a WIDE array of clothing and customization options.</p>

<p>I would love for them to add back the gym from GTA San Andreas. I heard rumors about it being put back in. The skill thing from San Andreas would be pretty sick cause it gave the character some more feel to it for me cause i got given a character w a story
 but i could make him good at driving cars or bikes, fat or skinny or Muscle on top of Muscle. The driving schools and Pilot school would be sick to make a return. Just more activites instead of mission and go to bar. I liked what they did w the Ballad of ***
 Tony. Add in those features again. Night clubs and cage fighting. Thats all i do when im playing it now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>5- no offence cant spell but the strip clubs and the hookers is the best thing about gta and every game they come out with. that part of the game just gets realer and better every game of the series so of course thats gonna be in the next game. rockstar

<h2>            How to delet windows&#47;software distribution&#47;downloads files</h2>
                    I am using Windows Xp and am trying to save disk space. I have checked disk usage and a huge amount is being used by windows/software distribution/downloads which, I think is the temporary file for the windows updates that have already been installed.
 How do I delete this file and make it so that the computer will still run but will not try and redownload/install these updates again.

<p>1. Ordinarily, the folder is sometimes renamed or deleted to fix a specific issue with Windows Update. There is no harm in deleting it, but it will erase your history as shown on the Windows Update website.</p>
<p>In a Run window (Windows Logo key+R), type services.msc and press Enter. Scroll down and stop the Automatic Updates service. Using Windows Explorer, navigate to C:\WINDOWS, right-click and Delete the folder SoftwareDistribution or if you’re nervous about
 deleting the folder, Rename it to, say, SoftwareDistributionOLD. Start the Automatic Updates service and run Windows Update again, which should confirm that no updates are outstanding.</p>
<p>2. Additionally, if your PC is behaving properly you can remove the hidden Windows hotfix backup files that begin with $NTUninstallKB from the WINDOWS folder. Be aware that once they are removed you will not be able to uninstall the updates that they represent.
 There are two ways to do it:</p>
<p>2A. Manually, but copy the folders to a CD/DVD first to allow their restoration should a fix need to be later removed. Now delete them from the \WINDOWS folder but leave the orphaned Add or Remove Programs entries intact. Only delete the $NTUninstallKB folders
 that relate to fixes not those for applications like Word, WMP, etc. Also, DO NOT DELETE THE $hf_mig$ folder.<br />
2B. My preference is to run a script which additionally removes the corresponding entries in Add or Remove Programs. Once they are removed by the script, they cannot be restored. Download, extract and run this little script<a href="http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_hotfix_backup.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dougknox.com/xp/utils/xp_hotfix_backup.htm</a>
 Create a system restore point first just in case anything goes wrong during the registry updating.</p>

<h3> captain jason  say:</h3>
<h2>            Something is seriously wrong with Windows Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>I spent several hours working on a movie that contained photos, videos and music. I went to save the movie file for HD playback and the format in which it was saved was totally WRONG!
</p>
<p>1. text wasn't diplayed properly in the colors I chose.</p>
<p>2. the music didn'y play as I set it up with start and end points.</p>
<p>3. the video was cropped wrong.</p>
<p>4. transitions were WRONG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bottom line is I'm pissed for waisting hours on this project only to have it screwed up by this application "windows movie maker"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of all that, my original movie file is all messed up! I save several versions while creating it and ALL of them have been corrupt. Music doesn't play when I re-enter movie maker, only when I am originally in the program and havent exited.........Man
 this is beyond frustrating!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>original title:&nbsp;Windows 7: startup freezes at the 'Starting Windows' screen. Maybe Classpnp.sys problem</p>
<p>HELP....</p>
<p>my computer is not booting up it keeps freezing on the 'Starting Windows' screen. When I try going into safe mode it seems to get stuck at classpnp.sys.</p>
<p>I've tried running Startup Repair from the install dvd, all I get is:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>problem event name - startup repair offline</p>
<p>problem signature 01 - 6.1.7600.16385</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried system restore but all I get is:</p>
<p>the file or directory is not a reparse point - 0x80071126</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried bootrec (all four options)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>under 'diagnosis and repair details' all sections come up as 0x0 except Chkdsk which has an error code 0x1126. it also says 'unspecified changes to system config might have caused the problem' 'repair - failed 0x3'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer is a self build:</p>

<p><span>Hi The-Handy-Andy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you have any external USB devices connected to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 was the last time it was working fine?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disconnect all external devices and then try to restart the computer and check if you are able to log on to your computer. From the problem signatures
 that you have given it seems that at start up it is trying to load any device whose drivers are not loaded properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Try booting into&nbsp;<strong>Low resolution video
</strong><strong>mode </strong>it may work if issue is caused due to the display card drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You must press F8 before the Windows
 logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then
 press F8.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the &nbsp;<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight &nbsp;<strong>Enable low-resolution video (640×480)</strong>, and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you can boot into Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            prologue to ms. splosion man DLC not working</h2>
                    
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I downloaded "prologue to ms. splosion man" a couple of times now and it's still not letting me have the play now option. &nbsp;Every time I hit DLC option in Splosion Man, it says that I purchased the DLC and would I like to download it again. &nbsp;The Play Now
 option is not clickable. &nbsp;So everytime I download, it still doesn't let me play it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>4. &nbsp;Option to download again shows up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Download again.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;And it does download completely. &nbsp;But there's still NO play now option when I try to access it from Splosion Man. &nbsp;It's just the same Download again option.</p>
<p>And when I delete this download and try again fresh, it still doesn't work.</p>

<p>Guava Ninja,</p>
<p>You are not alone in your frustration. &nbsp;I too am unable to run the prologue dlc for 'Splosion Man.</p>
<p>I have run through the whole gamut of possible solutions...to no avail...</p>
<p>Help...someone!!!</p>
<p>FYI, I am not sure, but I suspect that some of my game save data may have been corrupted after downloading the DLC. &nbsp;I have beaten the game, but now it shows that I have not passed levels I have previously passed.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Thank you ShadeSix for commenting. &nbsp;I am unhappy that it's a problem, but reassured that it's not just me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Betty La Roo, your comment did not help because I do not have Ms. Splosion Man, which should not matter because the DLC is SPECIFICALLY FOR SPLOSION MAN.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Pairing - Xbox One Elite Controller</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a new Alienware desktop running Win 10 Home x64. Bluetooth appears to be working, but I'm not getting the Xbox One Elite Controller in the list of available devices when I attempt the pairing. The light on the controller flashes normally when I
 press the pairing button, but on the PC, I'm only getting four or five generic 'unknown' devices. I've tried a few, but none will connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot, I unplugged the power from the Xbox, just to make sure there wasn't a pairing conflict between the game console and Windows. Doesn't help. I've also tried pairing in the new Win 10 interface, as well as through NCPA.cpl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get home, I'm going to try pairing the controller with another computer, but I'm also interested in any suggestions this community can provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            <p>Brad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAIK, the Xbox One Elite controller does not, at present, support Bluetooth connectivity.&nbsp; Only the Xbox One-S generation controllers currently support this feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Elite controller can be used wirelessly on a Windows PC, but it requires the Xbox Wireless Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been wanting to purchase an Elite controller, but have been holding off to see if the hardware is updated with the Bluetooth support the new S-controllers have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            I've spent the past hour trying to pair with the Samsung VR headset which is xbox controller compatible.&nbsp; &nbsp;I was going out of my mind thinking i was doing something stupid.&nbsp; I just assumed a $150 wireless device was Bluetooth when their cheaper/older ones
 included it.&nbsp; GAH!&nbsp; Damm that's so very very very annoying.

            I can't believe I just spent 158 for a controller that doesn't support bluetooth!! &nbsp;for 150 I expect it should say: &nbsp;by the way don't waste your money on this.....no bluetooth. &nbsp;I want to return it.

<p>&nbsp;They never said it had Bluetooth in fact higher end gaming controllers like this will not or should not use Bluetooth naitively because it has more latency. &nbsp;The Xbox one elite controller's run on a Wi-Fi signal; the usb dongle converts that to Bluetooth
 so you can connect that way over your computer if you want but it will be a slower connection which is why they're not going to put that technology in a highend controllers that are typically bought by hard core gamers who want the fastest response time, when
 they can put it in their standard controllers at a cheaper price point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps. &nbsp;Most people who spend 150 or more on one controller do research on its capabilities first I suggest you do that next time so you don't buy something that you regret that never claimed to have the feature you wanted it to have. Simply reading up on the
 elite controller you wouldnt waste youre money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pss all elite controllers come with a usb dongle to use the controller on your pc. If you didnt get it contact the seller and get one. Problem solved.<br />

<p>That's nice, bud.&nbsp; But it is a top of the line Microsoft Product, and should have that.&nbsp; In fact, it is so fundamental an issue, that many would not even consider having to search out that info because it is a no brainer to have that option.&nbsp; Microsoft has
 promoted the Xbox/PC seamless cross platform as a strategy.&nbsp; Yet their top of the line input device doesn't seamlessly integrate.&nbsp; That is the issue.&nbsp; That is the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you know better.&nbsp; Because you are you, right bud?</p>

Hi</p>
<p>They should display the same way as the Music folder, if you have the &nbsp;<strong>Arrange By</strong>&nbsp; option (top/right in the View window)&nbsp;set to &nbsp;<strong>Folder</strong>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>They are all set to "Arrange By Folder", but for some reason preview differently.</p>
<p>For example, my</p>
<p><strong>Documents<br />
&nbsp; My Documents <br />
&nbsp; Public Documents</strong></p>
<p>Previews as:</p>
<p><strong>Documents Library<br />
Includes: 2 Locations&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Arrange by: Folder<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> - all sub folders from both folders</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But my Public folders are merged with my private folders in my preview.&nbsp; I have checked all options and they seem to all be the same (except for the above greyed area).&nbsp; This is driving me nuts.&nbsp; There must be some "Separate views by location" option.&nbsp; Mysteries
 abound.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>That is strange and I cannot recreate what you are describing.</p>
<p>Click the &nbsp;<strong>Arrange By</strong>&nbsp; drop down menu. If you see a &nbsp;<strong>Clear Changes</strong>&nbsp; option at the bottom of that menu, click that option and let us know if this changes anything.</p>

<p>OK, what I did was:<br />
1. added &lt;Folder path&gt; &nbsp;to the column display&nbsp;<br />
2. right click in blank area<br />
3. group by &lt;Folder path&gt;</p>
<p>This separates the two main folders within the library, organizing the display by the &lt;Folder path&gt; which is 1/2 the battle.</p>
<p>e.g. selecting the&nbsp;&lt;Videos&gt; library, I get:</p>
<p>Videos Library<br />
Includes: <em>2 Locations</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Arrange by: <em>Folder<br />

&gt;C:Users/Public\Public Videos (1)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;.......folders</p>
<p>Which is good enough for me.</p>
<p>The Music Library (which for unknown&nbsp;reasons is&nbsp;in my preferred&nbsp;display format) displays as:</p>
<p>Music Library<br />
Includes: <em>2 Locations</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Arrange by: <em>Folder<br />
</em>Name&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Size&nbsp;&nbsp; Folder path<br />
&gt;My Music (3)--------------------------------------<br />
&nbsp;C:\Users\John<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ..... folders</p>
<p>&gt;Public Music (1)-----------------------------<br />
&nbsp;C:Users/Public<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;.......folders</p>
<p>which does separate folder name from the folder path.<br />
The only difference I can see is the &lt;Group by&gt; in this library has no selection in it.</p>
<p>If I clear all&nbsp;changes, the display reverts to one list for all locations.<br />
It would be easier if&nbsp;I could attach a screen shot.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's all for me.&nbsp; I have a headache and am not pursuing this further.</p>

            In the upper right of the Windows Explorer window, find the <b>Arrange by:</b> setting. Click the down arrow to show the context menu. Choose Reset folder (or the similarly-named entry), and the default arrange behavior will return.

<h2>            My MSN premium mail program is not working</h2>
                    My MSN premium mail program is not working. I had the computer at a Staples office supply store to get a cd drive checked. They said they were doing free computer cleanup. I said yes. When it was completed I took the computer home and the MSN Premium mail
 program wouldn't run. Error messages said files are missing. I downloaded one file and then another message poped up saying another file was missing. I took it back to Staples and I don't think they know how to fix it. I guess the program has to be re-installed.
 my concern is that there are folders with important emails in them. Will they be erased if I re-install the program? Where do I go to re-install.

<h2>            suddenly my sound on my laptop is gone..</h2>
                    i opened my laptop, ofcourse theres an opening sound. then i leave it for sometime then when i get to it again i played my games, WOT to be exact and i noticed i have no sound, i thought my sound is so low or it might be muted so i checked but its not.
 then i tried using eternal speaker and earphones and its working., i also checked my drivers it says its working perfectly and i have an updated drivers, but still no sound. whats happening, on sound section, input sound on start, on playback tab theres 2
 items named: 1-Digital Display Audio[AMD high definition Audio device][not plugged in] , and Speakers[Realtek high definition audio device][Default Device.] -- on device manager all sound related drivers are working properly and updated drivers., my first
 time experiencing this., btw this is a new windows 10 from update., ofcourse i can play games so i mostly already downloaded neccessary files,/drivers. &nbsp;my laptop is toshiba satellite.

    <title>Now TV App Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wavydavy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Now TV App Not Working</h2>
                    Since the crash on 30 January, Now TV hasn't worked on my Xbox One S. I've done a complete power reset on my Xbox - as suggested elsewhere on this forum - but with no joy. I deleted the App but now it won't download again. When I check on the problem it
 says there is an error with the code&nbsp;0x80072f8f. Am getting quite annoyed now as I pay a subscription to Now TV and currently can't watch anything without plugging my laptop into my TV screen.

<p>Hey Wavy Davy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. We understand you are experiencing some issues when trying to use your NOW TV app, and now the app won't even download prompting the error code&nbsp;<span>0x80072f8f. We have been experiencing some service problems these last
 couple of days. Try downloading the app once the service alert is over. You can keep track of this by heading over to our
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
service status page</a>, or by running a connection test on your console.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thank you for your reply. I have taken your advice and have been monitoring the Service Status which has now been saying that all services are up and running for some time. In addition, I have checked my connection and my Xbox informs me that all services
 are available. Never-the-less I still cannot download and install the NOW TV App. When will this be fixed? Is it still being worked on considering the Service Status claims everything is working fine?

            Sorry to hear you're having the same problems too. I just wish they would give us some idea when this is going to be fixed - if at all. I can still watch NOW TV on other platforms but the XBox is most convenient for family viewing. I really don't think
 Microsoft are actively addressing this issue if the Service Status is anything to go by. I mean, let's face it, everything is NOT working as it should.

<p>I have bolded what appears to be problems.</p>
<p>The driver that appears to be causing the crash is the e1k62x64.sys.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=e1k62x64.sys&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=&amp;oe=&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=xwCWT6eMBYHe0QHXhfSiDg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
e1k62x64.sys</a>, which is dated Apr 6, 2010, is the Intel network&nbsp;adapter driver.</p>
<p>You can try updating the Intel network adapter driver.</p>
<p>Try Dell for an update or you could try the following utility from Intel:</p>

<p>However the problem may be McAfee antivirus&nbsp;driver, the mfeapfk.sys.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?q=mfeapfk.sys&amp;sourceid=ie7&amp;rls=com.microsoft:en-us:IE-SearchBox&amp;ie=&amp;oe=&amp;redir_esc=&amp;ei=_AGWT6fHJabm0QGY-KXZDg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
mfeapfk.sys</a> is dated June 25, 2010.</p>
<p>As this appears to be an older version I would suggest to update to the most recent version of McAfee antivirus</p>
<p>If problems continue consider replacing McAfee antivirus&nbsp;with alternative software.</p>

<p>Hi Kristy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Sending a gift card for your friend to buy games from Microsoft Store would definitely work. You can buy a digital game code and send the code to your friend and your friend can redeem it on his account. However, you need to check if the game is available
 on his region or country. To get more information about this, we highly recommend that you get in touch with our Xbox Chat Support. To do this, you may refer to the link below:</p>

<h2>            SQL server fails to start error 1920 and 1605</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 laptop identical with one exception. One has never been taken out of the box since July till now for testing. The other has all current updates. I am trying to install software and get the error message that qsl server is needed and something to
 do check your permissions. I have given everybody full access to the sql server but no help. The install still crashes part way through. For comparison I took the 2nd laptop out of the box and did nothing but install the program and it went perfectly. Now
 why the difference is my question? Both running windows 10 home.</p>
<p>

At the result of my experimental lab, computers restarted automatically first before installing Windows updates completely. I am looking for a solution that computers need to restart automatically after Windows update finishes. It will save a lot of time and
 efforts for IT technician for deploying Windows Image and installing Windows updates. Please, be advised.<br />

</p><p>I then get a message that says something like messaging isn't available. However I am able to send messages to my Contacts, but they can't send messages to me . We can both video one another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't call the Skype audio contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, where do you find the option to message, chat with or talk to someone from Skype - its referred to but where is it ?</p>

<h2>            Terribly Poor Windows Support&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I am STILL waiting for Microsoft Support to do troubleshooting on my computer! Below are some notes I’m taking that show how bad Windows Support is:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8-2-16 Windows 2nd level Support called (#1) at ~9:30 a.m. concerning #1347874733 and we talked a bit. He set up a call-back was scheduled at 1:00 p.m.
 Called (#2) at 3:13 p.m. because they did not call back as scheduled. Was transferred at 3:22 p.m. and then disconnected almost immediately! Called (#3) at 3:23? p.m. Was transferred at 3:27 p.m. to 2nd level Support. Answered at 4:03? and was told I was connected
 to wrong department! Before I could ask what department it was, he transferred me. At 4:07 p.m. I was disconnected! Called (#4) at 4:08 p.m. At 4:14 p.m. I hung up because he would not allow me to speak to a Supervisor and wanted a case number again. Called
 (#5) at 4:15 p.m. Was told wait time was greater than 30 min. Message said that I need paid support and did not give option for case number. At 4:17 called (#6) again. Said need paid support. Said need a mobile number to send text for survey and I did not
 give one so it disconnected, I believe. Called (#7) at 4:23 p.m.?, the general Windows number and finally spoke to woman who asked for case number but I didn't give it and I asked for a Manager or Supervisor. She finally said that she would get one. She later
 said there wasn't any available. She said would transfer to Joe which was a woman which was only a CS person. Spoke to her and Joe said would transfer to 2nd level Support but I didn't want to wait for another 1/2 hour on the phone an either be transferred
 to the wrong department or disconnected.<span>&nbsp; </span>At 5:04 p.m. she said would transfer me to correct department and according to her someone should answer right away. I said that if no one answers in 5 min. I will hang up. At 5:10 p.m., I hung up because
 no one answered. At 5:13 p.m. she called back and said 2nd level Support was busy. I told her again that I waited on hold for a half hour (actually more) and one answered and have been waiting for two weeks perhaps to get things fixed, I believe. Asked to
 speak to Manager or Supervisor. and was put on hold. At 5:33 p.m. hung up.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8-5-16 At 11:54 a.m. a person called to schedule a call-back later today! A call-back was scheduled for 7 p.m. today. Man said that they had a lot of
 customers with issues basically after the Windows 10 update and they had some time in evening. Was on phone for 25 min.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I received a call from Microsoft 2nd level Support at 7:08 p.m. but after I answered, I immediately was disconnected! At 7:08 p.m. I received a call from
 Microsoft on my cell phone. At 7:10, I answered and spoke to a man for a little while and asked that he call back on my requested or preferred number of 509-826-7067 and he said he would. A little while later, my land line phone rang at 7:12 p.m. and I answered
 and immediately I was disconnected! I then asked that he call my land line again as a test. (I had answered on another phone.)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Ended at 8:39 p.m. Windows Support is supposed to call at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>!8-6-16 Ankur Choudhary called at 10:58 a.m., an MS 2nd level Support person. He immediately said that the high CPU usage of the System and Compressed
 memory process was normal! I said that it is not and that he was not familiar with my computer! I did show him later that the issue was related to IE11. After I installed the latest NVIDA drivers, the System and Compressed memory process went down to ~0.1-2%
 on both computers. He didn't set my computer back to Normal boot before finishing and not everything worked. A bug concerning Normal boot not sticking was found. Additional bugs: Dism command, lost source files, logon issue, IE11 URL saving in Favorites Sidebar,
 Edge not responding, Edge imported Favorites from IE not alphabetized correctly. Call ended at 1:39 p.m.? On phone for ~2 hours 40 min.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8-8-16 At ~7:35 p.m. called Windows Support and was told would be transferred to 2nd level Support without much wait time. At 7:41 a man answered. Started
 speaking to a man who said that the previous Support person would have to work on the computer! I said I need help now. He listen some and then after I spoke about the previous Support people erroneously saying that the System and compressed memory CPU usage
 is ~15% is normal the call was disconnected at 7:48 p.m. Called at ~7:55 p.m. and spoke to Anne. Said that she would transfer to a Manager. Spoke to a Manager who didn't know that much about the OS and finally said would transfer to 2nd level Support at 8:19
 p.m. At 8:25 music stopped. At 8:28, it started again and then stopped at 8:29 p.m. At 8:29 said would put in queue. At 8:31 was xferred to Up and Running Dept. for Windows and Office. At 8:43 was told would connect to 2nd level Department. At 8:47 was told
 would connect to 2nd level Support and check for Manager? At 8:53 p.m. he said in a roundabout way that he got disconnected and will try again! At 8:56, he said was disconnected again! He then said he would send a message to a 2nd level Support Manager and
 arrange a call-back from 2nd level Support at 10-11 a.m. tomorrow. At 9:21 call ended. Spent about 1 3/4 hours on phone and got no Support! (Windows Support DID NOT follow through with the scheduled call-back.)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8-11-16 Called Windows Support at ~3:20 p.m. Woman said would connect to 2nd level Support. Asked to speak to a Supervisor. I did, and he said he would
 connect me back to level 1 Support at 3:38 p.m. and they will connect me to 2nd level Support. At 3:40 was transferred to 2nd level Support. At 3:48 p.m. was connected to 2nd level Support and then disconnected at 3:48 p.m. Called at ~3:50 p.m. and spoke to
 a woman. At 4:01 hung up after woman said that she would NOT transfer to her Manager! At ~4:05 called Support again and asked to speak to a Manager. She asked what my concern was and I told her your terrible Support. Then silence. She asked again what my concern
 is. I said again your or Microsoft's terrible support. She then said I need to call the Corporate Office. I told her that won't work---I have called them. Also, they aren't Support. Eventually transferred to a Manager who contacted 2nd level Support and said
 they would call back within 30 min. (asked for 30 min. because was trying to eat and all of this delayed my meal.) Call ended at 4:47 p.m. ~1 hr. 25 min.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Man called back around 5:15 p.m.? and started the Windows 1607 upgrade. Call ended at 6:01 p.m. Although the Support person said that all of my files
 and personal setting would be retained, that was false. Things that were changed that I noticed: 1. Desktop picture missing. 2. Inkjet printer was removed. 3. LaserJet printer was removed. 4. Had to unpin Store from Taskbar. 5. Snipping tool keyboards removed.
 6. IE lost full screen opening setting. 7. On computer #2 Dism command would not work. Unresolved issues: 1. Logon screen after waking up (remains black) doesn't appear until I hit a keyboard key. 2. Calculator keyboard shortcut doesn't work. Call ended at
 6:01 p.m. Tot. ~2 hrs. 50 min. Microsoft's Support is often an example of what Support is not supposed to be! He did NOT call back later to see how the reinstall went.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8-12-16 2nd level MS Support called at 12:07 p.m. and we talked about the Windows update on both computers. He said to reinstall the upgrade on computer
 #2 to try to resolve the Dism command failing issue which I did. Spoke to a Manager. Call ended at 12:41 p.m. ~35 min on phone.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Called Windows Support, case #1347874733 because of Edge Favorites issue at ~5:10 p.m. Spoke to a man who eventually said would contact 2nd level Support.
 Was left on hold and finally said at end that couldn't contact them. Sounded like he could connect me to them or I could hang up and they would call back. It was decided that I would hang up and wait for a call back. Call ended at 6:01 p.m. ~50 min on phone.
 Tot. ~1hr. 25 min. (I have no record of them calling back.)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>8-17-16 Called MS Support at 6:28 p.m. concerning #1347874733 and left msg. Said would call back in ~6 min. at 6:29 p.m. Host process for Setting Synchronization
 is ~13% at times. At 6:39 p.m. received call but only was put on hold! At 6:44 p.m. was transferred to 2nd level Support at 6:47 p.m. At 7:09 a man answered and after talking and put on hold I was disconnected at 7:15 p.m.! On phone for ~25 min.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9-5-16 Chatted concerning Windows issue from 10:37 p.m. to 11:23 p.m. I was assured that 2nd level Support would call at 10 a.m. tomorrow. Tot. time ~45
 min.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9-6-16 Windows never called so far today! (They never did call as I was told.)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9-7-16 Windows Support called and we talked a little while and then call ended and said would have another give me a call. A man called at ~12:05 p.m.
 and got connected with 2nd level Support but because the woman wasn't the Support person who was working on the case, I was told I would get a call-back in two hours at ~1:15 p.m. Call ended at 1:20 p.m. They did NOT call back like they said!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9-16-16 At ~10:30 p.m. Windows Support called and I mentioned to him some problems about Support including not getting scheduled call-backs. He asked
 when a call back could be made but I asked if one is made, will I get called back? And, then CLICK, I was disconnected!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>At 10:35 a.m. I received a call from Microsoft, I answered and there was no response.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>At 10:36 a.m. I received another call from Microsoft and again, there was NO response.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>At 2:08 p.m. Microsoft called and I answered but no one said anything!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>At 3:14 p.m. Microsoft called and I answered but no one said anything!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9-17-16 At 11:10 Windows Support and asked if they could take control of computer to troubleshoot and I said I have around 1/2 hour. That wasn't really
 enough time it appeared so the Support person scheduled a call back next Monday at 2 p.m. I asked that he send me a confirmation email and he said he would. Ended at 11:16 p.m. (I cannot find that confirmation email although I’ve done much searching.)</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9:19-16 Windows Support called at 2:02 p.m. and asked if could call back in one hour. I came across as I was expecting the, Support person to call at
 2:00 to troubleshoot the computer and he asked if he could call back in two hours I believe. He finally said he would call back in 1/2 hour. Ended at 2:05 p.m.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Windows Support did not do as he said and called at 2:50 p.m. approximately 45 min. later and we talked but he didn’t even try to do any troubleshooting---all
 he wanted to do was a custom installation where I would have to reinstall all my software and reset up my computer! At one point he said something like I just need to wait for a Windows Update as if that was going to fix all of the issues and appeared to be
 lazy and not want to do any troubleshooting. I asked to speak to a Manager. He said that none was available and I asked that one call me. He said he would have a Manager call. Call ended at 3:24 p.m. He didn't say goodbye, he just stopped talking!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>9-22-16 I have not heard at all from any Windows Microsoft Support Person since including a Manager like I was promised!</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I received a call at approximately midnight by Office Support and we talked for approximately ½ hour because it is felt that Windows issues (case #1347874733)
 is impacting Outlook performance. I was told that a call-back from Windows Support was scheduled for 11 to 12 noon today. He said that he would send me contact info but he did not follow through and do what he said. It is now 1:03 p.m. and there has been no
 call-back as usual! Microsoft has missed at least five call-backs made for this case, I believe.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>When will Microsoft Support actually fix my computers?</span></span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>

            This discussion is very interesting.&nbsp; But the bottom line is that Windows support is almost non existent.&nbsp; Is this really true?<br />
