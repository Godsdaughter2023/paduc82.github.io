<h2>            running XP or Vista on a new computer&#63;</h2>
                    I have a computer running Vista that is giving up the ghost, and I want to replace it. However, I have a couple of programs related to my business that will not run on Windows 7, and will be expensive to replace. Can I somehow run Vista or XP on a new
 computer? And where would I get a copy of Vista or XP?

Windows 7 Troubleshoot Compatibility</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>This can help with some (but not all) programs/drivers:
</span></p>
<p>
<span>1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"
</span></p>
<p>
<span>2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next window click "Start the Program" to install it.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in Windows 7.

<p><span>Windows 7 Downgrade To XP/Vista</span></p>
<br />
<p>
<span>If it's a new computer it might not have drivers for the older Windows system, meaning it will not work correctly.&nbsp; First you would need to check with the computer manufacturer if they have XP/Vista drivers for your computer.
<br />
<br />
Then you would need to use an available XP/Vista license you have, or buy a new one and install it on your computer. XP and Vista are no longer officially for sale, but some local computer stores might have a copy. Insert the install disk into the computer,
 reboot, and start the install. During the install process you can format the Windows 7 partition then continue installing Windows. You'll have to backup your files and reinstall all your programs.<br />
<br />
You can not use a Windows 7 key to activate XP/Vista.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>In case you ever want to reinstall Windows 7, make sure you have a way to reinstall. If you don't have install disks, you can make a system image:</span></p>

<span><span>The HD loses the connection after a few seconds connected to the Surface. I imagined that the Surface don't have energy enough to support the HD, so I bought a USB 3.0 HUB with power source. Apparently
 this hub solved the problem, but created a new problem: the devices connected on USB HUB
</span></span><span><span>are disconnected by themselves after a few minutes, and they reconnect soon after (less than 1 second).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Is this problem in the HUB or Surface?

<p><span><span>If it's in the HUB, would you have indications of HUBs that support external HD and that are not as expensive as the Surface Dock?</span></span></p>

            In regards to Surface devices, the USB port is underpowered compared to other computers.&nbsp; You will need an external power source for the hard disk and if your drive does not have a "Y" cable, try a powered USB hub.

                    <p>I have an old&nbsp;Tungsten T5 and a new Windows 7 based computer.&nbsp;My computer failed the installer setup and I suspect that the software is incompatible with Windows 7 (outdated).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is a Windows 7 based driver avalable for my Tungsten T5 ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help. Thanks</p>

<h2>            Disc read error, multiple issues, why did i buy&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Bought the xboxone on 30th April 2014, always had Playstation but thought I'd give xbox a try, what's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>1/ Somehow they set my account to US, easy to change to UK but have to wait "5-7 days" for full change to take place, so had for five days and not had access to all content.</p>
<p>2/ Signed up for xboxlive and received an e-mail two hours later saying i'd cancelled it, tried signing up again but it wouldn't let me use same card "used on too many accounts... try removing and adding.." so tried that, still didn't work. Noticed an alert
 for account issues so decided to leave till next day, contacted support... "ah... you can't subscribe to xboxlive because you removed and added the card in the same day...", actually i did that in response to issue, cue circular argument for a few minutes....
 got sorted in end but couldn't use xbox for first day.</p>
<p>3/ Online account isn't set up for xboxone apparently, which is why online it thinks i have a 360, not the end of the world but Microsoft seriously haven't sorted this yet?</p>
<p>4/ Bought Assassins Creed Black Flag..... and can't use it because the disc drive is faulty.. so have to post back to Amazon, wait three days for processing then wait for another to be delivered...?&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've had the xboxone for five days [with return probably won't get replacement till next week so nearly two weeks after purchase i can finally use?], have had numerous issues as above [not including issues with the Kinect], not had full functionality,
 can't watch blu-rays or use all of store.... I'm going back to Playstation, no wonder they are up in sales, will wholeheartedly recommend to rest of friends to go PS4.</p>
<p>I may have just been really unlucky but from what I've seen others are complaining so...</p>
<p>Also, you can't ship with rechargeable battery pack? I have to pay £20 for one?</p>

<p>My console works about 99% of the time and when it glithes, it is just minor things. &nbsp;The Xbox is a great system. &nbsp;Just hang in there!</p>

<p>OK, sounds like a lot of misinformation here so lets clarify:</p>
<p>1) These consoles are sold and come regionalized. &nbsp;If you set up your account on a US server and tried to install it on a UK console, YOU did it wrong.</p>
<p>2) So I will be the first to say that setting up an account can be a little confusing. &nbsp;They have a lot of security measures you have to jump through and all your info on your account has to be verified as well. &nbsp;And when it comes to billing information,
 the security it 10x as tight. &nbsp;But for all that, which again it comes down to you setting it up wrong, you have to remember that Microsoft hasn't been in the news because they've been hacked and leaked peoples credit card info all over the web.</p>
<p>3) Again, not sure what you're doing wrong, but almost every other person (who knows their log in info) was able to seamlessly sign into their accounts they had on the 360 without any issue.</p>
<p>4) The ODD (Optical Disc Drive) failures have been one of the more prominent issues with the new system, that's just a known fact. &nbsp;Just like the PS4 blue light issue because of a catastrophic hardware failure. &nbsp;At least with a busted ODD I can still play
 downloaded games and watch Netflix.</p>
<p>The system isn't perfect, and I'm sorry your first supposed foray into Xbox waters was mired by a bad experience. &nbsp;That being said, the sales numbers are almost dead even, and the PS4 even came out first. &nbsp;Won't be too long before they get passed by for
 the more reliable system.</p>
<p>Not to mention the 1.7 OS update for PS4, shame shame shame.</p>

<p>Not after an argument, &nbsp;venting frustration (tearing hair out when wrote above).</p>
<p>1/ Bought from Amazon.co.uk so would have assumed got UK console, &nbsp;if got US console then maybe amazon's fault?
</p>
<p>2/ The jumping through hoops for security wouldn't have been an issue of they hadn't cancelled my xboxlive account.
</p>
<p>3/ Signing into a 360 account isn't the issue, &nbsp;as stated I have an xboxone (never had an xbox360, so first account), online support told me that this is same for everyone, &nbsp;interested to know if anyone else in same situationl with xboxone can sign in to
 online account and gets xbox360 info. </p>
<p>4/ reach console had issues true, just seemed like I have a lot, &nbsp;ODD error was last straw.
</p>
<p>Appreciate the response, &nbsp;taking a few days to cool down then making decision.

            Yes Windows C: is the same as Local Disk C:
<br />When you open file explorer and click on the C drive you will see a Windows folder.
<br />That is the folder that contains your Windows files and is normally installed on the C drive.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any further questions.

            It is the drive letter that matters, which is same in your case.

            Hi  MMSmith20, yes both are the same . . .
<br />
<br />At a lower level, Windows only recognises the drive letter, the label on the drive is just for us users to make a distinction between our drives. 
<br />
<br />You are in no danger of messing up your Laptop!
<br />
<br />Windows (C:) = Local Disk (C:)

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Silverlight is Microsoft's free web-browser plug-in that enables interactive media experiences, rich business applications and immersive mobile apps. It is legitimate and I would recommend you install it.<br />

<h3> margueritewhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            2nd monitor won&#39;t come on after going to screen saver</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer with the following:</p>
<p>Windows 10 64 bit</p>
<p>Intel I5-7500 Processor 6MB Intel Smart Cache</p>
<p>MSI B250 PC MATE motherboard</p>
<p>NVIDIA GTX 1060 PCIe graphics card</p>
<p>16 DDR4 2400 RAM</p>
<p>240GB SSD&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 TB HD</p>
<p>Another 1 TB&nbsp; HD I added</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitor with the issue:&nbsp; Acer G235H</p>
<p>
</p><p>My second monitor (Acer) will not come back on after entering "screen saver" mode.</p>
<p>When transferring programs and such from old computer to new computer, new computer was attached to the Acer monitor with no trouble.&nbsp; When I attached this monitor as a 2nd monitor, the monitor works fine on start up but will not come back up once it goes
 into screen saver mode.&nbsp; I get "Input not supported" in a blue box.&nbsp; The first monitor works just fine.&nbsp; The Acer monitor can not be connected through an HDMI cable but the cable being used is not the problem as it worked fine with the old computer, worked
 fine with this one as a single monitor (would wake up fine) and works fine every time the computer is rebooted.&nbsp; Under device manager, the monitor is listed as Generic PnP Monitor.&nbsp; When I tell it to update driver, I get "the best driver for your device is
 installed"&nbsp; When I go to the Acer site, they do not have another driver to install. &nbsp; I have uninstalled the driver, then rebooted but no luck.&nbsp; This monitor did not come with any software in order to install drivers.&nbsp; This monitor was used as a 2nd monitor
 in my old set up with no problems.&nbsp; I was running Windows 10 64 bit on that computer as well.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated as it is annoying to have to reboot every time I wish to used double monitors!</p>

<p>Hi Marguerite,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure to utilize the second display properly may indicate a possible display driver issue. To effectively assist you with your concern, we'd like to confirm which Windows build version is running on your device? Type
<strong>winver</strong> in the search box and press <strong>Enter</strong> to help you identify.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we suggest that you perform the roll back driver option to restore the display driver to a previous version that's working on your device.&nbsp; To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in the search box and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Locate and right-click on the affected display driver, then select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Driver</strong>, and then select <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>.</li><li>Wait for the process to finish. Restart the device if prompted.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

                    <p>Bom dia!</p>
<p>Meu controle xbox one estava funcionando normalmente há pouco tempo. Porém, há alguns dias que vem apresentando o seguinte defeito: A carga da pilha está durando muito pouco. Fiz um teste colocando uma pilha excelente e joguei por um tempo, cerca de 2h.
 No dia seguinte voltei para jogar novamente e apareceu uma mensagem falando que o controle estava descarregado. Tentei contatar o suporte para troca e não consegui efetuar o processo pois aparecia a seguinte mensagem:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;Good Morning! My xbox one control was working normally just recently. However, the following defect has been present for a few days: The battery life is very short. I did a test putting a great stack and played for a while, about 2h.

<p>Hey there Carlos!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulty with getting your controller serviced.
</p>
<p>What Legend was saying is that there is an accessory for the controller through which you can charge your controller through called a
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/batteries-chargers/play-and-charge-kit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Play and Charge kit</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now concerning your repair. If it is giving you this error, then it might behoove you to contact
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support
</a>and have this looked into directly by an agent. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you get a chance, give that a shot and let us know how that helped out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Much thanks for reading!</p>

    <title>Font size for printing from Snipping Tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donald eager  say:</h3>
<h2>            Font size for printing from Snipping Tool</h2>
                    The Snipping Tool has started greatly enlarging the font size when printing a snip. Why? Didn't used to do this. Can't print a document in portrait without running the right-side text onto a second page. Cannot find a way to change font size in the tool.
 How can this be solved?

            Hi Donald.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try sizing down the target snip using Ctrl button and mouse zoom or + or - buttons.
<br />
<br />You can also try Editing with Paint to resize the snip before saving another screenshot of it to Print. 
<br />
<br />You might also want to experiment with your Screen Resolution or Scaling sizes at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Down sizing the target snip seems to work. However, I'd rather not have to do that. So, I downloaded and installed "ScreenshotCaptor" which doesn't require that step and is a much more robust application with many more features. Seems to work fine so far.
 I'll keep the Snipping Tool in reserve in case the other app doesn't end up working for me for some reason.</p>

    <title>Fight Sticks and Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxfaraday  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fight Sticks and Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>If Microsoft wants me to play my XBox One game on my Windows 10 computer then when will they fix their controller drivers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that the Xbox One Fight stick from Mad Catz and other companies do not work on Windows..... Really?&nbsp; You can get them to work but the RT and LT buttons do not work.&nbsp; It might be because Windows expects them to be triggers and not buttons but
 that explanation CAN'T be correct because these sticks work perfectly fine on the Xbox One, which basically runs a version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't Microsoft fix their drivers for us loyal customers can get our peripherals to work on both systems.&nbsp; I would think this might be a problem with just Mad Catz but all Xbox One Fight Sticks are like this even though they are basically just controllers.&nbsp;
 These are licensed to be used but Microsoft does not care enough to get them to work on Windows 10 even though they want more people t play games on it, they even say we can play our Xbox One game son it.&nbsp; Maybe all games except our fighting games which the
 expensive controllers we bought they don't want to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has been a year and we are still waiting.&nbsp; The pathetic thing in that an Xbox 360 fight still will work.&nbsp; Sigh... Microsoft....</p>

            <div>Do you think I am stupid, of course I tried that like A YEAR AGO.&nbsp; I was hoping over time that Microsoft would stock being dicks and actually fix the drivers so that licensed&nbsp;perriferals for the Xbox One would actually work in Windows.&nbsp; Unfortunately they
 are lazy and do not care.</div>
<p>
</p><p>If they want me to actually be able to play my games on both systems then they should make proper drive so that a Mad Catz XBox One TE2 fight stick will work in Windows.&nbsp; This is basically just an XBox One controller so it should be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make you happy I once again tried to use it on Windows 10 but the anniversary update but now it works even less.&nbsp; I get a warning that I should connect it to a USB2 port, which it is, and try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry but this is just pathetic and Microsoft should have fixed it a year ago.&nbsp; If this is how they support cross gaming then it will be a horror show.</p>

Press “Windows key + X” and click on “Device Manager”.</p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<strong>Scan for Hardware changes”
</strong>option. This will force the computer to recognize any hardware changes. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></p>

            <p>Yes, I have done that multiple times. To make you happy I tried that&nbsp;again and&nbsp;nothing.&nbsp; In fact I was not given the option to delete the driver.&nbsp; This is basically a Xbox One controller that users YOUR drivers but the drivers do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is something that is known by everyone online and all the companies can say is, "There are Microsoft drivers and so it is their responsibility to fix them."&nbsp; The PS4 version they were able to create a usable driver for but since these are your drivers
 they can not.<br />
<br />
Have any of you actually tried one of these devices to see that it does not work?&nbsp; These are licenses XBox One products so please get them to work properly.&nbsp; I have an XBox One controller that I use as well and that works fine.&nbsp; For the fight stick it should
 also work but does not, in fact the usability has gone DOWN.&nbsp; I used to be able use at least six of the eight buttons but it is now no longer recognized.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I did some more looking and I found a link that shows the exact problem I am having and the work around to get a PARTIAL product.&nbsp; TWO of the buttons still will not work, the LT and RT buttons.&nbsp; This is because the fight sticks have buttons and the controls
 have a lever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heyZDwBKuEo</p>

            <p>HAHAHA....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get an answer here when I pointed out the exact problem and now I received and email from Microsoft asking why I haven't marked a post as being the answer. &nbsp; That is because there hasn't been an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time I have contacted Microsoft about this and it may not be the last since they haven't done anything about the problem, they just ignore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't mind if Microsoft was honest and answered that they just didn't care and that I should stop bothering them about a problem they will never fix. &nbsp;It has not been a year since Windows 10 came out and NOTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if they at least did a little lip service and said they would let the programmers know about the problem and they might be able to fix it at some point. &nbsp;I know they would be lying to me just to make me feel better but that would be at least
 something. &nbsp;I GET NOTHING.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft really want us to care about cross platform gaming with Windows 10 and XBox One then they would make sure this stuff works. &nbsp;All the fight sticks are are XBox One controllers and they work perfectly on the XBox, just not Windows 10. &nbsp;You would
 think that Microsoft would be able to get this to work properly but I guess they are not that capable.</p>

            I finally got it to work. I had to go into reset PC(in settings)&nbsp;and&nbsp;I installed just the windows and kept the documents and uninstalled certain games. Then when I did that I used joy.cpl and tested the controller and it worked fine. Then I installed the
 anniversary build again but this time I used the windows 10 upgrade launcher to install it. And it is still working fine. This was obviously a lot of work. So if you are able to uninstall the updates and try that route or back up to an earlier image saved
 on a hard drive I would recommend that first. This was to correct an Xbox one wireless controller not recognizing all the inputs.

            <p>A Windows 10 recovery disk cannot reinstall Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>------------------------------------</p>
<span>
<p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 reinstall after factory default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judecurio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reinstall after factory default</h2>
                    <p>I have a &nbsp;laptop that is less than a year old. I got it as a present when my old laptop gave up the ghost. The person who gave it to me, did a restore to factory defaults to wipe their info from it. Here's the problem: It starts fine. The 1st screen asks
 language, time zone, etc. I put the info in, and clicked next. The second screen says express install or custom install. I've tried both ways. It takes a minute or so, where you'd expect it to go to a 3rd screen, but no... It loops back to the 1st screen,
 then the 2nd, loop to 1st. It offers no error message.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Jude,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you get to a functioning computer and download the Media Creation Tool, then create bootable USB/DVD installation media from the MCT download? &nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download
 Tool Now</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">Clean Install Windows 10</a> by booting from that media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for doing this, is that a factory reset often contains a lot of muck that you don't really want, including third party antivirus software, a curse on your Win 10 system. &nbsp;Now, would be a very good time to clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, your device is stuck in loop. &nbsp;I would start completely over with a clean installation. This is the best installation available, found&nbsp;HERE&nbsp;and above. &nbsp;Don't settle for a factory reset....it's certain to cause problems down the road.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Wayne&nbsp;</p>

<p>Disconnect from the Internet to see if you are able to progress pass that screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, before you download and create boot media, try initiating a reset using the recovery drive. Why I recommend you first try the factory reset, it will have all the necessary drivers out of the box for your system. This removes a lot
 of chores to go hunt and download drivers. It won't hurt to try this first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power on and off your computer three times</p>
<p>On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment</p>
<p>Click Advanced Options</p>
<p>Click Troubleshoot&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Reset this PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that fails, go to a working computer:</p>

 10</span></a></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key
</span></span><span><span>you already own</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

    <title>Laptop secondary monitor flashes black for a few seconds - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meteorstorm42  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop secondary monitor flashes black for a few seconds</h2>
                    <p>Hey all, I just got a new laptop (Sager NP8658-S / Clevo 650RG) with Windows 10 on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cant get my secondary monitor to work with it. Its screen keeps going black for a few seconds every minute or so. It&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">happens regardless of what I'm doing (video, desktop, etc).</span></p>
<p>The laptop has an nvidia 980M card and I've updated the video drivers&nbsp;(354.?? -&gt; 359.06).</p>
<p>The monitor is an LG IPS LED 23.5" monitor, LG website says it's just PNP so no separate drivers available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This monitor works fine with my desktop (Windows 7, Radeon 7970, via HDMI)<br />
</p>
<p>I have looked around this forum and others for solutions, but no luck yet.</p>
<p>I've tried: driver update, changing HDMI cable, resetting power, using the Windows Hardware &amp; Device Troubleshooter, checking the refresh rate is at the monitor's native 60Hz, setting the Nvidia "Adjust desktop color settings" to "Desktop programs", unplugging
 all devices and replugging only monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p><br />
