<h2>            On-screen Keyboard Learned Words File Location</h2>
                    Hello -- <br />
<br />
I love its ability to learn new words, but it seems to learn even incomplete words.
<br />
<br />
So my question is, how do you make it "unlearn" words? Where does it save custom words?
<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)

<h2>            My computer is making a loud, sudden buzzing noise whenever I play music.</h2>
                    My computer is making a loud, sudden buzzing noise whenever I play music. It's not coming from the fan or anything, just from the speakers. It only lasts for literally a second, then goes away and comes back a couple minutes later. And I can hear it whenever
 I have headphones in too. I have no idea what is causing it and it just started doing it today, I've never heard it before. It happens when I play music on the internet (including Pandora and Playlist.com) and even on my iTunes. And my computer never makes
 the noise otherwise. I've tried shutting everything down except the music but it still makes the noise. I don't know what to do.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 7 thumbnails keep breaking&#47;corrupting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ironbar.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 thumbnails keep breaking&#47;corrupting</h2>
                    <p>I'm having an issue where thumbnails for images/videos break/corrupt, turning into a garbled mess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Examples:</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/svRQO0Q.png</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/SP0C9sh.png</p>
<p>http://i.imgur.com/H0mm4kP.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, folders showing thumbnails have broken and files with thumbnails appear with a static-like image.This doesn't apply to all files, it just happens with random folders and picture/video thumbnails out of the blue, sometimes with several folders
 displaying the same type of broken image (like on the third image). Other files and folders in other locations are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can fix it by deleting my thumbnail cache but the problem appears again hours later.</p>
<p>If I resize the size of icons in the folder, the thumbnails appear again but as soon as you leave the folder and go back in, they appear broken again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files themselves are fine, they open correctly in any program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to find what causes this and how to fix it properly, rather than a "sweep-under-the-rug" solution such as merely disabling thumbnails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember installing anything in particular before it happened, no new drivers or Windows updates.</p>
<p>I have tried a virus scan without any results.</p>

            Heya, I'm also dealing with this issue.<br />
<br />
I had it first appear around November/ December time, but was also dealing with several other issues at the same time. I've since replaced a HDD and my graphics card, reinstalled twice.<br />
<br />
I've barely installed any programs and certainly nothing that was A.) Dodgy or B.) Untrusted - I've developed a particular disliking for Hamachi<br />
<br />
So this is a completely clean install of windows and after a few days, it started doing it again.<br />
Corrupted, static thumbnail images. Pretty much identical to the images you've provided.<br />
<br />
At first one folder, then a few, now I view folders via my browser and they're all appearing that way in specific sections. I'm concerned this might be related to something more serious, but as it stands it's just a minor inconvenience.<br />
<br />
Was there an update via MS that might have caused this?<br />
<br />
The only things I recently installed were windows updates and I've scanned my PC too, to no avail.<br />
<br />
I'm also looking for answers.<br />

            <p>Yes, but you need a retail Windows 7 or 8 product key. &nbsp;When you do the clean install and come to the page requesting a product key enter the retail Windows 7 or 8 product key. &nbsp;This is a new feature beginning with Windows 10. &nbsp;You must install the same
 edition (Home or Pro) that the product key if for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like Windows 7 came preinstalled on the old computer. &nbsp;If so, you do not have a Windows 7 product key that will activate Windows this way because OEM product keys are not transferable. &nbsp;But it also sounds like you purchased an upgrade to Windows
 8. &nbsp;That product key will work to activate a new installation of Windows 10 (same edition) if you are contemplating installing on a computer without an OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer you want Windows 10 on is already running Windows 7 or 8, simply upgrade it to Windows 10 the normal way. &nbsp;You can then do a clean install if you wish without need of a product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you purchase a new computer now it will have either Windows 10 preinstalled or a copy of Windows 7 or 8 that you can simply upgrade to Windows 10 for free (until July 28).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please state the make and model of the laptop and the capacity of the hdd that is apparently failing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past I have purchased an SSD and clean installed Windows 10 (no product key needed) in your scenario. &nbsp;Works great unless you have other hardware problems, like a failing screen.</p>

<p><span>Hi Stansd,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like something in Internet Explorer is preventing Snipping Tool to do its task.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Were you able to capture screenshots earlier from Internet Explorer using Snipping Tool before this issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, check to see if snipping tool works on other web browsers. Also, try the steps mentioned below to see if that help you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on Snipping Tool and choose to “Run as administrator”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Internet Explorer and then try to capture screen shots.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2: Perform a System File Checker</span></span></em></strong></p>

An article posted by Microsoft Support at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/317025 seems to refer to the same problem. However, it was for Win 2000 and NT platforms, not XP. The problem seems to be due to the VPN connection (being configured) to use the default
 gateway on the remote network<span style="font-style: italic">.</span><br />
<br />
Questions:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>Is the problem indeed due to the VPN connection being configured to use the default gateway on the remote network<span style="font-style: italic">?</span></li><li>If so, a) how can I find out if that is how my VPN connection is configured, and b) how<span style="font-style: italic">
</span>can I configure it so I can use VPN to remote network and still being able to use internet locally?</li></ol>
Thank you.<br />

            Realize that the purpose of VPN is to establish a secure connection to a remote network over a public internet.&nbsp; Allowing a client computer to simultaneously access a public network and a secure network can pose a security risk for data to leak out of
 the secure network into the public internet.&nbsp; The VPN server controls whether "split tunneling" is permitted on a client computer.&nbsp; If permitted by the VPN Server side, the client computer can access both VPN and internet by un-checking the "use Gateway on
 remote Network" box.&nbsp; For more information:<br />

<h2>            Google and Yahoo&#33; search engines not working &#40;all other websites work fine&#41;</h2>
                    Hello, <br />
<br />
I'm using Windows Vista 32 bit and for the past couple days my computer has been unable to conduct searches through both Google and Yahoo! Any other website works fine, AOL and Bing searches work fine. I can also access other Google related services, such as
 the image search, I'm also able to sign into Gmail without any problems- except my school email gmail accounts, which I sign in from the school website and when it redirects to the mail.google.com server I get a timeout error. Another similar instance when
 this happens is when I try to logon to Yahoo Answers through a gmail account I receive another timeout error. I found several different reasons and solutions on internet threads addressing similar problems as to what could be causing this problem, and to no
 avail everything I've tried so far has not worked. It's very frustrating...I'll give more information on my situation and list what steps I've taken to rectify this problem thus far...<br />
<br />
-I do not believe this a web browser problem. I've tried using Google and Yahoo searches through Internet Explorer, Firefox, and Chrome and get the same results.
<br />
*Internet explorer tries to load google for about two minutes and then gives me the message "Internet explorer cannot display the webpage"<br />
*Firefox tries to load google for about a minute, then gives me this message "The server at google.com is taking too long to respond."<br />
*Chrome automatically gives me "<span>The server at<span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>www.google.com</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>can't be found, because
 the DNS lookup failed."<br />
<br />
-I don't think it's a problem with my internet connection itself, as I've tried accessing google and yahoo searches on other computers and did not experience any problems.
<br />
<br />
-This seems to have happened out of the blue, I haven't made any recent changes to my computer or installed any programs.
<br />
<br />
-Just to clarify, this is NOT the common google redirect virus. My browser is never redirected anywhere, it just times out.
<br />
<br />
And here's what I've tried so far: <br />
-I ran a virus check, nothing was found.<br />
-I'm not using any proxies.<br />
-I turned my firewall off to see if was causing the problem, that did nothing.&nbsp; <br />
-I made sure my hosts file wasn't blocking google and/or yahoo; it looks how it should look.
<br />
-I reseted my TCP/IP stack. (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357?wa=wsignin1.0)<br />
-I changed my DNS server to </span><span><span>208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220, and 208.67.222.20,
</span></span><span>neither solve the issue.
<br />
-I used a DOS command line to ping google.com, and I get a timeout error. <br />
<br />
Any more ideas/suggestions of what I can do to solve the problem. I would greatly appreciate it as I need to access my school emails on google.com from this computer. Thank you very much for reading.

            <p><span>Hi,</span><span><br />
<br />
Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.<br />
<br />
Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><br />
I would suggest you to check if the issue persists in no add-ons mode. Also try the remaining steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
How to optimize Internet Explorer <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213/ro</a><br />
<br />
Note: The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings. We recommend that you
 note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><br />
You may temporarily disable security software’s and firewalls and check if the issue persists.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</span></p>

<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>NOTE: Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In
 most cases, you shouldn't disable the antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled,
 your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            Thank you for the response Arya S Asok. I tried your suggestions and my issue still persists. I reset internet explorer's settings, but that did nothing. As I mentioned&nbsp; previously I cannot access Google and Yahoo searches from Internet Explorer, Firefox,
 and Chrome, so I don't see why it would be a browser related issue. I also turned off any security software and firewalls before and that did nothing to remedy my problem. Thank you again for your help.&nbsp;

            <p>​Hi,<br />
<br />
This problem may occur when you use search engines could indicate that you have a malware infection. Take a look at this guide to try identifying/removing malware from your system:<br />
<br />
<span>You may run a <span>Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />
</span></span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></span><span><br />
Disclaimer:<br />
If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So yo</span><span>u have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with virus then they might even get deleted</span><br />

            that virus scan did not bring up any malware either. Thank you for the suggestion. Unfortunately my problem still persists.

<h2>            HP Spectre x360 13 &#40;8th gen&#41; fans are always on, even when surfing the web on chrome.</h2>
                    <p>Fans are at about half speed when CPU is at 15% and computer is mildly warm. There is also a display issue: When watching videos on youtube or netflix, the display glitches out and part of the screen turns into a glitchy mess of random colors, like this

            Hi Philip, it does sound like video troubles - the overheating and the pixelated screen . . .
<br />
<br />Try the fix below, if that does not work - return your laptop. 
<br />
<br />I had a HP 4 -5 years ago, every 3rd or 4th time I switched it on the screen would scramble, I assumed it would right itself after a graphics driver update or two - it never did. In hind-sight I should just have gotten a replacement, you have paid good money for your laptop, it should work as expected !!
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver

<h2>            Xbox 360 - no updates for digitally bought&#47;acquired games</h2>
                    
<p><span>So, this has been a really huge problem for myself since realising this was actually a thing. To put it bluntly: if you digitally download/purchase a game off the Xbox 360 dashboard, a huge percentage of said games simply won't have title updates available
 to the user, something of which is readily available to users with the physical copy of the game. This then means technical problems etc. within digitally-released games can't simply be fixed up with a routine patch.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Now, I purchase/acquire most of my games through the Games on Demand section on the 360 dashboard, so you could imagine this has proved quite problematic when I can't download a simple update for, for example, Dark Souls, meaning no patch to irradicate
<span>Now, I purchase/acquire most of my games through the Games on Demand section on the 360 dashboard, so you could imagine this has proved quite problematic when I can't download a simple update for, for example, Dark Souls, meaning no patch to irradicate
 HUGE framerate issues throughout the game. As another example, the recently available Metal Gear Solid: Ground Zeroes given to XBL subscribers via the Games with Gold campaign(free digital games). There was apparently two secret missions released for the game,
 one for XB360/One users and the other for PS3/4 players, though later both parties could acquire the former console-exclusive content through a patch update. Due to my digital aquirement of the game, the patch containing the former ps3/4-only mission simply
 isn't available. Bare in mind that these aren't the only titles with a digital handicap, these were just recent examples; I could list many, many more.</span></p>
<p><span><span>First time I actually acknowledged that this was happening was with Battlefield: Bad Company 2 last summer when receiving the game through the GWG program. I had recently had the disc copy of the game several years before, but sold it and deleted
 all of the related data. The difference being that back then I can vividly remember 2-3 online patches for the game at boot up, while this time I wasn't met with an update prompt presumably because this particular copy of the game was digitally downloaded.
 This all meant that I couldn't play the online section. To fix this I had to scrape through years/minutes of recently downloaded items in the 'Download History' tab to then hopefully find the BF update that I had downloaded years before when in possession
 of the disc copy. Luckily that was a success, but that solution is sadly not an option with titles that I haven't previously had disc copies of.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Something to note is that neither of my digital copies of games have a code at the very bottom of each main menu(for example: Ver. 00.2), something that I picked up upon when troubleshooting my most recent MGS: GZ issue whilst browsing various MGS-related
<span>Something to note is that neither of my digital copies of games have a code at the very bottom of each main menu(for example: Ver. 00.2), something that I picked up upon when troubleshooting my most recent MGS: GZ issue whilst browsing various MGS-related
 internet forums. Those within the various forums said that "there should be a version code at the very bottom righthand corner", but these were owners/users of the physical copy of the game; those, like me, that only possessed the digital version reported
 the exact same problems. This leads me to believe that these famed digital copies are strictly nonupdatable versions of the game in their rawest and earliest release form.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Does anyone have a fix for this problem?</span></span></p>

<p>Hi, A lot of the Games on Demand digital games now download the update automatically with the game, so chances are that is the reason why you are not seeing the update prompt. &nbsp;The battlefield one is different as the update for it has to be downloaded separately
 from the marketplace. &nbsp;Some other games are similar like that, e.g Burnout paradise, you also have to download the update from the marketplace and some Need for Speed games are like that too.</p>

<p>Points taken. And it turns out I did have an update for Dark Souls, I found it in the DS data folder(derp), though the update didn't seem to fix the issue with extreme framerate problems throughout the game experience like the update was apparently(going
 by online sources) supposed to correct.</p>
<p>This still doesn't explain the MGS: Ground Zeroes update not appearing: I've checked both the in-game menu and dashboard/extras section for the game. Just a little mad, because apparently the added mission I'm missing out on is supposedly amazing.</p>
<p>But thanks anyway, your answer fixes at least some of my problems.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, games that are downloadable titles, normally have all current updates applied to them already. MGS is Konami's issue, and their support for their customers has been less than stellar. :s</p>

            Hi Steve,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor here to help you.
<br />You can make a bootable USB using Media Creation Tool (<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>). 
<br />Once created, you can install Windows 10 on a PC, changing BOOT drive on the device BIOS. To do so:
<br />
<br />1. Start the computer and press ESC, F1, F2, F8 or F10 during the initial startup screen. Depending on the BIOS manufacturer, a menu may appear.
<br />2. Choose to enter BIOS setup. The BIOS setup utility page appears.
<br />3. Use the arrow keys to select the BOOT tab. System devices appear in order of priority.
<br />5. To give a USB device boot sequence priority over the hard drive, do the following: 
<br />6. Move the hard drive device to the top of the boot sequence list.
<br />7. Expand the hard drive device to display all hard drives.
<br />8. Move the USB device to the top of the list of hard drives.
<br />9. Save and exit the BIOS setup utility.
<br />10. The computer will restart with the changed settings.
<br />
<br />At this point the install USB will start Windows 10 Installation on your device, just follow on screen instructions.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if that instructions solves your problem.

            Hi SteveFritz, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>My Ancient Depths deck is corrupted too. Deck Manager says its 55000+ cards. If I try the reset option it crashes. If I play with the deck it says im running 86 cards, and its all coilfang oracles, kraken hatchlings, and new frontiers(around 20 copies of
 each of those cards, plus the appropiate land count for those cards). &nbsp;Ive tried deleted game and clearing xbox cache. I assume the deck is saved server side like the previous game.</p>

<p><strong>RagingWallNut</strong> and <strong>EnragedDark1</strong>&nbsp;- &nbsp;Can you describe the exact steps that you took which resulted in your deck being broken? &nbsp;As much information as you could provide would be really helpful, especially stuff like: &nbsp;Did you
 make edits to your deck prior to unlocking with a key? &nbsp;Attempt to save these edits before applying the deck key? &nbsp;Did you unlock cards first in the deck and then use the deck key? &nbsp;or did you use a deck key immediately? &nbsp;What game mode did you enter (if any)
 to notice the behavior?&nbsp; Did you purchase the deck key and then immediately redeem it to unlock the deck, or did you purchase the deck key and exit the deck manager to use the deck key later?</p>
<p>The more specific information you can provide will greatly help us track this issue down.&nbsp; Thank you!</p>

<p>I've had this same problem as well. &nbsp;I bought the deck key, used it on ancient depths, then I exited before saving changes and it got rid of all the cards in the maindeck. &nbsp;All the unlocked cards are there. &nbsp;I called xboxlive support, no go there and I also
 tried &nbsp;deleting and reinstalling the game, nothing worked. &nbsp;I hope this information helps your research and helps us unglitch this problem.</p>

<p>I had unlockied the apex predator deck. and was in the deck manager looking at the cards. I decided to buy a key to unlock the whole deck and changed the cards in the deck. When I went to exit, I was asked if I would like to save and I chose no by mistake.
 When I went back in to try and rebuild the deck again it showed no cards unlocked and 12 of each of the lands in my deck. I deleted the game and key save and re-downloaded again. Same thing, it should the apex predator deck unlocked but when I loaded it in
 the deck manager no cards were unlocked and 12 of each lands where in the main deck. loading the game and picking the apex predator deck shows nothing but land cards in your hand. Hope that helps.</p>

    <title>External USB floppy drive is recognized by Windows 7, corresponding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael b bennett  say:</h3>
<h2>            External USB floppy drive is recognized by Windows 7, corresponding windows open, display normal, system can&#39;t read old MVC-01.411&#47;.JPG files</h2>
                    <p>Good morning!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my computer (Windows 7) not recognizing, or being able to read the data or images on a 3.5" floppy disk. I have an external, USB connected "Floppy Disk Drive (A:)", listed as a "device with removable&nbsp;storage" below the "C" drive and
 "F" external drive, Windows opens as normal and the files on the disk are all displayed, and properties folder indicates device is working properly. However, it seems that the file types (MVC-00.411 / .JPG) are unable to be read or recognized by the system,
 and therefore none of the files displayed on the floppy are able to be opened. I get several error messages, the most common being: &nbsp;A:\MVC-0175.JPG "The directory name is invalid.", when I try Windows Explorer to open, or, if I try opening using Internet
 Explorer, the message is: "This page cannot be displayed." Windows Photo Viewer, Paint, and others I've tried indicate "this picture can't be opened because the file appears to be damaged, corrupted, or is too large." The drive makes noises like it's opening
 the file slowly, but always has a reason for not delivering. Another common message is "A:\MVC-0175.411 is not a valid Win32 application." Granted, the files are a little aged, but this floppy drive setup worked well with Windows XP, I'm wondering what changed
 with Windows 7, and might this be something that has a simple remedy or workaround? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping there is some method of data retrieval on the ancient technology stuff. If not, I can live with that. It would be nice to hear from some of the "experts" in this field, however, before tossing this effort in the garbage. My friends, neighbors,
 and relatives all think they know just about everything there is to know about computers, and some do, I just don't trust their judgment anymore at this point, and would like a professional's opinion for a change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do appreciate your time&nbsp;and any help, advice, direction or thoughts that you may have on the subject. In the event of bad news, the expression of heartfelt sorrow is acceptable as well. Not really, I'll be fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael B Bennett</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, what are the file extensions of your files in your floppy disk? To see the file extension of a file, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click any file.</li><li>Choose <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Type of File</strong> under the <strong>General</strong> tab.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>There may be an issue with the current location of the file that you're attempting to open. Let us isolate the issue by moving the files inside the floppy disk to one of your folders on your computer. After moving your files, check if you'll be able to open
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your reply.</p>

            <p>Hey there Spiked!<br /><br />That's a bit of a tricky situation because of the "I Accept" screen. I've seen similar situations on college capuses where you have to enter a student ID number to log on.<br /><br />Fortunately, we do have a workaround for this. =D<br /><br />Check out our guide on how to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/win-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">connect your console to Xbox Live using a Windows computer in place of a router</a>. It's a bit complicated in comparison to just connecting your console to wifi, but by using a PC/Laptop as the bridge, it will allow you to access the "I agree" page and perform the actions needed to get online.<br /><br />Let us know how that works for you! ^_^</p>

<h2>            Surface pro 4 suddenly shut down and then black screen of death</h2>
                    <p>So I've had an sp4 since last August, a month ago it wouldn't turn on no matter what I did , so I went to the support web page and they told me &nbsp;that because my device was from another country (bought in the USA I live in EU) they would change It, I got
 the replacements a week later, which you know,was great because I need for class .</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all worked just fine ,but today I was watching Netflix when it suddenly shut down (since it was connected I know it is not that the battery ran out) I tried to turn it on again and it showed the surface screen for a second before it what down again and
 became unresponsive (last time I could hear the fans working and the cover would lit up but not now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I suppose to do? (I am probably going to go to the store in my city, manage through the language barrier ,but maybe someone else needs help and somebody has an answer for this )</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />The setting to fix this is "System unattended sleep timeout" in advanced power settings. (Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\Edit Plan Settings &gt; change advanced power settings).
<br />
<br />However this setting is hidden because Microsoft wants waste our time and make our lives miserable. 
<br />
<br />To un-hide it, you need to change a registry attribute value data from 1 to 2 at the following registry path:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE &gt; SYSTEM &gt; CurrentControlSet &gt; Control &gt; Power &gt; PowerSettings &gt; 238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20 &gt; 7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0
<br />
<br />Full instructions:
<br />
<br />windows key + R
<br />type regedit and hit enter
<br />click Yes if asked
<br />on registry editor - ctrl+F
<br />search for 7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0 
<br />wait, can take a while to find
<br />when found, double click attributes on the right pane
<br />change value data to 2
<br />hit ok, close registry editor.
<br />Right click the start button &gt; power options &gt; Additional power settings &gt; Change Plan Settings &gt; change advanced power settings
<br />expand Sleep
<br />expand System unattended sleep timeout
<br />change both values to zero for never or set your preferred value.
<br />
<br />in this link you will find more information
<br />
<br />I hope this can help

<h2>            Error mesage trying to install Streets and Trips 2011 -  .microsoft visual c&#43;&#43; 2010 redistributable won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased Streets and trips 20011.&nbsp; I uninstalled S&amp;T 2007.&nbsp; When I try to install S&amp;T 2011 I get an error message saying that microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable could not be installed.&nbsp; Same thing happens whether I try to install from the
 DVD or the download. I have 10.0.40219 of c++ 2010 installed.&nbsp; I'm using win 7 pro and have Office 2010 Pro installed.&nbsp; I've read elsewhere that S&amp;T 2011 will not work with the latest patch for microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable.&nbsp; If that is true then
 I'd like official confirmation so&nbsp;I can return S&amp;T and get my money back.&nbsp; Otherwise I won't be able to return it because I've opened the package.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help you can offer</p>

            <div>SOLVED!</div>
<div><br />
I called 1-800-MICROSOFT for support. &nbsp;I was given a case number and transferred to tech support. &nbsp;The answer was so simple I wonder why MS doesn't just post it. &nbsp;So here it is:
<div><br />
<div>After trying and failing to install the downloaded trial version of Microsoft Streets and Trips 2011 (failed because I have the latest version of&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable
 and the program trys to install an earlier version but can't then just terminates) there will be a subfolder and sub-subfolders of the installation files on your hard drive. &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>go to the folder &nbsp;"Microsoft Streets and Trips 2011\ST2011\Streets\MSMap\" and run the file called "data.msi"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>The program will install and all is good.</span></div>

<h2>            IS THERE AN UNAUTHORISED KEYLOGGER INSTALLED IN MY COMPUTER &#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hello, Thanks in advance for any advice.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am running XP PRO, the latest in AVG FREE 9.0,&nbsp;run regular scans and defrags and generally watch for anything out of the ordinary. My machine (apart from tracking cookies) has escaped anything to sinister for the past two years<em>. BUT</em>...&nbsp;a
 few nights ago I went into one of my (password protected) MS Office Home and Student 2007, Word documents to find just below&nbsp;my title these words<em>"Please close file, keylogger has now commenced..." These words&nbsp;appeared like this in light grey font and a
 similar size. This file contained all website registration details including passwords and usernames. Up until three months ago I had never made a purchase over the net but around that time I started using Itunes with store cards. About&nbsp;a week &nbsp;before this
 event&nbsp;&nbsp;I started purchasing music downloads from Itunes with A Debit card. The only other thing I did differently over the net was also a couple of days before the appearance of said text and that was to register for online banking. The bank sent me an email
 confirmation that I could now go to the site and access my account (which I have not done now because I spotted that wording beforehand). I have also deleted all files with&nbsp;password and username&nbsp;type info. I have tried forums and blogs and can not find a simlilar
 occurance. I have run half a dozen scans with the new AVG and this is showing a clean computer.&nbsp;At the least I was hoping someone might know of a page listing all inbuilt warning messages that may come with&nbsp;MS WORD 07. That would be a start. For such an important
 security issue, it was a rather small, light grey warning. Thanks again.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>

<p>Firstly, check and make sure your Windows is Genuine. If your Windows is pirate or NOT genuine, no one could help you with security.</p>
<p>Check your Windows Firewall and make sure you have latest service pack and update yoru Windows.</p>
<p>Just in case run full system scan with:</p>

<p>And see if it will detect anything or not.</p>
<p>Check Windows Security Center in control panel and make sure everything is fine.</p>
<p>Then see result and tell us.</p>

    <title>Cannot access root UNC path of Win7 machine from Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kermit 31415  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot access root UNC path of Win7 machine from Win10</h2>
                    <p>So, a couple months ago I upgraded my home PC to Win10 Pro from Win7. Yeah, there are some things I dislike. I still hate the "start" menu, fortunately there is a program called "Classic Shell." Lots of other minor annoyances; Windows update, volume mixer,
 flat windows, program compatibility, etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my problem: I have another remote machine, Win7 Pro, which hosts media files. Previously, with Windows 7 on my local machine (like I can anywhere else I have an Windows XP or Windows 7 machine) I could open up a run prompt or explorer window and go
 to the root share via UNC path of a remote machine such as \\mycomputer and it will show me what folders and/or printers are shared. However, after upgrading my local machine to Windows 10 I cannot see the root PC. I only get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"\\mycomputer is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this network resource. Contract the administrator of this server to find out if you have access permissions. The network is not present or not started."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can type the share manually and it works fine: \\mycomputer\h or \\mycomputer\media - as an example</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the "net share" on the remote machine and all of the admin shares are still present. Such as: \\mycomputer\c$</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Windows 10 do this and how can I fix it? If it's doing it at home, the last thing I want to do is upgrade the machines at work to Windows 10. That would be a major pain in the neck. I've already held off on any upgrades because due to the major
 lack of control in Group Policy for Windows 10 machines. I vaguely remember having an issue like this with Windows XP years ago, but I haven't seen it in a long time. Windows firewall is turned off for both machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok - after all that, turns out File Sharing was not enabled on my local Windows 10 machine. Why does local file sharing have to be enabled to see a remote share? That doesn't make any sense. But, Windows 10 was "free" so I guess I can't really complain?
 No, I'm not going to Apple. I dislike those even more. And network locations for my DESKTOP doesn't make sense either. I usually try to disable that stuff in GPEDIT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was stupid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you help, community.</p>

<h2>            Unable to update&#47;install game</h2>
                    
<p>I have the digital version of Halo MCC, and upon trying to install the last update I get error&nbsp;<span>0x87e0000 "Installation Stopped".</span></p>
<p><span>I have contacted xbox support 3 times and the issue hasn't been resolved, so they suggested I post here. I've tried doing an offline console update, using a wired connection, I even deleted the 70gb game and attempted to redownload and then got the
 error again so I can't even install the game anymore. I borrowed a friend's disc version which will only work offline, if I bring the console online it attempts to update and then fails.</span></p>
<p><span>No other software seems to have any issues, I tested by downloading something from the store, also deleting the ODST DLC then reinstalling it, works fine. Just the Halo MCC won't work. Any help is greatly appreciated!</span></p>

<p>Hey there. Try canceling any downloads and heading into Settings, System. Make sure it says "No Update Available." If it says there is a system update, install that. If not, go to Settings, Power, Turn Xbox off. Unplug the power cord from the back of the
 console for at least 5 minutes, then plug it back in and try the download again.</p>
