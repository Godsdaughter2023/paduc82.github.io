    <title>Windows 10 and older games. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 and older games.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Last year I bought an HP Pavilion 400-334 PC with Win 8.1. It was fine for what I needed to do and I was able to play an old favorite game of mine: Sid Meier'e Pirates! Not long after I was given the option to update to Win 10 and I did it. Most everything
 worked okay except for Pirates! The graphics were always on the low side considering the game came out YEARS ago but it played just fine on Win 8.1. After update frame rate was down to where it was too slow to play and even with internal settings lowered to
 minimum it still would not function right. I have searched all over the web for an answer, updated drivers many times, reloaded game a few times, tried to force the game to run with DirectX 9, ran it in different compatibility modes, different resolutions...
 No luck. I am very disappointed with Win 10! Something in Win 10 disrupted the graphics in the game. I know my computer has an integrated graphics card on the motherboard: AMD Radeon HD 8240, but the game worked just fine before the update without having to
 update the drivers, so something about Win 10 is not compatible with Sid Meier's Pirates!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I would like some feed back about this problem of mine. Otherwise I will be reverting back to my previous OS and will not recommend Win 10 to anyone that asks. And, please do not say "Update drivers" for I have done that many times in trying to solve
 this problem. Thanks.</p>

            &nbsp; &nbsp;The game was originally produced in 1987 and re-made in 2004. There really is not a whole lot of support from the manufacturer any more. Seeing as how the game was made on a much simpler game engine platform I would think that todays computers would
 have plenty of resources to handle a simple game, which, by the way, WORKED on Win 8.1. My conclusion is something about Win 10 does not compute when it comes to my graphics.

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 has a mind of it&#39;s own</h2>
                    <p>I have searched and can only find similar issues on the community, however, not exactly the same.</p>
<p>The cursor whether operating from the touchpad or external mouse has a mind of it's own. It will randomly start shaking then disappear, then flash and hover at the top of the screen. If left alone it will eventually settle down to use again for a couple
 of seconds before going off again. While on the internet the page will start enlarging, then shrinking, then scrolling up and down, and then enter a link, and all this time I am nowhere near the touchpad or mouse and nothing is touching the keypad or mouse.
 I have even tried detaching the keyboard and same thing. The touchscreen is also playing up and not responding to touch.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a complete re-install and that still didn't work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed all available updates, and done everything I can see to do without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a possible solution to fix?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Andrew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Touchscreen issues might be due to some corrupt or missing system files, and a complete reinstall resets your Surface back to factory default state, so it should've resolved the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're in the US, we recommend that you go to the nearest physical retail <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Store</a> in your area and have your Surface checked by our technicians. Also, you can contact our Surface Answer Desk on this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any additional concerns, please let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Regards.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Voun.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a complete reset again, and it appeared to have fixed the problem, until I did a check on all updates and force updated from the settings-update screen.</p>
<p>Then it started happening all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have just today rest the complete system again. So far again it would appear that it is working ok, although I haven't run it through it's paces properly as yet. I will not this time check for updates and just let them load naturally to see if that
 changes things. It would appear to be a software issue and not a machine issue</p>

<h2>            Unable to turn on windows update</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : WINDOWS UPDATE virus and REGISTRY FIX</p>
<p>I noticed the other day that my computer Windows Update won't turn back on, no matter what i do? After trying multiple times, multiple things, I was told that it was a virus, most specifically a registry virus. I'm trying to figure out how to fix my registry.
 What is the best program I should use? I've tried multiple so called "free" programs but am exhausted at the uncertainty of all of these programs. They find 800-1000 problems and then deliver the punchline... pay me and we'll fix them.&nbsp; First of all, do I
 have to pay? and if I do have to pay.... which one is the one I should pay for?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>What is the exact error message when you try to install updates?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
You may try to run the fix-it and check. Refer the following link.<br />
</span><strong><span>Fix the problem with Microsoft Windows Update that is not working
</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Reset Windows update components and then check if it helps.<br />
</span><strong><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</span></a><br />
</span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these
 steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article
 in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows:</span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><strong><span>Step1: </span></strong><span><br />
You may try to temporary disable all antivirus software’s installed on your computer. Refer the following link.<br />
</span><strong><span>Disable Anti-virus software</span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a><br />
</span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span><br />
After disabling antivirus, you may try to install the updates in Clean Boot state. Refer the following article.<br />
</span><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
</span><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>: Once you are done with clean boot, please follow step 7 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>You may refer the following article.<br />
</span><strong><span>Unable to install updates in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2</span></strong><span><br />

Important: The above mentioned article contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back
 up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.

            <p>If you replaced the HDD "earlier this year," you would have had to do a clean install of Windows
<em>as well as MSE</em> but you told me you didn't do that. The fact that MSE was installed on 21 April 2011 (not "this year") confims that you didn't do so.</p>
<p>That being said, you may have restored an Image instead of doing clean installs.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, my previous post still stands.</p>
<p>REPOST: Chances are you're seeing the effects of an ongoing "hijackware" infection, possibly compounded by a rootkit infection!</p>
<p>Based on your replies to this thread, there are two (2) possible explanations for this situation: (a) your injudicious use of registry cleaners and/or (b) failing to
<em>fully-remove</em> the Norton software before you installed MSE on 21 April <em>
2011</em>.</p>
<p>In fact, chances are the computer was <em>already&nbsp;infected</em> when you installed MSE since none of those other updates are installed (all of which were released before you installed MSE).</p>

<p>Hi Cruz! I'm sorry to say there isn't a way to password protect the entire xbox, it will automaticall go to the dashboard at startup, allowing users to attach their own profiles or play offline as a guest. You CAN set a passkey to prevent your own account
 from being signed in and used, and I'll provide those links for you, but I don't suspect that's exactly what you want. Sorry about that!</p>

<h3> bonrek  say:</h3>
<h2>            The procedure entry point _W_Getdays could not be located in the dynamic link library msvcrt.dll</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to windows 10 and realized my mistake. I didn't like windows 10 at all. So I reverted back to windows 7, and now I keep getting the error "The procedure entry point _W_Getdays could not be located in the dynamic link library msvcrt.dll" with several
 of my programs including my McAfee Anti-virus. I have tried reinstalling the programs that generate the error, but this does not fix this issue. All of these programs worked fine before I upgraded to windows 10. I re-installed the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010
 Redistributable Package, both the x86 and the x64 as my machine is a 64-bit machine, and that didn't resolve my issue. I also ran sfc /scannow, but it found nothing. I tried to a Startup Repair, but it too found nothing and so did nothing. Next I performed
 and "In Place Upgrade" of my OS as detailed here - <a href="http://windowssecrets.com/top-story/win7s-no-reformat-nondestructive-reinstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windowssecrets.com/top-story/win7s-no-reformat-nondestructive-reinstall/</a> , but that also did not resolve anything. It seems that the only option I have left is to reformat my hard drive and perform a clean install of windows 7, but I am loathe do
 that as I can't find all the discs and product keys to all of my software and I can't remember my email passwords as outlook remembers them, and so will lose access to them too if I reformat. Can anyone help to fix this issue without me having to resort to
 a re-format. All these programs worked before I upgraded to windows 10, and so should work now that I have reverted to windows 7, and I have no intention of going back to windows 10, so please don't suggest that.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Harkanwar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to try to answer my problem. However the article that you linked is relating to windows xp and I have windows 7, and so there is no i386 folder on my windows disc that I got with my dell computer. So what I tried was the following
 steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I installed 7-zip from http://www.7-zip.org/</p>
<p>2. I extracted msvcrt.dll from the system32 folder inside the install.wim file on the DVD to a temp folder on my hard drive.</p>
<p>3. I booted from DVD and opened a command console window from the recovery options.</p>
<p>4. I renamed msvcrt.dll to msvcrtOLD.dll in the windows\system32 folder.</p>
<p>5. I copied the new msvcrt.dll from my temp folder to windows\system32.</p>
<p>6 Restarted my computer and tested.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still had the same issue, so I repeated to above steps for the copy of the file that is found in the windows\sysWOW64 folder, but still have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you know of anything else I could try I'd appreciate the help. Once again thank you for taking the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 Storage Spaces Broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waltweiss  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Storage Spaces Broken</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell XPS machine with two Sans Digital 4 bay towers attached via eSATA. One bay contains 4 2 terabyte drives in a mirror configuration and the other contains 4 3 terabyte drives in a mirror so effectively one 4 terabyte storage pool and one 6 terabyte
 storage pool. &nbsp; There was a driver problem after a Windows 10 update and I received a BSOD with an indication that the problem was the High Point Rapid Raid 642L driver.&nbsp; I updated the driver for the raid card - which I am not using as a raid card just plain
 old disk storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However during the driver failure one of the 2 terabyte drives in the 4 terabyte bay (containing 4 2 terabyte drives) became corrupted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the 4 terabyte drive no longer exists</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go into manage storage spaces and it shows that the storage pool is in error</p>
<p>
</p><p>it shows 4.55 TB of 7.27 TB used</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under storage spaces it says error iaccessible, check the physical drive section</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the physical drive section three drives are ok and one says warning error consider replacing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attach another 2 TB drive via USB and click on the change settings button which is dark grey</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 6 tb storage then shows the commands to add drives rename change delete etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4 tb storage still shows error and no commands available to do anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used powershell and the get-virtualdisk command shows both storage pools but it shows the 4tb one named workshops in not attached</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used powershell again with get-physicaldisk and it shows me all of the drives in the computer and shows that one drive has stale metadata</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to use powershell to retire the drive and it failed </p>
<p>
</p><p>further investigation revealed that the storage pool is in read only mode so I cannot retire or delete the drive using powershell - probably also why no commands show up on the gui</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to use powershell to change the pool to read-only is false and it fails and will not change the pool from read only</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found no tools that will help with this</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually removed the drive from the system both logically by deleting it from devices and by physically removing it and the storage pool still cannot recover</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a case with microsoft and was in the middle of explaining the issue and I was hung up on.&nbsp; I called back and got the recorded announcement that they were now closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very disappointed that the failure of one drive - that actually doesn't appear to have really failed - it just has stale metadata - can cause me to lose 4.55 TB of data.&nbsp; The only reason I went with storage spaces instead of raid is because it is supposed
 to be a good solution.&nbsp; From where I sit I am not sure I would trust any of my data to storage pools or windows 10 again.&nbsp; IF I can recover my data I guess I will be migrating away from storage pools to some other technology because this is not usable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that after the BSOD the computer went into automatic repair mode and that failed so I launched windows 10 and thats where I am today - looking at the loss of 4.5TB of data because of corruption in some metadata on one drive and no documented
 way to repair it or to remove the offending device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea how to repair the storage pool or change it to read/write so that manage storage spaces might be able to remove the drive and let me recover the data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are having trouble with certain sites and their related apps on your Surface RT.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that Surface RT and Surface 2 can only install and run apps from the Store.&nbsp; If the sites you mention require a download in order to function, this may be the problem.&nbsp; You can check in the Store to see if these sites have an RT compatible app
 available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing you can try is to access the given site in desktop versus modern IE and see if this helps.</p>
<p>

            Hi Patty
<br />
<br />Open Edge
<br />
<br />On the upper right hand corner of the Edge browser, click  Image and select Settings
<br />
<br />Click View advanced settings
<br />
<br />Make sure Use Adobe Flash Player is On
<br />
<br />Personally, I would use another Browser . . .
<br />
<br />Edge is still in development and has a lot of glitches       
        </p>

            If you happen to be using Edge and see the following when you load a site requiring Flash, it’s possible it’s just disabled.
<br />
<br />To change that, open the More actions menu in the top right corner of the Edge browser, scroll down, click the View advanced settings menu then toggle on Adobe Flash Player. Refresh the web page or close Microsoft Edge then open it again. In rare cases, you might need to restart your computer
<br />
<br />If there’s no overt signs on the page that Flash needs to be enabled, but you still sense that there is some missing content, then it’s possible that Flash content isn’t loading.  This may be by design; as a security measure, Microsoft is limiting the use of Flash where ever it can. So, if you are greeted by a web page with only a puzzle symbol, don’t be puzzled. Instead, look in the address bar, then click the puzzle icon. From here, you can choose whether you want to allow the website you are viewing to always run Adobe Flash or Allow it once.
<br />Update Adobe Flash Player in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Since Microsoft bundled Adobe Flash in Windows, you also get Adobe Flash updates via Windows Update. So, if you have tried all the above and Flash still refuses to load in Microsoft Edge, you likely need to install an update.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for updates. Download and install the latest update for Flash if it’s available.
<br />
<br />Sometimes even Windows Update might prove problematic when installing updates for Flash Player updates. What you can do is download the update for Flash Player manually from the Microsoft Update Catalog. We showed you how to do that in our previous article on how to install Windows updates manually (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-install-standalone-cumulative-updates-virus-definitions-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/manually-insta...</a>).
<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems viewing Flash content, then you might want to try to repair or reset Microsoft Edge (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-microsoft-edge-web-browser-windows-10-1709/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-m...</a>).
<br />
<br />What About Other Web Browsers?
<br />
<br />Windows 10 bundles Adobe Flash for use with the Edge browser. If you use Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox or other web browsers, you will need to either enable or download then install Adobe Flash manually. In Chrome, when you visit a website that requires Flash, click the Secure menu in the left of the address bar then click Site settings.
<br />
<br />Scroll down, click in the list box for Flash then select Allow.
<br />
<br />If Flash still does not work, you likely need to update it. In the Chrome address bar, type chrome://components then hit Enter. Scroll down then click Check for the update under Flash Player.
<br />
<br />Mozilla Firefox
<br />
<br />In Firefox, first, check if Flash is enabled. Click the Open menu , then Add-ons, Plugins then click on Preferences for Shockwave Flash. Click on the Choose Change when this add-on runs list box then choose Always Activate.
<br />
<br />Updating Flash on Firefox requires users to visit Adobe’s download page (<a href="https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/otherversions/</a>) where they can download and install the latest versions for their respective web browser.

            Thanks for the suggestion Dave.&nbsp; I checked, and Adobe was already turned on.&nbsp; Reckon I'll go back to the old Internet Explorer browser and see if it will work.&nbsp; You're right about Echo - lots of glitches.&nbsp; Thanks for your response.

<h3> lachlanblow  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Surface Pro &#40;5&#41; - Hot and Electric Shocks while Charging</h2>
                    <p>So I've only had this for a couple days now, and I noticed that it got super hot while charging, and only charging. I haven't tested it in sleep mode yet, but I'm pretty sure its okay in that department, as in - I get normal, somewhat cool temperatures.
 While it is on battery, it runs nice and cool, with some warm temperatures near the top but I suspect that's normal too.</p>
<p>In summary, while charging, my Surface Pro (5):</p>
<ul>
<li>Feels way too hot (to the point where its uncomfortable to touch) which means the fans are on all the time</li><li>Sometimes delivers electric shocks when touching the metal back, which also feels "bumpy" while charging</li><li>Things seem to actually run slowly, where Word documents sometimes have delayed input from the keyboard</li><li>CPU and RAM loads are at around 20% while all this is happening</li></ul>
<p>I have the following specs: i7, 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought it brand new only days ago, and expect a little more from this premium device.</p>
<p>I am pretty tech savvy and have no fear of the registry, and would like to prevent taking this back or getting a repair if possible, I am just unfamiliar with this device and require some support as internet research seems specific to the device being in
 sleep mode (which is not my issue).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have just tried reversing the figure 8 connector on the power adaptor (apparently that worked with a Surface Pro 4 with a similar issue) a solution which I found here:&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/3zff8w/electric_shocks_on_the_surface_pro_4/</p>

    <title>Audio Graph Isolation Issue&#40;audiodg.exe&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lightchaser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Audio Graph Isolation Issue&#40;audiodg.exe&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So about a month ago, before I got Windows 10, I started having this issue with my sound where it wouldn't work at seemingly random times. After about a week I realized that it stopped working when there was no audio being played, and once I needed audio
 for a video or game, it would take about 45 seconds for the video or game to start due to the fact that no audio would play. Often even if the video had only been paused for 10 seconds it would take a bit for the sound to come back. During the wait, "Audio
 Graph Isolation" would rise to the top of my disc usage which leads me to believe that it may have something to do with the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have tried several things based on similar issues people have had.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I checked my audio drivers.</p>
<p>-I reinstalled my audio drivers.</p>
<p>-I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 hoping that would fix the issue.</p>
<p>-I uninstalled and then reinstalled the adobe flash player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-I scanned for viruses using both AVG and Windows Defender.(full scan)</p>
<p>-I reinstalled Chrome in case it was the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to be clear, this issue affects all type of audio on my computer, not just games and videos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this topic would be much appreciated. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I have also tried the troubleshooting tool, but it doesn't say that there is anything wrong.</p>

            I would suggest you to check the status of volume shadow service. If it is not running please start it and set it to automatic. If it does not start please check the dependency services and make they all are started when you click on volume shadow service you see a dependency tab. Make sure the services under the dependency tab are up and running.
<br />
<br />Services related to System Restore are:
<br />
<br />-      Volume shadow copy
<br />
<br />-      Multimedia Class Scheduler
<br />
<br />-      Remote Procedure Call (RPC)
<br />
<br />-      DCOM Server Process Launcher
<br />
<br />-      Plug and Play.
<br />
<br />Follow the instructions below and set all of the above services to Automatic.
<br />
<br />a. Click the Start button, and in the search box type in: Services.
<br />b. Press 'Enter' to open Services window.
<br />c  Find related services that are listed above, and check the Status (started) and Startup Type (automatic).
<br />d. Double click the service to change the status to started and set startup type to Automatic.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists, try this method.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Performing a System File Checker Scan(SFC) on your computer.
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator/active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Attempt System Restore.

<p>Well, you asked for it, here is (part of) my evolving list of possible solutions in the fight against USB (Unreliable Serial Bus) problems. Make sure your computer is free from malware before trying them. Don’t be intimidated by the length of the list as
 many of them will not apply to your error or your device and some you may have already attempted. Read through and/or print the list and try any that seem significant. In no particular sequence, they are:</p>
<p>5. Try plugging in another device to ‘wake up’ the port. If it is recognised, plug in the misbehaving device. Also, if you have moved the device from one port to another, try reconnecting it to the port it was connected to before the problem occurred, then
 restart the computer.<br />
7. If you have one, or can get hold of one, try booting a ‘Live’ Linux CD to determine whether the problems are hardware or operating system related, i.e. if your USB ports work in Linux, then it isn't a hardware problem. Test the ports by plugging in a mouse
 or, in Ubuntu, look in Places &gt; Computer for a disk drive. <br />
8. Reinstall the motherboard chipset drivers and/or check the motherboard manufacturer’s website for updated drivers.<br />
11. Remove static electricity by turning the computer off and remove the mains lead (also remove the battery if it’s a laptop). Press and hold the on/off button on the computer for ten seconds. Leave the computer turned off for five minutes and discharge the
 static from the actual USB ports by touching them whilst touching something metallic. Plug in the lead (and laptop battery) and start the computer as normal. You may have to reset the system date/time on a laptop. Also, whilst the power is off, it can be useful
 to clean the USB ports and the individual device connectors using a lint-free cloth.<br />
13. Even if the devices are present in Device Manager, check for these two BIOS settings (these settings are not present on some motherboards):<br />
If ‘USB 2.0 Voltage’ is present, set it to maximum or similar wording.<br />
Under P &amp; P or Peripherals, there may be an option to clear the stored data of PCI/USB devices.<br />
17. The device may be identified as ‘Unknown’, so go to Device Manager &gt; View &gt; Show hidden devices. Expand the USB section and right-click each Unknown Device and choose Uninstall. Restart the computer. Plug the device in and the drivers should be installed.<br />
21. Click the Windows Orb (Start) &gt; All Programs &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Services. Scroll down to the Plug and Play service and make sure it is set to Automatic and that it is running.<br />
22. Only use an external USB hub that has its own power supply, also if you have a desktop computer, installing a separate PCI card may help.<br />
25. Creating a new account sometimes works. Create a new Administrator account via Control Panel &gt; Classic View &gt; User Accounts. Log on to the new account, can you view the device? If so, you need to copy all the data from the old user account to the new user
 account. You may have to go to Folder Options &gt; View Tab and put a check in ‘Show hidden files and folders‘.<br />
26. Rule out any problems with the device itself by plugging it into a different computer. If it does not work in a different computer then the device is probably at fault. Also, if you receive the message "USB Device not recognised....", try shutting down
 the computer, pull out the power, wait for a few minutes, plug the cord back in and start the computer. It can also mean that the device has 'died'.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p><span>Hi Didge107,</span></p>
<p><span>Along with BurrWalnut’s suggestions, I would also suggest you to try the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Delete the corrupted registry entries (if found) and check it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Important:</span></em></strong><em><span>
 This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the
 registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article:<span>&nbsp;</span></span></em><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span>Back
 up the registry</span></em></strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>
 Follow the steps as below only after you have backed up the registry.</span></em></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, in the start search box, type “regedit” (without quotes), and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the navigation pane, locate and then click the following registry subkey:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</span></strong></p>
<p><span>c. In the right pane, click UpperFilters.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>
 You may also see an UpperFilters.bak registry entry. You do not have to remove that entry. Click UpperFilters only. If you do not see the UpperFilters registry entry, you still might have to remove the LowerFilters registry entry. To do this, go to step 6.</span></em></p>
<p><span>d. On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>e. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span>f. In the right pane, click LowerFilters.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Note:</span></em></strong><em><span>
 If you do not see the LowerFilters registry entry, unfortunately this content cannot help you any further. Go to the "Next Steps" section for information about how you can find more solutions or more help on the Microsoft Web site.</span></em></p>
<p><span>f. On the Edit menu, click Delete.</span></p>
<p><span>g. When you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes.</span></p>
<p><span>h. Exit Registry Editor.</span></p>
<p><span>i. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h3> ronrosenfeld  say:</h3>
<h2>            explorer.exe using 50-100&#37; CPU</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>I've noticed this for a few weeks.&nbsp; In Task Manager, explorer.exe shows as using 50-100%&nbsp;CPU, and programs seem to run more slowly.&nbsp; This reliably starts when I open an "explorer window".&nbsp; It will also start if I use msconfig
 to disable everything (except microsoft services).</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>I have booted into safe mode and run malawarebytes anti-malware -- nothing found.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>I then ran Process Explorer, and discovered that the thread which seems to be responsible is called (has a start address) &nbsp;nttdll.dll!EtwTraceMessageVa+0x130.&nbsp; There may be one or two of these threads present, each using
 48%+CPU.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>I believe these are responsible, and I think they are used in some kind of event logging, possibly a debugger that somehow got turned on, but I don't know how to proceed from this point.</strong></span></p>

    <title>Windows 8 Keeps Loading Temporary Profile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 Keeps Loading Temporary Profile</h2>
                    <p>I understand that there are many posts on this topic but, my case seems to be a little more complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about a week windows 8 has been logging me in with a temporary profile. I have tried to solve this issue by the means of the other answers that have been posted on the topic. However, there is one issue that I keep running into, the need to access the
 "Built-in Administrator" Profile. While I have been able to activate this profile, I have been unable to log into it. It keeps on requesting a password which I do not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this: Can I solve this issue without having to access the "Built-in Administrator" profile? If not, is there a way around my password issue?</p>

            <p>Hey Trish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be various issues you may come around due to which you can face trouble logging in Windows 8. Actually, when you don’t login into Windows using correct user path directory, this issue came into play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You’ve Been Signed In With A Temporary Profile </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you’re logged in with a temporary profile, a notification in the right side of taskbar keeps popping up:</p>
<p><a href="http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Temporary-Profile-Error.png?c2fdaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f10%2fTemporary-Profile-Error-400x137.png%3fc2fdaa" height="137" width="400" /></a></p>
<p>Now since you’re warned that you’re on a temporary profile, every file operation you’ll be performing will be nullified at next sign in. But what if you get the same issue on the next sign in. If you; yourself is the administrator of the system facing this
 issue, you can apply the registry method discussed below to blow out this problem:</p>
FIX : Using Registry Editor
<p><strong>1.</strong> Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong> combination, type put
<strong>Regedt32.exe</strong> in <strong>Run</strong>&nbsp;dialog box and hit Enter to open the
<em>Registry Editor</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f08%2fREGEDIT.png" height="216" width="415" /></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Navigate to the following location:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/Youve-Been-Signed-In-With-A-Temporary-Profile-Error.png?c2fdaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fthewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2013%2f10%2fYouve-Been-Signed-In-With-A-Temporary-Profile-Error-400x204.png%3fc2fdaa" height="204" width="400" /></a></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Under the hood of <strong>ProfileList</strong><span> key, you’ll find the subkeys specific to a profile, see in the above
</span></p>
<p><span>screenshot. For example, I found out myself </span><em>S-1-5-21-2944774474-1080414133-2956492554-1001</em><span>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You’ll have these long subkeys equal to the number of user accounts on your system. All you need to do is that make sure the expandable registry string (</span><em>REG_EXPAND_SZ</em>) named
<strong>ProfileImagePath</strong> in the right pane of these keys exist and linked properly to the correct user account folder. If you find that this is not the case, just point it to correct the location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That’s it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Close the Registry Editor after making appropriate manipulations and reboot the machine to get the issue fixed.<em>

</p><p>I have attempted reinstalls of Mixed Reality from Settings Menu as suggested as well as the WMR Portal App. I've also attempted uninstalls of the last Windows Update before and after trying the above without success.</p>

</p><p>There are no pending updates (this machine is on the Windows Insider slow ring).</p>
<p>

            HI Tim.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />As you know Insider Previews are by nature unstable so I would report Feedback to the Insider program in Feedback Hub app, then roll back to the last stable version in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery if possible. 
<br />
<br /> Judging by the patches they're already pushed it needs several months more work before Version 1809 is stable enough to use.  Nobody should be in a hurry to get it after what we saw when it was "released" and lost files, caused cascading catastrophic problems.  
<br />
<br />If I had one of those headsets I'd want a stable version to transport me so I'd go back to the last stable version for that and many other good reasons.  
<br />
<br />If you need to reinstall follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Dear Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the suggestions however it was only through being on the recommended insiders slow ring that MS Layout WMR Functionality could be used (as it was previously able to be approximately 3 months ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates cannot be rolled back and resetting the PC is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other advice?</p>

            Please try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall or a VPN.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Store app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Store app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!
