    <title>CAN&#39;T SET WINDOWS 10 AUDIO TO 5.1, RECENT ISSUE, PLEASE HELP IM SO - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nickboland91  say:</h3>
<h2>            CAN&#39;T SET WINDOWS 10 AUDIO TO 5.1, RECENT ISSUE, PLEASE HELP IM SO LOST</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hoping I can get some help on this one. I'm trying to revert my audio settings so that it'll let my computer send out a 5.1 audio signal through my HDMI cord again. This has indeed been done before, so I know it's a software issue. I also have a suspicion
 it has something to do with this dumb Dolby Access app that keeps installing itself every time I reset my PC (yes, i've done this multiple times now). I tried out Atmos literally 1 time and now I've lost the ability to play 5.1 audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My audio devices looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fef35b1a-3ef7-48e4-858d-100e3cc778a4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fef35b1a-3ef7-48e4-858d-100e3cc778a4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>5.1 and 7.1 options are greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've taken two major troubleshooting approaches, one was temporarily successful and the other just flat out wasn't.</p>
<p>The one that wasn't: PC reset without completely deep scrubbing the hard drive. Went through the whole process and when my surface came back online I didn't have the ability to set audio output to 5.1. It also says the my SONYAVAMP can only support 2 channels
 - which is flat out wrong. It is a 5.1 surround sound system. See below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a6f6918-f725-4e7c-92c1-7857955b3f13?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a6f6918-f725-4e7c-92c1-7857955b3f13?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The option that temporarily worked was when I went through with the deep-clean option, but it only worked until my OS automatically install Dolby Access again. I was able to set my SONYAVAMP to 5.1, I was able to run a test and verify the computer was able
 to signal the rear speakers individually and then hours later the ability was gone. I also should note that it had considerably more options in terms of sample rates. The problem I'm reconciling is that with the 1st option, Dolby Access wasn't installed yet
 but I still wasn't able to set my audio output to 5.1... I'm honestly so frustrated at this I can't even begin to describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if something is causing my computer to bypass the amp and go directly to the TV, which would explain why it won't even recognize that there is more than 2 channels available. But my TV is a Samsung and my surround sound is a Sony so the name
 (SONYAVMP) staying consistent might rule out that theory. I might do another complete restore and keep the computer off the internet while I figure out what components I can uninstall before it switches my settings around. If ANYONE has ANY experience dealing
 with something like this PLEASE help me because this has gone on for too long and I've spent way too much time waiting for my computer to reset only for the issue to repeat itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANK YOU MICROSOFT COMMUNITY!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

The update is 384 MB. I have an Ethernet cable giving my Xbox internet. I tried cycling my Xbox one, and that didnt work. I even had my Xbox unplugged for 24 hours. Everything on my Xbox Live Service Status is normal.&nbsp;My Xbox is in the preview program on the alpha stage. I cant find the error code anywhere.</p>

            <p>wishing I would have read your post before resetting, contacted xbox support and was told my console is out of warranty and that I will have to get a third party to fix the console because it must be a hardware issue. I am baffled and angry,&nbsp;the console has never had any issues until now a ran like a dream. I get the update and it's a glorified paper weight that I have to fix. Absolutely ridiculous, the agent gave me a generic&nbsp;reason for updates and how they maintain the console. I cannot wrap my head around that, can someone please&nbsp;explain how it is possible for this to be a hardware issue maybe I'm missing something.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            XBox sign-in does not support passwords longer than 16 characters</h2>
                    
<p>After receiving a security alert, I changed my Microsoft password to a nice, secure, 17-character password. But the XBox 360 only accepts the first 16 characters, and drops the rest, so I can't sign into my account. This seems stupid. Why is the password
 input field limited to 16 characters? Especially if the underlying system accepts more?</p>

<p>[quote user="Anaerin360"]I changed my Microsoft password to a nice, secure, 17-character password.[/quote]</p>
<p>No matter how long you make up your password, a password can eventually be leaked or otherwise be stolen.</p>
<p>If you REALLY want to make your account absolutely password proof, 
turn on Two Step Verification and set up the free authenticator app on your smartphone.
</p>
<p>This has two advantages:</p>
<p>First, even if someone gets hold of your password somehow (e.g. a keyboard sniffer on a computer in an internet cafe during your holiday trip), without the additional code that is generated by your phone, your account can't be accessed. So an account hijacker
 would also have to physically steal your phone as well. </p>
<p>Without the phone, there is no access to your account. </p>
<p>However, since the Xbox 360 can't work with the two step verification code yet, you generate an additional App Password on the Two Step Verification site, and use THAT on the Xbox 360 instead of your regular password.
</p>
<p>And since that app password can't be used for regular account access (only for special apps or devices like the Xbox 360), you are double secure, even with a "short" 16 character password.
</p>
<p>So please use Two Step Verification in addition to your password to make your account "bulletproof".</p>

<h2>            My computer freezes while watching a video.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Hi!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have encountered an annoying problem with my pc as soon as I reinstalled windows 10. When I try to play videos, it doesn't matter if it is on YouTube nor the videos I have saved, my computer freezes. I can't do anything and an artifact also comes along.
 I've found a temporary solution for the videos that I saved in my pc, and by that I mean changing the video player (I changed it from "Movies &amp; TV' to "Quicktime") and had no problem since then with that.</p>
<p>When I reinstalled my windows it happened every time I tried to play something on the internet. Now it doesn't happen that often, it freezes only after about an hour or so. (I hope I am getting this right.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Note: I have Adobe Flash Player installed, and I disabled Hardware Acceleration too,&nbsp; the problem still persists.</em></p>
<p>

<p>well, looks like an issue you have. Could be many things. try uninstalling any garbage programs. Quick time is horrible and garbage and causes conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do this and you will never have any issues, providing you uninstall all players and codec packs first and restart pc.</p>

<p>if after this, you still have issues, then I can help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, if you have shared video, which means in task manager&gt;&gt;performance tab, scroll through list</p>
<p>and if it shows your video card GPU, then you have shared memory and maybe you have an issue with not enough, pagefile too small, total RAM installed not enough, video card drivers need updated or something causing corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>online flash player videos are highly compressed and need a a lot of GPU ram and main RAM and CPU% usage&nbsp;to play them</p>
<p>
</p><p>videos on pc not as much, but HD will need more than a non hd video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>play a flashvideo online</p>
<p>
</p><p>look at the CPU%, Memory usage, and GPU usage if shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>plus, even if you do not have shared GPU memory, after your dedicated memory for GPU runs out, you are now using a cache for additional memory</p>

<p>
</p><p>looks like&nbsp;plenty PC there, how did you delete quick time, Programs and features I hope and not deleted the folder&nbsp;in program files(x86)</p>
<p>

<p>I had some updates to do but it's the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also yes, my C:\ drive is used 95-100% while i am on Facebook, in Opera or Chrome.</p>
<p>But while I watch a video on youtube my CPU has a ~12% usage, GPU a max 7% usage and my disk barely gets at 6%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Pynd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you continue to experience the issue after following the troubleshooting steps provided by
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/28e4147d-6aca-4620-93a2-59bb59fed5f2" title="seahawks65">
seahawks65</a>, I suggest that you adjust the page file size or virtual memory in Windows 10. Adjusting the page file size is known for regulating the disk usage and it dramatically improves Windows 10 performance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the search box, type <strong>Adjust the appearance and performance of Windows</strong> and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Go to <strong>Advanced </strong>tab and click <strong>Change...</strong> button in the
<strong>Virtual memory</strong> section. </li><li>At the top, uncheck the box right next to the <strong>Automatically manage paging file size for all drives</strong> option.</li><li>Select drive C: <em>(or the drive where Windows 10 is installed)</em>.</li><li>Select <strong>Custom size:</strong> by ticking its radio button, and change the
<strong>Initial size (MB)</strong> and <strong>Maximum size (MB)</strong> to the <strong>
Recommended </strong>value that you will find just below the <strong>Total paging file size for all drivers</strong> section.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>This method will help improve the system performance of Windows 10, and will gradually decrease the freeze issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
        </p>

<p>There is no way a PC uses 8GB of physical ram to watch a video on top of the already pagefile assigned.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case, there is serious system corruption of files or a problem with Video card, dedicated Vid memory or video software or a bad system board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the person needs to install all board hardware drivers from OEM if the OEM has them for Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            KB4093112 - once applied, system receives stop code 0xc000021a - cannot start up</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once KB4093112 is applied, my Dell becomes non-functioning.&nbsp; Steps: apply updates.&nbsp; At restart to complete updates, the system goes to blue screen with stop code 0xc000021a.&nbsp; It cycles between the Dell splash screen and the blue screen continuously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to correct:&nbsp; used the F12 option on the Dell to get to the OS Support - restored to the pre-update version of my OS.&nbsp; ran the windows update troubleshooter.&nbsp; tried to update again.&nbsp; same issue.&nbsp; stop code 0xc000021a.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next steps?</p>
<p>BEFORE I APPLY THIS UPDATE AGAIN...I think I am going to try to run various system scans to see if I can identify any other system issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else running into this?</p>
<p>How did you resolve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi Jim.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you using System Restore which is the easiest way to get back before problem Updates people are experiencing?    <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also identify and Uninstall problem Updates at Setttings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; WIndows Update &gt; Installed Updates, then install the Hide Updates tool to hide them if they cause repeat problems:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

When I plugged it in it took awhile to turn on but it turned on. &nbsp;It went to the home screen where you see the logo and right away it was green over the green logo. It is like a annoying highlight all over the screen. As I tried to set it up there were green lines going up and down the screen flickering making me sick. Anyway I have an HDMI cord plugged once along with the power source and thatâs pretty much it. I have a Panasonic TV</p><p>My Xbox 360 works fine with no problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I don't recall exactly when I first started noticing this happen, but it was definitely after I got a new hard drive and did a clean install of Windows 7 x64 (it was running x32 before and did not have this problem) but when I put my computer into sleep,
 it takes a surprisingly long time and then the next time I turn it on, it does a cold boot and says that it recovered from a BSOD. &nbsp;I installed and ran BlueScreenView and found that it was being called by usbhub.sys with an error message of BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER
 (Code 0x000000FE). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a number of USB peripherals plugged into the computer via a dock including an external sound system, hard drive, but the same thing happens, even if the computer is not plugged into anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts on next steps?</p>

<p>Although the Bug Check 0xFE: BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER does usually indicate hardware it could easily<br />
be a USB device attached and not System USB hardware. And you can never really rule out drivers.<br />

<br />
<strong>Is this a Upgrade installation of Windows 7 or did Windows 7 come on the system from the factory?</strong></p>
<p>A possible cause could be Windows Updates, especially drivers. Even drivers not usually thought of as<br />
USB related, such as video/display, network (NIC &amp; WiFI), and others, can be the cause.</p>
<p>Remove <strong>ALL </strong>USB devices from the computer. Be sure to check for updated drivers for ALL USB<br />

    <title>Windows 10 will not recognize my game purchase - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charles hardin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not recognize my game purchase</h2>
                    I recently bought Quantum Break for PC from an external site, punched in the code and it was good to go. Code worked and Microsoft confirmed that I purchased it. I now go to "My Library" and it is missing. I check under "downloads and updates" and it isn't
 there either. There has no means to download or install this game. When I go to the store page, rather then there being a download button, it is asking me to pay for it again. I have the latest version of Windows 10. Anyone else out there having this problem?

    <title>Win 10 wont boot until &#34;Windows boot manager&#34; manually - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mitchellhayes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 wont boot until &#34;Windows boot manager&#34; manually selected in boot menu.</h2>
                    My computer won't boot until I manually select "windows boot manager" in the boot menu in the bios.&nbsp; I used to have to select my SSD to boot windows but now it wants to use "windows launcher" which I haven't seen in a computer's bios as options to boot
 off before.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there anyway I can fix this so I don't have to manually select?&nbsp; (It is already first in boot order.)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Motherboard is Gigabyte Z77X-UD5H<br />
<br />
Drive is OCZ vertex 4 256 GB SSD&nbsp;<br />
<br />
No physical changes have been made to this computer, but it did recently do a few windows updates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Update:&nbsp; After disabling every boot option other then windows launcher it still doesn't boot straight to windows but if I hit any key on the keyboard it will boot.&nbsp; Before disabling I had to hit F12 only then it would be able to boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Hi Mitchell,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the possible reasons why your PC fails to boot into normal mode are broken components on the boot configuration data of your system. To isolate your concern, we suggest that you perform the following steps to trigger
<strong>safe</strong> <strong>m<span>ode </span></strong>through the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</strong> option</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><span>Improper shutdown process</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Turn on your computer. When the Windows logo is visible, unplug the power source of your computer. Perform this step three times.</span></li><li><span>On the fourth time that you turn on your computer, just simply wait for the
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</strong> window to appear.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings</strong> and click <strong>
Restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once your computer restarts, you will see a list of options. Press the
<strong>F4</strong> key to start your computer in <strong>s<span>afe mode</span></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>We also recommend that you perform a system restore after booting in
<strong>safe mode</strong>. </span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restoring wonât affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore
 point was made. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the <strong>Search</strong> box, type
<strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the upper-right window, under <strong><span>View</span></strong>
<strong><span>by</span></strong>, click <strong>

<h2>            Word 2013 not working with Windows 10, but not at start up</h2>
                    Hello and I hope someone can help me.&nbsp; I just recently upgraded my PC from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I also have Office 2013 Pro Plus.&nbsp; At start up I can right click on the Word, Excel and Edge icons in the task bar and get the pop up showing recently
 opened documents or sites.&nbsp; I can also left click on the volume icon and get the single slider bar and I can left click on the notification icon and get its pop up window.&nbsp; Word, Excel and Edge work and I am able to work on documents.&nbsp; However, at some point
 of the system being up I can no longer right click on Word, Excel and Edge.&nbsp; Nothing happens.&nbsp; Left clicking on the volume and notification icons does not do anything.&nbsp; When I&nbsp; left click on the &nbsp;Word icon or any document I may have on my desktop it opens
 it up but then freezes.&nbsp; I need task manager to close it down.&nbsp; Edge only brings up the blue screen with the 'E' in the middle and that is all.&nbsp; Only Excel works

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for providing detailed information about the issue, request you to provide below information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Have you installed all the pending updates on your system?</span></li><li><span>Which Windows 10 build is installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any recent hardware/software changes on your computer?</span></li><li><span>Do you have any antivirus program installed on your computer?</span></li><li><span>What troubleshooting steps have you taken to resolve the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>As an initial step, I would suggest you to install all pending updates on your system and check if it helps in resolving your issue. Disable or uninstall the apps or programs which are not used frequently on your computer, these apps might be running
 in the background which may result in slow performance or freezing of the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists follow the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Disable or Uninstall Third party antivirus.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Disable or uninstall any third party Antivirus software and check if it helps. Once you have disabled it try Opening the store again. See if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: System maintenance troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur due to presence of unused files in Windows or due to software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to Run by pressing Windows + R simultaneously.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on Security and Maintenance.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click on Troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>4. At the left side pane click on View all.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click on System Maintenance and then follow the instructions. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Perform full system scan using Windows defender</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Windows Defender uses real-time protection to scan everything you download or run on your PC.</span></strong></p>

            <p>Looking at Quick Heal Data Sheet, it seems to be designed with full Windows 10 compatibility. You shouldn't have a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34849735-de08-45d6-9703-15c3bda8be08" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But as a precaution to avoid encountering upgrade issues, fully uninstall Quick Heal first and turn on/enable Windows Defender before initiating the upgrade. There several issues arising on the web about 3rd party anti-virus causing upgrade problems where
 the only solution is either disabling or uninstalling them before users can successfully upgrade to Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After successfully upgrading to 10, reboot, disable Defender&nbsp;and&nbsp;install the Quick Heal AV back again.</p>

<h2>            still issues with zune update &#38;amp&#59; parental account</h2>
                    
<p>Since the Zune update I have not been able to sign into the marketplace on my phone, zune on my pc or xbox live website.</p>
<p>This is because it recognizes my account as a child (I was born in 1988)</p>
<p>I am happy to answer any questions in relation to identification to prove this should not be a childs account.</p>
<p>I posted this question on answers.microsoft.com and was told:</p>
<p><span>"It's possible that when the account was set up, it was required to have a parental account. Xbox LIVE determines whether an account is a child account or an adult account based on the age of the account owner. Then the account reached adulthood and
 we just need to promote the account into an adult account. This promotion removes the Family Settings and Xbox LIVE restrictions."</span></p>
<p>I attempted to follow the promotion link that was provided (Promote a child account to an adult account), however trying to sign in at xbox.com requires agreeing to the new t&amp;c, which requires parental permission.</p>
<p>The Xbox LIVE account was setup on my brothers xbox360 Pro 60gb edition. Release for that model was August 2008 so I would have been almost 20 years old.</p>
<p>I do not own an Xbox or have access to the above any longer, nor have my parents ever held an xbox live account or have a profile on that system.</p>
<p>Please let me know what Microsoft can do to remedy this issue.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It's not possible to have an account that's a child without parental information on it. If you're being prompted to agree to the terms of use on the website this means that there's definitely a parental account attached to your child account. You should see
 the e-mail that it's showing when you look at the terms of use page. Your parents didn't need to own an Xbox LIVE account, they needed to fill in their information along with their e-mail address. If you had entered fake information at the time of it being
 created then that would be quite unfortunate.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can suggest you do is to either <strong><a href="http://account.live.com/resetpassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset the password for the e-mail account</a></strong> that's coming up, or fill out the
<strong><a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account recovery form</a></strong> to get that e-mail switched out with one that is actually valid and working. If you don't actually know the e-mail address or it's not coming up in the field automatically
 filed in on the form then you'd need to <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reach out to phone support</a></strong> so they can tell you the parental e-mail on the account.<br />
<br />
Without being able to agree to the terms one last time, you won't be able to promote the account at all regardless of age now.</p>

<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>I have called Xbox Live and they have advised the parental account is my brothers xbox live ID/email</p>
<p>He is overseas and it is very difficult to contact him. We have both been over 18 years of age for a number of years.</p>
<p>This is a major issue relating to the use of my Windows Phone. It should have nothing to do with Xbox Live and is incredibly frustrating that I have been sent around in circles trying to fix this.</p>
<p>Someone at Microsoft or Xbox needs to fix my account.</p>
<p>Please help. Thank you</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's nothing that Microsoft or anyone on this forum can do to assist you with this specific issue.<br />
<br />
If you've found out the e-mail associated with the account now please reach out to the owner of that account. If you're unable to do so then please sure the two links above to either reset the password, or fill out the Microsoft account recovery form.<br />
<br />
Those would be your only avenues of getting into the account. Once you've done so, you can agree to the terms one last time and promote your account from a child to an adult. Without being able to agree to these terms first you'd be locked out of the account,
 unfortunately. This is an issue with the Microsoft account in total, not just Xbox LIVE. Regardless of what the account was created for (Zune, Windows Phone, Games for Windows LIVE, Xbox LIVE, etc) if you were under the age of 18 when the account was created
 then the account would have a parent associated with it. The terms need to be agreed for each of those services, and the process to promote the account is the same in all cases as well.<br />
<br />
Sorry.&nbsp;</p>

            A. You can use File Explorer to transfer photos from phone to Windows. When you attach your phone, look for your phone under This PC &gt; Click to locate DCIM folder &gt; Open DCIM folder &gt; Select required picture &gt; CTRL+C to copy &gt; Go to the target folder and CTRL+V
<br />
<br />B. You can also use Photos App to transfer pics

            Hi  PhasyaBowling
<br />
<br />To transfer photos and videos from your phone to PC, connect your phone to the PC with a USB cable. Make sure the phone is on and unlocked, and that you're using a working cable, then:
<br />
<br />On your PC, select the Start  button and then select Photos to open the Photos app.
<br />Select Import &gt; From a USB device, then follow the instructions. You can pick the items you want to import and select where to save them.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you're using having trouble with an Android device see the below notes:
<br />
<br />On Android devices: You might need to change the USB setting to allow you to transfer media or photos and not just charge the phone. Go to Notification Center and choose Transfer files or File transfer.

<p>Hi all, I'm interested in upgrading my Sony Vaio AR41L (running Vista 32-bit SP2) to Windows 7, but when I run the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor, it tells me that for the graphics card, NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GT, the driver "installed for this device is not compatible
 with Windows 7".&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Apparently, NVIDIA don't have a solution and have been sending people to Sony, and Sony say that they haven't upgraded the drivers yet for Windows 7 and don't know when they expect to do so...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced and solved this issue? &nbsp;Any suggestions would be mighty useful!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            someone had noted that nVidia will be releasing a new batch of drivers in a few days. (once a month)<br />
<br />
it may be advisable to wait it out and continue with Standard VGA for now.

<p>I accidentally deleted the title update which was somewhere in july 2014,whenever I go play Ds2, it automatically quits the game and says that the title update is lost, I really wanna play the SOTFS content,but whenever I download it and is 99%,if freezes
 or restarts to 1%</p>
<p>Basically,I want to know the answers to these questions:<br />
-How can I get the Title Update back?<br />
-How do you fix the 99% restart bug?</p>

<h2>            being returned to single player &#47; disconnected from xbox live alot.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a new wireless xbox, bought new boxing day, over the last few weeks it keeps dropping xbox live connection, or I connect but there are no other players in the session. my brother's xbox is working fine (older elite) he's on a wired connection,
 so I've tried that but it makes no difference. is it my xbox that's playing up?</p>

<p>I've just gone through all the trouble shooting for NAt settings, Upnp, DNS, </p>
<p>Going to try another router, an older one.</p>
<p>Signal strength on the xbox is lowest bar, laptop next to xbox is getting a good (3rd or 4th bar) on the wireless, again the wired connection also is a poor connection. Anyother trouble shooting I can do before I box the xbox up and go back to the shop?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 battery problem&#40;not the everyone&#39;s problem&#41;</h2>
                    When Windows 8.1 was installed on my laptop,the battery was used to full charge in 1 and a half to 2 hours while shutdown and was used to give 5-8 hours of downloading without any activity and keeping display on or off didn't matter a lot(I am serious).But
 now in Windows 10,the battery charges up in just 1 hour while display is off and gives only 2 hours of downloading time in the same circumstances.Even if i use battery saver and power saver or avg economy mode as my power settings :( I checked in battery options
 if any application uses a lot of battery but none enough to completely drain my battery,only 1-2% background use.I even disabled almost all of the background applications using settings and avg.I also closed a lot of applications which I didn't required while
 downloading.Could it be that my battery doesn't full charge(It do shows 100%)?I opened the device manager and tried to updated almost all of the drivers,some had new versions and some didn't including battery drivers.Plea

            <p>Although the operating system could affect run time due to the load it puts on the battery it cannot have any influence directly on the charge time. That is entirely dependent on the power supply and the controller built into the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reduced run time could be due to the battery not really&nbsp;being fully charged or the low battery warning triggering too early.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;A true charge time can only be established if the battery is really flat. To do that you need to override the battery control built into Windows. If the BIOS setup has a memory test or use a bootable hard disk test tool to run the system until it goes down.
 Then plug in the PSU and see how long it takes to charge without switching on.</p>

            <p>It is not so much about fixing it, more&nbsp;trying to identify what your real problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't really say how long a battery takes to charge unless you know how flat it is. If Windows is misreporting the battery condition which is possible then you need to get a reliable benchmark. Flat is about the most reliable one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long it takes to get there depends on how you can work the system which is why I use a disk tester, exercising the drive pulls a good current. Recharging from flat with computer off should take a few hours.</p>
