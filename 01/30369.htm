    <title>How do I boot into Safe Mode on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slickd0g  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I boot into Safe Mode on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just started to do my updates after being away from home for 2 weeks. I have an MSI gaming rig with Nvidia 1080 graphics card. My computer now would boot up into windows, but only show me a cursor on a black screen. Nothing else. I suspect it's the
 graphics card, but I am unable to boot up into the safe mode. Previous windows versions allowed us to press F8 and choose safe mode, but from what I am reading now the only way to get into the safe mode on windows 10 is to actually do it within windows 10?
 Is this for real? What about people who aren't able to go into windows and that's why they need safe mode in the first place?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading USB bootable windows 10, but when I try to use bcdedit command it does not let me do it with an error "the boot configuration could data store could not be opened" and there are no safe mode restart options available when I boot
 from a USB. The USB becomes drive X and the existing windows is on drive C. From the USB command line I am able to see the C and all the windows files in it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW DO I GET INTO SAFE MODE ????</p>

<h2>            how do I prevent display dimming when it&#39;s dark</h2>
                    My computer display dims when it gets dark and I don't want it to. It's easier for me to see what's on my screen when I'm in a dark room but then my display automatically dims and that makes it hard for me to see again. I've tried to change the settings
 but it seems it won't allow me to do so and changing contrast doesn't help. I just want to be able to disable the automatic dimming function.

            Check with your hardware manufacturer for how to turn off that feature.&nbsp; More than likely you can do it in the BIOS as well as some setting unique to the system.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>You've discovered a long-standing problem with Windows 7. To fix this, I recommend a program called FileMenu Tools. You can download the freeware portable version from&nbsp;here:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/System/System-Enhancements/FileMenu-Tools-Portable.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">
 http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/System/System-Enhancements/FileMenu-Tools-Portable.shtml</font></a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading and installing the program you'll notice that by&nbsp;default every option is checked. I'd be a lot more selective about it, otherwise your right-click menu will be a full page long! When the main window opens you'll see a list on the right-hand
 side&nbsp;of all the items that can be added to the right-click menu. Start weeding through the list and take out all the one's you
<em>don't</em> need by <em><strong>un</strong></em>checking the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're done making your choices (de-selections) make sure you click the green checkmark in the row of icons in the top left-hand window&nbsp;of the interface to "Apply" your choices. The program can do much more, but that answers your specific question.
 I'm told the program has a good help file, so try there if you're interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            <p>I have the same problem also now but I did find a temporary work around.</p>
<p>You can copy a folder for a different folder area and paste it where you need it;&nbsp; delete the duplicated files in the&nbsp; "copied" folder and rename it.&nbsp; You are at least back in business until we find a fix!&nbsp; Do not copy a folder into itself (subfolder) the
 system won't like the naming convention. </p>

    <title>Surface book continues to say attached - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> endeavor384  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface book continues to say attached</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed in the past couple days, when ever I have my screen attached to the keyboard and I move the screen ever so slightly, the green box in the bottom right pops up saying "Attached". My screen had been attached for hours, never having detached but
 when i close the screen and re-open, it says "Attached" and beeps and again anytime I move the screen any number of degrees, it will re-pop up saying "Attached"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was just curious if anyone has had this before and what they did to get it fixed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi Endeavor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this issue a number of times, I did two three thing. Firstly&nbsp;I downloaded the latest driver pack and installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49497</a>&nbsp; - Rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then did a full windows update. - Rebooted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I&nbsp;cleaned all the connections on both parts of the surface book, after this&nbsp;it seemed to behave normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not really sure if it was the drivers or the clean but it seemed to work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>
<p>Paul.</p>

<h2>            Screen issue-Manually settings the brightness not working</h2>
                    <p>I have few days now with my brand new Pro 4 i5/4/128 version&nbsp;purchased from Monday via Amazon an issue with the brightness setting when put it&nbsp;to manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's just behave like putting it to automatically and by itself adjust the brightness level up and down especially when switching between app via multitasking or closing any kind of app or traditional exe programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had last 2.5 years several surface tablet (Pro 2/3 and Surface 3) but that's first time meet that kind of issue.</p>
<p>Not experience&nbsp; with other tablet from other OEM that kind o issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When putting the brightness settings to automatically it works fine and as it should, but when putting it in manually simple doesn't seem to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is more strong when put the brightness level from 15-25%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the latest Intel HD drivers from Intel downloading center&nbsp;hopping the issue is gone but never helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all the windows/firmware update and did hard reset but never solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone had similar that kind of&nbsp;blizzard issue never happened with a lot of previous windows tablet before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi Chuck,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message that you've received is due to some files extensions which are not properly complied or installed in your device. On the other hand, a DLL is a library that contains code and data that can be used by more than one program at the same time.
 Just to confirm, were you able to successfully disable the Dropbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need additional assistance.</p>

<p>When you say you typed into the log file of DropBox to disable it, where did you get these instructions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not use DropBox, go to the Settings App - Apps and uninstall DropBox</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do use DropBox but only want it to run manually rather than run all the time, go to DropBox's Settings and uncheck 'Start Dropbox on System Startup' or disable the process in Windows Startup (Task Manager - Startup Tab)</p>

<p>"Only" checking the Insider App is not enough. If there are surveys and quests you can do, do them and answer the survey questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if a Beta-Feature is particularly helpful or does not work as you would like it to work, file feedback. Hold the Xbox button on the controller and use the send feedback button, when you encountered a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more feedback and surveys you file the more "active" you are regarded as a Insider, and the higher the chance of getting an invite to the Alpha ring.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Elite Controller bumper quality - the only thing worse is the support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tadabukuppeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Elite Controller bumper quality - the only thing worse is the support you&#38;&#35;39&#59;ll get... </h2>
                    
<p><span>Just wrapped up an amazing call with Xbox One's support team. And by amazing, I do mean "an event equivalent to bashing one's head into a concrete wall". I did learn some important things I'd like to share with anyone having issues with their Elite
 controller's bumpers (which from searching on the internet, is a common theme). Take from this what you can. I assure you, you won't receive ANYTHING that can be considered helpful from Xbox's support team. In fact, expect them to lie directly to you.<br />
<br />
Will attempt to keep this as short as possible, but want to make sure to include what I think are the important details.</span></p>
<p><span>During regular use of my Elite controller (did not throw, slam, or drop) left bumper makes a pseudo popping noise after being pressed and released and now jiggles loosely around. If I hold the left trigger down and turn the controller down, the broken
 off bumper will fall out. I do some research online, looks like tons of people have this or similar problem (bumper sticking was the other common issue along side stick drift and grips coming off). All threads bear ill tidings of zero help from Microsoft/Xbox.
 I decide to call Xbox support because a very few threads mention a year warranty (I've had mine for approx 9 months). Here is where things get really interesting.<br />
<br />
The call lasted for an hour and 12 mins. and of course was some calling center not in America (although they try to fool you with a caller ID out of WA). The connection was terrible and I had to repeat the Serial numbers for my Xbox and Elite controller tons
 of times because the audio kept cutting out... (Go go failure VoIP). Now, I tried to explain several times to this lady that I bought my controller well after my xbox and that they were not in a bundle. &nbsp;My Xbox was quickly added to my Microsoft account but
 she spent close to 40mins attempting to pull up my controller by the serial number. Once she exhausted her "tools" (in which she confirmed she was not at all able to pull up the device) she told me that the warranty was void because when you buy the elite
 controller separately you only get a 90 day warranty... Please take note of that:<br />
<br />
Elite controller obtained w/ bundle purchase of xbox = 1 year warranty<br />
Elite controller obtained by itself = 90 day warranty<br />
<br />
What a crock. Just because I didn't purchase a brand new console at the time I got an Elite controller I'm now S.O.L. on getting a replacement for the crummy design of the bumpers. Way to take care of the people who are willing to drop $150 bucks on a controller
 you claim to be designed for hardcore gamers. I've had normal controllers last well past 9 months before they break to the point beyond using.<br />
<br />
At this point I'm ticked off and the lady tells me that she can refer me to the closest business that repairs controllers... SPOILER ALERT!!! I've already contacted several places that do that and ALL of them told me after parts and labor I'd be MUCH better
 off just buying a new controller... which was this ladies next shiny piece of advice. I tell her that I want to verify that my specific controller is out of warranty. I can see from where my xbox was added to my account (and that I purchased it many many moons
 ago) that it's warranty ran out on XYZ date. She tries in vain to pull up my controller via the serial number again and even has me visit the website to do it myself. Here's the message I receive when I try to add it:<br />
<br />
"We're sorry. Something went wrong on our side, and we are working on it. Please come back in a while."&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What the heck? At this point, she is just trying to get me off the phone saying she is 100% positive my warranty is void. I ask to speak to a manager because you can't be 100% sure WHEN YOU CAN'T EVEN PULL UP MY CONTROLLER IN YOUR SYSTEM. The manager who gets
 on REALLY puts the cherry on top of the whole thing. He rudely talks over the top of me to CONTINUOUSLY inform me that controllers purchased on their own have 90 day warranties. When I tell him that I'm not satisfied until the controller is added to my account
 and/or I verify that fact. He has me read off the serial number, waits literally 10sec and goes "oh yup, here it is. I can't add it to your account but with the information I have here, I know for sure your warranty is void." WHICH IS A COMPLETE LIE!!! He
 could give me NO additional information on the controller and refused to prove in any way that he was able to find it in his system.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I asked for his information so I could file a complaint (won't do my any good but might as well) on someone willing to blatantly lie to a customer because they don't have the answer and just want to get me off the phone as quickly as possible. I was told I'd
 be emailed the address in which I could address my complaints. I told him to include a screenshot of where he had my controller pulled up. His response was "we can't email screenshots". Ha!<br />
<br />
Surprise, surprise... email never came!<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I did get a "reference number" which I'm sure isn't anything I can use to help hold that guy accountable. Here it is in case someone out there knows where I can pull additional info about the call. Hope this thread helps someone out there.<br />

<p>Feel your pain, Valiquin. I have a sticky left bumper on an elite controller I purchased 5 months ago. Besides the difference in warranty depending whether you bought it separately or as part of bundle (agree, that is nonsense), there is simply not the level
 of support for the gamer community as advertised. Using terms like "the controller for the ultimate gamer and a long lasting controller" simply hold no weight when you have crappy support. I would gladly send mine in and they can see it is in pristine condition,
 minus the sticky left bumper. I had my interaction over chat, and I think he just ended up copying and pasting in the same answer; "I am sorry you are dealing with this but this is now out of warranty and we can't replace it". No logical reasoning what so
 ever. As an example, Razer, a gamer oriented company as well has a 1 year warranty on controllers. I'm going back to my old controllers and maybe wait for the next version and make sure to always purchase it in a bundle.

<p>Well, I think Microsoft has realized that it simply does not need to respond to these kind of issues. Make something look expensive, market the crap out of it and sell it for a premium price and enough people will believe it actually is "elite", me included.
 I did end up following the advice of Microsoft support and went to Best Buy to see if they would return it, but they just chuckled.
</p>
<p>I did have a very pleasant conversation with my american express customer service who informed me that these kind of purchases are covered with a one year warranty under the credit card agreement and &nbsp;we immediately got the claim processed. Just an idea
 for some of you that used a credit card to purchase this incredibly, elite controller.

    <title>Easy Connect works sometimes then doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Easy Connect works sometimes then doesn&#39;t</h2>
                    <p>I have browsed the web and the Microsoft forums and have not been able to come up with a solution to the problem of "Easy Connect" working all day and then without any warning starts failing.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;When failing it states it cannot connect to the global peer to peer network. Have run the troubleshooter in Remote assistance and it does not show any problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Worked with a friend of mine for over 4 hours who&nbsp;is having the same problem (works one day and not the next)&nbsp; He is running Windows 8.1 and I have Windows 7. &nbsp;We have looked at all the suggestions on the Microsoft page / forums etc.&nbsp;but&nbsp;that all assumes
 that it never worked when it in fact was working a few hours before. Cannot be router config&nbsp;, &nbsp;both systems not running windows seven since we never get that far, or&nbsp;anything else that is suggested since it was working and now isn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance when I started typing this&nbsp;question, &nbsp;Easy connect was not working.&nbsp; I just tried it again and now it works. Not a fast typer but that could not have been more than a few minutes.&nbsp; The other day it would not work at all.&nbsp; &nbsp;No updates or program
 changes made between times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This has got to be something to do with either Microsoft or the ISP (in my case Comcast). Has anyone got any suggestions or is Easy Connect" just&nbsp;poor programming.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Also the "send an invitation" option always&nbsp;seems to work. However talking someone who is not computer knowledgeable through &nbsp;saving the invitation and attaching it to an e-mail is sometimes quite difficult.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Thanks for trying but what you suggest is the standard answers that have already been researched and dismissed.&nbsp; Please understand that without doing
<u>anything</u> to the computer or router it will suddenly start working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Cannot be on the computer I am trying to connect to since the error comes up before you even enter the 12 digit code.&nbsp; The error occurs at the beginning&nbsp;testing network capabilities. The&nbsp;exact verbiage of the error is "&nbsp;Cannot connect to the global Peer
 to Peer network" .</p>
<p>&nbsp;Everything else works. Even when you get the error you can still&nbsp;work with an invitation&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem was the internet connection I doubt that everything else works ok.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Is it possibly a timing error where Easy Connect is timing out before connecting to the peer to peer network and at other times if the network is not too busy it is making the connection?</p>

            <p>Hello, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>May I know which antivirus is installed on your computer?</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
Try allowing Windows Remote Assistance to communicate through a firewall.For more information, please refer to the following Microsoft article:
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Allow-Windows-Remote-Assistance-to-communicate-through-a-firewall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Allow-Windows-Remote-Assistance-to-communicate-through-a-firewall</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>If you have antivirus installed on your computer I would suggest you to check the firewall settings related to antivirus.</em><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> <br />
In order to remove the possible third party software conflicting issue, you may also try to disable the antivirus programs and firewalls, and then test the issue in Clean Boot.
<br />
For more information, please refer to the following Microsoft article: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> <em>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem followStep 7 to reset the computer to start as usual.<br />
</em><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> <br />
The “Unable to connectto global peer to peer network” error message mostly can be caused due to the router cannot support the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP). I would like to suggest you contact the Router Support to confirm if this router supports PNRP
 and how to enable it. <br />

<h2>            Windows Media Center - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Can someone from Microsoft please explain the rationale behind the removal of Windows Media Center from Windows 10? &nbsp;This is a key component that I use each and everyday from Microsoft. &nbsp;Although no development has been done on this software in a number
 of years, the existing product is fabulous for what it does. &nbsp;It is my DVR that I use when watching cable television. &nbsp;I also have the ability to stream via Media Center and watch videos that have been backed up to my personal network. &nbsp;This is my television
 source. &nbsp;Not everyone is cutting the cord - just look at cable subscription levels. &nbsp;Millions and millions of people still consume their video directly from their cable provider and use a DVR - Windows Media center puts the cable provided DVRs to shame. &nbsp;I
 have a Ceton infinitv 4 which provides me with the ability to watch or record up to 4 digital cable channels at once. &nbsp;I use a Ceton echo as an extender in my bedroom and an Xbox 360 in the basement to stream live and recorded television - my personal whole
 house DVR, without the monthly rent to Comcast or other issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reconsider the inclusion of windows media center when you launch windows 10. &nbsp;Otherwise I will remain a fragmented user of Windows 7.</p>

            <p>They would have to pay licensing fees to Dolby for many of the technologies that goes into building Media Center. Even if users don't need it, they have to pay a fee. Persons are consuming their media in other ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

            <p>Me too.&nbsp; I need WMC to tune over the air TV for watching later.</p>
<p>I suspect that the answer:&nbsp; "They would have to pay licensing fees to Dolby for many of the technologies that goes into building Media Center. Even if users don't need it, they have to pay a fee. Persons are consuming their media in other ways."&nbsp; Is the
 real answer but why Microsoft would use this cop-out is poor indeed!&nbsp; I guess we will have to find some third party to provide a feature Microsoft has withdrawn yet again, sad to say.&nbsp; DVD playback...What a joke when you say: "...media in other ways"&nbsp; It won't
 wash.</p>

            I agree. Shame on Microsoft for dropping media centre. I will not be upgrading to windows 10 or advising or providing support for the os. Microsoft do not realize how many people use this application as most who do, do not 'send information to microsoft'.
 Please realize that you are ditching a lot of your early adopters by refusing to bring media centre to windows 10 (even as a paid add on).&nbsp;

            <p>I'd glady pay the licensing fee portion in a paid add on app to windows 10. &nbsp;Much like they did with windows 8 - a $10 add on, limits the number of people that have it, plus lowers the royalties that microsoft would have to pay. &nbsp;Why not do a similar thing
 with windows 10 - especially since we know that it was working in early pre-release versions of windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I must express my frustration with Microsoft's decision and I hope that they reconsider, given the fact that there isn't truly a comparable app out there that would allow me to use my existing infrastructure.</p>

            <p>I can understand your frustration. &nbsp;It would be nice to see Microsoft include some kind of native media sharing utility (or include an app), even if it isn't Media Center and even if it requires a subscription fee, but I agree that when you've been accustomed
 to a product (especially one that has been part of the Windows line for so long), it's difficult to make this transition. &nbsp;PVR setup with WMC was always pretty simple, so it was a great, easy solution for folks that needed that capability. &nbsp;So cool to have
 it built right in to Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to be a Media Center user for my home PVR setup as well, but once I discovered alternative programs like Plex and Kodi (formerly known as XBMC), Media Center almost never got used again... &nbsp;There are some excellent PVR and media sharing utilities
 available now and most of them are either free or reasonably priced (and are not difficult to setup), so I can understand if Microsoft's approach is to let other vendors do what they do best, instead of focusing a lot of resources into a product that is not
 their native objective. &nbsp;I honestly don't know what's involved in maintaining Media Center for Microsoft, but I presume they've done a fair amount of research to see how heavily it's being used and is probably why they're dropping it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For media sharing I personally love Plex. &nbsp;It is so easy to use, so easy to set up, plays virtually any file you throw at it, pulls down subtitles for movies, auto-attaches movies trailers to your saved movies, includes lots of free channel apps (like YouTube,
 Crackle, etc.) and just works perfectly. &nbsp;It's also free - for the basic in-home utility. &nbsp;To add some extra zing to streaming options, there is a very modestly-priced subscription version that is, truly, worth its price (and more - because it works awesome).
 &nbsp;You can easily stream media ANYWHERE. &nbsp;I watch my home movies from my phone... My wife watches from her tablet, and you can even share access with friends. &nbsp;It's just the coolest program. &nbsp;The only drawback is it's not a PVR and doesn't stream Netflix or
 Hulu or play DVD's. &nbsp;That hasn't been an issue for me because my TV is a SMART TV and I just flip to it when I want to use those services. &nbsp;For PVR needs and DVD playing, Kodi is quite capable.... and free. &nbsp;There are others too, but these are the two I'm
 savvy with and fond of. &nbsp;They also have apps on most streaming devices and SMART TV's so they're worth taking a look at.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My father-in-law is a heavy Media Center user and I know he'll be disappointed that it's not included in the upgrade. &nbsp;I do know others that use it quite a bit also... and, even though I hardly use it anymore, it does handle Netflix still, so I do switch
 to it for that sometimes. &nbsp;It would be nice to see them continue supporting it for a while, but what are ya gonna do? &nbsp;I really like the app idea. &nbsp;Microsoft should really consider that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck with your setup.</p>

            <p>Thank You for your very considered response!&nbsp; I will look into all you suggested.&nbsp; You state the problem exactly as I see it.&nbsp; Microsoft is not as loyal to its long time customers as we are to them.&nbsp; It seems strange that they don't get it.&nbsp; I thought XP
 with media center was great and many of my older (and poorer) friends will not update.&nbsp; Apparently we -they - don't count because we don't bring "new money" to the table.&nbsp; Microsoft would be wise to appreciate loyalty and reputation over the almighty dollar.&nbsp;
 I'm sorry I cant really buy that:&nbsp; "...&nbsp;but I presume they've done a fair amount of research to see how heavily it's being used and is probably why they're dropping it.""&nbsp; I think you assume too much...&nbsp; It's just MONEY.</p>

            <p>All I have to say is.....</p>
<p>Microsoft is no different than&nbsp;any other greedy corporation. It's always about profit and money and never about the customer. The way&nbsp;businesses&nbsp;see&nbsp;people is to replace them with a percentage sign. If you are in a lower percentage category, (whether they
 have the true numbers or not), you get the boot. We are all just numbers in the name of money, loyalty has no place in business these days. There are so many people in the world that are willing to lay down and take the abuse, No one cares anymore, so what
 if a few people get hurt, they can be replaced. Don't think for a second that your concerns are being considered. If only a few million people would post their concerns here and let Microsoft know they care, then and only then would they consider listening.
 people need to speak up instead of buying into the **** these big companies hand out. Slap them in the face, through cold water on them, harass them everyday. Make them listen by speaking out and pounding down their doors. If that doesn't work, stop buying
 there product, hit them where it hurts, there bottom line. No money, no business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the early 90's, I started building my own PC's, at that time the old 386's were the hype.&nbsp;I loved computers and Windows was the big OS and though it had problems, it was popular and there were tons of programs out there to try and play with. Right
 around 2001 I looked at the MAC systems that were coming out and the software was amazing. After careful consideration I decided to give Apple a try in 2003. I loved their system and eventually bought another, larger 24" when the release of Tiger came out,
 and abandoned Windows all together. I used that system and updated the OS a couple of times until the system became to old, about 6 years. With Apple, you pay a lot to get a decent unit and I started looking at the Mac Pro. OMG!!! The price was so outrageous,
 over 3 grand, I don't think so! So again I was at a turning point, what was going to best fit my needs? I did research and talked to "sales people" about the things they liked about the systems they sold. After about 15-20 discussions, one person mentioned
 the Media Center. I had never heard of it, didn't know a thing about it, so I dug for answers. I was very impressed, and&nbsp;still wonder why Microsoft didn't pursue advertising this as part of their system. I still talk to people that have no Idea what the Media
 Center is or what it can do. After I discovered it, I built a system to try it out and WOW! I was impressed! LOVED IT! It now being around 2009 and Windows 7 was being advertised, but never really made a Media Center a selling point. I built an HTPC system
 just for the use of the Media Center and&nbsp;faithfully use it everyday, not that Microsoft really cares. I bought a few extenders and completed a 1qig network system needed to support the tuners and extenders I purchased. Needless to say, I have quit a bit invested
 in this one single product, again, Microsoft doesn't give a **** because they don't make the profits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all that being said, I think a few thing that Microsoft should look at is their consumer advertising team. I truly believe that if they had marketed&nbsp;Windows7 with an emphasis on Media Center, they could have had an&nbsp;advantage they&nbsp;underplayed and discarded.
 If people really knew what the Media Center is and what it can do, it would have been a game changer. The cable companies would be forced to rethink their marketing strategies and price points. Microsoft could have packaged different systems with tuners, cable
 cards, extenders and made a huge killing. But as we all know, they probably got a huge donation from the cable companies not to advertise the Media Center. If Microsoft had advertised, the cable companies would have been in serious trouble. I have personally
 saved thousands using&nbsp;Media Center by not having the high cost of cable subscriptions and&nbsp;DVR cost. It's enough that the system I built has paid for itself many times over. I am

            <p>I think from Microsoft's point of view they already considered Media Center to be a failure before Windows 7 ever even came into existence, and thus why it was simply included in Windows 7 as a free give-me. &nbsp;And by the time Windows 8 came along, it couldn't
 even justify that, so became a low-price add-on to try to help offset some of the royalty costs Microsoft still had to cover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, Media Center didn't come into existence with Windows 7. &nbsp;It came into existence with Windows XP Media Center Edition. &nbsp;When Microsoft acquired the software for Media Center, they actually built a whole entire edition of Windows around it - and
 marketed it as such. &nbsp;And where you say they "could have packaged different systems...and made a huge killing," that's exactly how they sold it - but the "huge killing" never happened. &nbsp;When you acquired Windows XP MCE, you did so by buying a package that
 included hardware as well as the software. &nbsp;Still, despite substantial marketing it never developed more than a niche following - and in the corporate world that means it was never anything but a failure from the day it was born.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the XP MCE days, people commonly berated the whole idea and laughed at the mere notion of using their computer to watch TV. &nbsp;And before XP MCE, back in the days of the cow pattern boxes, Gateway computers introduced a whole line of systems with some
 pretty remarkable TV and DVR capabilities. &nbsp;And those also failed miserably for the same reason - people simply thought it was stupid to use a computer to watch TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, for once, it seems Microsoft was actually ahead of the curve. &nbsp;They introduced something that was actually a good thing, but they introduced it before the public had any interest in it. &nbsp;And now, there are simply too many other players in the field
 to really compete effectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And despite the fact that I have used Media Center since it came out (and even had one of those Gateway computers before that), I really can't fault Microsoft on the decision to get rid of it. &nbsp;I would love it if it didn't go away, but I'm not going to refuse
 to move on just because I'll be losing it in the process.</p>

                    <p>I just installed Windows 8. I'm an American living in the UAE. I bought a version locally. The " and @ are now reversed on my keyboard. I have gone in to keyboard settings in the control panel and specified I want it to use a US keyboard. Still there is
 the problem. Why is this happening? Why does Windows 8 not recognize I have a US keyboard plugged in? I'm using a Raver keyboard bought in the States, yes, I updated firmware and drivers on that as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very aggravating to have to relearn to type because I updated Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other than that, Windows 8 is great.</p>

<h2>            Mobile Hotspot setup problem on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had my mobile spot running as usual, and I was able to connect my IPhone and IPad to the internet, through the Laptop. I was doing so, by clicking the "Mobile Hotspot" appearing in the available networks pan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, it stopped working, and keeps trying forever! When I was trying to access the "Mobile Hotspot" through the "Settings", it hangs, and the screen freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened after an a Windows update!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p />

<p>Judging by the traffic in this forum, a lot of people have had problems with Mobile Hotspots and Internet Connection Sharing since the November 2017 updates. Some people have had success by resetting their Windows Firewall settings (particularly if there's
 a related spike in CPU load).</p>

            The answer is indefinitely. 
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            Hi, Pongsak,
<br />no one can say will or not Microsoft stop using illegally upgraded Windows 10. 
<br />It made enhanced detection of KMS activation in 1803, so both variants seems me possible.

<h2>            UNABLE TO BIND BASE DN WHEN USE DOMAIN</h2>
                    Hi there, <br />
I am having trouble binding the BASE DN to the Domain for my application to work.
<br />
<br />
When I use an OU inside then the binding works.<br />
Example : OU=SALES,DC=NEW,DC=WORLD,DC=ORDER<br />
<br />
But What I want is for it to bind to the DC which is<br />
<br />
<b>DC=NEW,DC=WORLD,DC=ORDER<br />
<br />
</b>Because the users are scattered everywhere in the AD and this is a large organization with thousands of users, hence I do not want to specifically bind to the OU<b>,
</b>otherwise it will only query users within that OU. I want the query to search the entire AD.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Music Files Disappeared After Win10 Installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cabass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music Files Disappeared After Win10 Installation</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded from Win 7 to Windows 10 in early September and thought all of my files moved into their new places with the upgrade. It's now December 9 and I've just discovered (when looking for my Christmas music playlist) that more than half of my music files
 are gone. The songs show up as missing files in my iTunes Library, but cannot be located anywhere on my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only music that survived the upgrade were files that were purchased through iTunes or Amazon. The music that I had uploaded from CDs through the years, which were stored in the previous "My Music" folder in Documents, are simply gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used iTunes for many years when listening with my iPhone, but had always kept Microsoft Music Player as my default music player on my laptop. With a Microsoft OS, I thought keeping them in a MS folder was the safest place to store the files. Wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched throughout my hard drive for any sign of the missing files to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any hope for digging out these missing files?</p>

            <p>Why aren't we given a warning that the files will be deleted? A lot of people are losing a lot of very precious files and MS doesn't appear to care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you clarify whether ALL files from ALL folders are retained in Windows.old? We're getting conflicting information from the Support Engineers on this site. For example, we don't all keep our files in My Documents/My Pictures/My Music and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of us have very good reasons to keep them in different folders on our PCs. Will the upgrade preserve these files? If not, why are the Support Engineers telling people ALL their files will be retained?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we do two upgrades in a row are all the files from before the first upgrade in any folder still in Windows.old? If not, why are you telling people BEFORE they upgrade that ALL their files will be retained?</p>

    <title>Typing repeat characters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen kesten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Typing repeat characters</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I've noticed that when keyboarding repeat letters or numbers I need to pause after typing the first. Otherwise, the second (and subsequent same characters) won't show up. For example, letter shows up as leter; happy as hapy; 2000 as 20. Words like
 "accidentally" and "committee"&nbsp;are particularly frustrating. Obviously, this slows down typing sped considerably.&nbsp;(That's speed by the way).&nbsp;I recently had an automatic update installed. Could it be that this is actually a new Microsoft feature meant to prevent
 accidentally typing two (or more) of the same characters when only one is intended? If so, it's a remarkably stupid idea.</p>
<p>Has anyone else had this problem? Is there a fix? Thanks in advance.</p>

<h3> moobles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Acer Aspire E1-570 laptop &#47; Issue&#58; specific keyboard letters delay or freeze up, requiring reboot</h2>
                    <p>Purchased approximately 2 years ago.&nbsp; Came with Win 8.1 installed, I later updated to Win 10.&nbsp; I've always had this problem, although there have been times where it's been better than others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that specific keys on the keyboard either delay functioning&nbsp;or freeze up completely, currently requiring a reboot every time I want to use the laptop.&nbsp; The keys are 1, 3, -, q, t, u, p, j, &amp; the right arrow key.&nbsp; e.g. he ick brown fox med
 over he lazy dog. Generally, the longer the laptop is operating the better the problem becomes.&nbsp; However, it's just frozen&nbsp;as I'm typing this post and I've had to&nbsp;have to copy and paste to complete&nbsp;this sentence.&nbsp; And now the problem keys have come back into
 function!!&nbsp; Completely random and time-consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware obviously does work, which&nbsp;leaves me believing it must be some kind of software/program/driver issue, so I've never attempted contacting the company I got the laptop from and I think I'm out of time for that option now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought when I upgraded to Win 10 the problem might be resolved, but apparently not.&nbsp; If I awake the laptop from 'sleep' it can often take 5+ minutes for the problem keys to function.&nbsp; If it's a complete freeze, reboot and time for the problem keys to
 function can be 10 mins+.&nbsp; The time mounts up and is extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since installing Win 10 anniversary upgrade I now also have the problem of Quick Access not responding&nbsp;but I'm following another thread over this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reviewed a couple of similar threads but there doesn't seem to be a definitive answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please assist?&nbsp; I'm no techie but I can't understand why Microsoft upgrades don't ever resolve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<span>Hi Moobles,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><strong>Windows 10 Anniversary Update</strong> has the latest drivers and hardware installed on your PC. The reason you are experiencing freezing and misbehavior activities after the update is because of hardware or driver compatibility.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Firstly, thanks for your input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Acer and the response was as follows: 'Regarding your query, the issue seems to be with the recent updates.'&nbsp; [I'm not so sure about this because I've ALWAYS had the problem since purchase from new, Win 8.1 through&nbsp;Win10 &amp; Win10 Anniversary.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Please follow the instructions given below for performing a power drain: 1. Power off the computer and unplug the power cord.&nbsp; 2. Disconnect all external devices.&nbsp; 3. Remove the battery.&nbsp; 4. Press and hold the power button for 10 to 15 seconds.&nbsp; 5. Plug
 the power cord into the computer and press the power button.&nbsp; 6.&nbsp;Check the front panel LEDs (lights) on the bezel (front face) or optical drive and check if you hear the internal fan.&nbsp; 7. If computer boots up, then power off the computer.&nbsp; 8. Reconnect any
 external devices.&nbsp; 9. Restart the computer.&nbsp; This could fix the issue, if the issue persists you can send the unit for a repair.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this yesterday and up to now I have to say it seems to have worked.&nbsp; No freezing on the keys and they worked immediately.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've no idea how the above process works, but&nbsp;I really hope this has finally resolved this longstanding issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(As an aside, following issues resulting from&nbsp;the Win 10 Anniversary edition update,&nbsp;I appear to have resolved&nbsp;a problem&nbsp;with the Windows Start Search Options bar not working.&nbsp; Now all I need to do fix is my Quick Access not responding&nbsp;problem - I have to
 say, I've never experienced issues like I have with&nbsp;Win10 and Microsoft really needs to get to grips with them fast.)</p>

<br />If not checked, check it and click the lock to make the changes.

            Remove it again then install the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>
<br />
<br />File a bug report so the engineers are aware of the problem.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />NOTE: We’re letting you know that support for Skype version 7 will end on November 1, 2018 on desktop devices and November 15 on mobile and tablet devices. When support ends, we’ll begin requiring updates to version 8. Although you may be able to use older versions for a little while longer.
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. Since September 2018, we started seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.
