            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span><br />
I would suggest you to download and install the latest printer drivers from the following link and check if it helps:<br />
Download the driver from the Lexmark site:<br />
<a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_X2500&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_X2500&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#2</a></span></p>
<p><b><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Method 2:</span></b><span><br />
There are no drivers available for windows 7 but I would suggest you<span>&nbsp;
</span>to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it works fine or not.<br />
I would suggest you to download the drivers for windows vista and then try to install it in Windows 7 by choosing the compatibility level:<br />

            Sorry, Gevona.  I was confused by your using the word "crop" which normally means to cut a video. I see now you want video capture instead.
<br />
<br /> I hope i can continue to help you find the tool that works best and at the same time redeem the rating you gave me.  As I said I continue to help until the problem is solved, as I've done now for 10 years for nearly 100,000 consumers.  
<br />
<br />See this video capture tool built into Windows 10 that gamers use to capture clips of their games:  <a href="https://gizmodo.com/windows-10-is-hiding-a-great-video-capture-tool-1719196149" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gizmodo.com/windows-10-is-hiding-a-grea...</a>

<p>My bad on misusing 'crop' for this instance. That still doesn't help. I recorded a video for a school project, there are some moments in the video that a group member is laughing and I would like those scenes to be taken out. Most of them are like 5 seconds
 long. How do you think I go about doing that on this app??? Or is there another app you would suggest for me to use??</p>

            Was Game DVR refusing to record from  your video?  It is meant to record from any program but only asks you to say it's a game first.  This explains it better and also references some 3rd party tools which is where we have to go next:  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/how-to-video-screen-capture-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/how-to-video...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then there are free third party apps here:

    <title>Windows account is not linked to Family safety - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maxal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows account is not linked to Family safety</h2>
                    <p>I had Family safety set up on multiple computers (all Windows 8.1) for my kids. However, recently I got a message that I need to link them to device once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the problem. I invited my kids to my "Family", they accepted invitation, and now their Live Account appear in the list of my Family Safety accounts. However, the message says "No device to show yet".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the accounts on my computers, reset their accounts as "Child accounts". And they always login with Microsoft Live account, not local computer account. However, when I went to Family Safety web site, their activity is reported under "Local Account"
 per each device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely inconvenient. I used to have all those accounts linked together, set the together, monitor them together. Now I don't see how it can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Didn't fine "Family safety" in product lookup anywhere. Have to post it under something else.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My kids all have Microsoft Accounts, but when I log into family safety, it says that they don't have any devices associated with their account. Been trying to add them, get them working, etc. and they just keep showing up as individual local accounts.</p>

            Thank you for responding.&nbsp; However, your response does not help as your advice is not even correct.&nbsp; It does not even agree with the article you told me to look at.&nbsp;&nbsp; Family safety does not function on standard user accounts.&nbsp;&nbsp; The account has to be changed
 from a standard user to a child account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please if you are trying to help, please know your product.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even if I was to try giving my children new child accounts they would loose everything that they have stored on their accounts already.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you take a
 look at the other threads you will see that family safety is only working on local accounts.&nbsp; It is not working with the "roaming" account that everyone is using Windows 8 for.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other thread a Micorosft support person told us that Microsoft Family

            <p>Let me restate the problem as it occurs on my kid's Windows 8.1 laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Logged into my kid's laptop using my microsoft (admin) account.</li><li>Created a microsoft (child) account on the laptop and asked my kid to logon.</li><li>The account shows up on the family safety website with "no devices to show yet."</li><li>I logged on the laptop (using my microsoft admin account) and checked account settings.</li><li>My kid's account was now listed as a standard account.</li><li>I changed the kid's account back to a child account.</li><li>My kid logged into the laptop with his microsoft (child) account.</li><li>Two accounts with my kid's name (one local and the other a microsoft account) now show up on the family safety website.
</li><li>The local account on the family safety website has the laptop name next to it and lets me set restrictions on the microsoft (child) account on the laptop.</li><li>The original microsoft (child) account on the family safety website still has "no devices to show yet."</li><li>I delete both accounts on the website and the microsoft child account on the laptop and start over from step 1.</li><li>steps 2 - 10 repeats.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 7 starter to 10 on different PC</h2>
                    I have an old netbook that came with Windows 7 starter but never was powerful enough to run it well. I wiped the HD and installed Linux. I now have a recycled Dell desktop. Can I transfer the license from the netbook to the desktop and upgrade to 10?

            <p>No, you can't. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>

<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like&nbsp;you need to update iastor.sys :<br />
<br />
iastor.sys = Intel Matrix Storage Manager driver - See System/Motherboard Maker and the chipset maker.
<br />
This driver could have been driven to fault by other programs such as Symantec/Norton.<br />
<br />
This driver is extremely difficult to install so you need the System Maker or&nbsp;Motherboard&nbsp;Maker's&nbsp;(for custom<br />
built systems) help though you might also ask in the their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
Also check the Intel Downloads AFTER checking with the System/Motherboard Maker..<br />
<br />
Intel Downloads<br />
<a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://downloadcenter.intel.com/</span></a><br />
<br />
Intel Matrix Storage Manager - be sure to check for DATE and set for version of Windows and chipset<br />

Two primary causes of this blue screen are&nbsp;video drivers and BIOS - Check with System Maker's<br />
Site for Display Adapter (Video) and BIOS and then Device Maker's site for latest Video. It can be<br />
other drivers so check while there. Turn OFF auto-driver installation as those are older and if<br />
Windows Updates suggests a driver just HIDE it. Antivirus is another possibility.<br />
<br />

<strong>BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates that an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates that a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates that a memory access violation occurred.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p>If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.
</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</li></ul>
<p>If the bug check message lists a driver by name , disable or remove that driver. Also, disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the system by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. You can disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. You should also run
 hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows
 installation that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files
 that contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation.</p>
<p>You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version</p>

This is my generic bluescreen troubleshooter :<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info<br />
that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error<br />
information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 installations trouble - Hard drive not detected</h2>
                    I'm trying to install windows 8.1 onto a new hard drive but when I get a little bit through the process and it says to pick a drive to install to there isn't one. I have a samsung&nbsp;hd642jj hard drive in it but it can't detect it. Then it says I need to
 get drivers for it but I don't know how to do that. Can someone please help me figure this out?

    <title>Restart doesn&#39;t work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diane reiner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restart doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I cannot use the restart function, and have to literally shut down my computer at the tower. Bear with me please, I have limited knowledge of the computer but can find my way around pretty good. When I click on the&nbsp;restart button, it will go into the "shutting
 down" phase. But, that's all it does.The little green circle just keeps&nbsp;going&nbsp;round and round. I then have to reach down and shut off the computer from the tower. When I push it again it will go through the usual motions, then it will say "windows did not
 shut down normally" and then it tells me I can choose to start it in one of several modes (safe, etc.) It all began when I went to restart the computer. I never shut it down at the tower, but I've had to because it doesn't work with the restart button. I thank
 you for your help in advance. Diane Reiner</p>

            <p>Hi <strong>Diane Reiner</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like you are unable to reboot the computer normally. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

1. Keep your device connected.<br />
2. From the desktop, go to Start &gt; Start Search.<br />
3. Enter "Device Manager" or "devmgmt.msc" to launch the Device Manager window<br />
4. Look under the "Network adapters" node for "Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter". If this is not present, skip to step 5. Otherwise, right-click "Microsoft Windows Mobile Remote Adapter" and choose to "Uninstall"<br />
5. Look under the "Mobile Devices" node for "Microsoft USB Sync". If this is not present, skip to step 6. Otherwise, right-click "Microsoft USB Sync" and choose to "Uninstall"<br />

<h2>            Disc not being read</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought an xbox one s, and it doesn't seem to be reading discs. It doesn't happen every time, but sometime I need to turn off the console multiple times to get it to read them. It doesn't give me an error, it just doesn't read them. I put in Halo 5,
 titanfall, resident evil 4, and it doesn't start them up at all. I tried resetting the system completely and a hard reboot by holding the power button but the problem seems to still persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried taking it to best buy for an exchange, since I've only had the system for a few days but they refused to do an exchange since its not a problem that always happens. They tried loading in discs and they got one to work themselves and then told me
 they fixed it and sent me packing.</p>
<p>I'm just unsure what to do, since my OG xbox one never, and isnt having these issues and could use some help.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The problem is that you are trying to play several games that are 360 disc based on your xbox one and that are not part of the backward compatibility list. For example RE 4 has a new version for xbox one and you can't use the xbox 360 disc to play it (it
 will not read the disc at all) </p>
<p>As for the rest of your disc based games (that are part of the bc list) check if they are scratched or damaged in the surface. There is no reason for a new console's disc driver to have problems in reading discs other than those caused by the damaged or
 unknown disc games &nbsp; </p>

<p>If the discs are for XBOX One just try holding the disc a little when you put it in. &nbsp;Let the console tug it then let go. &nbsp;This makes sure the disc sits fully back in the drive. &nbsp;Some drives seemed to not put the disc in the right place.</p>

<p>Are you using an external HDD? If you are, than it could be the HDD failing and it would do the same thing which is not load.</p>
<p>The other thing would be is to clear persistent storage on the blu ray to see if that works. It is in the blu ray settings.</p>

<p>Thank you all for the responses.</p>
<p>To the first post, I am not sure what you're talking about, since the only discs i am using is xbox one discs. I don't own a 360 or any games anymore, so titanfall and resident evil 4 are the xbox one versions. &nbsp;Its not reading any xbox one games, sunset
 overdrive, assassins creed syndicate, DOOM, rare replay, etc. I tried them all, and they arent being read.
</p>
<p>I did get an external hard drive, buts thats not the issue since i tried unplugging it and using internal to load up halo 5 but it still didn't work that way either.</p>
<p>I will try clearing persistent storage though and holding the disc, but yeah i'm not really sure what to do.

<h2>            After upgrading to Windows 10, my old Camera app is a blank icon on my taskbar that does nothing.</h2>
                    The old Windows 8 Metro app was pinned to my taskbar. Now that I've upgraded to Windows 10, there's just a blank space where the app used to sit. I can right-click it and select the unpin option, but the blank space just stays there. If I actually ry to
 open the app, nothing happens. How do I get rid of this useless little blank space on my taskbar?&nbsp;

<h3> travisroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sidewinder X6&#58; Macro Editing &#59; Insert text block&#47;paste from file</h2>
                    Other than some hardware malfunction on my keyboard (I use the heck out of it all the time as I game alot and work from it as well) I love this product. I haven't really used any of the non preset macro functions before, but seeing as i just got a promotion
 at my job I need to start using it as it will lower the time it takes me to get from customer to customer. I only know how to describe it one way, on Mac OS X Lion, there's something called text substitution. Basically, when sending confirmations to my customers
 all I type is "resolved", and it inputs about two paragraphs of text immediately. I found a semi-work around with this keyboard, but the only thing is, I have to manually type it into the macro add/edit menu, and then I risk having a typing error on my part,
 and have the limitation of there being 10MS between each character stroke. Is there a way to set this default to 0MS? If not is there a way to paste from file, where (if i have 22 macros, i can have 22 pre determined messages) it will paste from memory, or
 paste from associated file?&nbsp;
<div>Please keep in mind I'm new to the macro thing, and know this is a "amateur" version of macro that only requires text input.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am not going to use it on a mac, all drivers up to date, software is up to date (intellitype and otherwise). Windows 7 64Bit SP1, using primarily with office/outlook.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any response as to my issue would be great. And if anyone knows if (on the offchance that it might be a software problem) there is any known issue with buttons not responding even after uninstall/reinstall of driver/software as well as attempting on another
 computer?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anything you got will work for me. Thanks,</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 problems with audio from docking station &#40;Dell D620 with D port replicator&#41;</h2>
                    Having upgraded to win 10 a few months ago and sorted a few minor problems all seemed well until I put family history software on, it caused a few problems which ended up in me doing a restore presumably with the updated win 10, since this restore I have
 no sound from the speakers on my docking station (it worked with win 10 before) I have searched forums and reinstalled audio drivers with no success. Is there a way of reverting back to the earlier version of win 10 ... failing this I will have no option but
 to reformat my HDD and put win 7 back on as I know that works !! just wanting to try and avoid starting again from the bottom. Other posts suggest a problem with the dock or connections ... this is all fine as another computer works fine on the same dock.
 Prior to the restore and old win 7 folder was on my C drive, this has now gone ... I accept I was foolish in not backing this folder up, but took the machines text (restore without loosing files) at face value....mistake !!

            Thank You for the advice, I have tried the suggested remidies with no joy, when attempting to update the driver it comes up with a pop up saying the best driver for my device is already installed ... I tried installing anyway but it didnt work, a friend
 said he thought my system was not compatible with windows 10, however it did work with win 10 until I restored the system back to "base" as it were. My son has offered me a Mac and I have wasted so many hours with microsoft issues I am very tempted ... but
 dont want to start and learn how to drive a new operating system, it's so frustrating !!<br />

    <title>Windows Hello not working on Surface Pro 4. Facial recognition fails, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hbgd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello not working on Surface Pro 4. Facial recognition fails, PIN fails. Camera and PIN work once logged in.</h2>
                    <p>I've seen this come up a lot in different varieties - people suggesting to start/stop Surface DTX and do multiple reboots, people suggesting there's a TPM issue. But my camera is working, and my PIN is valid once logged in, so I'm not sure what this issue
 is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue comes in 3 forms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When activating Windows Hello, the camera recognition DOES WORK and validates my face. It starts spooling as it says Hello and shows my name as if it's about to log-in as it would have in the past, but then craps out at the last moment and displays "Your
 credentials could not be verified."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) It then switches to the PIN. When entering the PIN, it says "The user name or password is incorrect."</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Then, similar to everyone else, under "Sign-in Options" it says "Windows Hello is preventing some options from being shown."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've validated my account (under "Your Info"). I've set and reset my PIN. My PIN DOES work once I'm actually logged it (because when I go to change it and enter the old PIN, it accepts it fine). I've removed facial recognition and readded it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The amount of time I've had to spend on this is already super frustrating. Is it TPM? Is it DTX? Is it something else if the camera is actually working? Should I just take it to a Microsoft store and since it's under warranty say give me a new one? What
 would you do?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Device Manager -&gt; Surface Camera Windows Hello -&gt; Driver -&gt; Roll Back Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine was dated as 2017.07.21 (?). After rolling back, it is 2016-03-11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to Sign-in Options, Windows Hello -&gt; Face Recognition is available now.</p>

<p>Alright, I was able to get Windows Hello to function normally again. These are the steps that worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to: Settings App &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in Options&gt;</li><li>Click "remove" under Face Recognition</li><li>Click "remove" under PIN</li><li>Now once everything is removed, go back and re-add everything.</li><li>Click "add" under PIN and recreate your PIN</li><li>Click "setup" under Face Recognition and retrain it for your face</li></ol>
<p>Now logs in fine with either my face or with pin. We'll see how long it lasts.<br />

            <div>Hi DaraJean,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This&nbsp;error appears&nbsp;because of .NET Framework version, installed in your computer and that is the reason why a component application, was unhandled exception.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> Download and install the latest version of .NET Framework on your computer to fix the issue.</div>
<div>Visit <span><strong>Microsoft download Center </strong>to do the same:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</strong></span></a></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong></span><span><span>Let’s put the computer in clean boot state and check if any third-party program
 is causing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications
 or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Here’s&nbsp;an article you may refer to, for steps with reference to the same.</span></p>

                    <span>
<p><strong><span>Okay, so my parents installed Norton on our computer about 3 months ago. Since we didn't like it, we took
 it off. Ran the tool from Symantec to fully get rid of it. Now we can't connect to download.microsoft.com. This has been going on for 3 months. And yesterday, we went out and got the Home Premium upgrade of Windows 7, and formatted the hard drive while putting
 it on (so we can solve the connectivity problem). It still doesn't connect, and we get this message: "The remote device or resource won't accept the connection" and "The device or resource (download.microsoft.com) is not set up to accept connections on port
 "The World Wide Web Service (HTTP)"". Now i know for a FACT that it isn't problems with our router (netgear) or modem. We're on a wireless connection that doesn't have any problem connecting to anything else. Iv'e tried every solution, from checking/resetting
 internet settings, trying connection on different browsers, trying to connect on safe mode, trying the Fix It thing (which, i can't download or use because i can't connect to DOWNLOAD.MICROSOFT.COM), scanning for viruses, and as i said before, formatting the
 hard drive. NOTHING works. Hopefully i can get a solution here, because i even called Comcast and they said that it's not a problem with our internet connection.</span></strong></p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>When using Narrator touch, there are a couple of known ways where the Caps Lock can get out of sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you use the touch keyboard, you can toggle the CAPS key to be on for all typing by tapping the CAPS key twice.<span>&nbsp;
</span>However, if you close the touch keyboard without toggling the CAPS Lock off on the touch keyboard (by again tapping the CAPS key twice), the keyboard CAPS will be left on.
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In another example, if you are switching back and forth between the touch keyboard and a physical keyboard, be aware that the CAPS
 state on the touch keyboard will not update to keep in sync with the physical keyboard.<span>&nbsp;
</span>So if the Caps Lock for the touch keyboard is turned ON, and then you switch the Caps Lock OFF on the physical keyboard, the touch keyboard will still consider the Caps Lock to be ON.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has also been observed that the Caps Key can become stuck ON if you very quickly toggle the Caps Key on and then back off using
 the touch keyboard.<span>&nbsp; </span>In this case, Narrator will read the keyboard as lower case characters, and you’ll be unaware that you’re typing in all caps.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To avoid this, pause slightly between toggling the Caps Lock on and off again using the touch keyboard.</p>

            <p>Not to contradict anyone, but one method sure to work is to prevent a particular file from timing out. Replace your</p>
<p>
</p><p>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live\Services\Cache\Config.xml</p>
<p>
</p><p>(just insert the path into your address bar - conventional access is hidden by default)</p>
<p>
</p><p>with the file contained in this archive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>config2021.zip</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the weather gadget does not work, your config.xml file has timed out or is missing. This keeps happening since February 2015, because the template file</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://gadgets.live.com/configW7.xml</p>
<p>
</p><p>was taken offline. In order to automatically create/recreate config.xml (which used to be done on startup), the gadget is depending on the presence of configW7.xml, at least under Temporary Internet Files. With the source file gone and no copy left in the
 IE cache, manual measures have to be taken to keep config.xml from getting more than 3 days old, equalling "no file available = case 404" to the gadget. The above archive "config2021.zip" contains a config.xml with its "date modified" set to January 1, 2021,
 so the timeout won't occur before January 4, 2021. That preparation was made using the tool</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.softwareok.com/?seite=Microsoft/NewFileTime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NewFileTime</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>just in case you'd like to modify an existing file yourself. The replacement/modification of config.xml will take 1-2 minutes to take effect and remove the display of "Cannot connect to service". Note: That same effect can be produced by simply opening an
 outdated config.xml in notepad (right click - "edit") and saving without any changes (i.e. setting the "date modified" to present). It's just not going to last too long then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those running Windows Vista, that has</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://gadgets.live.com/config.xml</p>
<p>
</p><p>gotten switched off, the file to replace/modify is exactly the same. You can use the one provided here. While the (mal-)functional behavior of the gadgets differs, those files are identical content- and pathwise.</p>

<div>I kind of agree with you. The checkbox is now so visible that it does not make sense to hide a file. Hidden files checkbox should be more hidden.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Even i, as an experienced user, have already deleted by mistake a system file, the file was not important but it makes it worse because windows 8 does not prompt you whether you want to send the file to the trash.</div>

<div>Please remove it.</div>

            <p>Sometimes virtual machine programs automatically recognize &nbsp;what os your trying to install.</p>
<p>I installed Windows 8 upgrade&nbsp;in Virtual Box &amp; VMware Workstation and both installed without Windows 7 in virtual machine. You see, virtual machine programs - when they know what you're trying to install, they initialize the settings for you so you don't
 need a previous version of Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just in-case it doesn't work, you can get a <strong>GENUINE WINDOWS 8 PRO OEM&nbsp;SYSTEM BUILDER</strong>&nbsp;from online stores like Amazon.com.</p>

            <p>Hi Sameer,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>A parallel windows version can usually installed only if you have an older version of Windows. You can yet try inserting your disk and pointing to an empty NTFS drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now as far as buying Windows 8 is considered,</p>
<ol>
<li>If you want to buy an old Windows 8&nbsp;version(&nbsp;relatively)&nbsp;still in development, get Windows RT.</li><li>If you are a business professional( this is a little difficult to obtain), choose Windows 8 Enterprise.</li><li>If you are a student, you should Choose Windows 8 pro.</li><li>Else, choose Windows 8( not pro).</li></ol>
<p>If this does not solve your dilemma or you require further assistance, feel free to reply to this post.</p>
<p>Ashwin</p>
