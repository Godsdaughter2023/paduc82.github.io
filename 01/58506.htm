<h2>            Flashing Cursor Problem After Win 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I'm hoping someone can help. &nbsp;My cursor has been flashing busy abut 2 or 3 times a second constantly since I upgraded my OS to Windows 10. &nbsp;I have read over other peoples solutions (spooler, NVidia Streaming) but they do not seem to be the cause. &nbsp;I have
 run a Norton virus scan and have tried the Microsoft Office fix suggestion, but none of these have resolved the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone encountered the same issue since "upgrading" to Win 10 and, more importantly, found a solution? &nbsp;Thanks in advance for your reply.</p>

            I'm also having this same problem and tried the steps above. It did not detect any problems, but I still have flashing cursor issue as described by JCarson.RD 's initial post.

            <p>Since my Windows 10 upgrade, the flashing cursor starts every time I wake up my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that the flashing cursor coincided with a high level of activity by Windows Explorer when looking at the Task Manager. &nbsp;Since I use Google Chrome as my browser that seemed very odd. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do is several restarts of Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Sometimes I "End task" and then go to "File" and "run new task" = Explorer. &nbsp;Then "Restart" sometimes several more times and eventually the problem stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect there is an incompatibility with peripheral drivers and Windows 10 and I am going to download all new drivers, making sure they are Windows 10 compatible.</p>

            <p>Problem permanently solved. &nbsp;Downloading new drivers didn't help. &nbsp;Cursor is now flashing constantly and the restarts don't help either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP with Simple Pass - the fingerprint sign-on, etc. &nbsp;When I disabled that, the problem went away. &nbsp;I don't use Simple Pass so I uninstalled it.</p>

            I had the same problem after upgrading to Windows 10 and removing the HP Simple Pass fixed my problem. &nbsp; &nbsp;It also fixed a problem that I was having dragging windows across the screen and typing into small text windows.

            <p>Win10 upgrade &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the mouse cursor blinks constantly and refreshes some text boxes making it impossible to input text. I went to MSConfig/services and turned off all services and the cursor blinking stopped after turning on services by alphabetically order i have isolated
 the service that is causing the problem. Windows driver foundation-user-mode Driver Foundation... with that service off i do not have the problem... What is your solution? I found that it is only a problem on my profile, not the admin profile nor my wife's
 profile.&nbsp;</p>

            wow....okay....I had windows 10 already on my computer....but on sept 20th my 47th anniversary windows updated....I don't know what update it was....but....it was a lengthy one...anyway....low and behold when I got on it to see changes there weren't any
 because I already had windows 10....I noticed the blinking cursor...it drove me nuts...also at the bottom of my screen on the bar I have the aps for whatever is on and it was blinking too...also I couldn't enter anything into the address bar or lower a menu
 that would stay down.....so I went to search and had to hurry to put in ....blinking cursor after update.....I came across your fix.....I do have the sensor for your finger thing which I could care less about....never use...I thought okay...I did a scan ..which
 is a fluke by the way...of compatibility and sure enough it said....that the older program for the finger scan wasn't compatible with the new windows 10 update....so I went into device manager and didn't remove it...but disabled it....

            <p>Attempt 1) I had to wait to do the upgrade from Win8 to Win10 to the last minute. The first time I did the upgrade when it first was available my system crashed after trying to fix the flashing cursor and had to reinstall from scratch. Lucky I had backed
 up all my info before upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempt 2)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This attempt went better, as stated before backed up all my data 1st, this time all went well and had been using Win10 since EXCEPT: seems that when I used a USB device then the blinking would start again.</p>
<p>I tried to contact tech support but did not have the time to wait.</p>
<p>I went to msconfig and turned off all services and reboot and all was well.</p>
<p>I went to msconfig and sorted alphabetically and turned on 10 at a time.</p>
<p>When I found my blinking cursor problem I turned off 5 of the last 10 services I turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the System Config/Services/Windows Driver Foundation - User-mode driver framework was turned off the blinking cursor went away</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not notice any significant difference using my Win10 system, Then, Then, when I plugged in a USB device (Cell Phone, Backup Drive) the cursor would start blinking and I would have go back to the system config turn off all services and then go back
 and turn all back on with the&nbsp;Windows Driver Foundation - User-mode driver framework turned off and all was back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>No changes in hardware or software from attempt 1 to attempt 2</p>

<p>Yesterday I did reset all my rules in the firewall to standard to be sure that I did't make a mistake there, but this didn't help.</p>
<p>Later then i installed "Windows 7 Firewall Control"-GUI and this said that this packets should go to the Hostprocess for Windows Services (svchost), but there are some special rules for that can prevent other rules for this process, says the firewall itself
 when i try to make one.</p>
<p>On the other hand my friends with Win7 don't have such problems. So what is the problem here?</p>

            This was not a firewall issue. It turned out that my router (Siemens SL2-141-I with special firmware from a german provider Alice) blocked some initial packets and the rest was dropped by the firewall. My workaround for now is to use my router as DSL-modem
 and initiate a pppoe-connection.

    <title>Memory Management BSOD Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Memory Management BSOD Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>I have been having this BSOD issue recently, twice already as of now since yesterday evening (26th of April). The error message I have been getting was Memory Management. Upon some googling, I have attempted memory diagnostic,
 both with the built-in Windows tool and a standalone program, a Linux based one, running under the Windows 10 bash terminal, called Google Stressapptest. They both came up clean, no errors whatsoever. I have also performed a malware and virus scan with Malwarebytes
 and Avast, and those also came up clean. Furthermore, I have also executed the sfc /scannow command and it gives the no integrity violation result. I was not able to run chkdsk on all my drives to see if any of them are at fault as I need my system running
 still (and it still is running fine when it's not crashing), and since I have got over 10TB of HDD storage, it would take days of the drives being unmounted to finish checking them, that is excluding the boot SSD still.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Prior to this issue, I have contacted Microsoft support twice. The first contact was regarding a different BSOD error message, but an error nevertheless, witht the System Thread Exception message, along with fltmgr.sys
 mentioned in the error screen to be what's at fault. Unfortunately, I don't have a .dmp file for these errors, as in the information collection screen, it will get stuck on like 5% progress for hours and hours, forcing me to just do a hard reset. Before this
 first contact, I have performed an in-place upgrade as I thought the fltmgr.sys might be a corrupted system file. The support agent at the time concluded that it could be a bad GPU driver as he was unable to see my GPUs in Dxdiag even though they are visible
 and connected in Device Manager with the latest drivers for all of them. He also performed a tweak in the virtual memory size, by setting the C drive virtual memory to a custom value of minimum 4GB and maximum of 32GB (I have 32GB of RAM), instead of leaving
 it automatically managed.&nbsp;</span><span>I have, however, since fixed the System Thread Exception BSOD, per his recommendation, using headless HDMI dongles to keep all my GPUs being detected. And now all of my GPUs are showing up in Dxdiag already. I have also
 contacted NVidia support just to be sure that I have got the latest driver revision and that it is all working fine. They have since confirmed that to me as well in a live chat support session.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My second contact with&nbsp;</span>Microsoft support&nbsp;<span>was last night (</span><span>26th of April)</span><span>, and it was regarding this new issue of Memory Management BSOD. The support agent simply reset the virtual
 memory management setting in Windows which was changed by the first support agent, as he saw that being the only thing "modified". He told me after changing that back to default to wait and see how the system behaves. Unfortunately, the issue returned, and
 I am currently out of options and tricks up my sleeve to try. W</span>hat I notice though, is that the BSOD came always right after Chrome crashing when I'm playing a Youtube video.</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<p>I have also contacted ASUS, the board manufacturer for my computer,
<span>they have then replied saying that their boards support all windows releases to the latest one available to the consumer (so, not insider builds, I presume), and
<span>they have then replied saying that their boards support all windows releases to the latest one available to the consumer (so, not insider builds, I presume), and
</span>I also have the latest BIOS revision available for my board. It should also be noted that I'm not signed up for the Windows Insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I also would like to mention that I also use Samsung SSDs, and with their Magician software, I have enabled the Rapid Mode, which essentially is ram caching/ramdisk. I am not entirely sure if that is the cause
 of the issue, but I have read somewhere online that it might be the culprit as well. As of now, however, I leave that feature turned on, as I find it difficult to believe that it was caching to the point that it overloads my RAM, especially since I have 32GB
 of RAM, and having Task Manager constantly open as my way of keeping an eye of my resource utilization, I can safely say that my memory usage at full normal workday workload hovers only around 50% utilization, never much more than that. I do, however, have
 a VirtualBox VM running sometimes as well, to which I dedicate 16GB of my system RAM. But, according to my understanding, in VirtualBox VMs, the assigned resource will only be used when it is necessary, ie. when I am using some things in the VM and need to
 use a CPU core or some RAM, only then it will take up some of my RAM and CPU core, which should be noticeable in Task Manager. Even with the VM running, based on my observation, I have barely seen any RAM usage nearing 70%. Furthermore, the BSODs have also
 occurred without the VM even running, so, I don't think that is the culprit here. I really need some help in pointing me in the right direction, as to what I need to "fix" or look for.</p>

<p>Added some extra details to the original post regarding the chronological order of the issues I have experienced and some things I have done that might be of relevance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE3:</p>
<p>Fortunately, in the past 3 days or so, I have not experienced the Memory Management BSOD. What I have done was an in-place upgrade and that seems to fix the issue. However, unfortunately, a different issue cropped up. I am now seeing a new BSOD
 with Faulty Hardware Corrupted Page error message. A few things that have happened between the last update and today (April 30th) are a couple of updates to the NVidia GPU driver to the latest version. As usual, I have Googled for some steps I can perform
 in order to potentially fix this new error, and I have performed and sfc /scannow which came out clean and turned off the fast boot option. As for the memory, as described in the original post, I have performed a couple of memory tests and all four of my modules
 seem to pass all the tests being thrown at it. For drivers, I have ensured that my GPU (dedicated and integrated) have the latest drivers, downloaded from their corresponding manufacturer's support page. I have also ensured that my Intel Management Engine
 version is of the latest one listed on my motherboard manufacturer's support page (version 11.7.0.1040, dated on November 11th 2017).&nbsp; What I also notice is that the BSOD this time occured soon after I had booted into my Linux VM in VirtualBox while also playing
 a FHD video file in VLC. I really am not sure what is the cause for this new one now. The name seemed to suggest a hardware failure, but I was not sure what to look for or replace. Any help on that aspect would be appreciated. The following are link to the
 .dmp files for this BSOD.</p>

            Hi Jeff the mini-dump fie indicates MSI Afterburner as the culprit behind your BSOD's
<br />
<br />Have you overclocked your GPU, if so it is possibly in an unstable state . . .

<p>Hi Dave,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I have not overclocked my&nbsp;GPU, they are at stock settings, aside from the custom fan curve I have set for them for better temperature and noise management. It is correct, however, that MSI Afterburner is running all the time on my computer,
 as I have it started on startup to apply the custom fan profile. Is that the only thing causing the issue? If so, I might have to consider switching to a different software interface to control my GPUs then. I have used Afterburner for many years and it has
 never given me any issue before. It seems like the least flaky GPU control software in my opinion. I find it rather odd, however, that the issue cropped up only recently (in the past 2 days) as I have had this exact fan curve with Afterburner always running,
 for months before this issue surfaced. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Has there been a MAJOR BUG FIX to the Anniversary Edition</h2>
                    I attempted to upgrade from my current build and had to revert to the old version of 10. &nbsp;Patches are unacceptable when or will a complete revision be released.

            <p>I've got news for you my friend: All software has bugs. There are bugs that users know about, bugs that only the developers know about and bugs that nobody knows about until someone discovers them. Even so-called stable software is filled with bugs that
 haven't yet been found or exploited. There is no such thing as bug-free software, so if that's what you're looking for, you may as well give up on computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's something else for you: Bugs are fixed (hopefully) in the most efficient way possible. That might be a patch, or it might be a service pack or it might be a new version of the software. Sometimes bugs are never fixed - too difficult or expensive,
 so the developers come up with a work-around. If something less than a complete revision is "unacceptable" to you, find a hobby or job that doesn't use computers. You'll be much happier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, you get nowhere by throwing a gauntlet down in front of Microsoft, or Google or Apple or Adobe or ... there aren't enough people in the tech industry to explain to every firebrand how technology works. That's something for you and me to learn.</p>

            I only throw the gauntlet in the case of Microsoft. I do business with two of other two companies you mentioned. &nbsp;Those two companies give me the impression that that are looking out for my best interest rather than number one. &nbsp; I am tired of crippleware
 that is so bad that the fix is worse that the let's wait and get it right. &nbsp;The Anniversary Edition completely shut me down. &nbsp;Given a choice, I would have stayed with stable, reliable&nbsp;Win 7 but I bought a new machine and was forced to move before the OS was
 ready for prime time.

            <p>My web cam is still not working with Skype a Microsoft product currently.</p>
<p>I been waiting since mid-August for a fix!</p>
<p>Have to use a old pc with Windows 7 Pro in order to use Skype, glad I still have a Windows 7 pc..</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was from a Business Advisor article:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"A behind-the-scenes change in the <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-windows-10-anniversary-update-new-features-2016-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 Anniversary Edition update</a>, which rolled out earlier in August, is causing a lot of people's USB-connected webcams to freeze up when using video apps like Skype.</p>
<p>The big issue, <a href="https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/76719/microsoft-broken-millions-webcams-windows-10-anniversary-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
as first reported by Thurrott.com's Brad Sams</a>, is that with the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, Microsoft disabled the ability for webcams to use&nbsp;<span>MJPEG or H264 — two of the leading standards&nbsp;for encoding&nbsp;video in transit between the camera and your
 PC.</span></p>
<p><span>The reason, as explained by a Windows camera engineer in an <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsdesktop/en-US/9d6a8704-764f-46df-a41c-8e9d84f7f0f3/mjpg-encoded-media-type-is-not-available-for-usbuvc-webcameras-after-windows-10-version-1607-os?forum=mediafoundationdevelopment#fc5c100a-c661-43cd-9540-bb4591e3d1fe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
official Microsoft support thread for this issue</a>, is that Microsoft has instead moved towards a different video&nbsp;standard called&nbsp;YUY2. By enabling both YUY2 and the other technologies, the engineer explains, there was a strong chance they'd get in each other's
 way and result in lousy video.</span></p>
<p><span>The end result is that any webcam that uses&nbsp;MJPEG or H264, which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cameras_with_onboard_video_compression" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
includes popular models from companies like Logitech and Creative</a>, aren't working quite right. As Sams reports, lots of users are finding that their webcam images freeze after about a minute of using them.</span></p>
<p><span>While that support thread is full of both consumers and business IT managers grumbling about the issue, it's hard to know exactly how many users are affected by this issue.&nbsp;</span><span>But if you are in that camp of Windows
 10 Anniversary Edition upgraders who are having issues with your webcam, at least now you have an inkling as to why. The good news is that a fix is on the way, but that engineer says it may not be coming until September. "<br />

<p>The first thing you do in this Community is to start your own thread, not&nbsp;add your off-topic question to someone else's problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it came preinstalled and the product key is erased/worn on the COA sticker:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could&nbsp;use a torch and magnifying glass to attempt to&nbsp;read it.</p>
<p>Or&nbsp;take a photo of it&nbsp;and enlarge it on the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can contact your&nbsp;Laptop Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.
</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost, IF they still have them available (<strong>Most don't</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you never received a Recovery Disk when you received&nbsp;your&nbsp;Laptop there should be a Recovery Partition on the Hard Drive to reinstall&nbsp;Windows back to how&nbsp;it was when new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Key/s to press at Boot to start the Recovery Process back to Factory Settings (new condition). Under each Manufacturer in the list below are the instructions in the respective links for you to follow on how to use their Recovery Partition</p>

<h2>            Halo Spartan &#42;&#42;&#42;&#42; keeps crashing</h2>
                    
<p>Bought Halo: Spartan **** on 360 today. So far, it's crashed five times already.</p>
<p>Four times when starting a mission (three times on the 'press 'A' to continue screen and once on the weapon select screen) and once in the middle of a mission (A-5, I think) Sound kept playing on one of the crashes, but not on the other four.</p>

<p>Having the same issue myself. Can't play my shiny new game. Driving me up the wall.</p>
<p>I hope it's fixed in the next couple of days, otherwise I might ask MS if they can credit the cost of the game to my account. I'd rather have this game, but if it doesn't work, I'm not interested.</p>

<p>I have Two things to say:</p>
<p>Halo Spartan Assault is Designed for Xbox ONE and Windows 8 on Computer as it has very good graphics so it may crash with all the sounds and weapons and music. Or it may be a big download problem. If this is not fixed eventually. Maybe its not an update
 fix. Try removing the game and re downloading it. Don`t worry it wont charge you twice to re download something. If it still persists stay with the DEMO version I have played it a Hundred times already and haven't crashed. If it still persists download eitheir
 version to a different storage device or to cloud saved games is you have gold.</p>
<p>And CaptRaspberry if you read the description of all items that are priced on xbox live market place it says no refunds.</p>

    <title>Keyboard Layout Glitches on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gustav christensson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard Layout Glitches on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes, when using the Swedish (Swedish keyboard) input method on my HP ENVY x360 bp008no running Windows 10 (version 1803), I notice a glitching behaviour with my keyboard layout.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Swedish language keys seem to move around. "å" becomes "´", "¨" becomes "å", "'" becomes "ä", "ö" becomes "¨" and "ä" becomes "ö".</li><li>The input method does not change when using Windows Key and Space.</li><li>The language bar appears slightly translucent when clicked upon.</li><li>All of these symptoms resolve when I open the language settings, then return after typing in Swedish for a while (often on Google Chrome). What could be the issue here.</li></ul>
<p>Update: similar issues have been seen with the Italian keyboard layout, where "è" becomes "'", "+" becomes "ì", "ù" becomes "à", "ò" becomes "è", and "à" becomes "ò". All the other keys seem to be in their normal positions.</p>

<p>Hi Gustav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'd like to ask for your help in isolating this issue. Let's try to check if this also happens on the
<strong>On-Screen keyboard</strong>. Open this by pressing <strong>Windows key </strong>
on your keyboard and then type <strong>OSK </strong>and click the search result. Try to type if the issue is there. Also, can you give me these information to have a better understanding of this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the current build and version of your Windows 10 device? Press <strong>
Windows logo key + R</strong>, type <strong>winver</strong>, then select <strong>
OK</strong> to get this information.</li><li>Are you using your built-in keyboard or an external keyboard?</li><li>When does this issue happen? Try to observe if it has any triggers like when opening an app or opening a webpage.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'll be waiting for your update.</p>

            Hi Davey
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Run the Recording Audio Troubleshooter from there
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this, go to the support page for your PC on the manufacturers website
<br />
<br />From there, download and install the Audio driver they recommend for your PC
<br />
<br />If you have any difficulty locating that support page, what is the make and exact model No. of your laptop - that will be printed on a sticker on the underneath bottom casing . . .

            In that case it might be disabled and windows doesn't recognise it.  Are there any unknown devices listed in other devices?<br /><br />Sometimes Whether user interaction or through updates some permissions could be taken away to certain programs...<br /><br />Best fix I found is:<br /><br />Go into Settings and select the Privacy Option.<br /><br />From there find the Microphone option and make sure the program you want the microphone to use is "On" in the microphone option.<br /><br />You should be able to use it off the bat. The same works if you want to take away the ability for certain apps or programs to use hardware devices.

            I've also found the following information on the community site which might be of use to you:<br /><br />Step 1 - Identifying the Microphone<br />Right-click on the volume icon, choose "recording devices" - right-click on the devices area and make sure that the "show disabled devices" option is checked. The mic should appear on the list. Select it, click "properties", and make sure the device is now enabled on the "Device Usage" drop-box menu.<br />(Alternatively, you can right-click on the volume icon, choose "Troubleshoot sound problems" and follow the wizard - it found out the device was disabled and corrected it automatically, but you still might have to do the next step)<br />Ok, so now I still had the overfeeding problem. If you have this or your voice cannot be heard through the mic, try this:<br />Step 2: Configuring the Microphone<br />Still on the Microphone Settings, go for the tab Levels. Although the Mic was now working, my voice would not be recorded. So on Levels I put the "Micropho

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Okay, this is only a guess, not a conclusive answer, but here is what I think:<br />
<br />
Because you misspelled the word "assassin" in your gamertag (you're missing one 's'), it's not recognizing the word for what it is, and is flagging it because of the first three letters.<br />

<p>
</p><p>My name is Luis A. Caraballo Ramos, and since two weeks ago all I want is a Windows Phone. Then, when I search on the Web for some information about them, I see posts saying that these type of phones reached the end of their rides. That Microsoft suspended
 all hardware and software updates. Look, I know I was not into this; I barely knew Windows Phones existed! But I am using this platform to make an approach to Microsoft. Please, don't let Window 10 Mobile down. Google didn't give up on Android, for example.
 With some innovation it can be even more than Android or Apple. I would gladly accept any corrections from the community on this issue, but if you feel like me, please deliver the message! Microsoft, bring Windows 10 Mobile to a whole new era of innovation
 all across the planet.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi ThofikhAhamad,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for the answer to the same question Sqrly asked. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't help that you say Camera Roll and Saved Pictures "will be recreated by design" - we know they are recreated because that is exactly what is annoying when we have decided to delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want Camera Roll or Saved Pictures on my system. I object to someone decreeing ("by design") that I can't make that decision about equipment and setup that I own.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deleted those libraries and those folders but, as you know, that doesn't work because Windows 10 defaults to recreate them. Of course, I could mark them hidden but that doesn't address the fundamental point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to return to the original question: how do I get rid of them so that they don't return?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

</p><p>So, I've uninstalled these 2 apps. MS doesn't want you to do this so they don't let you do it the traditional way through Programs and Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead you must use the Windows PowerShell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 Search "PowerShell" then right click it and&nbsp;open it with admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 Type "Get-AppxPackage"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will list all your apps, the info you need is the "PackageFullName" for the app you want to remove.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS There's no right click menu but keyboard shortcuts work, Ctrl+C to copy, Ctrl+V to paste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 type in "Remove-AppxPackage -package "PackageFullName""</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove-AppxPackage -package Microsoft.Windows.Photos_16.302.8200.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>and </p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove-AppxPackage -package Microsoft.WindowsCamera_2016.225.10.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's kinda sad really. I use ACDsee as my main image program but I&nbsp;liked using the photo app to open an&nbsp;occasional single image once in awhile.</p>

            <p>That incorrectly named article shows how to <em>hide</em> them, not <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
remove</span> them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the two offending apps as I stated above seems to have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logic: If I used those apps, I wouldn't want to get rid of the folders in the first place, so get rid of them too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            theme images- how to save as separate files&#47;pics</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded several themes to use as a background. In each theme there are several images that make up the theme. I want to separate this theme and pick only those images that I want. I do not want to run a slide show. Just pictures that I like and keep
 for long periods of time. I need to know how to get those images separated and saved so I can choose which I want for the background.&nbsp;</p>

            Which version of Windows 10 are you running? 
<br />
<br />Where did you download the themes from?
<br />
<br />If they are themes from the Windows Personalization Gallery, you can download them then extract them like regular compressed files. Learn how:
<br />

<br />
<br />You can then copy them to a folder, open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Background.
<br />
<br />Click in the Background list box
<br />Choose Picture
<br />Click Browse, navigate to the folder the choose the specific picture you want to use:

            Can you upload one of the themes to the cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . etc.) post a link here and I will figure that out for you . . 
<br />
<br />Sometimes, it is just a case of changing the file extension to .zip and unzipping to access the images, sometimes this does not work . . .

BSOD error, Need help have tried quite a few different solutions none seem to work.</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello I keep having BSOD issues.</p>
<p>Have tried scanning memory for errors, hard drive for errors (none found on either).&nbsp; Cleaned out my comp with air, installed older Nvidia drivers.&nbsp; Even reinstalled Windows 7.&nbsp; Keeps blue screening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My RAM is 3 months old and has worked perfectly, about that same age of Video Card as well I doubt either are failing.</p>

<p>Run the manufacturer's diagnostic tool.<br />

Diagnostic Utilities By Manufacturer - run the one for your hard drive<br />

<p>These errors could easily be hardware related and you would need a real computer shop<br />
(not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other big box stores) or the System maker's Support.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Looking at the .nfo file you provided and the errors you just posted I believe the nTune software may be causing an issue on your system.</p>
<p>I do not believe nTune is compatible with Windows 7.</p>
<p>I would suggest to uninstall the nTune software and see if the system stabilizes.</p>
<p>I would also suggest to uninstall the display drivers that are now installed and download and install the following version:</p>

<p>Just noticed that is a new version released today.</p>
<p>Also, is your mainboard the&nbsp;K9AG Neo2-Digital?</p>
<p>If so, you appear to be at an older BIOS revision so you may want to consider updating the BIOS to the latest revision.</p>

<p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, the information regarding Windows OS is indicated on the box. If you can't see it there, we suggest that you contact the shop where your friend bought it from or the manufacturer if it's pre-installed to know whether it's a Windows 10 Home or Pro.</p>

    <title>How to customize UI colors&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikhail22  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to customize UI colors&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to customize colors of windows and native elements.<br />
Mainly I want to set the color of UI elements to something different than 100% white,<br />
say for example 90% white. Pure white hurts my eyes and in the end of the <br />
day I have issues with eyes. I need a way to setup several color schemes for <br />
different lighting.<br />
<br />
After some search I've found out that one option is to use the so-called "High contrast theme".
<br />
Is it the proper way to customize UI colors? It sounds weird because I just want to adjust the UI colors
<br />
to reduce eye strain, not much to do with high contrast.<br />
I tried it and it worked for some settings: I can set up some colors now.<br />
I really like that I can set the global color for elements, such as window background, button face.<br />
But there appear many issues with UI.<br />
<br />
Issues that are most annoying with High contrast on:<br />
<br />
1. </p>
<p>Colors of many elements borders and separators are same as text color, in my case - all
<br />
black (because I use black for text), and therefore most native UI looks awful.<br />
I cannot find anything that can adjust border colors separately.<br />
This is very frustrating. I've spent 2 days and found nothing that helps with that.
<br />
<br />
For example this is a GUI of one notepad++ dialog:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e15ba3f-961d-491a-a7a8-1404b7b30f6a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e15ba3f-961d-491a-a7a8-1404b7b30f6a?upload=true" /></a><br />
Further, all buttons and the scroll bar are converted to same 1 px black frames.<br />
This looks bad and it is hard to believe such setup could be made intentionally.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. </p>
<p>Color of the taskbar is set to window bg color and there is no way to <br />
set its color separately. It looks bad with light bg. Also some elements in <br />
the taskbar appear with 1 px border and I cannot get rid of this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89eb3f5d-3823-483d-b870-2d80d5aa8a47?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Questions:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Where are options to customize important colors such as borders, separators, taskbar?<br />
- Why is it called "High contrast theme" and not just "custom theme"? <br />
- If I should not use High contrast theme - then how to customize colors? </p>

<p>Hello Mikhail,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <em><strong>High contrast mode</strong></em> feature has been available long before the release of Windows 10. When the feature is enabled, it will revert your theme back to the Windows Classic theme with the colors altered depending on the configuration
 you selected. It is mainly designed to aid individuals that need more color contrast to read text on the screen. This also features the creation of custom colored theme's that have always been included in the previous version of Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, there's no option to modify the borders and separators. The taskbar color is tied to the
<em>Background</em> color selected. Once you've modified the color of any of the four default high contrast theme and then click
<em>Apply</em>, you will be asked to name your custom theme. For more information, you can check these articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026951/windows-turn-high-contrast-mode-on-or-off-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Turn high contrast mode on or off in Windows"><strong>Turn high contrast mode on or off in Windows</strong></a></li><li><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13862/windows-use-high-contrast-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Use high contrast mode"><strong>Use high contrast mode</strong></a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The configurations available under <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Personalization</strong> &gt;
<strong>Colors</strong> are limited to the accent color of the Start menu, taskbar, title bars, and Action Center. You can also choose between a
<strong>Dark</strong> and <strong>Light</strong> mode from the same page. See this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17144/windows-10-change-desktop-background" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Change desktop background and colors">
<strong>page</strong></a> for more details on how to modify colors in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're experiencing issues with the default display configuration of Windows, you can try Night light and color filters. The Night light feature will show warmer colors that are easier on your eyes and the color filters can help you distinguish display
 elements better.</p>

            I have found many similar concerns in the Feedback app,<br />
so I assume it is a known issue, upvoted some of them. <br />

<br />
So in short, there is no advanced setup for UI colors, apart from High contrast <br />
mode, which has the above mentioned shortcomings.<br />
Also I've found out that in some of previous versions of Windows there <br />
was advanced UI color settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding the Night Light mode - it is an interesting idea. <br />
But unfortunately it works strange for me - it changes the <br />
Hue to Red. I don't find it pleasing - the Hue should not be changed, <br />
only luminace of high levels should be changed.<br />
Ideally background Hues should be around 80 deg. (on a 360 deg. scale).<br />
And it moves it to 30 degrees, which makes it look unbearable at some point.<br />
So, currently this feature is not very helpful, but I believe it can be improved <br />
with more settings.<br />

1. I made a user account for security reasons, not giving applications the ability to access administrator functionality.&nbsp; How can I install a program on the user account and run it as the user?&nbsp; Even when I install a game for example, it installs it to the
 administrator account and I have to find the path in program files and create a shortcut on the user account desktop. This creates a problem on issue number two below.<br />
<br />
2. When running a game as an administrator from my user account, if i try to kill it because it locks up, i get access denied, you must be an administrator.&nbsp; When I run taskmgr as administrator, attempt to kill the process, I get the following error. "Unable
 to terminate process. The operation could not be completed. Access is denied."&nbsp; I am an administrator with limited capabilities it seems.&nbsp; It would be nice to kill -9 'pid'. Any suggestions? I followed the guide from "http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-files/task-manager-cant-end-processes-access-denied/65c12d51-8b01-49f2-8e2e-4bf77010e419"&nbsp;
 It did not seem to help at all.&nbsp; In fact the solution seemed like a script a novice Microsoft employee pulled from the Windows help function.<br />
<br />
3. I cannot close a program running on the Desktop if I am in the ipod application start menu.&nbsp; I must return to the Desktop to close a program.&nbsp; It seems if Desktop has become an application vs. a graphical interface for running programs.&nbsp; This seems counter
 productive.<br />
<br />
4. It seems there is a serious issue with the wifi connection issues.&nbsp; Windows 8 enables a function to turn wifi off when inactive.&nbsp; Well it seems this functionality is flawed and will periodically disconnect me and millions of other windows 8 users from what
 i can tell on forums, from the internet.&nbsp; This feature is turned on by default.&nbsp; How can this issue be addressed?<br />
<br />
I appreciate the time and concern to view this issue, but I am very concerned that I bought a laptop with ipod/tablet functionality.&nbsp; Is this how Windows 8 is supposed to be or is there a Windows 8 version for Laptop/Desktop functionality?<br />
<br />
Thank you and have a nice day.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Lenovo Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Update BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board device drivers. If no Windows 8 versions exist try the latest Windows 7 versions.<br />

<br />
Translate the Windows 7 methods to Windows 8 (there is little difference) :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually
<br />
included with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Xerox Phaser Printer will not print in office products</h2>
                    I have a Xerox Phaser 6180 printer that will not print from any microsoft program including office 2010. I have uninstalled and installed the latest printer drivers from xerox for Windows X64 however I not get it to work. I have an old Lexmark X5450 that
 works just fine. The Xerox printer is hooked up to the compute via usb.

<p>Is the printer recognized by Windows and listed in Control Panel\Printers, and is it set as the Default Printer?&nbsp; Is the Lexmark set as the Default Printer?&nbsp; A green tick usually indicates the Default Printer.&nbsp; If you have other Printers such as Document
 Writers etc., is the correct Printer selected from any drop down menu when you click on "Print"?</p>

<p>Try contacting Xerox Technical Support for assistance: <a href="http://www.office.xerox.com/printers/color-printers/phaser-6180/sprt-enus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.office.xerox.com/printers/color-printers/phaser-6180/sprt-enus.html</a>.&nbsp; This is the page specific to your printer.&nbsp; It offers information, access to manuals (which may help with detailed installation instructions you may not have received with
 the printer - there may be steps that were missed or done in the wrong order which can cause the printer to function erratically or not at all), video and other instructions, access to a knowledge base (which may contain articles about this specific problem),
 access to driver, firmware, and software downloads (all of which should be updated - not just the drivers), and a toll-free support number (though&nbsp;I don't know if this support is free - but you'll find out when you call).&nbsp; Although the proper thing to do would
 be to search for the answer and download the updates and such, frankly I'd probably first call the support phone number and see if free assistance is available with a human (which will make things go much faster).&nbsp; If it costs, then I'd hang up and try the
 research first and if that and what you get here doesn't resolve the problem, then decide&nbsp;&nbsp;if you're willing to pay whatever it costs to get personal attention or see if there is another free method not mentioned (like a chat option or an e-mail option or
 something else like that).</p>
<p>Linney offered some very good suggestions and things to check.&nbsp; He also asked some important questions which will help us to help you.&nbsp; I would like to know if it prints<strong>any</strong> documents or pictures or anything at all - say from a non-Microsoft
 program (like maybe Adobe Reader or something else you have installed on your system) - you mentioned from any Microsoft program and I would like to know if that means other programs work or if you really meant any program at all.&nbsp; I would also like you to
 go to Start / Control Panel / Device Manager and find the device driver for the printer and make sure it has no error symbols next to it.&nbsp; Click on it and make sure it says that it is working properly.&nbsp; If it has errors or is not working properly, it needs
 to be re-installed until the problem is resolved (or possibly configured manually to resolve the problem).&nbsp; I would also like to confirm that you have in fact downloaded and installled the applicable firmware
<a href="http://www.support.xerox.com/go/results.asp?Xlang=en_US&amp;XCntry=USA&amp;prodID=6180&amp;ripId=&amp;Xtype=download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.support.xerox.com/go/results.asp?Xlang=en_US&amp;XCntry=USA&amp;prodID=6180&amp;ripId=&amp;Xtype=download</a> that goes with this printer as well as the drivers - just the drivers alone may not be enough for this printer to work properly.</p>
<p>I hope this helps and/or I hope that Xerox is able to resolve the problem quickly as it is their product and they know much more about it that we&nbsp;do and may have encountered this very problem many times before and have a simple solution to resolve the issue
 (whatever it is).</p>
<p>If not, please reply to our questions and the results of the checks we asked you to make and we'll go from there. It would also help to tell us what Xerox had to say about the problem if they were unable to resolve it.</p>
<p>Thanks and good luck!</p>

<p>Hello ..</p>
<p>Since I did not see a reply, I thought I would reply as I have the same problem.&nbsp; Clearly, this is a Microsoft Office 2010 issue, not a Xerox issue.&nbsp; Xerox has had no updates for this printer since 2009 (shame on them if they needed to).&nbsp; Everything was
 working just fine until I upgraded to Office 2010.&nbsp; The only way I can print out of Word now is to convert the document to a PDF and print from Adobe Acrobat.&nbsp; You can't print even if you 'save as' into a word 2003 document.</p>
<p>When I try to print from PowerPoint, sometimes it goes through, but the spooler process craps out and you get an error.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Andremacfarlane,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the compatibility of the game with Windows 7 by following the link.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 Compatibility Center
</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the game is not compatible with Windows 7, you may install the games in compatible mode and then check if it helps.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on the program you want to install in compatible mode.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to Properties.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under Compatibility Tab, Check the option “Run this program in compatibility mode for”</p>
<p>

</span></span></span>Select Windows&nbsp;XP (Service Pack 3)</p>
