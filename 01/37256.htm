<h2>            Windows 10 crashing, mainly Kernel Security Check Failure</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer crashes often, mainly due to Kernel Security Check Failure, but have had numerous others. I built this computer late last year, and have had problems since. Some programs seem to be more prone to it than others, but sometimes I will just be sitting
 on a webpage, and it will crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've updated my BIOS, as well as a number of drivers, and have run System file checker, the DISM tool, and have performed a disk check, memory diagnostic and virus scan. All have come back with no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system specs<br />
Intel i5-6600 processor<br />
Crucial 8GB DDR4 RAM (2 sticks)<br />
Nvidia GTX 1060 6 GB<br />
Samsung SSD 850 Pro 256GB<br />
Western Digital 2 TB hard drive</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated. I have previously sought assistance but am still having issues, and I'd really like to get to the bottom of this problem. Here is a dump file that has been previously asked for: https://1drv.ms/u/s!Av2LMj4MQEYJddDwUdVHlBx7grc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi Melowin</p>
<p>
</p><p>The day I posted this question, I was having a Kernel security check failure surge. I might have to try a clean install on this weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you be able have a look at the dump file? Or do you know someone that could?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately it had a blue screen: MULTIPLE_IRP_COMPLETE_REQUESTS. I think at this point I will just have to format C Drive and install Windows 10 again.</p>

<p>Hi Melowin</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've reinstalled Windows 10, unfortunately I have still been running into issues. This time it has been a system service exception, and 2 PFN list corrupt bsods (I had another PFN list corrupt whilst typing this up), and I'm not sure I won't be running into
 kernel security check failure again. Both bsods I've encountered in the past even with updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done at this point? I have a feeling that I may just need to buy a new PC unfortunately.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">Hi Dante,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Thank you for that additional information. PFN_LIST_CORRUPT is commonly caused by an outdated device driver, corrupted Windows system files, driver conflict and such. Before we go to a more in-depth troubleshooting, we suggest
 to update your device driver through the manufacturers website.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you complete the setup on your computer and have <span>received </span>8 digit code, you may try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Get the setup key on your console:</p>
<p><span>a) On your console, go to <b>Apps</b>, select <b>My Apps</b>, and then select
<b>Windows Media Center</b>. </span></p>
<p><b><span>Tip</span></b><span> Not seeing<b>Apps</b>? You might need to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/system-updates/system-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update your Xbox 360 console software</a>. </span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;Select <strong>Continue</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Write down the<strong> 8-digit setup key.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><br />
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Add your console to Windows Media Center:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Start Windows Media Center on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Go to<b>Tasks</b>, and then click <b>Add Extender</b>. </span></p>
<p><span>c) When prompted, enter the 8-digit setup key from Step 3.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click<b>Next</b> to complete setup. </span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong>&nbsp; Start Windows Media Center on your console:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to<b>Apps</b>, select <b>My Apps</b>, and then select <b>Windows Media Center</b>.
</span></p>
<p><span>It will take some time to build your media libraries the first time you use Windows Media Center on your console.</span></p>
<p><span><br />

            Hi,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. When exactly do you receive this error message?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div><br />
Uxtheme.dll error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation.<br />
<div><br />
Uxtheme.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the uxtheme dll.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Follow the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</div>
<div><b>Method 1:</b> Run a virus scan with Microsoft Safety scanner and check.<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<b>Note:&nbsp; </b>Before performing the security scan take a backup of important data.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Method 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; </b>I would suggest that you run SFC scan on the computer which would scan for corrupt system files on the computer and replace them.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><b>Method 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;</b> If this does not help, you may try performing a system restore to the date where the computer was working correctly.</div>
<div>Perform system restore on your computer. </div>
<div>System restore will take your computer to pervious state when it was not facing such problem, this can be done by selecting the proper restore point.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;a. Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>system restore</b> in the Start search box, and then click
<b>System Restore</b> in the Programs list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<b>Continue</b>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click
<b>Next</b>. <br />
c. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click
<b>Next</b>. <br />
d. Click <b>Finish</b>.</div>

<p>- It seems that when MS included the pop-up that offers to install Direct Play (as you saw when trying to launch GTA-SA)</p>
<p>in one of the version updates they got something wrong, as there seems to be a lot more people with this issues since that 'feature'
</p>
<p>was introduced.</p>
<p>- When this pop-up fails to enable Direct Play it also tends to affect the original manual method, but if you have not already...</p>
<p>- Go to <em>Programs and Features &gt; Turn Windows Features On or Off.</em></p>
<p>- Scroll down to and tick the box next to<em> Legacy Components </em>and <em>Direct Play</em>.</p>
<p>- Sign out and back in if prompted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've never had this problem, but disabling your Anti-Virus software before trying to enable Legacy Components &amp; Direct Play
</p>
<p>helps some people.</p>
<p>- <em>Sign Out</em> out as the instructions suggest. Rebooting rather than signing out may only save changes for system-wide events,
</p>
<p>so it may not save changes such as this which may be a User account based change .</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I believe one of the most recent cumulative Windows Update has some fixes for the Direct Play/d3d issue. I don't know</p>
<p>if the update is the reason, but I no longer have to sign out and back in to enable or disable Legacy Components &amp; Direct Play</p>
<p>(I hadn't played with this option for a while, but did some experimenting yesterday due to another thread regarding the</p>
<p>same issue, which seems to have affects a fair number of Win10 users. )</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><em>"I don t need derictx i need to install direct play"</em></p>
<p>You need for DirectX to be complete though.&nbsp; Direct Play is a function of the older versions of Direct X - DX8 (and maybe DX7 ?) - and your</p>
<p>Windows install needs all available DX files to be installed or various old games will have issues, even regarding 'newer' DX9 files
</p>
<p>which seem to go missing in some clean Win10 installations.</p>
<p>I believe there is only one DX8 file - <em>d3d8thk.dll</em> -&nbsp; which should be in Windows\System32 along with all the other DX files.</p>
<p>[Note: I don't think Pedro's MS download link above is relevant. That is a DX8 security patch for XP from 2004. ]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you want to verify all files are installed use the official Direct X Web Installer -

Download DirectX&nbsp; Web Installer from Official Microsoft&nbsp;</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event of corrupt DX file you need to use the full Direct X Redist (June 2010) installer package as this overwrites all DX 9,10 &amp; 11 files.</p>

            Hi RV, 
<br />
<br />Let’s try something:
<br />Click start and type “this pc” - right click on it, and click manage. 
<br />
<br />Once there, expand Users and Groups, and then click on Users. 
<br />
<br />Right click on one of the users, and try reset the password. Once done, log off, and see if that user account is prompted for a password. if that works, complete this task on the other two and you should be good. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if this helps!
<br />- C

<p>Hi Charlie,</p>
<p>thank you for reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helping someone else with this.</p>
<p>This is Home edition - no lusrmgr.msc&nbsp; . Control Panel&gt;User Accounts&gt;User Accounts&gt;Manage Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If Ctrl+Alt+Del&gt;"change a password" i get usual "enter old pass-new pass-repeat new pass"&gt;&gt;&gt;error:"username or password incorrect"</p>
<p>2. If go through Control Panel - user has no password set(!) - "Create password-repeat new password", NO CURRENT PASSWORD. This explain error in (1.), but how passwords got gone? Its odd, as I know passwords were set and two users with admin accounts swear
 not changing/removing account passwords, not eliminating this completely, but leaning to believe as they wouldn't know how to get to control panel or settings and where to go from there - IT illiterate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have guided current user to set password, but...<strong>How the hell this happen in first place?</strong></p>
<p>Even if users using same computer it doesn't mean they willing to share whats on their accounts.</p>
<p>There are two other users that currently not able physically to access laptop and secure their accounts/data. For their interest i have to do this&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Their accounts, potentially, were compromised, and along with this, potentially, other accounts(mail, gmail suite, Facebook, etc. etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this caused by Windows update - this is BIG PROBLEM. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Need to find cause to try eliminate this from happening again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further thoughts?</p>
        </p>

            Good evening, so just to verify, you were able to reset the passwords, right? If so, awesome, at least we got those back secured. 
<br />
<br />As to your question about why this happened, I don’t have a clear answer yet. I’ve done some digging to see if this was reported, but haven’t found the same occurrence.
<br />
<br />It does seem odd that all the accounts have had the passwords wiped... If it were just one, I wouldn’t think it was an OS thing, but... 
<br />
<br />We are sure no one else has access to that box that could of done it, right? I’m scratching my head with this one as well. I’ll keep digging, but You can also leave feedback using the Feedback Hub as well (click start and type feedback and you should be able to launch it) and leave a note for MS. They may be able to offer some insight.

</p><p>The steps on how you can reactivate your Skype Credits are stated on this support article:&nbsp;https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10378/&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're not seeing an option to reactivate your Skype Credits after signing in to the link given on the support page, it's most likely because you're signed in to a different account than where your credits are stored. In this case, I strongly suggest
 you to sign out of the page, then sign back in using the Skype Name, email or phone number you might have used in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't recall your old account, it's best to seek help from friends or family members in finding your account's Skype Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Need help with my Line app............ One way video - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need help with my Line app............ One way video</h2>
                    I have a Popalook PA452 web camera and it works fine on Skype and IMO. Using the Line app is another story. I can see her but she can't see me and I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out what the problem is. Before she could see me and I couldn't
 see her so I uninstalled Line then re-installed it. Now I can see her and she can't see me. Is there some kind of driver or setting that I'm missing somewhere? I have Windows 10&nbsp; and a big gun Dell Ryzen computer. Could the Windows 10 Anniversary update messed
 something up? Any help would be appreciated in saving my relationship. Thanks.....

            Hello! I am sorry that you are having some issues using LINE app on Windows. First, try checking and re-installing the webcam drivers and see if it fixes anything. If this doesn't do the job, try checking your LINE settings and see if the webcam is detected as a video output device. If not, select your webcam as the video output device. 
<br />Hope this helps! :-)

<p>Thanks for the input. I re-installed the webcam drivers but it didn't do anything so I did a Hail Mary and shut the Xfinity router and my computer down and rebooted, BOOM...It worked. I don't know why but the webcam is fine now, she can see me and I can
 see her perfectly. Life is good once again.</p>

<p>Hi zena123,</p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>Maximizing the FreeCell game window will increase the size of the cards by default.</p>
<p>There is also something called "Large Print Deck", which can be changed as follows:<br />
a. Open FreeCell game.<br />
b. Click Game menu, click Change Appearance.<br />
c. Select Large Print Deck in the list and click ok.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Issues after Installing and Uninstalling KB3081424 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angmargre  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Issues after Installing and Uninstalling KB3081424</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba L855 (64-bit) laptop which had run Windows 8.1 for the last year and a half; it had been configured for Windows 8 originally.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 on August 1, and I removed Windows 8.1 from my hard drive so that the two programs would
 not interfere with each other.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I had had no major issues with my system since the upgrade (just the loss of links when exporting my Favorites from Internet Explorer 11 to Microsoft Edge)--until yesterday.&nbsp; First, my computer became very sluggish when I went online, and it froze as I tried
 to access notifications, Task Manager, and my Start Menu.&nbsp; I turned off my computer, removed my battery for about a minute, reinserted my battery, and turned the computer back on.&nbsp; When I restarted my computer, the screen read, "Working on updates. 83% complete.
 Do not turn off your computer" before I could even access my Start screen. &nbsp;The message stayed on the screen for about fifteen minutes.&nbsp; So, I did several cold restarts by holding my power button until my computer clicked off.&nbsp; Each time, I got the same message.&nbsp;
 I then removed my battery for about three minutes.&nbsp; After turning it back on, I got the message, "We couldn't complete updates.&nbsp; Undoing changes.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer" every time I restarted;
<em>that</em> message lasted about as long as the first message.&nbsp; Frustrated, I managed to do a System Restore back to a point on August 6.&nbsp; Although the laptop restarted sluggishly, that System Restore allowed me to access my start screen and my desktop.&nbsp;
 When I tried to run any programs, I could run them only about five minutes before my computer froze.&nbsp; To stop the freezing, I have to do a cold restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, I noticed and decided to uninstall KB3081424.&nbsp; After uninstalling it, the computer still restarted sluggishly, and, the last time that I tried to restart my laptop, I could only get a black screen after my computer manufacturer's screen.&nbsp; I
 also have been unable to access System Restore again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is this:&nbsp; Are my difficulties a software issue, a hardware issue, or a combination of both?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your time.&nbsp; I appreciate it.</p>

            <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update: August 16, 2015</span></p>
<p>I forgot to mention that the system stated that my Software Protection and my anti-virus software were turned off. &nbsp;Both of them are my Microsoft Defender, which was turned on before the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update:&nbsp; August 17, 2015</span></p>
<p>I ran sfc /scannow on my laptop yesterday afternoon; it took seven hours to complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;When I finished,&nbsp;the resulting message read, "We found corrupted files but were unable to fix some",&nbsp;and SFC directed me to access CBS.log to find out what was wrong.&nbsp;
 I checked CBS.log this morning, and I found two messages.&nbsp; The first read, "Cannot repir memberfile [1:24{12}] of "sppwinob.dll" of Microsoft-Windows-Security-SPP-Plugin-Windows Version 10.0.10240.16384".&nbsp; The second read, "Could not reproject corrupted file
 [m1:48{24}, 1:46{23}]"\\??C:WINDOWS\System32"\[1:24{12}]"sppwinob.dll"; source file in store is also corrupted".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I have three more issues that may stem from this.&nbsp; My screen turns back every so often (and it's not my screen saver) when working on it.&nbsp; When I access my notifications, the taskbar and my applications freeze.&nbsp; Yesterday, when I finished SFC,
 I saw a notice on the bottom right corner of my screen reading "Activate Windows.&nbsp; Go to Settings to activate Windows."&nbsp; When I went to Settings, it stated "Windows is not activated.&nbsp; Activate Windows now."&nbsp; When I go to activate it, the link turns gray, and
 my computer becomes sluggish and unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I fix any of this?&nbsp; If so, how?&nbsp; Does any of this help?</p>

<h2>            about the performance information and tools</h2>
                    I have installed a windows 7 ultimate n x64 trial version, which doesn't contain windows media player 12, after all the drivers were installed I found out that the performance information and tools&nbsp;cannot work. When I click the rate button, a frame popped
 up and says,"The Windows Experience Index for your system could not be computed. Cannot complete the requested assessment. This system does not have the necessary multi-media support to run the requested assessment." I wander whether it has something to do
 with the wmp12. But there is no relative options in windows features and I also cannot find any downloading site. I have installed other multi-media softwares like kmplayer, but it didn't work. Can you help me? Thank you~~~

            Thank you for your advice. But the N edition doesn't contain wmp12 really. Even in the windows features list. It really confused many people.<br />
Maybe the driver of my display adapter doesn't match with the x64 windows7, I would try later. And now I have installed x86 windows 7 instead,it works well.<br />
Thank you again.

<h2>            Microsoft Exchange Server set up in Windows Mail or Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
We just got a new laptop and I am trying to set up my email account as it was on my old one.&nbsp; For work purposes, I use the Microsoft Exchange Server because my work has us using OWA.&nbsp; This way I can sync it to my outlook client at home and then sync with my
 portable devices. <br />
<br />
The new one has Windows Mail and Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; As regular Mail didn't seem to have all the proxy set up, I tried on Live Mail.&nbsp;
<br />
I can't get set up on either one.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?

            So, I purchase a 800$ laptop which includes the $150 for microsoft office home for students and teachers only to have to go and buy outlook for an additional $100.<br />
Atleast I am taking a 3 credit post-grad class right now through the University and have an .edu email address there.<br />
The Ultimate Steal- Office Ultimate for college students--- $60 if you take at least a .5 credit class and have an .edu email address.<br />

Windows needs to stop trying to make things better for people.&nbsp; Things were fine before!!!

</p><p>I find a strange "bug".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In our computer there are several account with restricted access by 'famliy safety' which we limited by time(access granted only in specific hours).</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the access is blocked, an attempe to access show the option to get an extra time. choosing this option lead to a screen that ask for the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this screen, taking the mouse curser to the edge revial the start button and all the bottom line and even though the access is blocked, starting a game is working!</p>
<p>since it "take over" the screen the restriction doesn't work!!</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for keeping us updated on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to remove &amp; re-add the account and also
<span>refresh the Family Safety Filter</span>. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How do I refresh the Family Safety Filter?</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/family-safety-filter-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/family-safety-filter-faq</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you change any Family Safety settings, for just one child or for all family members, it's a good idea to refresh the Family Safety Filter to make sure it's using the most current info. The Family
 Safety Filter refreshes its settings automatically at certain times, but if you notice that web content isn't being filtered the way you would like or if you don’t see activity reported as you expect, you can refresh the Family Safety Filter manually.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;I never tried to play such games. Also I can geuss it's won't work. The problem is with full-screen app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Every game I have can be played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned before. The issue is seems to be that when &nbsp;accessing the account while time-limit, It does access but blocked with the question to get more time. Games the going full screen are "ignoring" &nbsp;the question and enter the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use password in addition to the limitation, but it only help at the beginning of the use. After the time is over, the account is not blocked but asking for an additional time, and then the issue is up again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can I convert a partition being used for Users to FAT32&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charlie729n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I convert a partition being used for Users to FAT32&#63;</h2>
                    I currently have Windows 10 installed to an SSD on C:\, with the Users directory on an HDD on D:\. Since I am going to dual-boot Ubuntu on C:\ with Windows, I'd like to be able to share files between operating systems. The problem is, I don't want any
 potential data corruption related to NTFS not understanding UNIX file permission triads or Ubuntu not having very good NTFS drivers etc., and I would like to convert this partition to FAT32.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I want to know this: can the partition on D:\ be directly converted to FAT32 using software such as Partition Wizard or GParted with Windows still recognizing the partition afterwards? Or, do I have to reinstall Windows and create the FAT32 partition
 beforehand?

            <p>Hello Charlie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you begin, note that the FAT32 file system has size limitations. You can't create a FAT32 partition greater than 32 gigabytes (GB).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;if you want to use the FAT file system on the partition with NTFS format, you will need to reformat the partition, which erases all data on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p />

            <p>Are you sure? I did a test run by cloning my drive, and the partition worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Wikipedia article</a>, in fact, states that the max is 2-16TB, depending on your cluster size. Also, with the software I'm using (GParted), it has the ability to convert the partition from NTFS to FAT32 without data loss.<br />
</p>
<p>All I need to know is whether Windows will still recognize Partition 1 on D:\ if it changes filesystem type. As far as I know, windows identifies drives by UUID and partitions by their entry number, so it should work. I just need confirmation.</p>

            <p>An Update:<br />
<br />
It worked. I said "screw it" and did two test runs on isolated hard drives with both GParted AND Partition Wizard and both times Windows was still able to read the partition as if it was the exact same thing as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But! I decided on a different approach entirely. It turns out that Ubuntu's NTFS drivers have gotten MUCH better, and so I kept the partition the same and just moved all of my media over to a seperate partition formatted as ext4 (Windows, though, has ****
 ext drivers. I would recommend putting any data you require in Windows either on NTFS or a FAT32 "bridge" partition).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all, it works pretty great. Here's a screenshot of my desktop, for the one person in the universe that is interested:<br />

    <title>Windows 10 - Windows Update not opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacquip-10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Windows Update not opening</h2>
                    <p>I've not had any problems since upgrading to Windows 10 soon after it was made generally available. &nbsp;Currently though, despite my computer appearing to be working normally I seem to have a problem connected to Windows Update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago I discovered I couldn't sign into the Microsoft Solitaire Collection games - the app starts, but when it doesn't get stuck at 'Loading' it comes up with a message along the lines of 'importing previous saved game data step 1 of 9' and
 gets no further. &nbsp;I thought perhaps reinstalling or updating the app might solve the problem, so tried the Store icon. &nbsp;It took a very long time to open and when it did I discovered a queue of 3 things under Downloads and Updates all of which seem permanently
 stuck on 'Starting Download' (with nothing happening).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Googling the issue prompted me to check whether I was missing any Windows 10 updates, so I went into Settings, Update and Security, but couldn't get any information at all about the updates. &nbsp;All the other options (Windows Defender, Backup, Recovery etc)
 show information, but clicking on Windows Update brings up nothing but the moving horizontal dots which signify loading. &nbsp;I ran the troubleshooter, but it couldn't find anything to fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hunted around online for a solution and ended up downloading a Windows Update Diagnostic tool from Microsoft. &nbsp;When it ran the first time it got stuck trying to start BITS Service (or something similar) for so long that I cancelled it to try something
 else. &nbsp;Having tried to run the diagnostic again since, it doesn't mention BITS but simply tells me it couldn't identify the problem. &nbsp;After this, I found a built in 'Contact Support' app - this took ages to load (more dots) told me I had to log in to continue
 and brought up more dots (yawn), then took me back to the log in to continue message, which brought up more dots and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to summarise, I can't get any information at all out of Windows Update, or Microsoft's built in trouble shooter or Diagnostic tool and can't see a way to roll back the most recent update - whenever that was. &nbsp;Neither can I use the Contact Support app.
 &nbsp; I'm reluctant to try 'Reset this PC' because everything else is working without a problem - I can connect to the internet, send and receive emails etc - and I don't want to lose all the software I've got installed. &nbsp;I've not had any notifications about updates
 failing or corrupted files, and I've not changed any of my settings or installed anything new. &nbsp;If it weren't for the fact that I felt like playing Solitaire I'd be blissfully unaware that Update had a problem at all. &nbsp;What do I do? &nbsp;I'm not very 'techy' or
 up with jargon, but before this I've been able to find answers to and sort out all my computer-related problems one way or another, so I'm not completely clueless either! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to Windows 7 computer using Remote desktop</h2>
                    <p>Original title: No remote access after installing Windows Updates</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing Windows update, I can no longer remote into my system. I had the issue in the same environment on a different PC and remove update KB2667402, once that was removed I could remote into that one. Tried the same thing on this PC and still could
 not remote in. Any ideas? </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried enabling and disabling remote desktop with multiple reboots. I've also tried installing and un-installing the same update multiple times. My last step was do a system restore, and that did not resolve the issue either. At this point, I'm debating
 on doing a clean install of Windows on that PC. Thoughts please?</div>

            <p><span>Hi NickIdol,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand the frustration you experience when you are unable to access a computer using remote desktop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Insufficient memory, problems with Network connectivity or third party programs might be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What <b>exactly happens</b> when you try to connect using remote desktop?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>
<p><b>Why can’t I connect using Remote Desktop Connection?</b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-can-t-I-connect-using-Remote-Desktop-Connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-can-t-I-connect-using-Remote-Desktop-Connection</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Clean boot</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> </span><strong><span>Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup</span></strong><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><strong><span>If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration Utility to perform clean boot, click Startup &amp; Services tab one at time and ensure wireless related
 entry is Checked (Enabled).</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists, let us know and we would be glad to help you.</span></p>

            Deepak B,
<div><br />
<div>I'm getting the following error:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Remote Desktop Disconnected</div>
<div><br />
<div>This Computer can't connect to the remote computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Again, this only started happening after Windows Updates were installed. I've un-installed several updates that I seen were giving users issues. This still didn't resolve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for any help</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
        </p>
