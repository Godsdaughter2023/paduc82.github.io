<h2>            After Replacement Of Keyboard Windows Hello Isn&#39;t Working ,But Before It Works Well....</h2>
                    <p>Respected Sir/Madam,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had changed my backlit keyboard of Dell Inspiron 5570 model as the right arrow key wasn't working well within a week after buying the product.When I called "DELL"they assured me &amp; replaced the keyboard.Afterward,At the
 time of replacing,the Technician had to open all whole set up of motherboard &amp; fixed my problem.At the same time I got a call from Dell Technical Support Team &amp; madam asked me about any other problem **** at the time of using this machine.As to answer it
 I gave a quick reply that ,My PC Is More Than Slow.Then she told the Technician to open the setting &amp; took changes in some settings .I thought it's the end of my problem buy it proves wrong when Windows Hello started not working...</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After restarting the windows there was no option for Pin or FingerPrint touch.I gave the password as that was the only one option for me.The windows opens &amp; Dell's fingerprint touch-pad can easily sense my FingerPrint,but
 Windows Hello can't recognize it.I told the Technician about the problem but he replied ,"it's not a problem of our Dell's product","It's undoubtly a problem of Windows".Afterwads I opened Sign-In options and setup fingerprint then Windows Hello asked me for
 a pin.After giving the Pin Windows Defender shows error that the pin can't be set,And again the option"Set Up"shows in the place of FingerPrint,which tells clearly about the fingerprint can't access by Windows Hello.Even after signing with Microsoft A/C again
 &amp; again this issue comes back time to time.Even changing to Local A/C this issue don't go.I called Dell Technical Support ,they covert the call to Windows team,where a person suggested me to write down my problems to their Web-Advisers &amp; promised me for solution.When
 I open Windows Defender it clearly shows no problem are in P.C &amp; the system is up to date!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'm facing this type of problems after changing my keyboard within 5 days of buying this product.<span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I'm

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted system files or corrupted drivers may be the possible reason why you're experiencing issues with Windows Hello. To assist you better, we'd like to know the build and version of Windows 10 you're using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you follow these options below on how to troubleshoot Windows Hello:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1: Turn off Fast Startup.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>power options</strong> in the Search box, and open <strong>Power Options</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Choose </strong>what the power buttons do.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change settings</strong> that are currently unavailable.</li><li>Uncheck the checkbox next to Fast Startup.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Although this option is actually recommended to be enabled, if you use Windows Hello to log in to your system, it’s better to have it disabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 2: Reinstall Windows Hello drivers</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you re-install the driver, make sure it’s updated first, by going to the Device Manager. If your Windows Hello driver is out of date, update it, restart your computer, and try running Windows Hello again.<br />
<br />
If your Windows Hello driver is up to date, try reinstalling it. To reinstall the Windows Hello driver in Windows 10, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Search</strong>, type <strong>device manager</strong>, and open
<strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Find your Windows Hello driver, right-click on it, and select <strong>Remove</strong> driver software.
</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>One the next startup, Windows 10 should automatically detect Windows Hello, and install the latest driver for it.</li><li>Once Windows 10 installs the driver again, try running Windows Hello to see if the issue is resolved.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Option 3: Make sure your camera drivers are compatible</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span> </span>button, type<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</li><li>
<p>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards,&nbsp;expand the&nbsp;<strong>Display adapters</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>category, right click
 your graphics card and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update Driver</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Option 4: Run Windows 10 Troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Search</strong>, type <strong>troubleshooting</strong>, and open
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Hardware &amp; sound section of the troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>Now, click on <strong>Hardware &amp; devices</strong>. </li><li>The troubleshooter will start, so wait for the process to finish, and follow further on-screen instructions.</li><li>If the troubleshooter found a problem with Windows Hello, it will automatically fix it.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you need additional help.</p>

    <title>New Windows 10 Pro PC won&#39;t download anything from the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> supermattvisor  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Windows 10 Pro PC won&#39;t download anything from the internet&#59; browsing works fine</h2>
                    <p>I have a secure and stable connection to the internet. I am able to get online and connect to my local network. The problem is that I am unable to download anything from the internet. This is a brand new computer and it has been this way from the beginning.
 Certain programs will were able to bypass this issue. For example, when I was downloading printer drivers (from the internet) through the printer companion software that was installed from a CD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to download anything from internet explorer (i.e. a document or different browser) it says " [name of document] couldn't be downloaded". When I attempt to "retry" it then appears to download but the file has a long garbled name and appears
 to be a blank notepad document or sometimes a notepad document with jumbled code (that's what it looks like to me since I can't read code).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my work computer and this issue is very disruptive to my work day. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you!</p>

<p>I am running Windows 10 Pro, version 1703. It says that my windows updates are up to date as of today. It only happens on Internet Explorer since that's all I have (Since I am unable to download any other browser). The computer came with McAfee anti-virus
 and I've turned off its firewall (which sometimes affects my ability to connect to my network printer) but that has done nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attempt to download a .exe file, it says it couldn't be downloaded. I hit retry and it downloads (kind of) because when I open it, it asks which program I'd like to use in order to open the file. Please help, this is really eating into productivity
 at work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have already attempted the suggestions in your previous message. It was already set to all those settings you suggested.</p>

            You've mentioned that your PC is a work PC.<br />
<br />
Learning about that, is it possible that your company has set limited actions on your device? Is your device under a domain? If yes, then possibly, you might not have administrator rights to be allowed to download anything from it without the permission from
 your company IT.<br />
<br />
You've also mentioned that it's a brand new PC. Is it still under warranty? If yes, have you tried bringing it to the manufacturer and see if they can still get those things checked?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

            No, there are no administrator restrictions. We are a small company and I was there helping with the setup. As far as I can tell, I have full administrative rights. I'm not sure about the warranty though. This is the second computer we bought from Microcenter.
 We took the first one back because it kept restarting itself, although that one also had the same issue downloading things. That is why I thought it was something I was doing wrong. I thought that 2 computers having the same downloading issue was too big of
 a coincidence. Especially considering we have 3 other computers purchased at the same place that are without issue.

            We appreciate you sharing us those information.<br />
<br />
However, it's good to know if you can learn if your PC is still under warranty, as you've mentioned that some of the PCs have been returned due to some issues as well.<br />
<br />
If you can't download anything using the Internet Explorer, have you tried downloading using Microsoft Edge?<br />
<br />
Is your PC an Enterprise version?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, let's see if doing this from a new administrator account will make a difference. If yes, then your current account might be corrupted.

            Well, I have decided that the issue was with internet explorer. It had been acting funny. Not only would it not download, but it wouldn't let me change the homepage. I ended up downloading Chrome on another computer and transferring it on a flash drive.
 I was able to install it and VOILA! I was able to download files. Thank you all for your help and support.&nbsp;

<h2>            Controller Repair</h2>
                    I bought an elite controller back in January and my left stick is already dragging so bad I can’t play. I did a service repair and they want me to send it back in for repair before I can get a new one. This process will not work for me as I stream on a
 daily basis and that is how I make my living. Is there any other way around this issue?

            To get it repaired or replaced you will have to send it in to Microsoft. They will not just send another controller to you with out first evaluating the condition of the controller in question.

<p>I have delt with this exact same issue. Its going to take week for them to get it either fixed or swapped out for a new one. If you do send it back, they have very specific information about what exactly you are supposed to send back with it: not the sticks
 and other accessories... Make sure you follow those directions to the letter as I did not and sent the Elite stick with all the accessories back and that was a nightmare getting it all back. Took weeks more time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My recommendation is to bring it with you with all your purchase receipts to a Microsoft store. I did this when my second Elite controller went bad. I was fortunate enough to have a competent store manager who did a direct swap for a new one. No waiting
 time or game play down time. Is that a guarantee? No, but its worth the trip.</p>

<p>It's best you call your local store first before you take it there for a repair.&nbsp; Now if you live in the U.S. the Elite controller only comes with a 90 day warranty.&nbsp; They won't be able to replacement it.&nbsp; However, if you brought it through Microsoft and
 got a extended warranty then your good.</p>

            I've only had good experiences when I can actually get to a store, across all Microsoft products, from Surface to Xbox.&nbsp; Only downside is there isn't one near my house, so it's only when I'm up in Charlotte or Atlanta that I can get to one, but I can't
 ever remember having a bad experience there.&nbsp; There is also a lot of real cool things at the NY MS Store; those people were the best!

    <title>trying to delete multiple files of the same type but get access denied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jacklroider  say:</h3>
<h2>            trying to delete multiple files of the same type but get access denied error message</h2>
                    I need to delete tens of&nbsp; thousands of files in hundreds of sub-directories, say all *.doc and *.docx files, while keeping others (say *.jpg and other media files).<br />
using the explorer search option is too slow and never does more than 200 files at a time.<br />
After checking some sites, I tried the cmd line entering the dos command del /s *.doc but got access denied.<br />
I changed the access rights on the entire drive, but that still would not help<br />
I ran command prompt as an administrator, but that would also not work<br />
I always get (in the command window) an access denied error message<br />
<br />
I am actually quite baffled that this does seem to be such a problem<br />

            <p><span>Hi Jack, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’d recommend you to take ownership of the folder and try deleting the files.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps: </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Start</b>, select
<b>Computer</b>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right-click the folder, click
<b>Properties</b> and then click the <b>Security</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Advanced</b>, and then click the
<b>Owner</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>Edit</b>, and then do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click <b>Other</b>
<b>users</b> <b>and</b> <b>groups</b> and, in Enter the object name to select (examples), type the name of the user or group, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>- To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>(Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Additionally, to delete all .docx files from a folder/subfolder, use this command:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>DEL /P /F /S /A "Full Path of Folder\*.extension"</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For instance, <span style="font-weight: bold">DEL /F /S /Q /A "D:\Test\*.docx"</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>/F - force deleting of read-only files.</span></p>
<p><span>/Q - quiet mode, does not ask for any confirmation prior to deleting the files.
</span></p>
<p><span>/A - allows file with set attributes (hidden files) to be deleted</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Files will be deleted permanently and not placed in the Recycle Bin first. You cannot recover the data unless you have a current backup.</span></p>

Thank you,</p>

<p>for your reply.</p>
<p>Actually this is what I had tried , but it still had not worked.</p>
<p>My layman's explanation is that when the search span is too wide, say an entire 1TByte, explorerr always wants to search the entire drive and gets somehow hung up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I eventually did, I used Directory Opus, and that worked like a razor.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Essentials for windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have a new windows 8 laptop which uses McAfee Security/Spy wear and my trial period has nearly expired, So a sizeable subscription is now required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to install Microsoft Essentials, I was informed by Microsoft that MS Defender was already installed ?.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I recover MS Defender/Essentials so I can therefore delete McAfee.</p>

            <p>Yes, Anti-Malware is already build into Windows 8 which is Windows Defender . When you install another Anti-Virus , it will be disable. If you uninstall McAfee and restart your PC, Windows Defender should turn on and you could check it by search for Windows
 Defender in start and see its status.</p>
<p>You might need to run Windows Update and install definition update for it. Take a look at:</p>

<h2>            Cod Ghost season pass &#40; Xbox 360 vs Xbox One&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I was checking the Season pass for COD: Ghost.</p>
<p>I'm confused. I wish there is some who could explain it better.</p>

<p>From the COD:Ghost web site</p>
<p><em>"When you buy the Call of Duty: Ghosts Xbox 360 Season Pass in the Xbox Live Marketplace, you will automatically receive access to download the equivalent Xbox One Season Pass on Xbox One, FREE of charge.&nbsp; You simply need to upgrade your game and Season
 Pass to the Xbox One version in the Xbox Live Marketplace by May 31, 2014and your content will then be available for download and play on your Xbox One (using the same Xbox Live account)."</em></p>

<p><em>Question: </em>If I the season pass today, does it mean I would be able to get the season pass Upgraded for Xbox One right away?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or do I need to wait until May 31, 2014? ? ?</p>

<p>Thanks Thanks</p>

<p><em>[/quote] </em></p>
<p><em>Yes you can upgrade to the one right away. I bought the season pass today for the 360 and was able to download the map packs onto the 360 and the XBone right away.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>You have until May 31, 2014 for the offer to be good. So today I paid $50.00 for the season pass on both consoles after May 31, 2014 my guess would be they would cost $50.00 each.</em></p>

<p>What console?</p>
<p>On both you should click season pass in the store of the multiplayer menu and double check that it has been downloaded and activated. Next you should click on the onslaught map pack. On the 360 it should be labeled 0.00 and able to download. On the one assuming
 you have both consoles you should do the same but the difference is it will say you already own it and you can install it from there. To check on the install you go to my games and apps.</p>

<p>If you have to uninstall ghost for any reason do not delete all because you will then be on the phone for hours for your season pass not reinstalling... I had a issue with it getting stuck on loading screen... so activision told me to uninstall all... but
 season pass and dlc will not redownload.. xbox gave me a refund only to buy the call of duty ghost hardend edition which still will not download the season pass.. sooo i have 2 digital copies of ghosts but no season.. i have to wait til next week for a tech
 from xbox to contact me... This is B/S &nbsp;just a heads up</p>

            <p>There is a workaround for this, but you have to go through google+ to get to it.&nbsp; I don't understand why it is this way, but it is working for me now.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">From Google+ account click on the Blue person up in the top right hand corner and in the pop-up window there should be a link "account" underneath the title and email address.&nbsp; If it is not there then you need to go to your main
 account below that and then do this step.&nbsp; ((((If you do not see the Blue person or are in youtube click on the blue square icon in the top right corner and click on the youtube settings icon (the little gear wheel) and then on the page that comes up -&nbsp; find
 and click "edit on google+" in the middle of the page by your account name.&nbsp; You might have to click on the blue square in the top right corner again and click on you account below to bring up the blue person icon.))))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on "Account" and on the next page click on the second tab - "Security"</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the next page go to the "Sign-in" section (square) and find the "app passwords" at the bottom and click on the link next to that.&nbsp; You might have to enter you password which is the normal account password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will bring you to a screen that allows you to set up an app for windows.&nbsp; Click where it says "Select App" and choose Youtube then click on the next field "select device" and choose windows computer.&nbsp; Then click the blue "generate" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A new window will popup with a 16 digit password.&nbsp; This is the password that you now must use for the connection between youtube and Live Move Maker.&nbsp; It says you don't have to remember it, but there is no way to save it so you must remember it or come back
 and regenerate another one of these every time you want to login.&nbsp; This isn't a very fun fix, but it works until Microsoft can get their heads together and fix this mess.&nbsp; I am sure it is the fault of google+and cell phone apps.&nbsp; Movie maker is about obsolete
 so they don't seem to care about keeping it current with all of the other technological changes happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this works for you!</p>

 the message box says the youtube plug-in.....I've changed the passwords both in my youtube channel account &amp; nothing seems to work. Ever since I added that damn Google+ it's been a nightmare!......Please help!</p>

<h2>            Re-installing OS Without Appropriate Setup Disk</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was recently given an OEM manufactured computer which has a Windows XP Professional COA sticker on the case, I would like to reinstall Windows as the current installation has been used by the previous owner with all kinds of modifications etc. I do not
 have the appropriate installation media, and there is no way I could obtain any kind of reinstallation disk as I believe the manufacturer DCT Systems is no-longer in the OEM business.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>I did however notice a "I386" folder on the root directory of drive C:, and found multiple guides explaining how to create an installation CD from this folder, however they include downloading certain files (The boot sector etc.)&nbsp;from external sources,
 leading me to believe this is not legal. </del>(Tried running WINNT32.exe in the I386 folder, and found it is missing many files.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a "HP Operating System CD" which contains a seemingly unmodified Windows XP Professional installation, however I have no idea what kind of terms this disk could be bound under.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to reinstall Windows on this PC?</p>
<p>

<p><span>Hi Thomas,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The text input option in Microsoft Paint by default uses a black cursor when being used to enter text. If the image has different colors the cursor will have a
 white border around it to make more visible. Currently, there is no option to change the cursor style in Microsoft Paint.

    <title>THIS PAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> somwhereintime2000  say:</h3>
<h2>            THIS PAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED</h2>
                    <p>I did as instructed, START: msconfig, Selective start up&nbsp;1) uncheck load startup 2) SERVICES: hide all, DISABLE ALL, ok, RESTART.&nbsp; I have no idea what that CLEAN BOOT accomplished.&nbsp; Now I see most of the SERVICES are either STOPPED OR RUNNING.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I went to Microsoft fix it solution center: <strong>IE hangs up or freezes</strong>, RUN NOW&nbsp;(troubleshooting encountered an error &amp; cannot continue).&nbsp; THIS IS MY PROBLEM so why can't Microsoft fix it or tell me what the problem is?&nbsp; I have seemed to follow
 every suggestion &amp; update &amp; nothing fixes the problems of 'cannot be displayed' or no 'tool bar'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>then I ran <strong>FIX&nbsp;IE (FAST, SAFE &amp; STABLE)</strong>&nbsp;report was Data Ext Prev. Disabled-FIXED.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>now I'm to the point I don't know if the SERVICES in the CLEAN BOOT&nbsp;that were changed was the right thing to do, should some or all be changed back?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft updates updated to IE 11 now, it seems before I had IE 10 I had no problems now I have even more.&nbsp; What can I expect from IE 11?</p>
<p>Look forward to anyone with some expertise to help, thank you</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>when I open IE there is no TOP TOOL BAR as I've always had with (FILE, etc.) so I can't print preview, print or send a page.&nbsp; What happened to it?</p>

            <p>thank you for responding and trying to help me.&nbsp; I did as you instructed but when I try to open IE or my homepage yahoo I get nothing but a half blank page.&nbsp; there is no way to SEARCH or add a web page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did do the RESTART but have <strong>questions</strong> about the following:</p>
<p>Security Settings</p>
<p>Privacy&nbsp;&nbsp;Settings</p>
<p>Pop up&nbsp;&nbsp;Settings</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>DISABLE TOOLBARS &amp; ADD- ON'S</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>WILL I HAVE TO GO BACK &amp; RESET THE ABOVE SETTINGS, if so, how &amp; where?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>before the toolbar disappeared I at least had a web page, now none opens.</p>
<p>when I would try to go to another web page that is when I would get the message "THIS PAGE CANNOT BE DISPLAYED" no matter how many times I tried.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I will be restarting the computer now &amp; will let you know tomorrow 11/17/13 what happened.&nbsp; maybe then you can tell me about my above questions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

<p>This might only happen once.&nbsp; Were you able to change your Home page back to Yahoo!?&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>FWIW I don't see anything like your Tracking Protection list.&nbsp; I'm wondering if you got a customized IE to install?&nbsp; I think that Yahoo has such a version.&nbsp; Perhaps you would get a TPL&nbsp;with it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In any case, to try to simplify things, let's just work on your connectivity symptoms in this thread.&nbsp; It's possible that with that as a focus some of your other issues may be resolved in that process.</p>

This seems so unreal - like the Twilight Zone!<br />
<br />
I searched for "Change the time zone" as you said and it showed the CORRECT time; the same time showing on both phones beside me - cell and land line; 8:45 PM</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However is showed PST when I live in NC (Eastern). I changed it nonetheless and not is says 11:46PM!!<br />
<br />
Too weird for me.<br />
<br />
I checked the Outlook settings and it was already set to Eastern and I put that in the label box and hit save.<br />
<br />
I am so lost now with no idea what to do!<br />
<br />
Best regards,</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Okay, the steps below&nbsp;worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. open a command window with admin privileges and attempt a "net stop wuauserv", if that doesn't work, you might want to use the GUI (I did) and go into Start -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Services and look for the Windows Update service</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. It might say something like "stopping" or "starting", change it's status to DISABLED and hit OK</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. upon starting Windows, go back to Start -&gt; Computer Management -&gt; Services and ensure that the Windows Update service is in a DISABLED state and not running (keep this window open)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. navigate to c:\windows (or installed directory)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. look for a folder named "SoftwareDistribution"</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. rename it to "SoftwareDistribution.OLD" (other people suggest deleting it, but I didn't in case it was different on Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Return to the Windows Update service and change it's startup type to "Manual"</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. go to Start - Settings (Cog icon) - Update &amp; security and run Windows Update again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should start checking and downloading updates, hope it works for others!</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Alex, I think what you were describing was a proposed solution (from another Microsoft community post) to a problem I had with my mail/calendar apps earlier. I posted a screenshot below. The trouble is I got to about step 2 in yours and it's been over
 a day and it hasn't finished stopping the Windows Update. </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a9d9804-030c-4712-beae-62ae23dc9b01" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>How long did it take for you? I feel like something might be wrong. My computer was lagging a lot and I noticed the (0x80080008) error message. The mail/calendar apps still don't work for me (as expected), but after rebooting my computer, the lag is less
 evident. How can I solve this? Also is it safe to do a system image or reset now?</p>

            <p>Hey there, hmm, for me it was a pretty immediate commencement of Windows Updates starting to download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for clarification - I'm another forum member, and not a Microsofter :o), lots of lagging in general? Did you upgrade from Windows 8.1, 8, 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had another machine that had gone through the upgrade, and it was super laggy, in that particular case I created a recovery USB key, which allowed me to perform a reset AND re-install the operating system fresh (wiped all files off the system), not saying
 that is the best approach, but for another one of my systems, it was the only option. (refresh couldn't repair the artifacts of an upgrade from 8.1 to 10).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never tried to download something from the Store. Just looking at your screenshot, I don't think you'd be able to get away with renaming SoftwareDistribution to SoftwareDistribution.old unless Windows Update service was first changed to Disabled, and then
 you rebooted, renamed SoftwareDistribution to SoftwareDistribution.old, and then re-enabled it, but that was my own experience.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you might consider is first using the following approach:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on Start button, open Control Panel, then go to Troubleshooting, then under Troubleshooting, look for System and Security - Fix problems with Windows Update and
<em><strong>then perform </strong></em>the steps I indicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dunno what to say about Mail and Calendar apps, not sure what might be going on with them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope my advice helps :o)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            You can delete the Windows.old folder.&nbsp; Here is how to do it: go to the start screen and press Win-I.&nbsp; Select Tiles and Turn Administrative Tiles On.&nbsp; Run the Disk Cleanup tool and when that is finished (it will probably take an hour or more), run the
 Dick Defragmenter tool.&nbsp; That will take another hour or so.&nbsp; The Disk Cleanup tool will delete the folder and the Defragmenter tool will make your computer run faster.&nbsp; The E: drive, at least on my computer, is the optical drive and the D: drive is where your
 system images are kept.&nbsp; You can use the F: drive, which, at least on my computer, is an external hard drive, to store some of your files.&nbsp; Then you can just leave it plugged in to your computer and access those files from there.

There was a big update rolled out a few days ago, could it be that it added another 2 mcbuilder.exe (so there were 4 instead of 2) and Eset falsely marked it as virus?</p>

                    <p>The manual says</p>
<p>" the AKM320 does not need other driver to work with a computer, only needs the USB Audio Driver built in the system."</p>
<p>
</p><p>i go to my device manager ,&nbsp; the device status says</p>
<p>
</p><p>"&nbsp;Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)<br />
A request for the USB device descriptor failed." </p>
<p>
</p><p>So J uninstalled it , restarted the computer and still says&nbsp; the same thing . </p>
<p>The driver details say</p>

<p><span>Hi Addy Adkins, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions for us.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>May I know the device manufacturer name and model number?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is the device working on another computer?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Please note that Code 43 error occurs when one of the drivers controlling the device notifies the Operating System that the device failed in some manner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please try these steps and let us know-</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>- Please run the hardware troubleshooter. This is the
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-hardware-and-system-trouble-shooter/39029d76-d6eb-4b84-82ac-2016686e44d7">
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>- I would suggest you to disable and re-enable the USB controllers:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">1. Press Windows key + R on the keyboard. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">2. Type “<strong>devmgmt.msc” </strong>without quotes, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. Device Manager opens. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">3.&nbsp;Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">4.&nbsp;Right click the first USB controller under <strong>
Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>, and then click <strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove it.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">5. Repeat Step 4 for each USB controller that is listed under
<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">- Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><strong>Method 3</strong> – Reinstall the device driver manually.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>From Start, search for <strong>device manager</strong> and select Device Manager from the results.</span></li><li><span>Right-click the device in the list.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Uninstall</strong> from the menu that appears.</span></li><li><span>After the device is uninstalled, choose <strong>Action</strong> on the menu bar.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> to reinstall the driver.</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">Note-</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"> You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver.&nbsp; If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware
 vendor’s website.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit Blue Screen HP Compaq Cq41-206TU</h2>
                    So i am using a HP Compaq Cq41-206TU and i was using windows 7 ultimate 32-bit and i decided to upgrade to 64-bit. So i bought windows 7 64-bit but when i tried to install, i got many blue screens (Error: 124 , 101 , 9e, 7c) and so on and so forth, but
 when i downgraded back to 32-bit it worked just fine. Can someone help me here please, ive been trying for days now.

<p>The system might have a 64 bit capable processor, but it doesn't necessary mean the entire system is 64 bit compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if the system already had a Windows 7 Ultimate license, there is no need to purchase another license. The same license used to install and activate Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit, can also be used to install activate the 64 bit Ultimate version too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the drivers page for this model, I do see 64 bit Windows 7 drivers:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/drivers/selfservice/compaq-presario-cq41-200-notebook-pc-series/4075892/model/4110650" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/ph-en/drivers/selfservice/compaq-presario-cq41-200-notebook-pc-series/4075892/model/4110650</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, its possible the reason you are experiencing crashes is because important software drivers are not installed or the install media itself might be a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Go to Heidoc, download and create a 64 bit Windows 7 Ultimate ISO media:</p>

<p>thanks but thing is, its happening during a windows install, after it has restarted to complete the install,&nbsp; a blue screen will appear, so i dont see any solution there to help me....</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Undo recent changes using System Restore (wouldnt work when u dont even have windows installed)</p>
<p>- Use action center to check for solutions to problems (again, no windows, no action center)</p>
<p>- Check windows update for software updates (and again no windows)</p>
<p>- search for drivers on manufacturer's website (how do i install a driver with no windows?)</p>
<p>- Use safe mode to troubleshoot problems (much nope,no windows so again,dosent work)</p>
<p>- Check your computer for hard disk and memory errors ( been there done that, everythings fine P.S i spent few hours running the check)</p>
<p>
</p><p>it also says</p>
If you can't start Windows at all 
<div>The following tools can help you uninstall or roll back software changes, repair Windows startup files, and restore your system from an earlier backup. If none of those suggestions fix the problem, you can reinstall
<span><span><span><span>Windows&nbsp;7</span></span></span></span>.
<p>
</p><p>i cant even installl it so how do i "reinstall", there are no software changes cuz i dont even have software and windows startup files? none<br />
</p>
<p>is there any other info u can provide me with that would help? sorry for the inconvenience</p>

<h2>            Password</h2>
                    I am currently trying to sort out my 82 year old father's skype account. What a palaver. &nbsp;He cannot remember his password so i tried the recover thing. &nbsp;Hmmm. His recovery email is his old hotmail which was hacked so cannot access. &nbsp;Tried another email
 but could not give enough info according to the email i received. Now there is no option. &nbsp;You cannot even contact skype. Ironic. His contacts are lost. Did all this nonsense start when microft got involved. &nbsp;Why do we have to log in to microsoft? &nbsp;I will
 add they were good at taking money out of his account so he has credit which is also lost. &nbsp;Any ideas of getting some answers?

            Hello What a pain<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose

            I recommend you contact chat support and choose Technical problem so an agent can help diagnose whats the problem with your account:
<br />
<br />Go to the following link to get assisted live support:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/contactus/s...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Account &amp; sign-in 
<br />Select Payment and Purchases 
<br />Click Chat
<br />
<br />By the way - downgrading to Skype Classic is not going to resolve this problem.
