<p>Greetings, demonizer andy. As a first step I'd recommend going through this troubleshooter to see if it can't help you get this resolved "<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/disc-drive/disc-drive-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Disc Drive Solution</a>".
 In addition, are the games you are trying to play installed to your hard drive or are you attempting to play them directly from the disc itself?</p>

    <title>Connecting to a shared printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fastncrazy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting to a shared printer</h2>
                    <div>I cannot connect to a shared printer on my home network. The printer is connected to a desktop computer running Windows XP connected to the router via CAT5 cable. My laptop is running Windows 10 connected to my router via wireless. The Windows XP computer
 is not a member of a domain but rather a Workgroup. The sharing properties for the printer on the Windows XP computer are set to allow all users to print. I can see the printer in the Add Printer dialog window on my Windows 10 laptop. I have tried most of
 the obvious methods for adding a printer to no result other than failure. Any help would be greatly appreciated! Frustrated to say the least.</div>

<p>As your response about settings in Windows XP was quite vague I am not sure what you are talking about. The shared printer worked under Windows 8.1 on the same configuration as now but after the upgrade to Windows 10 I began getting the failure to connect
 to printer error message. I can see and access all shared files and folders on the Windows XP computer. I can even see the printer. The &nbsp;Windows XP computer and the Windows 10 computer use the same router. Still looking for some definitive help and suggestions
 on the issue.</p>

Have you installed a Windows 10-compatible driver on the laptop?<br />

            <p>It could be a driver problem, where Windows 10 does not like the printer driver.&nbsp; How old is the printer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also some printers have a newer driver that comes in for Windows 10 via Windows update.&nbsp; It might be worth a try to get it working even temporarily on the Windows 10 machine that way you know you have a working driver, then try to move it back to the XP
 machine if you want to keep it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason Windows 10 can't share an XP printer, other than the driver being incompatible.&nbsp; When you connect the share, it tried to download the driver from the XP machine, and maybe that driver is too old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try getting the newest driver you can on the XP machine for that printer then try to connect to it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope this helps...</p>

            That's a pretty old printer.&nbsp; I would try connecting it to the laptop directly just to see if it will work at all with Windows 10.

<p>I connect directly to the printer via USB and Windows 10 installed a driver for it. I was able to print a test page and a single page document with no issues. I still cannot print to it through the wireless connection to my Windows XP computer when the printer
 is attached to the Windows XP computer.</p>

<h2>            Freezing&#47;crashing Issues after upgrade and clean install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm having major issues with random freezing and crashing on my PC with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reserved W10 before the release and had run all compatibility checks with no issues whatsoever. When I upgraded from Win7 64bit to 10, the upgrade worked fine until the first Win10 boot which froze and crashed during set up. After a hard reset, I was able
 to complete setup and bring the system up and running. From that point on within at least every 10 minutes of use, the machine would freeze and crash (many times the cursor would still respond to the mouse, but nothing was clickable). Also, if the computer
 was asleep, often I would would go to wake it up and the login screen would appear but the computer would be frozen from minutes/hours ago. Again the cursor would respond, but nothing clickable. Have to hard reset every 10 minutes. There seems to be no pattern
 to the crashes in terms of software usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After fully updating Win10 through Windows Updates with no different results, I decided that a clean install was the way to go. I wiped/clean installed Win 10 with exactly the same results except the setup didn't crash this time. Another note is that both
 times I installed, there would be no sound until the computer had rebooted/updated. Then the sound would work fairly normally. At random intervals the sound would also seem to just cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess has always been hardware/driver incompatibility. However all Win10 checks showed full compatibility for all hardware (despite a few elements being a bit dated). Here's a full list of hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus M4A87TD Evo motherboard</p>
<p>VIA Audio VT1818 Audio Codec</p>
<p>AMD Athlon II XP 635 Processor</p>
<p>12 gigs of Crucial RAM</p>
<p>AMD Radeon HD 6800</p>
<p>Atheros AR922X based Wireless Adapter</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reverted to Windows 7 clean install until I can get some assurance that the hardware is in fact compatible with Windows 10. Any thoughts on what else this could be?</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help with this. Just to clarify, When reverting to WIndows 7 OR when I clean installed windows 7, I have no issues whatsoever. The system runs perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue for me is that whenever Windows 10 is running, immediately there are system freezes/hangs which I described above.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bring this up because the links you sent seem to focus on resolving hangs and freezes on Windows 7 and 8 which I'm not experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you face might be with your motherboard. Your motherboard M4A87TD EVO is made specifically for windows 7 and though it can work in windows 10, its architecture is simply unable to handle the load put forth by Windows 10 efficiently thereby resulting
 in crashes and freezes even after you did a clean install. We deduced this conclusion as you mentioned that you face no issues while running windows 7. So, to know more about your device specs, please refer the below link:</p>

<p>After doing a Recovery and Restart, the screen no longer reaches all the way to the sides of the Display. It used to go all the way out on both sides, but somehow it got reset? Can someone help me change it back to the "full screen" setting? Thank you.........

            Hi ACORN1<br /><br />Please try the following: In the Kubuntu launch menu, type password to find the utility Passwords and Keys. Open this utility.<br />In the panel on the left you should see an entry Login in the section Passwords. Right click on Login, and select Change Password from the pop-up menu.<br />You'll need to enter your current password first, then it asks for a new password<br />Just leave the fields blank and press Continue.<br />Once you have done that, you should be able to open Skype without being prompted for the keyring password.<br /><br />Obviously, this approach assumes you are fine with not having this extra layer of security on your keyring, but I expect for most home users this is perfectly fine.<br /><br />Source: <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/962733/how-can-i-open-skype-without-entering-a-keyring-password-each-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://askubuntu.com/questions/962733/how-can-...</a><br /><br />Note: This is a non-Microsoft websit

<p>
</p><p>1. Scansoft PaperPort 11. It looks like it does not recognize my Brother MFC 7440N laser printer. The printer works just fine trying to print&nbsp; documents.</p>
<p>2. Win 10 changed the folder permissions. Most were then read only but I fixed them one at a time.
</p>
<p>3. Might have missed some folders.</p>
<p>4. Windows Fax and Scan cannot run as it cannot access your documents folder. Please ensure that Windows Fax and Scan can access that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed your suggested steps but it did not work.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>

</p><p>I suggest you to check if you have the <strong>My Documents </strong>folder at the below file location:</p>

<p>

 If a </span><strong><span>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</span></strong><span> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Right click on the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, click on

<span>Type “<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>” without the quotes and hit

<h2>            HELP &#33;  My Lenovo T400 won&#39;t Boot Properly after a Windows 10 Update Today &#33;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;have been running Window 10 32 bit on my Lenovo T400 for over 1 year with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, computer had a large "update" for Windows 10.. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After update, display looked poorer than normal. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Went to control panel, and did not have any options for the display resolution or the refresh rate. m Seamed to be set at 1200 X 800, with refresh of 64Hz ?
</p>
<p>Shaded in a cell was "recommended 1200 X 768". &nbsp;but could not select that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran lenovo solutions, and downloaded 2 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the computer won't even boot up. &nbsp;Gets stuck and HD light stops blinking and goes dark... &nbsp;So it just sits there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what happened and how to recover my computer?</p>

<h2>            Game DVR lags game streaming</h2>
                    <p>On both The xbox app and Xbox beta, game DVR causing streaming to lag heavily. This has only started since the last update and the lag goes away when I turn game DVR off. My computer has no problems during streaming with ram or cpu usage. What are alternative apps I can use for recording that will allow me to upload to xbox live.</p>

            Hi Aba, BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi AbaYomi1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

    <title>Power Brick fan noise&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Power Brick fan noise&#63;</h2>
                    I'm on my 2nd xbox one and only noticed the noise from the power brick on the 2nd console, so not too sure how common this noise is. But I can hear the fan (buzzing/humming) coming from the power brick, I wouldn't say its really loud but at quite times
 in my room whilst gaming I can hear this annoying humming. Ive had a really good listen (resting my head on the brick..lol) and it really does sound like the fan spinning, so I don't think its electrical. But is this a normal sound to be hearing? Ive googled
 it and theres a lot of topics but they seem to be really loud, and have been told by MS to return them. Not something I want to do if this is a common thing. Just wanted to know if there is a fix, or is this something that's normal and to put up with the slight
 sounds. Ive also seen a video on the net of a someone fixing a noisy fan in a 360 by taking the brick apart and greesing up the fan.. and the fan turns super quite... could this be a fix on xboxone? once again xbox making me a

<p>I don't really hear mine at all, but it sits behind my entertainment setup. &nbsp;The best advice I can offer is to try and keep it clean, away from dust an an area where it can "breathe" - not sitting by other electronics putting out heat and especially not
 on carpet or locked in a closed entertainment center or anything like that. If you have to rest on the brick or near it to hear it, I wouldn't worry. &nbsp;If its rattling/vibrating or humming loud, then I would get a replacement.</p>

<p>thanks, my power brick is raised above the carpet (I use the cable from it to rest on on) nothing is near it which would cause any obstruction in air, It can't be dusty already only had it for a week. But it just sounds like the fan working.. but after all
 the shouting about by MS how quite the system is its making me wonder is it all right, cause when gaming I can hear this very slight but annoying humming/ticking.</p>

<p>It's not normal. A lot of us have/had the same problem and were pestering Microsoft about it and getting nowhere. They went you to either send the console back to where you got it from, let them put a $500 hold on your account to send you a new one (even
 though only the PSU is faulty), or give them $20 for shipping charges for a new PSU, despite the product being under full warranty. It's an absolute joke.</p>

                    I was a Skype user many years ago, prior to its sale/migration to Microsoft.&nbsp; I use Windows products, and recently downloaded Skype from the Microsoft site because I had occasion to use it after many years of dormancy.&nbsp; Now this has become my nightmare.&nbsp;
 I have numerous email addresses, names, and sign-ins for Skype and can't figure out a way to winnow it down to one.&nbsp; Additionally, I try to videoconference and although the tests run on my laptop work on both the audio and video, the videoconferencing feature
 does not work.&nbsp; I din't want Skype to make phone calls--that's why I have two phones.&nbsp; I want to use it to videoconference.&nbsp; I try to find "help" and the only choices I am given are the "virtual" feature or the "community."&nbsp; The virtual does not help with

<p>
</p><p>In my friends case, he has concocted several user profiles but has totally&nbsp;</p>
<p>lost the plot by making the corresponding user emails totally unfathomable..!</p>
<p>I manage to remove some, but other's won't delete. So I just need to be able&nbsp;</p>
<p>to clear the profiles that don't work, and keep (the two profiles that I think do-
</p>
<p>work)..! So really, I just need to remove the unusable profiles if that is possible..?

</p><p>Well, after trying all the suggestions (and ''thanks'' to everyone who responded) to my question/s&nbsp;</p>
<p>regarding this particular case. My friend and I, have finally decided to close his Microsoft account&nbsp;</p>
<p>and then open a new one, so as facilitate a clean and fresh start in that new account..!
</p>
<p>This may not be a suitable action for many people who have large amounts of data or files in their
</p>
<p>account's, and if this option is your choice of resolving any problem, then do make sure that all your
</p>
<p>files, document's photos are all backed up on an outboard hard drive. </p>
<p>So ''Many thanks'' again guys ''Forwards and upwards''..!&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

    <title>My rewards are not updating - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My rewards are not updating</h2>
                    <p>Hello, this is my first time writing in this forum. I have been a rewards member almost&nbsp;since it's inception. The biggest perk for me by far are rewards credits deposited to my account. The problem I've been having is that despite spending a lot of money in the store my rewards do not seem to reflect accurately. I'm in the&nbsp;8%&nbsp;gold&nbsp;tier but do not see a return of that amount. If I spend $100, I should get back 8% correct? I have not observed this&nbsp;to be true. &nbsp;Additionally, the punch card&nbsp;promotional for preordering 3 games for&nbsp;15,000 credits has not kicked in. I preordered Battlefield 1, Skyrim, and Call of Duty Infinite Warfare. Please help.</p>

</p><p>Hello dragunrising,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>MyVIP payback is for eligible, non-offer purchases for your account. If one of your purchases went toward an offer, we can only Reward purchases once, so you would receive offer Credits and not Credits from MyVIP. Regarding what qualifies as an "eligible" purchase, the common offenders for eligibility that users commonly ask about are the fact that pre-orders, game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for MyVIP, and do not award payback or progress. I have reviewed your purchases and can confirm that you were Rewarded appropriately. For example, your recent payback for November was accurate. You may have expected more, but since your 3000 Crowns purchase was a game consumable, it was not eligible for Rewards.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regarding the Games on Demand punchcard, and most offers in general, we only Reward for purchases made during the offers time period. Since your purchase of Battlefield 1 and Call of Duty was before the offer period for this Games on Demand, they were not eligible for a punch for this offer.</p>

<h2>            Rippoff&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Am I being ripped off? I noticed being charge renewal of Skype number today. I was sure I cancelled this over the phone a year ago. It seems that the skype number was not cancelled but the monthly use subscription was cancelled. &nbsp;If I cannot use the number
 why am I being charged for it. I went ahead and cancelled the number subscription also but it showed deactivated but no refund and I can continue to use the number. I called for help and was told that the number was being hacked and in use for the last 6 months.
 How can this be when no usage payment from me. when I asked about a refund the agent hung up. I made several calls and each agent hung up as soon as I used the word "refund." the website does not show any refund form or any method to request a refund. Just
 takes you around in circles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I am due a refund not only for last year but also for the current year which is not even started or in effect. It says it will expire 9/24/18. I have not used it and I cannot use it without monthly subscription. Nor can anyone use it for the same
 reason. I Skype is hacked it is not my responsibility.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am not sure what number or agent you called with, but the official way to contact customer support is
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1170/how-do-i-contact-skype-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that the number is still active on your account. You should be able to cancel your subscription when you log into your account on web. If you have any trouble deactivating it and want to request a refund, you should contact the customer support
 on the link above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the number being hacked, I can see 2 calls this year and the last one in May was picked up, so if it wasn't you, it is possible someone else might have access to your Skype account and I would recommend changing password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps and if you have any other questions, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day,</p>

<h2>            Right Mouse clicker on Laptop is not working&#47;functioning</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
I really don't know what else to do, so hopefully the problem can be fixed here. <br />
Recently, within the last 2 days, I started having problems with the mouse clicker buttons on my laptop (Dell Inspiron/Windows Vista), where the right button is basically disabled and not working at all (if I click it nothing happens). The left clicker sometimes
 did the actions that the right side clicker would do (usually when I would start the computer up in the morning), but after I clicked CRTL, ALT, DELETE and went back to the screen the left clicker would work properly again. The right mouse still does not work.
<br />
I'm cleaned out the keyboard of crumbs, hair, dirt ect, restarted over and over, did a system scan, installed and ran the Windows Fix for common problems (they didn't find anything wrong), and tried to change the functions of the clickers in the Control Panel
 (even when I switched the right clicker to the primary button, nothing happened).<br />
Any help? This has never happened before nor have I installed or done anything different lately. The laptop isn't old either.<br />

                    Whenever I am in Cygwin the CPU usage of Windows Explorer will abruptly spike to ~20% and stay there until I close close explorer, the same goes for MinGW/MSYS except that the CPU spikes to ~80%.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<p>The applications that you are referring consume more CPU usage than normal. In this scenario you need a sound hardware to get your CPU usage down to 10%.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>To help you with the issue please answer the following questions: </span>
</p>
1. Which antivirus application are you using?<br />
<span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to your computer?</span>
<br />
3. What is the make and model of your computer?<br />
<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and update us on the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Let’s place the computer in clean boot mode and open these applications one at a time and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Clean boot will help us to identify if any third party applications or start up items are causing the issue.

<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”.
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
Also use the Process Explorer to check what are the applications that are loading when you see more CPU usage.

<h2>            Weird Color Scheme On EVERYTHING  On My Computer</h2>
                    For some reason, without any warning, my screen goes into some sort of "color blind mode"??? I've been searching for a solution for the past hour and I keep getting the same "turn on/off high contrast mode" line, and it is NOT that. For example: the color
 blue looks orange, green is now magenta, and yellow is blue! I can't find what to do ANYWHERE! Please help, this is making everything very difficult to work with and is also very frustrating. Thank you in advance.

<p>Hi Sebastian,<br />
<br />
<br />
We understand that this weird color stuff just occurred for some reason. However, can you still remember any recent changes you've made before it happened?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you also tried choosing a theme for your background? Did it change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you're not experiencing an account specific issue, let's <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-US/help/13951" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create another administrator account</a></strong> to see if the same issue will occur.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards. </p>
