<h2>            Windows 7 Freezes after Login and More Recently Just Turns Off</h2>
                    <p>So I built myself a fairly high end gaming and development rig a while back, on a student budget. I've always had a few issues with freezing occasionally but never as bad as recently. The original issue used to be that after boot, I login and I can use it
 for a while while it loads my widgets, and startyp program and services, but after a few minutes, it might just freeze. Once I left it for a good 12 hours and still it hadn't un-frozen. A hard restart used to fix this but since, this still doesn't fix the
 problem. A few months after I built it, I got a second hand hard drive from a part exchange place and has a second OS on this. The problem went away after a few months and I had a few month with it working fine (only the occasional freeze up). More recently,
 it had come back, and I also got an error very frequently saying my computer was not powerful enough to run Aero graphics or something very similar and I just told it tto leave it as it was. I didn't understand because I have a GTX 660 card which runs games
 perfectly, and I have a i5 on turbo which is more than my laptop has and that runs aero fine. I was getting so fed up with the freezing that I cleared my other HDD of Linux and put a full copy of Windows 8.1 Embedded that I can get as a student from Microsoft
 and now, 7 has got so bad that it freezes after every login.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I spend all afternoon trying to sort this out. I doubted it was hardware based considering any OS I put on the other drive was fine and ran perfectly, but I still pulled a lot of stuff out and gave the enitre thing a good clean (my CPU cooler
 was pretty thick ith dust over half theheatsink next to the fan. I booted it up after and it started booting then just randomly turned off.. It did this a few times then booted fine and I booted into 8.1, no problems. Booted into 7 and it did it's usual freezing
 thing. I then booted into safe mode, and ran a selectective startup (in msconfig) with none of the services enabled and it worked fine. I then went and enabled all the microsoft services and all my NVIDIA servies, still fine. Then I turned of some others like
 Steam update, teamviewer, Skype Updater.. Still working and I can use it, just missing some other services I hadn't enabled. I thought if I re-enalbed a few at a time and see how that goes, until I find any that caause freezing. I turned it off last night,
 with just the MS ones and the NVIDIA ones and the few other I mentioned. Came to it this morning and 7 boots, I login and then it crashed, it waits a few minutes then just dies and the system turns off. It's done it before occasionally, but today it just did
 it every time I tried to boot into it. (tried 3 times). Oh and my keyboard has stopped working with anything too this morning (even 8.1). I have lots of valuable data and licences and software on 7 I don'twant to lose so I don't want to do a software rebuild
 just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, yesterday when it worked, I ran all sorts of windows diagnostics, HDD cleanup and defrag, registry cleaan and defrag. Everythnig I could find. I and running a HDD check over teamviewer now (in 8.1) and eevery test so far, the HDD for 7 has passed.
 I am literally stuck, I've been searching like mad everywhere and I can't find out how to sort the thing out :(</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Which program did you use to clean your registry? It is NOT recommended to use third party registry cleaners. However there are few safe ones to use but again it is NOT recommended to use. They could cause more problems than repairs!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please provide list of your security programs and any other software running on your PC (e.g. your start up programs)

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for the information.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing this problem after using registry cleaner, please consider using System Restore or Restore your registry from backup
</p>
<p>If that is not your case then:</p>
<p>Before following below steps, please go to Safe Mode Or Safe Mode with Networking if you need to use internet by pressing F8 button rapidly after you turned on your PC.</p>
<p>Consider performing "Clean Boot":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It involves disabling all start up programs and NONE windows services through msconfig (type in windows search in start menu) then restart your PC see if that make a difference?<br />
If it did then you will need find out which program or service is causing the problem by re-enabling them again. Consider to minimize your start up programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform scan using</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/</a>&nbsp;( Recommended )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your system is clean first. Use CCleaner to get rid of junk files ONLY (Consider using portable version)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner/builds</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also check for viruses i.e. using Avast free <a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a> ( Recommended ) or if you have an&nbsp;anti virus program&nbsp;make sure that it is up to date!</p>
<p>Please note that I personally prefer Avast to MSE as it has higher detection rate and it provides much better protection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check for Spyware i.e. using Superantispyware <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a> try using portable version so you don't have to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also scan using&nbsp;Hitman Pro &nbsp;<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.surfright.nl/en/products/</a>&nbsp; to make sure that you system is clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that all driver are working properly, check all your drivers through device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My final advise: You do not require AVG or Tune up utilities to speed up your PC.
</p>
<p>I recommend to uninstall the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, If you need to maintain your PC and speed it up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Run disc clean up and de fragment regularly </p>
<p>2. Uninstall any programs you do not use or rarely use! e.g. tool bars etc.</p>
<p>3. Do not use any third party software to speed up !! Not Needed!</p>
<p>4. Make sure your windows is up to date and all drivers are up to date and working properly.</p>
<p>5. Minimize your start up programs through msconfig</p>
<p>6. Protect your PC using SpywareBlaster against Spyware, Malware&nbsp; etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.brightfort.com/spywareblaster.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.brightfort.com/spywareblaster.html</a>and use FireFox as your browser.</p>
<p>7. If you really need to use registry cleaner, I personally use CCleaner and I never had problems with it but again make sure that you create backups.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also remember to use only one anti virus program for real time protection and one firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have noticed that you have lot of start up programs, They use lot of memory or RAM and resources as soon as you log in to Windows therefore if you do not have sufficient amount of RAM consider disabling few start up programs except your security programs.</p>

            Hi,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What steps did you follow to connect the 2 computers with the same IP address?</p>
<p>2. How are the 2 computers connected?</p>
<p>3. How exactly do you want to stop the connectivity between the 2 computers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to tell you that 2 computers on the same network can not have the same address. Each machine must have a unique address to identify it. A private network, such as a home network connected to the internet, can be connected to a router to connect
 it to larger network, will only have 1 address, a public IP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, if we know the IP address of a computer along the user ID and password we can access the computer/shared files.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are referring to changing the IP address of the two computers you may follow these steps and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Open Network Connections. Click the Start button, then click Control Panel. In the search box, type "adapter," and then, under Network and Sharing Center, click View network connections.<br />
<div>b. Right-click the connection that you want to change. Click Properties. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</div>
<div>c. Click the Networking tab. Under This connection uses the following items, click either Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) or Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6), and then click the Properties button. To specify your IP address for IPv4, click
 Use the following IP address, and then, in the IP address, Subnet mask, and Default gateway boxes, type the IP address settings.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>A typical IPv4 address looks like 192.168.0.2; a typical subnet mask would be 255.255.255.0. The Default Gateway is generally the address of your router.
<div>For example, IP Address: 192.168.0.2 through 192.168.0.12 (for multiple computers)</div>
<div>Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0</div>
<div>DNS: 192.168.0.1</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vista Ultimate 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>All of the Windows Updates and Essentials Updates are automatically and manualy checked and installed every day!!!!! All system And printer drivers are the latest available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous questions and answers with this problem and in this forum seem to be addressed to this Malware problem in Defender and it has been happening to users for a long time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 12 I started receiving&nbsp;2 reports in "Problems Windows Has Identified."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Antimalware Service Executable.&nbsp; Mp Telemetry.</p>
<p>Every time I turn on my PC this problem is listed on the Problems page.&nbsp; I can not report it to windows and it stays on the page in bold type.</p>
<p>I have run a Complete Scan in Essentials and no malware, virus or spyware are found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Spooler Sub System App.&nbsp; causes printer to not print.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Many users seem to be encoutering this problem. There seems to be numerous answers on how to repair the problem but nothing that Microsoft can do to fix it.&nbsp; The one answer to my question in this forum on this problem is so long and so detailed and so complicated
 and with language I dont understand that it is going to take me months to research all of the Possible ways to repair the print spooler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it just coincidental that both of these problems showed up on the same date? Or is the Malware that I can not remove causeing the Print Spooler problem?</p>

    <title>Display Issues With Dual Monitor Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daveb58  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Issues With Dual Monitor Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I connected a second monitor to my computer and after setting the display options everything looked like it was going to be OK. One monitor is a DVI connection and the other is a HDMI.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that when I set up the larger monitor (the HDMI connection) as the main display, it re-arranged the icons . This is not a problem, except that when I turned off the icon alignment and snap to grid,&nbsp;and tried to manually rearrange the icons,
 they would disappear if I dragged them to the bottom of the screen. Although the wallpaper fills the entire screen, it&nbsp;appears as though the bottom portion of the display is not functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My graphics card is a Nvidia GTX650 with two DVI and one HDMI port. Both monitors work fine by themselves, but this happens when used in a dual monitor configuration. Unfortunately, I only have the HDMI connection on one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing display issues when you use dual monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some change in display settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the following methods.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I suggest you to update the graphics card drivers and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows and x key</strong> on your desktop and click on <strong>
Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Expand <strong>‘Display Adapter’. </strong></li><li><strong>Locate the display driver.</strong></li><li>Right-click on the display card listed and click on <strong>‘Update Driver Software’.</strong></li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> I would suggest you to refer to the Microsoft Help Article and check.</p>

            <p>Hi Mayank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply, I really appreciate your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest drivers installed for my graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried your suggestions and the only part that worked was in the change PC settings. I clicked the "larger" option and my screen is fully functional. It seems to have changed my snap to grid settings though, as the icons don't line up in increments as large
 as they used to be. Also, the screen now seems to have an area that may be too large, as the icons now go into the taskbar area when I select auto arrange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for these aspects?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your help.</p>

<p>Okay so I am 16 years old, I play Gears of War, Borderlands, Halo etc. all rated M. The problem I face (like most teens) is the Xbox marketplace will not let me download M content... even though I've played it. I don't have a problem with donwloading M content
 that costs money (go figure) but its the free stuff like game demos etc. Now I've read a bit online and me and my dad have tried to resolve this issue, but we cant. On my Xbox under "online Safety" I have it custimized to were it says "adult" But I still get
 the message &nbsp;that says "This account is not permitted to download content with this rating". Why am I getting this? Is there no way to download this stuff untill I'm 18 regardeles of parent consent?</p>

<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<div>I starting a new thread because many people have talked about this but I dont seem to find a solution.
<br />
<br />
I was running windows vista on this computer with no problems, video looked amazing in SD and HD, I decided to install Windows 7 RC and for some reason Video has very mall lines and squares that, even though you are watching HD, distort the image, more noticeable
 on faces. This happens on every player, even on my slingplayer which is the one that I watch the most. I installed back vista, and everything perfect, but would like to keep windows 7. Im Windows 7 ultimate RC with NVIDIA GeForce 8600M GT with the latest drivers
 from Nvidia. <br />
<br />
Ive tried everything from messing around with control panel to installing codec packs and latest direct x with no luck. Curious thing is that HD from you tube and apple trailers look good!! Can someone help? thanks
<br />
<br />

            I've noticed that also with the latest nvidia drivers, go back a version or to the ones that ship with Win 7 and you'll be fine.

<h2>            Outlook 2010 Hyperlinks not fully handed over to Internet Explorer 11</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since upgrading to Windows 10 I have found that not all hyperlinks are fully parsed into IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hyperlink appears to truncate at the first "&amp;" so this fictional Hyperlink</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.anywebsite.com/viewtopic.php?f=36" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.anywebsite.com/viewtopic.php?f=36</a> would be passed to ie11 in full</p>
<p>
</p><p>but this one</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions. I have now reset IE and set the defaults, it has not altered the hyperlink problem at all.</p>
<p>

            <p>Just an observation - when a hyperlink is clicked in Outlook you can sometimes briefly see a window appear and disappear before Internet Explorer appears. Could it be this window that is not handing over the full URL after the &amp;?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Microsoft Community?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is the analysing and researching getting along? It has all gone a bit quiet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the issue still exists with Outlook 2010. To make the links with an "&amp;"&nbsp; in them work I am either</p>
<p>1. having to open emails in a browser and then click the link </p>
<p>or </p>
<p>2. right click the link and copy hyperlink and then paste it directly into a browsers address bar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It always a&nbsp;lottery as to whether the link has an&nbsp; "&amp;" or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fingers crossed you can resolve the problem</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had the same problem after applying the Easy Fix in KB <span>3094186</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The easy fix set t<span>he default command to open in a new tab, but it&nbsp;is faulty.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We have try the one that open a new Window, it solve the problem. (Look at the KB for more details)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But it's annoying to have a new window open each time.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks HVL,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting the registry key to open in a new window appears to be a good workaround for the meantime. I will just have to put up with having lots of windows instead of a neat row of tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The open in a new tab registry entry (<span>cmd /c start %1) specifically invokes the command prompt and I think that is where the problem lies. It parses the string (the url for the link) and ignores the rest of the&nbsp;url after the
 "&amp;" which is why some links work (because they don't have an &amp;) and some do not (because they do have an &amp;).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>IMHO is think this will never be fixed as MS wants people to move over to Edge and leave IE11. :-(</span></p>

<h2>            How Do I Create Another Copy of my Pre-installed Windows 8.1 OS&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a new laptop, and Windows 8.1 came pre-installed. I know that Microsoft allows users to create a copy for back up reasons. How do I make a copy of my pre-installed OS?<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You’re absolutely right on the point that Microsoft allows you to create a system image (copy of your Windows) for backup process.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you want to perform Refresh but do not want to get all your installed apps and settings deleted, you can create a
<strong>System Image backup </strong>and <strong>Refresh </strong>your pc with that System Image disc. This process will use the System Image from the disc instead of default System Image saved on
<strong>Windows Recovery partition</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>By default, desktop apps are removed when you refresh a Windows 8-based computer, unless you create a custom image. After you create a custom
 system image, the image is used as the refresh image. This means that any existing image or OEM restore image is not used when you refresh your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may refer the article below to create a System Image to refresh your system.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>(Article holds good for Windows 8.1)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span><span>Note: Though Creating System Image processes normally does not cause data loss, but, it is highly recommended to back up all your important data on any external drive before

<p>
</p><p>I have come to the end of suggestions in which I am to try and free up disc space.&nbsp; When I right click on the "C" drive instead of seeing what I can remove the picture is completely cloudy and I cannot see anything.&nbsp; When I click on another drive it is the

<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have deleted temporary files, closed programs running in the background, checked for corrupted files, ran virus scans, Malyware bytes and c cleaner and now just want to try freeing up space.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi April.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Tips for managing low storage space:  
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />To free up the maximum space you can do an automated Refresh which will save your files and reinstall Windows.  You'll need to reinstall your personal programs afterwards which we can help you with.  See here:  <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Manage Limited Disk Space on Tablets and Laptops Running Windows 10
<br />
<br />1 – OneDrive On Demand Files - <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-onedrive-on-demand-files-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-onedriv...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 running on a limited capacity device, you probably are looking for the most affordable option to recover some space. Starting with Windows 10 1709, Microsoft reintroduced OneDrive Files on Demand. This nifty functionality lets you keep all your files on OneDrive and only download the ones you need. Our recent article covers all the details how to set it up and configure it.
<br />
<br />2 – Disk Cleanup and Storage Sense
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is notorious for creating archived files you don’t need. Two features in Windows 10 that can help you with that are Disk Clean up and Storage Sense.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: disk cleanup then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Once Disk Cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if it’s not already. Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup completes its scan, click the button Clean up system files.
<br />
<br />This will perform another quick scan including every file that can be removed. Browse through the list then check off what you don’t need. Pretty much everything in Disk Cleanup can be safely removed. If you keep files in Recycle Bin for safe keeping, you probably should remove them.
<br />
<br />Storage Sense helps automate storage management by automatically deleting files like temporary files and content in your Recycle Bin. Starting with Windows 10 1709, you can delete files in your Downloads folder that haven’t changed in 30 days. Storage sense can also be set to run automatically when you’re low on disk space.
<br />
<br />To set it up, open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage. Click Change how we free up space.
<br />
<br />Enable and modify the settings you would like to be applied when you are running low on space.
<br />
<br />Within the Storage interface in Settings, you can get a bird’s eye view of what’s stored on your drive and what might be using up a lot of space. Under Local Drive, click your Local drive where Windows 10 is currently installed.
<br />
<br />There you will see a list of locations and the amount of space being used by each. As you can see, Temporary files are using about 7 GBs of space, installed apps and games 6 GBs, and Documents 2 GBs. If you click on one of the locations listed, you are not given many options except viewing the contents of the location and manually removing files you might no longer need.
<br />
<br />3 – Delete Data Stored by Apps and Games
<br />
<br />Going back to apps and games a bit, sometimes data no longer in use is kept by the app. If you have exhausted all the options previously mentioned, maybe it’s time to see how much data is being stored by each app installed from the Store.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app then click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Reset which will delete all the data stored by the app.
<br />
<br />4 – Delete Your Recovery Partition
<br />
<br />The recovery partition used to reinstall Windows 10, can eat up a significant amount of disk space. It’s used rarely, if ever, so there is no need to keep it. If that makes you nervous, you can back up your recovery partition to a USB thumb drive, which you can use to reinstall Windows 10 when you need to.
<br />
<br />To do that, open Start, type: create the recovery drive and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Connect a USB thumb drive with enough space—16 GB should do—then click Next. At the end of the wizard, you will be asked if you would like to delete the recovery partition. Proceed to do so.
<br />
<br />5 – Use Treesize to Find Hidden Large Files (Free)
<br />
<br />We previously reviewed Jamsoft’s TreeSize (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-u...</a>) and found it handy for finding large files not readily visible in Windows 10. The program is simple and easy to set up. Our previous article covers the details for scanning your drive and looking in the right places. Jamsoft provides a portable version of Treesize, so you can run it from a thumb drive and scan your system without using up disk space for the program itself.
<br />
<br />6 – Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
<br />
<br />Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
<br />
<br />Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
<br />
<br />There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here. (<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/partition-hard-drive-macos-time-machine-windows-10-backups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/partition-hard...</a>)
<br />
<br />Repeat this step for other folders where you keep large files.
<br />
<br />7 – Install an SD Card for Apps.
<br />
<br />For devices with an SD card slot, Windows 10 lets you move large apps and games from the main drive. These days, you can get an SD card with as much as 256 GBs of space. This is more than perfect for a system with limited onboard space.
<br />
<br />Note: This only works with Microsoft Store apps. Classic desktop apps and those that come built into Windows 10 cannot be moved.
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features. Select an app or game downloaded from the Windows Store, then click Move.
<br />
<br />Click on the Select a drive to move this app to: list box, choose the drive representing your SD card then click Move.

    <title>Playing online with silver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t72av  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing online with silver</h2>
                    <p>So I bought a used original Xbox One back in November 2017 signed in with my gamer tag, says I have silver but I am able to play online since I bought it. Recently just bought&nbsp;an Xbox one S, logged in with my same gamer tag &amp;&nbsp; tried to play online, says I need gold.</p><p><br /></p><p>So hooked the old one back up, an bam, able to play online on the old Xbox One + Get games in my ready to install list, that do not appear on my new Xbox one S list.</p><p><br /></p><p>Little confused, wondering if there is any logic or reason behind this. I certainly don't need two Xbox's, so selling one is an option, but I'm leaning towards getting rid of the S, as my original Xbox One grant's me online play + 64 titles in my ready to install list.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>Since you state your account "has Silver"&nbsp;meaning it doesn't have Xbox Live Gold. Then the only way your account can play online is if there's another account on the Xbox One console that has Xbox Live Gold and that profile is set as the Home Console.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The home console feature is available to each account. When you have an account set as the Home Console on your Xbox, then that account will share out it's games and subscription across that console.</p><p><br /></p><p>You state you just bought an Xbox One S, so the only account that would be on there would be your account that you added and your account does not have Xbox Live Gold.<br /></p>

            <p>My gamer tag is the only one on the console, and it is set to my home Xbox under the only gamertag on the system. On the One S however, I had to log in with my brother's account and make it his home Xbox so that I can use live on my new Xbox one S and game share with my brother. I tried playing on my gamer tag on my brother's Xbox one, that is set as my home Xbox, and it says I need to buy gold. But somehow on my original Xbox one, I can play online.</p>

<h2>            Wedge Mouse detected, but wont connect - Samsung ATIV Smart PC Pro</h2>
                    So the mouse has connected in the past and worked well. &nbsp;When it stopped automatically connecting, I manually attempted to connect it. &nbsp;It will show up as detected (though occasionally I have to try a couple times), but when I click on the icon, it will
 say "can not connect, make sure your device is detectable." &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have attempted to reinstall the driver, but it says I have the latest. &nbsp;This issue seems different from other peoples problems with the wedge mouse, as I can get it to show up, but it wont connect.</div>

<p>I suggested the built-in account but then I removed it form the post, because I thought you couldn't do on a limited account.</p>
