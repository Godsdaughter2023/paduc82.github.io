<h2>            LiveKernelEvent Error &#40;Problem with Hardware, etc&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I checked my reliability monitor last night (I don't even remember what I was checking) but there's a critical event in my history that is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Date: 1/26/17 6:50 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Status: Not Reported</p>
<p>
</p><p>Description<br />
A problem with your hardware caused Windows to stop working correctly.<br />
<br />
Problem signature<br />
Problem Event Name:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;LiveKernelEvent<br />
Code:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;ab<br />
Parameter 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;15<br />
Parameter 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2e0<br />
Parameter 3:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;390<br />
Parameter 4:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;600000005<br />
OS version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10_0_14393<br />
Service Pack:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0_0<br />
Product:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;256_1<br />
OS Version:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10.0.14393.2.0.0.256.48<br />
Locale ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1033<br />
</p>
<p>It looks like it's actually happened three times in the past two weeks, but I don't remember any error messages or even strange screen blinks. I saw a few other people having similar errors, but the parameters were different and I wasn't sure if that was
 just a function of being on a different machine than them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since it hasn't given me any error messages or other concerning behavior, I'm not sure how worried I need to be, but I'd really like to know what it is. And how to fix it, if it's a straightforward fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Looks like a stop error:</p>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff560119%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff560119%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case it may help to look at the minidump files from&nbsp;the&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive::</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

    <title>SOLUTION to NO WIFI after WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE - HP LAPTOP and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marilyn360  say:</h3>
<h2>            SOLUTION to NO WIFI after WINDOWS 10 UPGRADE - HP LAPTOP and others&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I found this solution on an HP message board. It came in early this am, right after my 5:00 am post after I had tried EVERYTHING else (Updated network drivers, uninstalled wifi network adapter, added it back as new hardware, etc,. etc,. etc.) Brand new notebook,
 so no VPN software ever for me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link for original solution post is below. If you can't get to it, here is summary:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For HP Notebooks models 15-ac020ds, 15-ac021ds, 15-ac022ds, 15-ac023ds, 15-ac024ds which have Realtek RTL8188EE 802.11 b/g/n Wi-Fi Adapter, run the HP Support Assistant Application and get the latest BIOS update and apply it. It completely fixed the problem.
 So, in my case, it wasn't the network adapter that had the problem, at all. It was the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original poster suggests to try this NO MATTER WHAT HP Model computer you have, and, even if your PC was made by a different vendor, and I agree, it is worth a&nbsp;try. Fortunately, I am now up and running. WiFi is perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original HP Post: <span>
<a href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Wireless-Internet-Home-Networking/Windows-10-Upgrade-Wifi-Adapter-Issues/m-p/5183378#M98590" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 125, 186, 1)">Re: Windows 10 Upgrade Wifi Adapter Issues</span></a></span></p>
<p>How to
 use HP Support Assistant for Bios update:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open the HP Support Assistant Application</li><li>Click on box labeled "Updates and Tune Ups"</li><li>On left menu, make sure you are at "HP updates"</li><li>Click on "Check for HP Updates Now" in upper right corner</li><li>That should give you a list of available updates, then select the Bios update by checking the box for that update</li><li>Click on "Download and Install Selected updates" and let it run!</li></ul>
<p>Yes, it does take a while to apply this update and your screen will go black and it will run in spurts, but be patient. It DOES finish and it does apply the update and hopefully, you will be up and running, too! Good Luck!</p>

            &nbsp;In device manager my wifi 8188EE adpater no longer shows in the network adapter tab only the wifi controller FE.&nbsp; I have no network connection and every time I try to connect manually or use all the trouble shooters to fix it as well the computer goes
 to a blue screen and says IRQL less than or greater than and&nbsp; an error code that also says failed: rtwlane.sys.&nbsp; Even after re-installing the entire windows 10 operating system through recovery the driver still was not installed.&nbsp; I then went to windows/stopcode
 and entered my concerns to trouble shoot and followed the instruction to go to command prompt as administrator and enter: netsh int ip, netsh /reset, ipconfig flush etc.&nbsp; Rebooted the computer and then the non working wifi adpater that was showing but not
 working was now disappeared in device manager and from settings menue that can be checked in Network Settings.&nbsp; Clicking the View Devices tap shows now only the ethernet 2 disconnect but no longer shows

<h2>            Trying to repair image with DISM but I get error 87 &#47; trying to fix windows restart loop.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>Recently I had issues updating my windows 10 to the latest version.</p>
<p>It got stuck on 44% over and over no matter what steps I took.</p>
<p>Finally it broke entirely when I shut it down and I was no longer able to restore to the previous version.</p>
<p>Right now if I try to start my PC with my SSD containing my version of windows 10 with all my settings and files it will try to roll back, shut down, try to roll back, shut down etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I've done is that I've installed windows 10 on another hard drive and I've taken an image of my primary SSD with dism.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I can't run any of the dism repair tools on my SSD or images for some reason I get error 87 on it. "cleanup-image is unknown"</p>
<p>The dism tools work on my temporary HDD and that system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SSD is mounted at F:</p>
<p>My image I made of it is at C:/help.wim</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth /Image=F: </p>
<p>is one of the ones that I've tried but doesn't work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm obviously working my way through this with DISM but I'm not limited to that.</p>
<p>I have access to all the files on the drive I'm trying to rescue.</p>
<p>If you know any other way to fix windows restarting over and over please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips?</p>

            DISM requires you to tell if you are servicing Windows Online or Offline(Recovery mode)
<br />So you either need to enter this:
<br />DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE or DISM /IMAGE&lt;PATH TO WINDOWS FOLDER)
<br />I am not convinced if DISM would fix it so.
<br />The following steps outline the steps to fix Windows failing to boot and you can boot to the advanced startup options.

<p>I have a thumb drive that is a windows 10 installation medium, it's the only way I've been able to access the recovery menu but none of the tools in advanced options help any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk check didn't find any errors</p>
<p>
</p><p>MBR doesn't seem corrupt</p>
<p>
</p><p>other options seem too extreme when I can actually see all my files and they should be working if not for the glitch I'm experiencing.</p>

            If you have a system Image you can try restoring it. These steps would only fail when the damage is beyond repair. Then the only resort is to do a Reset.

<h2>            Locked out of brand new computer after entering a new password.  Keep getting message password is incorrect.</h2>
                    I purchased a computer for someone else.&nbsp; They do not have internet, so I entered her name and assigned a password.&nbsp; Then I proceeded to download all of the latest Windows 10 updates.&nbsp; When it was all done, I went to sign back in with the password I assigned,
 which I am 100% sure I have correct, and am now locked out and getting a message that the password is incorrect.&nbsp; I was told by my local computer store that because the person does not have a microsoft account, there is not way to get back on the computer
 and I have to pay them $60 to reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp; Can someone help me with this so I don't have to spend an additional $60 on a brand new computer or send it back to Amazon.com where I bought it?

 Therefore, I only set up a user account name and a password.&nbsp; There is no e-mail address attached to the computer.</p>

            <p>I have it disabled, but in task manager it still shows that it's using memory. not much, only 40MB, but I don't like anything using any of my memory when I'm sure I'm not going to use it.<br />
</p>
<p>Someone suggested...</p>
<p><span>First install Classic shell, this is important because once Cortana is uninstalled you will not be able to open up the useless metro start menu. After that open up task manager, and find the "search" process. Right click it and click open
 file location. Then click "end process" on the search process. Then go to the folder that was opened and delete the 2 files that start with Cortana. There, Cortana is uninstalled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Can you tell me if this will work to remove it?</span></span></p>

<strong>To take ownership of a folder, follow these steps:</strong></div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<ol>
<li>
Right-click the folder that you want to take ownership of, and then click Properties.</li><li>

Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.<br />

You can google the reset of the steps. But yeah, I am happy to say I am no longer having software i don't want or need forced on me beyond my choice or under penalty of terror of ultimatum.</li></ol>

            When they say "type start", they mean press the start button on your keyboard. Just hit the button that says start on your keyboard. Or, if you have a keyboard specifically meant to be used with Windows, the start button will have a little windows image
 on it rather than saying start. On these keyboards, the button is sometimes referred to as the "windows" or "win" key. It's the button on the bottom left of your keyboard between the Ctrl and the Alt buttons. Pressing it brings up the start menu just like
 if you had clicked on the menu. Hitting this button and the "x" key at the same time will bring up a menu with options from old start menus.

            That is really annoying and unacceptable. I demand that anything that is installed on my computer is installed only at my discretion, and that if I choose to uninstall it, I have the right and ability to do so at will. Get your act together and respect
 the individual user and property owner's rights. I don't want Cortana, Xbox, and several other features of Windows 10 which are being rammed down our throats. No arguments.<em><strong>Fix it!</strong></em><br />

<p>&nbsp;Was this reply from a Microsoft professional = Mr/Mrs/Miss&nbsp; Terrt&nbsp; Smart.&nbsp; I did read the agreement - and am well aware that it is much like all other Microsoft Product agreements.&nbsp;&nbsp; What I am saying - why not make an honest product where the user's can
 once it's loaded choose the programs they would like to delete and delete them. </p>

            hi Bennet
<div>thanks for the reply. unfortunately, i dont have neither installation disc nor usb. i only have the downloaded ISO installation files in my harddrive disc. whats more, i have already formatted the partition and tried reinstall windows 8.1 within windows
 7 but the same problem always shows up. whats more, i have read the article you suggested. for&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Which type of installation do you want?</span><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">&nbsp;, if i click Custom option,
 will the contents in my hdd(other than the partition where i install the win8.1) be lost? i always choose the Upgrade option because i am afraid of losing my stuff.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">many thanks!</span></div>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>You can perform an upgrade installation only when there is a previous Windows operating system installed in that partition.
 Since you have already formatted the partition, when you try to perform an upgrade installation, the setup can’t find any previous operating system in that partition and will hence will display an error. So, I would suggest you to try installing Windows 8.1
 as a custom installation and check if that works. When you perform a custom installation, it will make changes only in the partition you are installing and will not affect the other Windows 7 partition in anyway.</font></font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font><font color="#000000"><font>If you have any important files in the Windows 7 installation, it is always suggested to create a backup of the data before
 the installation to make sure that you have a backup even if anything goes wrong.</font></font></font></span></p>

    <title>Is 32gb Rom sufficient storage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neilodisho  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is 32gb Rom sufficient storage&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a Nuvision&nbsp; solo 10 draw tablet from the Microsoft store ( The specs on this tablet is 2gb Ram and 32gb Rom).&nbsp; The Windows&nbsp;updates download and install slow, but other than that the tablet is working fine.&nbsp; However I have noticed
 that the Windows updates are&nbsp;occupying a lot of&nbsp;the internal storage (drive C).&nbsp; I have already mounted a 64gb micro SD card on the tablet&nbsp;and selected from the settings to have all the apps, files, pictures,..etc to store on the card.&nbsp;However, I Purchased
 the tablet on 7-25-2017, and as of today 8-10-2017 there is only 13.6gb remaining in drive C.&nbsp; The updates and possibly One drive seem to use a lot of the internal storage.&nbsp; I can certainly unlink One drive and use it instead&nbsp;through my MSN&nbsp;Outlook account,
 however there is nothing could be done about the Windows updates.&nbsp; Do you think the&nbsp;Windows updates will&nbsp;use up all the internal storage (drive C)&nbsp;in just few months?&nbsp; Which in this case should I&nbsp;better return the tablet and get something with more internal
 memory?.&nbsp;By the way, as of today 8-10-2017 this tablet still runs Windows 10&nbsp;version 1607,&nbsp; so the creators update is coming up soon and I worry it might not be even able to install&nbsp;version 1703.&nbsp; Do anyone have any suggestions on what to do?.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 occupies at least 16GB of your hard disk space for a 32-bit operating system. Since you have a 32GB space, yes, you can install Creators Update. However, it may cause a slow performance of your device. Make sure that you save your files on your
 SD card or other external hard drives and not on the tablet itself to avoid hard disk space shortage. Updates will compress the old ones to replace it new fixes and upgrades. Also, below is the list of Creators Update system requirement as your reference:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Processor</strong>: 1GHz or faster processor or SoC<br />
<strong>RAM</strong>: 1GB for 32-bit or 2GB for 64-bit<br />
<strong>Hard disk space</strong>: 16GB for 32-bit OS or 20GB for 64-bit OS<br />
<strong>Graphics card</strong>: DirectX9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />
<strong>Display</strong>: 800×600</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I understand from the two replies that I received that my tablet can still be upgraded to windows 10 creators and fall creators editions because there is still internal storage available in my tablet&nbsp;and also&nbsp;because I have over 58gb in additional storage
 that is available with the micro sdxc card.&nbsp; However my main concern was with windows updates using up a lot of internal storage.&nbsp; Just the August Windows&nbsp;updates used up about 0.7gb of internal storage, according to my calculations the 13.6gb of internal
 storage&nbsp;that is available now in my tablet&nbsp;will be used up just by Windows updates in just over one year.&nbsp; Do you think future Windows updates will use up less internal storage?Thank You</p>

<p>Starting with the Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft is introduced a new feature in Windows Update called differential updates, which reduces the size of updates. That said, this is not necessarily an end to end solution and the reality is a device like

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>you keep answering only the final question that&nbsp;I am asking.&nbsp; I need a definite answer to this question: How much time&nbsp;my tablet&nbsp;will&nbsp;continue to update and upgrade windows 10? remember the last windows update (August) has used up 0.7gb and now drive C has
 only 13.6gb of space.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay in response. I suggest you to try installing the bluetooth drivers in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows. Follow these steps to install the
 drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Download the&nbsp;<strong>drivers</strong>&nbsp;from the manufacturer’s website.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click on the&nbsp;<strong>driver setup</strong>&nbsp;file and click on ‘<strong>Properties’</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click on the ‘<strong>Compatibility’</strong>&nbsp;tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode</strong>&nbsp;for’ and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.
 Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Get back with the updated status, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            Using my Subscription on Skype - &#34;World unlimited mins Mobiles and Landlines&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have trouble to utilize my purchased and delivered (according to Purchase history) subscription for World Unlimited mins Mobiles and Landlines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always used Skype credits, but wanted to switch as I have started to make much more international calls. However, there is no help and no instruction how to initiate the subscription or utilizing it. My last call was cut in the middle of a conversation
 and as I refuse to add more skype credits, I am unable to make any call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now trying to find out how to get my subscription utilized, but there are just no help from microsoft. It seems like microsoft is making things so difficult and non user friendly (but still taking my money with promises, which I am unable to use), that
 I am the point to cancel all my microsoft accounts and never suport them again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me to initiate and utilize my subscription for World unlimited mins mobile and landlines, I shall appreciate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is really absurd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I just want to add,. I have search the previous questions on this topic and realize other people have the same issue, but the reply from Microsoft is cracy. They merely repeat the same information that they have promised when I have purchased the subscription.
 It is no resolution of the issue!</p>

<p>I have taken the time to read again the policy attache dto the subscription I have bought. here it is:</p>
<p>
Subscriptions
</p><p>Subject to this FUP, Skype’s unlimited subscriptions allow unlimited calls to landlines in the applicable subscription countries (excluding special, premium, service and non-geographic numbers) for the time period specified
 at the time of purchase. Unlimited calls to mobiles may also be included where stated at the time of purchase.
<p>I am not sure I understand the last part that I have underlined? What does this imply? Does it mean that a call could only last maximum 4 hours and you will have to reconnect if you want to continue with the call? If this
 is the case, no problem.</p>
<p>Any other interpretations or understanding from anyone?</p>

<p><span>Hi Steve,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error message when you tried to play a DVD movie?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Does
 this issue happen with all the DVD movies or with one particular DVD<span>&nbsp;</span>movie?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you using Windows Media Player to play the DVD movie?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows 7 contains several troubleshooting programs that can automatically fix some common problems with your computer. Although
 troubleshooters aren't designed to fix every problem, they are a useful thing to try first, as they can often save your time and effort. If you’ve trouble getting a CD or DVD to play on Windows Media Player, then I would suggest you to try running the troubleshooter
 as the first step of troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1: Open the Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>The troubleshooter checks for common issues, such as making sure you have both a DVD drive and the correct DVD decoder installed
 on your computer. </span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Alternatively, you can try the fix it from the link given as well.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Open the Playing and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu‑ray Discs troubleshooter</span></strong></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2: Test the issue by putting the computer in a clean boot state</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>A clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Visit the link below to know how to perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></span><span><span> Once the troubleshooting
 is over, reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></span></p>

<h2>            RoboCopy on Windows Task Scheduler</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a batch file transferring data from my local computer C drive to a network folder. When the robocopy command below is run in cmd or simply executed it works as intended. When run in the task scheduler nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have admin credentials on my local computer, have selected for the task to be run with highest privileges as well as selected to configure it for Windows 7 and Windows Vista Server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The code is :&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br />
ROBOCOPY "C:\example" "\\mydata\example" &nbsp;/MIR /XX /R:100 /W:5 /MON:5 *.txt*
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

            If you don't actually need the double quotes around the source and target paths because there are no spaces or special characters, try removing them.&nbsp; I recently had a problem getting a scheduled task to run and removing the quotes made it work.&nbsp; I have
 no idea why this should be so, and once my task worked, I didn't dig deeper into the problem.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the help. I think my issue is that I do not have the required permissions to access the network drive using my computer's admin credentials (different from what i use to access the network drive). This is why I can access it in the command line
 when its mapped but not when I run the task exclusively as the computer's admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A work around as I will not be able to grant that computer's credentials access to the network drive is for me to use another computer with direct access to the network drive to initiate the transfer of data. Now figuring out the UNC paths is my next challenge!</p>

<h2>            Initial update stops at 78&#37;, EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.</h2>
                    
<p>I am so sick of fighting with this xbox one. It was supposed to be awesome, so far it has just been a hassle.</p>
<p>I have been on the phone for hours with mostly-clueless techs, been transferred to multiple numbers, chatted with a very nice but unable-to-help online community member, and still am NOT playing the new xbox one.</p>
<p>I get past the horrible green screen, I get to the update, it starts, it gets to 78%, it stops, start over, same result. It tells me to contact support who calls me back HOURS later and plays clueless (maybe not even playing). Waiting for online chat now
 and call-back in 90 minutes.</p>
<p>"Turn it off, turn it on, cycle this, cycle that, turn it off again?"</p>

<p>RIDICULOUS!!!!!</p>

<p>Hope anyone who hasn't even made it this far gets their stuff working. Frustrated right along with you.</p>
<p>My most recent theoretical solution is to get ahold of the EOU, but I haven't managed to get the agent on here yet to ask about it. Will update if I hear anything.</p>

<p>Yeah it has, here is what their tech told me to do. It didn't work, maybe someone can shed some light on it and make it make sense since she was just so damn sure it would work.

<p>You are now chatting with 'Janice'</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:19:09</p>
<p>Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Janice. Please give me a moment to review your question.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:19:20 </p>
<p>Ok </p>
<p>Janice: at 13:19:35</p>
<p>Hi Sara!</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:19:58 </p>
<p>Hi, I REALLY hope you can help me</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:20:29</p>
<p>I understand that we're having issues downloading the system update, correct?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:20:53 </p>
<p>Yes, I've talked to SO many techs this morning trying to help me</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:21:00</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that, Sara.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:21:09</p>
<p>Don't worry, I'll do what I can to help you out.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:21:55</p>
<p>Just want to check, what are the things that you have already tried?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:23:26 </p>
<p>Ok, we have tried wireless and wired connections. We have tried power cycling the modem and router, and the actual xbox one a half dozen times by holding in the power button and unplugging for a brief time, then turning all back on. That was supposed to
 "clear out the caches".</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:23:47 </p>
<p>We have read off network error codes too.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:23:40</p>
<p>Anything else that you have tried?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:24:17 </p>
<p>I was told we would probably need the EOU, but was told I would have to talk to you all in support first</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:24:34</p>
<p>What do you mean by EOU?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:24:54 </p>
<p>Emergency Offline Update.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:25:32</p>
<p>Oh, I see.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:26:01 </p>
<p>If you have an alternative solution I would be willing to try it</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:26:10</p>
<p>You're right that if the automatic update won't work, then we have to do the Emergency Offline Update.
</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:26:51 </p>
<p>Well, it hasn't worked for about 9 hours</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:27:04</p>
<p>You have already tried it however, the issue still persist?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:27:26 </p>
<p>I have tried the UPDATE THROUGH INTERNET</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:27:56 </p>
<p>I have read that the Emergency Offline Update was pulled by Microsoft?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:28:10 </p>
<p>I was told I had to talk to you all directly to access it if that is what it came to.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:29:15</p>
<p>Thanks for the details, Sara.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:29:29</p>
<p>Just want to check, what is the Xbox One game disc that you currently have?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:30:01 </p>
<p>We don't have a game disc in it, we CAN'T get it set up</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:31:46</p>
<p>But you have a game disc with you, right?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:32:04 </p>
<p>Yes</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:32:19</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:32:25</p>
<p>Sara, let's do this one.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:32:49</p>
<p>Just want to check first, is the console currently connected to the internet?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:33:23 </p>
<p>Yes, currently wireless</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:33:45</p>
<p>We have to disconnect it from the network before we do the steps.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:34:12 </p>
<p>Ok, just tell me how to do it and I will do it</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:34:24</p>
<p>One moment please while I check all the steps.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:38:03</p>
<p>Still checking on it, Sara.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:38:22 </p>
<p>Ok</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:39:45</p>
<p>Thanks for patiently waiting, Sara.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:40:43</p>
<p>I have some steps here, however, we need to turn off the router first before we do it.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:40:45</p>
<p>How about this.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:40:56</p>
<p>I will provide you the steps and please take note of it.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:41:05</p>
<p>Turn off the router and do all those steps.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:41:18</p>
<p>If issue persist, please don't hesitate to contact us back.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:41:24</p>
<p>Are you okay with that, Sara?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:41:59 </p>
<p>Ok, now obviously I am currently talking to you online, so if this doesn't work, I am left with the lovely option of getting back on here and waiting some more?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:42:19 </p>
<p>I will try the steps because i don't have a choice, but this still SUCKS</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:42:36</p>
<p>I understand how you feel about the situation, Sara.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:42:56</p>
<p>This is definitely not the experience that we want you to have.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:43:20</p>
<p>I'm positive that these steps will work because it came from our Xbox Rangers.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:43:42 </p>
<p>Yeah, that sounds all cool and fancy so let's hope so</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:43:57 </p>
<p>So what steps do I need to follow?</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:44:04</p>
<p>These are the steps.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:45:50</p>
<p>1. Turn off Router.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:45:50</p>
<p>2. Advise customers to disconnect their console from the Internet.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:45:50</p>
<p>3. Allow the installation from the game disc to complete.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:45:50</p>
<p>4. Reconnect to the Internet and continue downloading updates as normal.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:46:21</p>
<p>Please refer to this number when you contact us back 1224471006.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:47:06 </p>
<p>I don't understand step 3?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:47:20 </p>
<p>I am not trying to update a game, I am trying to do an initial update.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:47:34</p>
<p>I understand.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:47:45 </p>
<p>Turn on system, input language and country, required update...can't get the required update to go</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:47:44</p>
<p>The game disc itself has the update.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:48:13</p>
<p>That's why, we will install the update from the game disc first.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:48:32 </p>
<p>ok, I'll be willing to try it</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:48:58</p>
<p>Thank you, Sara.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:49:08</p>
<p>I'm positive that those steps will work.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:49:15 </p>
<p>I already have a call back request in, so I guess if it doesn't work I will refer to this number</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:49:27 </p>
<p>I need it on a wired connection directly through the modem to try this yes/</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:49:29 </p>
<p>?</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:49:54</p>
<p>Please disconnect the console from your network first before doing the above steps.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:50:09</p>
<p>When game update is done, then we can reconnect the console to the network.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:50:16</p>
<p>You can either choose wireless or wired.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:50:36 </p>
<p>Then I don't completely understand...</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:50:59 </p>
<p>I turn off my router, disconnect from internet, reconnect to internet, put in game, then update from game?</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:52:16</p>
<p>Turn off router, restart console, put in game, then update from game, when update is done, turn on router then reconnect console to the internet.</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:52:48 </p>
<p>I'll definitely try it</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:53:24</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:53:33</p>
<p>Sara, is there anything else that I can do for you today?</p>
<p>Sara: at 13:54:16 </p>
<p>Nothing right now, my only choice is to try this. *Hope it works*</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:54:26</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that it will.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:54:41</p>
<p>Sara, thank you so much for your time and understanding.</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:54:46</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Xbox Support and have a wonderful day!</p>
<p>Janice: at 13:54:48</p>
<p>You take care!</p>

<p>i don't think the staff really know what to tell people to be honest as there would be no way a game disc would have anything at all to do with the initial console update,, the games would have been finished weeks ago,, :/ &nbsp;it's a real pain in the butt..
 &nbsp;ive tried wired,,, wifi,,, router resets,, clearing caches the lot... :/:/:/:(</p>

<p>She thought your console was fine and that the game install wasn't working,</p>
<p>What she said allows the game to install before the game patch update which seems to take forever.</p>
<p>Unfortunately even though you clearly said you cant even do the console day one update, she didn't seem to understand.</p>
<p>Also Unfortunately no one can be an expert to give us advice until they have seen it all. us and Microsoft are all experiencing it at the same time and its been less than 24hs</p>
<p>I bet within a month once they receive the bad egg ones back they will be able to test and dissect and fix the problems, but until then, they probably wont be able to help much.</p>
<p>Good luck and touch wood mine keeps playing without hiccups</p>

<p>Doesn't sound like a console issue to be honest, more of a network swamped type error. The console released world wide today in various countries, allt rying to download that same update. It probably thus just times out at 78% for some strange reason.</p>
<p>Would a day or two and try agian :)</p>

<p>So after another hour of waiting on the phone, I was just told the replacement website was down and they weren't sure when it would be back up.</p>
<p>The last tech I talked to (hours ago) said it was time to throw in the towel and order a replacement system. I told her we would call around and look for another available one. Of course all stores were out. When we called back I got put on hold/transferred
 FOR AN HOUR. Finally got a willing helper only to find out the reoder site was down!!! He might not have said it, but I'm gonna. "So many friggin xbox ones came in broken or broke down soon after that the site went down with people trying to order replacements."</p>

<p>Ok, it took me a few tries and was somewhat complicated, but if you follow those steps to a T, it WILL work! We are now playing Dead Rising 3 and setting up our tv connections. I'll stay around to try and help answer questions if possible.
</p>
<p>Also, if you are having the blank screen issues I cannot guarantee this will help you. I was just having download issues and this worked for me when NOTHING else had.

note - when I plug in the mouse I hear the "ding ding" sound. and when I unplug I hear the "ding dong" sound - also the mouse icon appears and disappears from the "device manager" page.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">so..</span></p>

<p>Hi Leigh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is best that you visit the manufacturer's website of your mouse to download the latest driver.
</p>
<p>

</p><p>Let us know if you have any other questions.</p>

<p>I had the same exact issue on a couple of Dell laptops in our office.&nbsp; No external mouse would work on a USB port.<br />
<br />
It appears to be an issue with Windows Update KB4074588.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The work-around is to uninstall Windows Update KB4074588 and reboot.&nbsp; Suddenly the mice work fine.<br />
<br />
I found the solution in this thread:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; https://community.spiceworks.com/topic/2114487-windows-10-pro-keyboard-mouse-driver-is-unavailable</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
<p>Van</p>

<p>Removing&nbsp;<span>Windows Update KB4074588 fixed it for me.&nbsp; Had to run the show / hide update tool to prevent it from installing again.</span></p>
