<p>Hey there Radicalizators,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for reaching out to us on the forums in regards to the repair order that you have setup. You don't have to send it in through UPS directly, as long as you are able to get the package shipped out to us the company used wouldn't matter. You can
 always use USPS, UPS or FedEx,&nbsp; but if you have any other local shipping companies in your area you can ship with them as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Just make sure that you send it out to the correct address that is shown on the email you received and that you include your service request number somewhere on the box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still need more time then you would have to set up another exchange order or just
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Xbox Support</a> for further assistance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

            Problem now solved. Windows was telling me that I had the correct drivers installed&nbsp;but in fact I did not. Searched for updated drivers but message said I had latest so&nbsp;I contacted Medion and simply downloaded an updated driver and manually installed it.
 Everything now working correctly.

<h2>            Failed backup to external hard drive with Windows 7</h2>
                    Tried to set up a daily backup using a Seagate external hard drive as destination. Windows says it can not run because it only recognizes the removable CD drive and ask to insert a disk. In "my computer" the Seagrate is listed as a second hard drive. How
 can I set this hard drive as my destination for backup? Do I have to use Seagate's software?

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I would suggest you to first check if two services - Volume Shadow Copy and Windows Backup service are running or not. To check
 for the services –</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; •Go to Start - Run and type Services.msc then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>•Under the Status column look for any entries that read "Starting" rather than "Started".
</span></p>
<p><span>•Check for both the services separately and then close the Services window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Try connecting the External hard drive to different USB ports and try to back up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Try doing the back up after disabling
 the Security Software sometime security software will prevent backup access certain files which cause it to fail.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Follow the steps mentioned in the below
 article to check drive for errors:</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Poonam007,
</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Did you make any recent changes to the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>How long are you facing this issue for?</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> First
</span><span>try to <strong>set the Default Administrator account</strong> and check whether you can install the drivers. You may follow the below mentioned steps to set the Default Administrator account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the
<strong>Start button</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click
<strong>All programs</strong> followed by <strong>Accessories</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu,
<strong>Right Click</strong> on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the
<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong> option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may
 simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type the command
<strong>net user administrator /active:yes</strong> and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Close the elevated command prompt.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Log off (in Start Menu) and you will see your new built-in Administrator account next to your current account(s).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. Click on the icon for Administrator account to log on to it.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps work, then
<span>try the steps by following the link to Fix a corrupted User Account:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> You may also refer the following link and
<strong>perform an online security scan</strong> on your computer to check whether your computer is been infected by any virus.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Run a SFC Scan to fix system file corruptions.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the
<strong>Start button</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click
<strong>All programs</strong> followed by <strong>Accessories</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu,
<strong>Right Click</strong> on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the
<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong> option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization prior to the command prompt opening. You may
 simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></span></p>

    <title>Build 7601 Returns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> larryvan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Build 7601 Returns</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone please tell me how to rid this annoying problem once and for all??&nbsp; I spent many hours figuring out how to resolve Build 7601 and several months later, it returns only this time, along with 3 viruses.&nbsp; I was able to resolve the virus problem but
 it corrupted my systemcpl.dll file plus, I lost my standard icons, I keep getting popup screens that are hard to close out and I am taken to the word pad program that displays code and I have to X out of that program every time I boot my system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I try to access the task manager and it directs me to this word pad scribble.&nbsp; I have to use a backdoor to get into it.&nbsp; Also, when I try to locate and disable dllhost.exe, I see it for only a second or so and it disappears unexpectedly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have followed the instructions to the tee like I did the first time to get rid of this problem but I can't gain any ground this time around.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I need help this time around and am asking anyone for a possible answer.&nbsp; I built my system and loaded a valid Windows 7 Home Edition 32 bit program I purchased well over a year ago so I know that my windows is not a copy.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A.DLL "Error loading” message usually occurs when the .dll file that was set to run at startup in the registry or as a scheduled task has been deleted. Windows is trying to load
 this file(s) but cannot locate it since the file was mostly likely removed during an anti-virus or anti-malware scan. However, an associated orphaned registry entry still remains and is telling Windows to load the file when you boot up. Since the file no longer

            <p>My only option that was left to me was to reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; Absolutely Nothing I tried, any and all suggestions were to no avail as the viruses did too much damage.&nbsp; I was not allowed to go into the CMD mode through DOS and resolve the issues
 either.&nbsp;&nbsp; Safe Mode was a joke so no sense in going into this mode to find and resolve this problem.</p>
<p>Even though all the settings were correct for the admin and the trusted installer which gave full access, the system still stated that I needed those changes made before proceeding.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Microsoft Security Essentials found the viruses while no other anti-virus programs did, including AVAST, AVG, Kaspersky and several others.&nbsp; I thought these programs were supposed to be among the top rated programs but I guess I was wrong.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have no idea how the viruses got through my system as I have my security settings set about as high as possible and still be able to function without a lot of pop up windows asking questions.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It acted like the viruses infected the KB971033 as when I uninstalled this update, the system whacked out even worse than before and all kinds of strange things begin to happen, such as when I typed in "taskmgr", word pad would pop up that had a lot of weird
 code displaying on screen.&nbsp; It seemed that any time I went to the "Search programs and files", this is where I was lead to, Word Pad and the code it displayed.</p>
<p>I had to go the long way around to get to the features I wanted to access.</p>
<p>This is a bad situation and I hope no one gets this kind of infection.&nbsp; It is nasty and requires a complete re-install.&nbsp; Now, due to this problem, after re-installing windows a few times, I now have to purchase another key code for Windows.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I think Microsoft needs to either&nbsp;delete the KB971033 update or rework it and make it safer for our systems.&nbsp; It appears that this is where most of my problems began.&nbsp; It was within a day or two after this update installed in my system when I&nbsp;noticed the
 Build 7601 problem.</p>
<p>What is funny is that I was able to resolve the problem the first time but it is like it learned by my actions and after learning how I was getting around this problem, it hit again with it's own safeguards on board to deflect anything I tried to do to get
 rid of it.&nbsp; I know that this isn't the case but it sure seemed as though it was by the way it acted.&nbsp; Like getting more intelligent each time it hits.&nbsp; Weird.</p>

            <p>To what are you exactly referring to by "Build 7601" as this is merely the version number for Windows 7 SP1 and if up to date all PCs should be this version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 7601 is not a "problem". KB971033 is an update to the Windows Activation Technologies system which identifies illegal software. If by the term Build 7601 you mean that this has appeared on the screen then this indicates that as far as WAT is concerned
 you have an illegal license and yes installing that update would trigger the message, that is exactly what it is supposed to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If as you have indicated you have now purchased a new key you may have solved the issue for the moment. The only problem is nobody should be selling a key on its own as retail licenses are only sold with media so you could well have the problem again.</p>

            <p>I received a message in the lower right corner of my screen that stated to the effect of "Build 7601, your copy of Microsoft windows is not valid" or something like this and continued to inform me that I had several options which included retyping in my
 key code, buying a new one, and contacting Microsoft.</p>
<p>My copy of Windows IS valid and therefore, this message should NOT have appeared to begin with.</p>
<p>Now, with this being said, the end results of this little message had other effects on my system.&nbsp; My wallpaper would no longer stay up, my screensaver would go blank as well, I got redirected at every time I tried to do a search!</p>
<p>Now, as for these codes, the KB971033 update, if this isn't a problem, then why are we instructed to uninstall this upgrade, go to System32 and right click on systemcpl.dll and take back control of our systems??</p>
<p>I know a little about this problem due to the research I have done on it.&nbsp; I have gotten the advice of Experts and know what they are talking about.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>This is a valid problem and it has created a mess for more than just me.&nbsp; If you would research this out, you too, would find this to be true.</p>
<p>I am not in the mood to be challenged on this problem as I have been down this path before.&nbsp; If you have something to help resolve this problem that others missed, I am all ears but My copy is Very Valid and therefore, this message is in error!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>There is a sequence of operations to follow to resolve this problem and it means going into the DOS prompt after hitting CMD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Go to Tips and Tricks relating to Build 7601 and you will see what I am talking about.&nbsp; This site can explain it much better than me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Now, with this being said, I would appreciate it if you would refrain from telling me something I already know.&nbsp; I fully understand what these are and I also know that they can become a problem as well, just like any other upgrade or software that has bugs
 in it.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The think tanks who build these programs and files have Never gotten all the bugs worked out nor will they ever.&nbsp; They might come close but they are Not failsafe.&nbsp; Do you understand?</p>
<p>Build 7601 IS a problem in the making and that is all there is to it!!!</p>

            <p>Then the problem is you are being told that your installation is illegal and you have reasons to believe that the message is wrong. The 1st step to resolve this is to run the MGADiag tool and copy and paste the results here. The problem is not "Build 7601"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will show the reasons why the message is coming up and yes there are a few reason why it can happen apart from the primary purpose of the WAT system&nbsp;but the issue is not with the update. More common is that it is an illegal installation from what is
 very good counterfeit copies or that somebody has hacked an OEM installation which no longer works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of channels where Microsoft sell keys only but these are for corporate use multiuser solutions never for individual use. You say you have bought a new key so the reality is it is most likely a new illegal key. These work for a while until
 they get flagged as being over used which triggers Microsoft to investigate and ultimately get blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You take the approach that there is an inherent problem yet I have been running Windows 7 since its release and installed in on hundreds of computers over the years with not one error generated by the WAT system. The difference is I do not buy keys for individual
 users, only buy from reputable sources and make sure the original system software is properly installed. You have presumably now bought a second key at a discount price but the probability is that the combined cost of the two licenses will have exceeded the
 cost of a legitimate license from an approved supplier in the 1st place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact is that if a product is offered for sale at an extremely attractive price it is almost certainly not genuine. A $50 Rolex is not going to be a Rolex, the same applies to software. Microsoft control the supply chain fairly carefully and do not allow
 significant discounting through legitimate channels. A local electronics retailer was running a 20% off everything offer, after 2 days a sign went up on the Windows display that the discount was excluded for this display.</p>

<p>Try clean booting the PC <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</a>&nbsp;NB The manual method, not the FixIt, then create a couple of restore points over an hour or so, then reboot and check whether they have been retained.</p>
<p>If they have then its a matter of using msconfig to attempt to pin down what is causing the problem, be aware that this can be a long/tedious process.</p>
<p>If no change you may have no option other than to clean install.</p>

<h2>            Game crashes on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Original Title : Problem with Assassin's Creed Unity</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I'd like to thank the experts here for helping me in my previous question and here I am, making another topic. My problem is that I'm trying to play ACU(Assassin's Creed Unity) on my DELL Inspiron laptop. Here are my specs-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor:&nbsp;Intel(R) Core(TM0 i7-3632QM CPU @ 2.20 GHz 2.20 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 8 GB RAM(7.87 Usable)</p>
<p>System Type: 64-bit Operating System, x64 based processor</p>
<p>Graphics card: AMD Radeon HD 7700 Series(2 GB VRAM)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I start, the game comes slow, and when I click 'Play' on the first one, it just crashes, I tried the same game in Windows 7, It works as a charm, It's a windows 8.1 problem, any solutions?</p>
<p>Edit: I browsed through the internet, a lot of people seem to have this problem, i guess windows 8.1 isnt clearly optimized for the game. I have the latest drivers.</p>

    <title>App Store not Working on Windows 10 1511 update. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigwhitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            App Store not Working on Windows 10 1511 update.</h2>
                    <p>I know, the App Store (and packaged apps) again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured the posts and cannot see a scenario quite like mine.&nbsp; Maybe the posts lack a bit of detail, and then mostly months older.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>I just build the PC, and updated to Windows 10 1511.&nbsp;</li><li>I have 3 drives:&nbsp; C - for Windows, D - for Programs and <em>Apps</em>, E - for user files(moved all the 'special' folders to point to E via the folder property settings)</li><li>Once 1511 was updated, I changed the App Store Location to D, to match were I install most of my other programs/games/etc.</li><li>On that same option screen, I kept the other folders pointing to C, even thought I change the folder properties to E via a old way to map.</li></ul>
<p>Things ran perfectly fine for a few days (remember&nbsp;a new bild so not much to clutter things up).</p>
<p>Suddenly, the App Store stopped opening (click the icon, no activity, no Event log errors)</p>
<p>Then the 'pre-loaded' apps stopped opening. But they work on the start page - (i.e. the weather still updates, but it does not open)</p>
<p>But other apps I installed after the facts, (i.e. Flipboard) still work, open, run...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a tried fix, I ran the powershell to re-install the App Store specifically (go get the ID, then run the appPackage command.&nbsp; Well, that did not help, and had removed the icon from the toolbar.&nbsp; It is still an app that I can click to open (if it only would).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I will try is to change the App Store install location back to "C" and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where I am at?&nbsp; Stuck.&nbsp; Any currently process to try?&nbsp; Any updates that were to fix this very popular issue.&nbsp; I am unsure what is old news to try and what is new so figured I would post this with details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Unfortunately, no luck. &nbsp;I received an error after a few moment - "invalid value for registry" after it passes the Current Version check. &nbsp;Even tried the Run as Admin as a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried to re-point the App Install location to C: but there is no change with that. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: The App Store icon had now appeared after a logout and later login. &nbsp;I was able to open windows store but each app I tried to install would just say "working...". &nbsp;The existing apps do open. &nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT now, after a new restart, it stopped behaiving again. &nbsp;Oddly, the App Store live tile updates which is new...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But still not healthy.</p>

    <title>Surface Book Battery Life Very Bad and glitches randomly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghotifish1078  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Battery Life Very Bad and glitches randomly</h2>
                    <p>I have recently purchased a Surface&nbsp; Book (config:&nbsp;<span><span><span>6th Gen Intel Core i5, 256GB SSD, 8GB RAM / dGPU ) and I am very dissatisfied with the battery life of it. I know
 it has a high resolution screen, but that does not seem to be the probable answer to the 4-5 hours of battery life I'm getting with suggested brightness and battery saver on with my computer installed with the latest version of Windows 10. I watched many reviews
 about this laptop and talked with the guy who made my decision to by this laptop. He promised 12-14 hours of battery life but right now, I'm not happy. I use my laptop for regular stuff like web browsing and writing word documents. Playing&nbsp;games also seems
 to drain the battery the same rate as writing word documents. I have also experienced many random glitches and freezes. Anyone&nbsp;have any suggestions to what's going on?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>BTW, does the laptop being stuck inside it's box for too long affect the battery of a laptop as the battery gets old? Thanks</span></span></span></p>

            I have suddenly had same problem. Sending 1 picture is okay but problem is with more than one. It always now locks up on the last picture and email is locked up. I can get out of it by - (1) go to outlook - (2) go to the OUTBOX - (3) delete from the OUTBOX
 - (4) re-boot PC. I have tried going to Microsoft support but doesn't seem to be doing much good - just sorry for inconvenience. Anyone else know if this is a Microsoft error?

            <p>On the lefthand side of Outlook Windows Live Mail you will see headings such as "Inbox" and "Sent" and "Junk email" etc etc.</p>
<p>One of these is "Outbox".</p>
<p>I found the email I was trying to send&nbsp;under this heading. It was sitting there as the picture process had not finished processing, i.e. it has locked.</p>
<p>Found that by going to this "Outbox" heading - finding the email - deleting the email and then rebooting the PC. I found this releases the locked picture processing.</p>

            <p>Thanks - We now have a way of unlocking "Live Mail" once it has locked up trying to publish and send a picture - but - we still cannot send pictures in the traditional way of an attachment. I only had this problem from about 4 days ago (have been using it
 for years). Is this a know Microsoft problem that they are looking to solve - or - should we be doing it another way ? - any suggestions/confirmations would be useful.</p>

 Express! &nbsp;I hope a software wizard at Microsoft is reading this.</p>

<h3> lighthouseman-9a5bcc97-6b18-4e82-a146-7cb957426ebf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Chatpad issue on XBOX ONE</h2>
                    
<p>Has anybody else had the special characters on the chatpad appearing wrong.</p>
<p>i.e if you use the green button and w for the @ symbol , it comes up as ". Both characters are on the wrong keys.</p>
<p>Is this a firmware issue ? or is it just my new chat pad.</p>

<p>is it a location thing? eg your in the US and your location is the UK, in a similar way the keyboards on a PC can be different if the location is different to the keyboard.</p>
<p>Check your location on the console is correct.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Figured it out!</p><p>The chatpad serial number ends with the letter&nbsp;B, E, F, G, or S to indicate which language it supports: British-English, US-English, French, German, or Spanish.</p><p>What you have to do, is to change the Keyboard Language in settings&gt;system&gt;language&amp;Location&gt;Keyboard Language</p><p><br /></p><p>Ex: If it has an "E" in the end, it needs to be US-English, If it has an "S" in the end it indicates you need to have the keyboard language set to Spanish (and so on)</p>

            That didn't work for me. My chatpad has only numbers in its serial number and my location and keyboard settings are all set to english in the US (where I live). The only way to get the special characters to work is for me to change the keyboard language
 to "Espaniol Mexico." <span>
<strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]</strong></span> is this <span>
<strong>[Mod Removed – Profanity]</strong></span>! Now have to go on a search to buy a chatpad that has an E at the end of the serial number? This is so

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are facing this issue might be because of startup program on your computer, refer to the following method and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Check if you can experience the issue in ‘Safe mode’; if safe mode works fine then set the computer to ‘Clean boot’ state to check for software conflicts.</font></font></span></p>

<h3> matthew wigmore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snap suddenly not working with win-key &#43; arrow key</h2>
                    <p>So snap has suddenly stopped working with win-key + arrow key, it still works when dragging the window to the edge/top of the screen using the mouse.&nbsp; The keys still work individually (arrow keys still scroll in web pages and win key still opens start menu)
 but no in combo.&nbsp; I've checked in the settings and control panel and snap is enabled (also when I snap by dragging with the mouse the snap suggestions do not pop up like they used to even though the setting is again enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It just stopped working about ten minutes ago and it's already infuriating since I'm at uni and often need multiple windows open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Hello Matthew,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the keyboard shortcuts for the Windows Snap feature to resize windows does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If system restore is enabled on your computer,&nbsp;I would suggest you to try&nbsp;restoring your PC to a previous date that you're sure the feature was working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above suggestion did not help, I would suggest you to <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
check if the same issue occur when logged in through a different user account.</span><span>
</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Also please be informed, the November update for Windows 10 has already been rolled out which you can install using Windows update as "Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.3)" which is an approximate of a&nbsp;3GB feed over the existing Windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update will play a major role in incorporating new features with the Windows Snap. This update in particular might help you in this issue to fix any performance issues, if you have any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information is helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to usa dn we would be happy to help you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>I have a similar problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalled FSX - Gold and it run OK on my Win 10 64Bit PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Loaded Acceleration and initially got 1-80004005 errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran KB928080 in admin mode and also changed 'partmgr' to PartMgr but then get error code 8-c0000006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My copy of FSX-Accleration is genuine as I used the code for FSX to register the base program and got 'Multiplayer' option showing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got another solution outside KB928080, KB960481, KB 925772, KB969886, KB960481, KB927007 all of which I have tried and failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FSX-Acceleration used to work well before the 'anniversary update'?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Printer Properties</h2>
                    
<p>I applied a shortcut to printing by using, in printer properties, (ctrl-alt-P).&nbsp;&nbsp; The printer preferences pop up, which is what I want.&nbsp; It has always worked.<br />
Now, when typing ctrl-alt-P, the printer queue window pops up.&nbsp; How can I get the preferences window back when typing the shortcut?<br />
I&nbsp;did a restore; clearing shortcut and reapplied; and&nbsp;looked at the printer drive, but don't know&nbsp;enough about drives to mess with them.<br />
I have a Dell lptp, XPS M1330, w/Windows Vista Home; &nbsp;32-bit op. sys;&nbsp; version 6.0.6001 SP 1, SMBIOS version 2.4; &nbsp;hardware abstraction layer version = 6.0.6001.18000;&nbsp; 4.00GB memory(ram).&nbsp;</p>

I am not quite sure how you created this shortcut, if you can explain what printer you have, what application you are using, and how you created the shortcut, we can better assist you.&nbsp; The normal shortcut to bring up the printer properties is ctrl+P, not ctrl+alt+P.&nbsp;
 Is this ability to create a shortcut specific to your printer or application?&nbsp; Please provide this information so we can assist you in resolving this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

    <title>Nothing will print after upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pattholle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Nothing will print after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p><span>I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 about a week ago. Everything works even better than before, except one thing: I can no longer print from any kind of printer! I
 have tried my own Samsung SCX-3405W, and my friend’s HP LaserJet M401dn, where his laptop running on Windows 10 can print without any problem. I even cannot create PDF files using Acrobat X Pro Extended. With the Samsung SCX-3405W, I have tried everything
 from remove/add device, troubleshoot, drivers update, Printerdiagnostic10, and all the various tips found on this as well as other forums. Alas, it just won’t work. (Samsung Support has confirmed this printer model is indeed compatible with Windows 10.)<br />
<br />
When trying to print from MS Word, I get the error message “Windows cannot print due to a problem with the current printer setup”. When trying to print from Acrobat Reader, I get the error message “The document could not be printed”, and subsequently “There
 were no pages selected to print”. Finally, when running the Samsung Printer Diagnostics app, I get the error message “Operation could not be completed (error 0x0000003d). The printer queue is full.” (My laptop has the following specs: Samsung Series 5 Ultra,
 Intel Core i3 @ 1.90GHz, 4.00GB RAM, 64-bit Operating System.)<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any clue as to how to fix this exceedingly frustrating problem? Thank you kindly in advance! /Pat</span></p>

 click on it and select, Set as default Printer. </span></p>
<p>

<br />
Thank you kindly for your response. Regrettably, none of the two methods you suggested solved the problem. As I mentioned in my initial post, I do not only have problems with my Samsung printer but with every printer, including Acrobat X Pro Extended for PDF
 file creation. To me it seems as though something is blocking the laptop from communicating with printer devices; any idea what that could be? Thanks/Pat</span>

            <p>I believe you have already set your default, now do one thing Press windows Key along with letter R then type services.msc and find print Spoolar. right click on go to properties then disable and stop then apply and OK....Then do the same and again go to
 properties of Print spooler and then Select Automatic from Drop Down list. and then Apply and then click on start.
</p>
and then check again It would be up and running and if still you got the same error then uninstall the complete printer driver along with software and install it again with compatibility mode. or &nbsp;&nbsp;

<br />
Thank you kindly for your new response. I have now been able to try your suggested solution. Strangely enough, I still get the same error message, even when trying to create a PDF file from an MS Word file using Acrobat X Pro Extended. Hence, whatever is blocking
 the print function still seems to be doing so. Any other ideas for a solution? Thanks/Pat<br />

(PS: Am I really the first one to experience this problem after upgrading to Windows 10!?)</span>

I’ve been on an overseas trip. Now that I’m back, I’ve been able to run the Samsung printer diagnostics another time (I already tried this solution before posting my initial question). Regrettably, the Samsung printer diagnostics is unable to find any other
 solution than telling me again, </span><span>“Operation could not be completed (error 0x0000003d). The printer queue is full.”<br />
<br />
Moreover, the problem appears to be deeper than that, i.e. not pertaining to a specific printer, as the laptop—which I’ve explained several times before—won’t even print to a PDF creator. /Pat</span>

<p><span>My printer is an HP 8600 - but as I see this its not related to the printer as such.</span></p>

    <title>Max size of swap file also 4096MB if enabled to &#34;system managed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Max size of swap file also 4096MB if enabled to &#34;system managed size&#34;</h2>
                    <br />
If to try forcing the page file size to manual setting by selecting "Custom size"<br />
Windows XP says something like "Not more than 4096MB please!".<br />
<br />
Therefore the question is: If to choose "system managed size" will the OS <br />
also respect the size limitation of 4096MB? Or is such limitation in that case<br />
not more valid?<br />

            Yes, quotation is fine.<br />
Page file is set to 4782MB and split to two disks: 716 (system partition) and 4066 (swap file dedicated hdd).<br />
Anyhow I don't understand why specs of this system is necessary for answering the question.<br />
It is rather a generic question regarding how in general handles this topic.<br />
Will the OS also respect the limit as it is arising when user aims to set swap file size manually?<br />

    <title>Problems with Windows Installer for Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleynorth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Windows Installer for Win 7</h2>
                    
<p>Is there any help out there for Windows Installer for Windows 7 ?</p>
<p>Mine has stopped working and I just can't get it to work ( I have looked at some of the fixes recommended by various websites, but they don't seem to work for me ).&nbsp; This problem prevents me from installing relevant programs on my PC - Adobe, for instance.</p>
<p>I run 32 Bit Home Premium version of Winodws 7.</p>
<p>If I can't get the Installer working, does anyone know of a link to enable me to download and reinstall it ( I just can't seem to find it either ! )</p>
<p>Many thanks !</p>
<p>Ash</p>
