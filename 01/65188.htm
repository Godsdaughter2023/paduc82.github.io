            Hi Loren.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Try different Screen Resolutions to find one that fits, at Settings &gt; System &gt; Display.   Set any Scaling changes back to 100% in the same location.
<br />
<br />3)  If this doesn't help then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Loren
<br />
<br />This is highly unusual on a laptop, usually this happens because a monitor needs adjusting on the monitor menu . . .
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard shortcut below to restart your Graphics Card:
<br />
<br />Ctrl + Windows + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this, go to the support page for your Laptop on the MSI website then download and install the graphics driver they recommend, that may be older, but it will be compatible with your laptop . .

<h2>            Upgrading Windows 7 &#40;Starter&#41; to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently accepted a free Microsoft upgrade of Windows 7 (Starter) to Windows 10 on my Netbook. The upgrade process went smooth, but then I ran into several serious issues that ended up in uninstalling Windows 10 and reinstalling Win 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Crashing: Windows 10 crashed several times after full installation and activation. Every time it crashed, it would restart normally and uneventfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) At first, I could activate the START menu. But then, and as Windows 10 started crashing, I could no longer activate it. I could also no longer open explorer nor type a question on the lower left task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) To fix the issue of the START menu, I attempted to invoke System Restore. After restoring to the intended point, and upon reboot, window's start circle was looping continuously for hours, while my screen was turning off and on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, this is an advise to people who are attempting to upgrade from Windows 7 (Starter): Do not upgrade. If you really want windows 10, go and buy it, then perform a full uninstall and install on your machine.</p>

            <p>I can relate with the Upgrade option as yes- it CAN- but not always cause problems upgrading the operating system. Though the 'upgrade' option has been done successfully several times on other laptops and particularly desktops. Usually if I can- ALWAYS,
 ALWAYS select the 'FULL re-install' option when upgrading your Windows 7/8 computer to Windows 10. You'll run into far less problems. YES- you will have to re-install your drivers...</p>
<p>But the BEST thing about Windows 10- your Windows 7 and Windows 8 drivers will be backwards-compatible under windows 10. I've done it numerous times as I work repairing/refurbishing computers for a pawn shop.
</p>
<p>You don't need to go and buy windows 10- you'll run into the very same problem if you were to upgrade from a purchased version.
</p>
<p>Simply- ALWAYS do a clean re-install if you can- it does save compatibility problems. I think I've only done an upgrade two or three times on desktops, albeit successfully- but if I can- I'll always clean-re-install the system.</p>
<p>Simply, when the second or third window comes up in the installation, select, "Upgrade Windows 10" and "Keep Nothing."&nbsp;(It might automatically just jump to the 'upgrade' window. If this happens, press the 'back' button and select 'keep nothing'.</p>
<p>Regards, Nigel</p>

    <title>How do I fix the Winsock cmd error message, &#34; this operation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theresa13  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix the Winsock cmd error message, &#34; this operation requires elevation&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    I am having serious troubles with my machine not getting on the internet. I have already established that it is not the modem or the ISP. &nbsp;I have done a sys restore over the last 72 hours ( one a day ) and nothing has been fixed. I will note that on Sunday
 night, the power in which the machine was in was interrupted. I did not turn the machine back on until Tuesday, at which time my AVG antivirus picked up a trojan back door and supposedly deleted it. This would make the 2nd encounter with the same virus within
 the last 30 days. &nbsp;After my machine reboot, the internet icons were not flashing and my antivirus had a yellow triangle with an "!" on it. I started to investigate and found out that I cannot connect to my ISP, which is Clear4g. I contacted them and since
 the machine I am on &nbsp;now is successfully running on their service, we determined they were not at fault. &nbsp;SO...
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I attempted to repair the winsock using the instruction given on this site. &nbsp;However, when I tried to do it on CMD, I got the message "this operation requires elevation" and that was it. I don't know what that means but it can't be good. &nbsp;I looked in the
 BIOS (?) and found that almost all of the HKEY &nbsp;had "Parental Controls LSP over" in front of them. ex: Parental Controls LSP over [MSAFD Tcpip [TCP/IP]]</div>
<div>The other HKEY entries looked like they were supposed to, but they also had numbers and letters after it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>ex: MSDAF NetBios [\device\net BT-Tcpip6-6FDB78822-6240-44A1-9CU-2FBE3DD...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>i could use a little bit of help with this one. I do not wish to format again as the OS disc I have is from the rent to own place I bought the machine from.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            I would suggest using a tool called Hirens, it is open source, it has a virus scan and removal tool so you can make sure you do not have a virus, you can also boot into it as a live disk and elevate your profile to have full admin rights, the error message
 you are getting is stating that you do not have admin rights, if you are an admin on your computer right click on cmd and select run as administrator, you should no longer get this error, simply running cmd as administrator should fix your problem of elevated
 rights if you are in fact admin on your computer, if not elevate your profile to have admin rights, this can be done by logging in as the local admin and going to the computer&nbsp;management&nbsp;and expanding "local users and groups" click on the "groups" folder and
 then open the one that says "administrator" click the add button and type in your user name, then click "check names" to ensure you have no typo's, then apply, log back in as you and run cmd as administrator again. to get to where you can right click on cmd
 in the search bar on the start menu type in cmd and it will show above.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Hope this fixes your problem</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit- Damaged &#39;ExplorerFrame.dll&#39; file</h2>
                    Hey there everybody-<br />
<br />
So, yesterday, booted up my laptop to find that when I tried to log in, Windows Explorer would crash. I would get past the login screen, and before it could load the desktop, I got the error message "windows explorer has stopped working"<br />
<br />
I wrote down the specs of the error message..<br />
<br />
Problem Event Name: InPageCoFire<br />
Error Status Code: c0000185<br />
Faulting Media Type: 00000003<br />
Damaged File Name: ExplorerFrame.dll<br />
OS Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.768.3<br />
Locale ID: 1033<br />
<br />
So, I restarted in safe mode. I got the same error. <br />
<br />
Started in Safe Mode with CMD prompt, and ran SFC/ SCANNOW. It seemed to stall at 13% for nearly 45 minutes. I stopped this, and tried to Repair the System -and- also tried 3 system restores (up to two months back) from the F8 menu. They all failed, and I wasn't
 able to log in normally and have Windows Explorer function.<br />
<br />
This file is located at C:/windows/system32/ExplorerFrame.dll<br />
<br />
I could back up my hard drive and just do a full wipe, reinstalling windows, but I don't want to have to reinstall all of my programs.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions? :-/ <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
Dell 1440<br />
Intel Centrino Processor<br />
Windows 7 64 bit (Upgraded from Vista in early January)<br />

Hey Drubes,</p>
<p>How long have you had this issue?</p>
<p>Any recent changes made to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>I suggest you to run SFC scan to find missing or corrupt files that may be causing this issue.</p>
<p>System File Checker (SFC) checks that all Windows 7 system files are where they should be as they were by default and not corrupted, changed, or damaged.</p>
<p>1. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and&nbsp; select Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>2. Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</p>
<p>3. In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</p>
<p>4. You should see the following on-screen message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beginning verification phase of system scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Verification % complete.</p>
<p>5. Once the scan has completed, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refer the KB article for more information:&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dual boot of Windows 7 32 bit and 64 bit, how to remove 32 bit&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought a computer with Win 7 64 bit and called Dell and they sent me&nbsp; a 32 bit cause I wanted that instead, but now I don't want it anymore.&nbsp; The thing is when I installed it it still kept the 64 bit on the computer so when you restart you can either click
 on the win7 32 bit or win 7 64 bit.&nbsp; How do I just delete the 32bit off the computer but keep the 64 bit on the computer.</p>

<p>If the 32 bit Windows 7 is installed on a partition, you will simply have to format and delete that drive. If its a primary boot drive, you will have to do a repair installation of Windows 7 64 bit.</p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer<br />
Click Manage<br />
Expand Disk Management<br />
<br />
Select the drive on which Windows 7 32 bit is installed<br />
Right click it, click 'Format'<br />
You will receive a Warning dialog, click OK to continue.<br />
<br />
The next step is to select your file system option, in this case, go with the default which is NTFS.<br />
The formatting process will now begin.<br />
Once complete, the drive will be displayed as a ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management.<br />
<br />
Right click the ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management, on the contextual menu, click the ‘Delete Volume’ option. Click ‘Yes’ when the warning dialog appears.<br />
The Volume you deleted will now appear as ‘Free space’, you will also notice that the disk icon no longer appears in the list of volumes.<br />
Right click the Free space partition, and click Delete, click Yes on the Disk Management warning that appears.<br />
<br />
<br />
The volume will now appear as Unallocated. (good stuff). Our next step is to merge back that unallocated free space with the system partition (where Windows 7 64 bit is installed). Right click the System volume and click the ‘Extend Volume’ option on the contextual
 menu, click ‘Yes’ when the warning appears.<br />
<br />
A wizard will now begin that will guide through the steps to merge back the unallocated space with your system partition.<br />
<br />
The wizard provides a simple procedure to merge back the unallocated space with the system drive. Once you have selected the space, click Next, at the end of the wizard, you will see the amount allocated.</p>
<p>If the Windows 7 32 bit entry you happen to be seeing on the Windows 7 boot manager, all you need to do is simply delete it.</p>
<p>Click Start, type: msconfig.exe</p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard</p>
<p>Go to the boot tab'</p>
<p>Select the entry for Windows 7 32 bit and click Delete.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Display Adaptor &#34;Couldn&#39;t connect&#34; - Not to Windows 10 at least.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Display Adapter v1, recently Windows 10 simply says "Couldn't Connect". No explanation, no reason.. I've come to the conclusion the fault is with Win10 or my hardware, although my hardware has not changed for some time and not with the
 adapter. The reason being is that my Samsung phone and other devices connect to it happily and work as they should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all options in the troubleshooter, done the usual resets, etc.. Adapter is up to date with latest firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm after a real solution here or thoughts on next steps, or at the least know if anyone else is having/had the same issues?</p>
<p>

            What I would do is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.  
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are Upgrade hurdles go over this Checklist to optimize the install for upgrade: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist after Upgrade go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Windows 10 Refresh which reinstalls Windows while leaving out the factory bloatware that throttles Windows and causes endless issues, and lets you save your files.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>Thanks for the speedy reply, I will check my version when back on my home PC and try an upgrade if required. I find it strange windows update does not always pick these updates up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean install is unfortunately not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this stage, I am doubtful the Windows version is the fault here though. I will update my progress later.<br />

<p>Are there any settings that could effect display adapters that aren't listed on the troubleshooter?</p>

<p>I have discovered the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually lied about recent hardware changes, thinking they would be of no consequence to this. They were indirect changes. First was an xbox wireless adapter for pc controller support.&nbsp;My second change was Sky's new Q hub (Dual band)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding change 1 - I recently I tried discovering why "ethernet 2" (even when connected to wifi) keeps popping up in my network settings so attempted to change setting in the device manager. I discovered its actually the xbox adapter, that for no apparent
 reason, shows as "ethernet 2". I did not realise I had disabled a 'wifi direct' setting or something similar. I reverted this to enabled.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding change 2 - probably the more important issue: my Wifi dongle is a dual band dongle - my new router is also now dual band (finally sky have a decent router). By default the sky router has the same SSID for both bands. i'm glad i was aware of this
 because my educated guess is that there are effectively no available bands for my dongle to connect to the display adapter while connected to the router.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply disabling my internet connection allows me to connect to the adapter. I'll have to change both SSID's in order to use both internet and display adapter.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely my Samsung galaxy S8+ connects to the wireless adapter AND Router (with mobile data turned off to confirm) - I believe this is dual band but unsure if it can actually connect to two bands at the same time so not sure if its the same issue.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>So in a case like this you would need to contact Xbox support and inform them that your sons account was compromised and the people that got onto the account then did things to violate the code of conduct and got your sons account permanently banned they would then fill out a form and do an investigation to determine if the account was truly compromised and part of the form is having you start a new Microsoft account and if they determine that the account was truly compromised then they will transfer all of your information over to the new account that they have you create.</p>

            <p>being in the U.S. I've been tempted to get a UK ip address so I could get this, I keep hoping for a us version (I'd be fine paying&nbsp; a reasonable subscription price) but I guess there are issues because it duplicates BBC America.&nbsp; I assume your IP address
 is in one of the authorized countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway first uninstall iplayer and reinstall.&nbsp; If that doesn't work: what is the exact error message you get?&nbsp;&nbsp;That might help people figure out what the problem is.&nbsp; Do you use it on another computer (from the same internet account)?</p>

<p>Hola amigos:</p>
<p>Quisiera saber como podria actualizar la lista de los equipos de la Copa LIbertadores 2013, ya que en la version que adquiri hay equipos de mi pais que no aparecen..</p>
<p>Tampoco la seleccion de mi pais Paraguay aparece actualizada en la lista de jugadores.</p>
<p>Ya baje los Data Pack 1, 2 y 3 para el PES y no actualiza los equipos.</p>

<p>Muchas gracias.</p>

    <title>port 3389 refused connection windows 7 remote desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shamus6564  say:</h3>
<h2>            port 3389 refused connection windows 7 remote desktop</h2>
                    I turned on all of the remote desktop services and even took down the firewall and antivirus and opened all of the ports to the internet<br />
and still get back (Error:&nbsp;I could <b>not</b> see your service on <b>75.121.26.151</b> on port (<b>3389</b>)<br />
Reason:To get around the problem of a frequently changing IP address, try a DNS dynamic update service, which allows you to assign a URL to your router that you can use instead of an IP address. The URL stays the same no matter how often the IP address changes.
 To find a service, search for "DNS dynamic update" on the Internet.)<br />
<br />
I go to canyouseeme.org and get this error everytime.&nbsp; The strange thing is, the ports were working last week when i was trying to install RemoteSuite for my<br />
cell phone.&nbsp; That didn't work out but was able to access my computer desktop via the internet but not the network.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there something in windows 7 blocking 3389, my isp is not blocking it, i checked.<br />

<p><a href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/RemoteDesktopTroubleshootingChecklist.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/RemoteDesktopTroubleshootingChecklist.html</a></p>
<p>Remember you need to use a static LAN IP address for the Remote Desktop [RDC] host on your LAN in order to not negate any port forwarding issues on your router. If you have a dynamically assigned public IP from your ISP look at using a free service like
 No-IP.com or DynDNS to map a fully qualified domain name [FQDN] to your ISPs DHCP assigned public IP address.</p>
<p>Lastly if you changed the RDC listening port on the RDC host in its registry you need to reboot the PC for the change to be effective and make changes in your router to reflect the new port.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I understand your concern and I'll be glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Did Windows 10 download successfully?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Ensure that you have removed&nbsp;non-essential hardware or USB device connected to the laptop except keyboard and
</span><span>mouse and check&nbsp;before you try the steps below:</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into your Bios and check to make sure that the right boot drive is selected. Boot drives get mixed in the bios setting on some systems resulting in the computer trying to boot from a non-bootable drive resulting in the error message you have received.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may as well check your RAM and see if it is causing the issue. </p>

<p>The problematic driver appears to be the AtihdLH6.sys and the&nbsp;version of that driver appears to be the same as in the other thread.</p>

    <title>Problems Connecting Canon SX280 WiFi to Windows 7 &#40;64bit&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjjjs38  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems Connecting Canon SX280 WiFi to Windows 7 &#40;64bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can help me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently&nbsp;bought a Canon SX280HS which&nbsp;has wifi capability, and I'm having a problem connecting it to my laptop.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I'm using a Dell Inspiron N7110 laptop which is running Windows&nbsp;7 (64bit).&nbsp;&nbsp; It connects to the internet and to a wireless printer&nbsp;via a
 fairly new Netgear wifi&nbsp;router without and&nbsp;problems at all. &nbsp;&nbsp; This laptop also has Intel (R) My Wifi Technology, and I can access the utility for it via the control panel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing the wifi set up software that came with the&nbsp;camera, I&nbsp;first tried to connect the camera via the Netgear router.&nbsp;&nbsp; After putting in the correct encryption key (I've done this many, many times), it searches for the device, but never finds
 it, and eventually times out with a "communication error" and "device not found."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was ready to send the camera back to Amazon...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But then I tried to connect the camera&nbsp;via the &nbsp;Intel (R) My Wifi Utility.&nbsp;&nbsp; I enabled the technology, put in the correct encryption key, and the Canon pops up&nbsp;on the connected list, showing its MAC address and a strong wifi signal.&nbsp;&nbsp; The camera then sees
 the name of my Dell laptop, but when I try to connect it, all I get is "Connecting."&nbsp; Eventually, it will time out with a&nbsp;"communication error" and "connection failed."&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I figure at this point that the wifi on the camera is working correctly because it clearly connects to the Intel (R) My Wifi on my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone tell me how to configure my laptop to allow the rest of the connection?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, I've tried this multiple times with my antivirus ON and OFF, and my firewall ON and OFF, and it doesn't make a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Had the same problem with the same camera on Windows . For me, I fixed it by going to Control Panel&gt;Network and Sharing Center&gt;View network computers and devices (do this while the camera is attempting to connect to your PC. I then right clicked on the icon
 of my camera and clicked 'Install'. Also make sure 'file and printer sharing' is on (my PC actually prompted this). Don't know if this will help, but worked for me. Can now import wirelessly!</p>
<p>All the best,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your Windows Product ID: 00359-<strong>231</strong> -7792854-86069</p>
<p>Microsoft's Response: Microsoft is committed to helping prevent software piracy, which often results in end users being the victims of software counterfeiters. Counterfeiters abuse product keys to create fake software packages and distribute these to the
 public. These packages are not licensed, do not have Microsoft support, and can also include dangerous malware and spyware.<br />
<br />
Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key to
 multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has become
 non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to www.microsoft.com/geniune and follow the links provided to repair windows.<br />
<br />
Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory can
 secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.<br />

<br />
EDIT: Additional information<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for.<br />
<br />
Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased
 it from and report it to www.microsoft.com/piracy&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product
 go to www.microsoft.com/howtotell and verify your product however some counterfeit software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.<br />
<br />
To check your PID press the win key and pause at the same time, or open system properties through the control panel, scroll down to activation section and look at the PID It will look something like this 12345-067-1234567-54321, the portion you are interested
 in is the three digit section, if it matches or is within one or two digits of the examples below you probably have an MSDN key.<br />
<br />
065, 066, 067, 068 for Ultimate, 220 area for Pro and the 230, <strong>231</strong> , 221 area for premium, there are probably others but they should be close to those posted<br />
<br />

Click the 'Validate Windows' button, if the validation check fails, then click on the 'Get Genuine' button to get a WGA Kit.</p>

    <title>Your PC needs to be repaired. The Boot Configuration Data is missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riehupallero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your PC needs to be repaired. The Boot Configuration Data is missing or contains errors. File &#58;&#92;EFI&#92;Microsoft&#92;Boot&#92;BCD. Error code 0x0000185.</h2>
                    <p>On start-up, my parents laptop (HP) gives this message (shown above) on a blue screen. It's running Windows 10, but came pre-installed with a Windows 8. There's no recovery tool/installation media existing in the household. What are the steps to take to
 get the laptop working again? So far, this is all the information I have, I don't know if something's been installed on the laptop before the problem occurred, will probably post more on this later when given further information. Is it worth trying the automatic
 repair? (Start-up and shut down when the HP logo appears, doing that two more times, and getting the repair on the third time when starting up)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies in advance!</p>

<p>Okay, so I found out that there was a Skype update on before the laptop started malfunctioning. There were also two games installed via Steam, which I doubt caused the issue. And two games were uninstalled.</p>

                    <p>Hi I was hoping I could receive some assistance ASAP.</p><p>I've been using the Game Bar to record my games ever since I upgraded to windows 10 last year, I tried everything this article said but nothing is fixing my problem... (Yes all my software is up to date)</p><p>https://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-on-windows/social/troubleshoot-game-dvr-windows-10#aa036a3651fc47d98142c2a7574c5e6c </p><p><br /></p><p>In the last week or so, any time I attempt to record a game it just tries to start recording then gets an error saying "there is nothing to record. Play some more and try again."</p><p>It does this with EVERY game I have excluding ONE!!!</p><p><br /></p><p>I know all these games can be recorded because I've recorded gameplay from them all before...</p><p>Suddenly its just turning up its nose at them all, the only game that isn't having the problem is "Resident Evil 5" which runs as a fullscreen game that won't actually show the Game Bar but rather uses the Win+Alt+R shortcut to record

<h2>            UK Xbox 360 in Canada</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I purchased my Xbox 360 in UK and used it with no problems in Europe (with plug adapter). In a few months I will be moving to Canada, and I was very sad and a little angry when I saw that my console is not "universal voltage". I searched, but I did not find
 useful information on where do I buy an official Xbox charger with canadian voltage and plug, and wether or not my console will work there or not.</p>
<p>Any information is greatly appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>Alina</p>

<p>What you have to do is just to buy a North American power brick. You will also need a PAL compatible or (more likely) HDTV otherwise the picture will be in black and white. HD component is fine though, you don't need to use HDMI.</p>
<p>Also you will need to buy PAL region or Open region game discs when you are there.</p>

<p>So if I buy a North American power brick and connect the Xbox to a HDTV or PAL+NTSC compatible TV via HDMI cable, it should work fine. That's good news for me.</p>
<p>I do not use the Xbox for DVD play, so I do not care about dvds compatibility. As for the games, well yes, I would just buy region-free games or from UK/Europe if PAL-only.</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer, I hope I understood correctly.</p>
