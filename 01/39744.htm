<h2>            laptop</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>i am aware that this has not much to do with Microsoft but i still think you may be able to answer it. i have an old Toshiba satellite L50-B-1NL, when i press the power button i can hear the optical drive spin and other components work though the screen
 stays black, after trying a few techniques the laptop turned on and displayed the Toshiba screen and then said low RTC battery, it then turned off. i know that this battery need replacing but i cant find anywhere on the internet a cmos battery that is compatible
 with this laptop. are all cmos batteries compatible? some have wires whilst on my desktop PC&nbsp;</p>
<p>its just exposed in one slot. do i need a certain one?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

            Hi reecehoskins 
<br />
<br />Please try this:
<br />
<br />Remove the power cord form your laptop
<br />
<br />Remove the main battery pack (not the CMOS (RTC) battery)
<br />
<br />Press and hold the Power Button on your laptop for 30 seconds
<br />
<br />Put the battery back into the laptop
<br />
<br />Connect the power cord
<br />
<br />Start your laptop - do you still get the Real Time Clock battery warning?

            Hi Reece, 
<br />
<br />Okay, sorry that did not work for you . . .
<br />
<br />Please check these batteries, I believe the first link is the battery you need for your model, even though it is listed for a different Toshiba model, once the voltage is the same (which it is) once the connection on that battery is correct, it will work on your laptop . ..

 sit in?

            Hi Reece,
<br />
<br />Okay I have been doing some reading up on this, a Toshiba L50-B does not have a CMOS battery, that is why they are impossible to find on the Web . . .
<br />
<br />The ePROM chip is powered differently to most laptops on that model and Toshiba say the RTC battery is not user replaceable, you need to send that to a recognized Toshiba repair center to resolve this . . .

<h2>            After Windows 8 upgrade user account no longer has admin. rights</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 8.&nbsp; Now my user account no longer has administrator privileges as it did on Windows 7 and I am basically unable to do much of anything that I need to do.&nbsp; None of the instructions I've found online to access the hidden Windows
 8 administrator account work.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I am at a loss at this point.&nbsp; I can't even set up a new user account and give it administrator privileges without already being on an administrator account.
<br />
<br />
Anyone have any idea what I can do from here?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

            My sister had the same problem when she upgraded to W8.&nbsp; I had her unhide the admin account, log in, and set up a new user giving it full administrator privileges.&nbsp; I also had her export all the favorite places she had set on her browser before so she
 wouldn't have to manually bookmark all those sites again.&nbsp; Once she had the new user set up the way she wanted it she just deleted the old user account.&nbsp;

since I upgraded to Windows 10 my computer just shuts down by itself all the time.&nbsp; At least a half dozen times a day.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to shut down while I'm working on it most of the time and I have noticed that it may be shuting down when the lock screen
 comes on.&nbsp; I am using the new outlook which allowed me to access the exchange account for my company which requires the security measures which lock the screen after a certain amount of time.&nbsp; It's getting pretty annoying so I would appreciate anyone's suggestion
 on how to fix it.

            Hi Nanden
<br />
<br />If you have Windows 10 Pro installed you can use the built-in Bitlocker to encrypt your folders - right click a folder and choose Properties - Advanced
<br />
<br />Is the 'Encrypt contents to secure data' option enabled or greyed out. If that is enabled, tick that box to encrypt the contained data
<br />
<br />If that box is greyed out, you do not have Bitlocker, you will need to use a 3rd party utility to encrypt a folder, the best free options available on the web are VeraCrypt and Secret Folder . . .       
        </p>

            Hi Nandan ... lock them from what?
<br />So you need a password to open them or that they are encrypted?
<br />Windows 10 does not have a built in capability to lock folders.  You would have to find a 3rd party utility for that.
<br />As for encrypting folders you can use EFS.  But make sure to export your private key and store it on a different location.
<br />See link for EFS.

                    I've been stuck with an issue that's persisted for about a month now (started December 10 2015). I have an Pavilion 15 Notebook PC that I purchased on April 1 2015 with Windows 8.1 installed (warranty is good until March 31 2016), and up until the mentioned
 December date my device had been working fine. But ever since then, my laptop has decided to have its screen go black at intermittent intervals. Not dimmed, flickering, or anything like that, but just black. Any playing sound will be cut off as well. The power

<p>But they do not install and there is an error every time. I have seen some posts regarding this and advise to create file names and other links etc but these are not helpful. Surely MS should sort this out and rerun the update?
</p>
<p>And exactly how "important" are these updates? If MS has not sorted out the issue I assume it is not a priority for them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some advice would be welcome, thanks. </p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>When any update won't install it always produces an error code. We need to know what those are to try and determine what the problem might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find the error code, open Windows Update and then click "View update history" in the left hand menu. Click the Status column to sort by Failed at the top (if it doesn't show already) and then find both updates which failed to install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click each in turn which will provide more info which includes the error code. Here's a screenshot of an error code.

            <p>I've made a schedule too and they didn't call, contacted microsoft support, they said my case wasn't escalated to Level 2 support, I explained my problem, They escalated my case to Level 2 and in a few minutes I should be able to call a number they provided
 me and they should help me using Level 2 support or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just try contacting microsoft support and ask what's going on, why they aren't calling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll hopefully get sorted out.</p>

            Hi Davisfessenko, 
<br />
<br />We'll first try the Windows Update Troubleshooter 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://aka.ms/wudiag" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/wudiag</a> - download here, run this, and see if that can detect and fix your problem. 
<br />
<br />If no luck, we'll run a couple of scans to try to repair corrupt sys files. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type “cmd” - right click and run as admin - then copy and paste this:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth    
<br />
<br />Hit enter, and wait for that to finish, and move onto the next command. Type(or copy and paste): 
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow         
<br />
<br />Hit enter, and after this finishes, reboot, and try windows updates again.
<br />
<br />If still no luck, let's try to manually purge the Update Cache
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />click start and type cmd, right click and run as admin. Type:
<br />“net stop wuauserv” and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Click start, type control panel - file explorer options - click the view tab, and make sure “show hidden files...” is buttoned off. 
<br />
<br />Once done, navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download and delete the content of the Download folder. 
<br />
<br />Click start again, type cmd, right click and run as admin, type:
<br />“net start wuauser” and hit enter. 
<br />
<br />After this, reboot and then try to run Windows updates again.
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Hi Davis
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Windows Updates
<br />
<br />What update(s) are showing as pending on your system?
<br />
<br />
<br />In the meantime, download Windows Update Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Run that to see if that can resolve this for you . . .

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Upgrade problems</h2>
                    <p>Started the upgrade from Win 8.1 to Win 10 Pro August 5. Had several problems from start but fixed some of them.</p>
<p>Still have following problems;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. OneDrive, when starting up. Error "A problem occurred when connecting to OneDrive".</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;No problem accessing OneDrive from Office 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Can not open Store and preinstalled Apps are "greyed out". When trying open Store, a short flicker on screen and then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Can not login on my Microsoft Account any more. This after trying to change the password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Because of showing \*** Email address is removed for privacy *** in account field? From where came this \ (backslash)?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Gets error "wrong account name or password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Cann not do a "repair install" from ISO or DVD. Fails with error "Modern Setup Host has stopped working"</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Can not roll back to Win 8.1. Says that old files no longer are there. But I have still have the windows.old folder with</p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;29,5GB / 148822 files / 31984 folders</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. NDAS Software (for my network disc connected to my WIFI router) causes BSOD (blue screen &nbsp; crash)&nbsp;</span>KERNEL_AUTO_BOOST_LOCK_ACQUISITION_WTH_RAISED_IRQL (lpx6x.sys) when botting up.</p>
<p>Anyone any idea how to fix or proceed?</p>

<p>Hi Sangeeta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems you don't noticed no 4 of my problems stated:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Cannot do a "repair install" from ISO or DVD. Fails with error "Modern Setup Host has stopped working"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried to reinstall by using the Media creation tool and Win 10 ISO-file 3 times.</p>
<p>Both using the DVD I created and direct by mounting the ISO-file kept on the computer.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the ISO two times to be on safe side.</p>
<p>But sorry to say, after a while running the install, I get the error "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Modern Setup Host has stopped working".</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I hope you have another idea of how to continue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">But of course I can try it the 4th time.</span></p>

<p>Hello again.</p>
<p>I have now for the 4th time tried to install from the DVD I created.</p>
<p>This time from another account, a Microsoft account.</p>
<p>After about 12 minutes in the phase "checking if installation can start", the error message appears.:</p>
<p>Modern Setup Host has stopped working<br />
A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.</p>
<p>So no progress here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have made a small progress on problem no 1.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;(OneDrive, when starting up. Error "A problem occurred when connecting to OneDrive".&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">No

<h2>            Microsoft Register Server not found</h2>
                    I recently just installed Visual Studios 2010 to my computer. However, I had already had Finale 2010 (a song writing program) installed on my computer. Once VS2010 was on, I guess it began to handle my .dll files now it conflicts with my Finale program.
 It stated that the Microsoft Register Server could not be found anymore. How can I go about restoring/reinstalling the Microsoft Register Server??

<p>Are you running 64 Bit or 32 Bit Windows 7? &nbsp;Also, what version of Internet Explorer are you using?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does Finale 2010 is give you this error when you attach a new effect or instrument DLL? &nbsp;If not, when does Finale 2010 give you the error?&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are running 64 Bit Windows 7, the Microsoft Register Server regsvr32.exe may be in multiple locations on your computer:</p>

<br />
I will give you steps to recover from both Windows and in Repair Mode that uses different drivers and should work if Windows won't.<br />
<br />
There is a fix released from Microsoft here to apply if you're able: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4091240/usb-devices-may-stop-working-after-installing-the-february-13-2018-upd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409124...</a><br />
<br />
You can try uninstalling it at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.<br />
<br />
You might also be able to get back before it via System Restore: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a><br />
<br />
Then if it reinstalls and causes the same problems, uninstall it again and block it using Method Two here:

https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a><br />
<br />
If necessary you can perform these operations in Safe Mode: <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a><br />
<br />
But if you can't get into Safe Mode try Advanced Startup Options by whichever method works here:
<a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a> <br />
<br />
If no other method works it may be necessary to create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>. Boot mode uses different drivers so mouse and keyboard should work.<br />
<br />
Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a><br />
<br />
Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered. If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />
After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.
<br />
<br />
If System Restore fails access the Command Prompt to try Option Five here to unlock F8 Advanced Boot Options in Windows 10 to reach Safe Modes:

            Hi again Muhammad.  
<br />
<br />I understand now.  There is more about the controls for this on HP laptops here:  <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Software-and-How-To-Questions/How-do-I-enable-my-touchpad/td-p/869533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Desktop-Software-...</a>
<br />
<br />Have you gone over all of the controls in Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Touchpad and also at the right hand side in the link for Additional Options where the touchpad software adds a tab to the Mouse Properties?  
<br />
<br />Make sure you're running the latest Touchpad driver from the HP Support Downloads web page for your serial number on the PC sticker.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps I'd go back to that first link above and ask for help in the HP forums which is quite good.  You can try tacking it onto that same thread or start a new Thread.  
<br />
<br />Let us know how it goes.

    <title>Windows 10 Education Edition And Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> isaacschmitz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Education Edition And Cortana</h2>
                    Recently, MS decided to remove Cortana from Windows 10 Education Version. This is absolutely ridiculous that they would abandon a piece of software, especially if it works perfect, that they spent so much time developing. The fact that they did not give
 any of us the option to opt in or out of this removal is insulting. Cortana was apart of my daily schedule. She HELPED me SCHOOL (Therefore EDUCATION as well). I am very upset at the removal of this tool and expect a reasonable response as to why each user
 or even each organization is not given the choice to opt in or out of Cortana. I mean really MS? Even Apple wouldn't remove Siri just because it was on a students phone? The whole point of this thread is not just to vent. I was curious if ANYONE has any idea
 how to activate Cortana or find a way to download her again to my laptop. Is there anyway at all that I will be able to use Cortana again? Thanks for Everyone's information.

<h2>            Bootrec &#47;nt60 C&#58; killed my partition table and added a rogue efi partition</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I had an issue originally with my system freezing every time I left it idle for a period. I traced it to possibly an ATI error, incompatibility or problem. Chkdsk was ran but I was not able to fully diagnose this for sure untill the
<strong>REAL, BIG, </strong>problem happened. I was going to update my bios with the Gigabyte bios flash utility and decided to reboot and see what version I had before I upgraded and I accidentally pressed 'Delete' trying to enter the BIOS right when it went
 to the next screen where it says DMI Pool data which activated the 'press any key to ....' start Gigibyte's ExpressRecovery2. I exited out of ExpressRevocery 2 and should not have caused any issues, and even if I pressed 'OK' to run it, as I understand it
 would try to build a recovery partition at the end of your boot disk <strong>IF</strong> you had unallowcated space there and if not, spit out a message that there 'was not any space' and let you reboot.
</p>
<p>After this, the system would not boot back into Windows 7. It appeared to be loading but then would reboot. I thought the BCD or partition boot record had acquired corruption so I loaded the DVD and started the startup recovery which ran for 1.5 hours and
 said there was partition table corruption that it fixed. </p>
<p>Rebooted but then it was in this infinite loop where it went back and forth from the "windows boot manager windows failed to start 0xc000000e ....... the disk is not accessible" to the Boot Manager saying to put in the Windows Disk and 'press any key to
 boot it' but when I put in the windows disk it would just reboot to the bios and end up right back in the same spot.
</p>
<p>So I ran startup recovery two more times with the same result. </p>
<p>Then I ran diskpart and it did not show any partitions on the disk that had Windows 7 when in fact it had 2 Primaries and extended with 3 logical data partitions on this 1TB HDD which should have looked like so:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SIZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LABEL</strong></p>
<p>100MB ...........NTFS........... System Researved</p>
<p>80GB .............NTFS........... Windows 7</p>
<p>818GB ..................Extended</p>
<p>160GB ...........NTFS.......... Data</p>
<p>70GB&nbsp; ............NTFS......... Data</p>
<p>260GB ..................... Unallowcated</p>
<p>10GB .............NTFS........ Data</p>
<p>180&nbsp; ..............NTFS....... Data</p>
<p>160 ................NTFS..... Data</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then booted into UBCD and ran TestDisk which found all of the partitions and rewrote the partition tables and I thought I was finally getting somewhere.<br />
I then rebooted and I think it may have spit out an error that said something about a boot record problem.&nbsp;<br />
I read how to rebuild MBR or boot record which was to enter into the cmd "bootrect /nt60 C:<br />
Yes, that was bootrec<strong>T, </strong>as that is what it said to do and not bootrec as I notice so9me other tutorials tell you. boocrec command previously met with a message saying it was an unknown command. I don't know what the difference would be between
 bootrec and bootrect.</p>
<p>It still does not boot so then I decide to boot into GParted recovery cd since it has other diag tools and I notice right of that my partitions on this disk now look like the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>SIZE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; FS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LABEL</strong></p>
<p>100MB ................NTFS...... System Researved</p>
<p>30GB ..................NTFS...... (blank)</p>
<p>9.5GB .................FAT16 .... (blank)</p>
<p>892GB ..................Extended</p>
<p>21.4GB ............... Unallowcated</p>
<p>1.4MiB ................FAT16 .......EFISECTOR</p>
<p>22.4 ...................Unallowcated</p>
<p>160GB ..................... Data</p>
<p>70GB&nbsp; ..................... Data</p>
<p>260GB ..................... Unallowcated</p>
<p>10GB ...............NTFS......... Data</p>
<p>180&nbsp; .................NTFS ........ Data</p>
<p>160 ..................NTFS ........ Data</p>
<p>
</p><p>How in the world did this happen? It seams that MS engineers just decided what
<strong>EVERYONE </strong>must be using EFI and if you want to rebuild your boot records that the bootrec just puts it in there and rearranges your partitioning scheme and tables on top of it and thus destroying your partition tables and data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to remedy this? Or at least get all of my data back? This is really aggravating and I feel like I have been violated. All I wanted to do was rebuild the BCD after fixing the partition tables. Never had this kind of issue in the easy days
 back with XP.</p>

Boot from the Install disk &gt; Choose keyboard and click <strong>Next</strong> &gt; <strong>
Use recovery tools…</strong> and click <strong>Next</strong> &gt; choose <strong>Command Prompt</strong><br />
type &gt;<strong> bootrec /fixmbr</strong> (writes mbr but does not overwrite partition table)<br />
type &gt; <strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong> (writes new boot sector to system partition)<br />
type &gt; <strong>bootrec /scanos</strong> (scans for other OS’s that you might want to add to bcd)<br />
(personally I find the above unneeded and use the last step)<br />
type &gt; <strong>bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong> (scans for other OS’s, unlike rebuildbcd it allows you to select the OS’s you want to add to bcd)</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Option 2 – The Nuclear Option</strong></span><br />
This option is basically going to give you a new MBR and bootloader. I’ve used this quite a bit. Most recently I used it after removing Windows 7 from a dual boot and moving the Windows 8 partition up (via True Image). Anyway boot as above and use these commands:<br />
<strong>bootsect /nt60 c: /force /mbr</strong><br />
<strong>bcdboot c:\windows /s c:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>What these commands do:</p>
<p>Writes a new mbr to c:<br />
bootsect /nt60 c: /force /mbr<br />
( command, /nt60 = use boot code that is compatible with BOOTMGR, / = force dismount, / = write mbr )<br />
( bootsect does to touch mbr, it works on the selected drives…ahem….wait for it…bootsector)</p>
<p>Write a new bootloader to the C: drive<br />
bcdboot c:\windows /s c:<br />
( command, look in c:windows for files, copy files to c: (actually c:\windows\boot) )</p>

<p>Thanks for replying .... but its obvious you didn't read any of my OP and it appears that you may have cut and pasted these steps which are found in many forums. I was looking more for a specific solution that fits my circumstances. I shouldn't have to restate
 my original post but I will. Maybe this will help others that find it too cumbersome to read the whole thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to make this simpler.</p>
<p>1. Its not a recovery DVD. It's a Windows install DVD. I already booted from it three times and used the recovery tool (as stated) with no results.</p>
<p>2. I do not have a dual boot system so scanos would not do anything for this situation.</p>
<p>3. Using the /nt60 command is obviously for EFI installed systems as it shrunk my Windows partition and installed a fat16 efisector partition. This is what messed up my system to begin with.</p>
<p>4. I am trying to find a way to reverse what is done. </p>
<p>5. What was done you ask? See the original post. It shows my partition layout before and after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bootrec command I previously entered obviously reorganized my Windows partition. The system probably thinks it is an EFI install now. The command&nbsp; /fixmbr or /fixboot are not going to reverse that issue. EasyBCD does not even come into play here and
 is irrelevant. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp; short I want to be able to get rid of efisector and add it and the unalowcated spaces
<strong>BACK</strong> into my Windows partition so that any data that is still there and untouched may be able to be recovered and not rewritten.</p>
<p>Does any of this make sense? If not please ask for clarification.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hello Richman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry for late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that your computer is not booting. We need to bring it to working condition so that we can troubleshoot the issue further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Start the computer by using Windows 7 media. <br />
</p>
<p>b. Select "Repair your computer". <br />
</p>
<p>c. Select "Command Prompt".<br />
</p>
<p>d. In the command prompt window, run the bcdedit command. Lists of items appear under "Windows Boot Manager" and under "Windows Boot Loader".<br />
</p>
<p>e. Look for the values for the following items : </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Under "Windows Boot Manager", the device item should be set to unknown.<br />
2. Under "Windows Boot Loader", the device and "osdevice" items should be set to unknown.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>f. Run the following three commands to correct the settings, and then restart the computer:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdedit /set {default} device partition=c: <br />
bcdedit /set {default} osdevice partition=c: <br />
bcdedit /set {bootmgr} device partition=c:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, you may locate X:\Sources\Recovery, and then run StartRep.exe to start a quick automated startup repair utility that corrects boot environment values.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

<h2>            SMS number on Skype software changed, no one can reply&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am really mad at Skype.&nbsp; Years ago I set up my Skype account.&nbsp; I put my mobile phone number into the system and used skype to send out SMS messages as it was easier to type.&nbsp; People used to get them and reply, now however, I noticed no one replied, and
 finally someone showed me their phone, the number they replied to is not mine! I tested it myself and sure enough it is not my number, and every time it changes!&nbsp; I went to skype settings and found there is no where to add or change this information, so I
 went to my account page here, and there is nothing!!!!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How to fix this?</p>
<p>2. how to contact Skype to get refunds for all the SMS messages I have sent that no one could reply to!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

<p>What you are referring to is Caller ID for calls/SMS (one combined setting). If an SMS was sent and received, it did its job.&nbsp; You can always reach out to Skype Customer Service over&nbsp;<a href="https://support.skype.com/faq/FA10656/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">live
 chat</a>, to see if there is anything they can do for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To attempt to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>Enable Caller ID for your mobile.&nbsp; If it has been disabled then it may display a generic number. There is also no guarantee that the Caller ID that is supplied will be accepted by every mobile provider.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply, however, it seems the information is not totally correct.&nbsp; At least it was not like that before.&nbsp; I programmed Skype to show my number and from my number when sending outgoing SMS messages. And it used to work fine. I tested it
 often and received texts back often.&nbsp; But now, even in the software settings this information cannot even be viewed!&nbsp; And on login, it cannot be found anywhere. I even cannot view what the online system has for my number, it cannot be viewed in the software
 or online profile, so what's going on???</p>

</p><p>Below is exactly what occurs when I check my settings using the link I provided (with numbers changed). This is similar in function to how it has always been. You control these settings from your account. Edit allows you to view/modify the settings for any
 pre-authorized numbers. If something is not working properly you can simply enable/disable Caller ID, toggle between your existing numbers or add a new number.</p>

<br />
<div>You will need to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate for this capability. Only Windows 7 Ultimate includes Multilingual User Interface (Language Pack) support. You can then install the English Language Pack from under Regional and Language settings in Control

<h2>            How do I get rid of this microsoft program that imports photos</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Until I got Windows 10, I plugged my Nikon camera into the USB place and a menu would pop up asking how I would like to import the photos, or they would automaticlly go to a certain page with a date - New Photos. where I could easily find them and look
 at them and move when I was ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, not at my request, they go to a file s33000 or something like that,&nbsp; which I have to find on my computer - on My Conp;uter, and then click on it, and click on the next folfer, and click on the next folde, and lo and behold, I am where the photos are.
 But I never asked for this. I think it is something called One that has done the dirty deed, and there is nothing elxe on One, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>I would like to delete this program, but I am concerned that I will lose all the photos by the same name that are now disctributed throughout my compueter. Yes, I keep pictures of grandpa in the family history pages, and pictures of the car in a filder marked
 car. Try telling that to this program.&nbsp; It want to alter the shape of my picutres to me and present them to me in thie new manner. How can I make it go away, safely.</p>
<p>Secondlty, if I delte all the pictures on the screen will I be deleting the ones elsewhere on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for this program, apparently, is so that the pics can be shown on all my devices. the trouble is, I only have this desk-top computer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the answer to part of this. If I delete a photo in this program - under "One", it deletes it in my own edited pages of photos.&nbsp; That means I cannot simply delete all the photos in the S3000 program. This is a real problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is under One Drive&gt; pictures&gt; screenshots.&nbsp; &nbsp;The photos are in "pictures".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The program that put them there I don't know what it is. I imagine it is Microsoft, or as Microsoft would say, Windows. and as Windows would say, Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see now that when I started up with this new comp[uter and Windows 10, and this One and Edge, etc, that I weas supposed to program everything, including all the things that were done automaticlly, in a good way, for the old-fashioned types of computers.&nbsp;
 I see that I can go in at the beginning, and by clicking on something, have the pics imported directly to my Documents, instead of to the special One program. By copying the files then, from One to my own documents, and sorting and editing in Documents, I
 left the originals, including all the one I would delete, under "One" And Now I cannot delete One.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who invented One. I would like to congratulate the psychopath.</p>

<p>Hello Andre. I have briefly looked at One. And I'm not liking what I read.&nbsp; &nbsp; It's like marriage. Easy to get into, much harder to get out of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know a while back I clicked on "sync" somewhere in settings to try to get the computer to work properly but I didn't know it was One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I am in One. It asks me to sign up but I never did.&nbsp; So apparently it is only these photos that are affected.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have never configured it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very unhappy that Microsoft continually tries to control my computer.&nbsp; I imagine I shall have to move all the pics in that terrible program over to a place in my documents and they to figure out which ones to delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;And then I can hopefully delete the program in which they are being collected and messed with by my computer.&nbsp; When I started, with this new computer, the computer decided where to import the photos. It never gave me an option. But if I go to PC, and then
 click on it somewhere and see where else I can place the photos, I see it can be done. I can change the destination. But whoever invented that had no right to decide for me what my first choice would have been and send them to this One place.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            I suggest you to use the OneDrive app settings to change where your files are saved by default.
<br />
<br />    In the Notifications area at the bottom of your Windows screen, right-click the OneDrive icon and click Settings. You might have to click Show hidden icons to find OneDrive.
<br />
<br />  
<br />
<br />    In the Settings box, on the Auto save tab, under Documents and Pictures, click the list at Documents or Pictures and pick the default save location you want.
<br />
<br />    This PC only - When you create a file, the Documents or Pictures folder under This PC is the first-choice location offered to save it. The file is not saved to OneDrive unless you do so separately, and it is available only on the PC you used to save it.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.
<br />
<br />Please revert back to us if you have further issues with auto saving to OneDrive and I will be happy to assist you.

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>I wrote another reply, before I saw your response, and mentioned that I had seen the solution. I explian it all there, The difference between doing it by using PC instead of One is that it gets me out of the One pprogram which has bsen the source of all
 this trouble,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One assumed that the only option I should get was to put all my photoos into it instead of allowing me to choose. I know I am not the only person to run into this problem. I read other questions where people have lost all their photos. I just want to get
 out of One. And I did say, I only have one computer. I have no other devices I do not need "One".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, You can tell me how to get rid of One, Once and For All. As soon as I get all those photos transferred out of ONE, to my computer-minus-One, then I will be free to delete ONE&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still annoyed that they did this to me, creating more problems, as Microsoft does, over and over.</p>

<p>Is there any way to get rid of this app without losing all the photos, even if they are first moved.</p>
<p>This is why I have read other people's requests for help because they lose their photos when messing around with "One" or this thing that takes their photos from their cameras without their consent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I see just how sneaky Microsoft is now, reverting back to what they would consider "basics" when people start with a new computer, knowing nothing.&nbsp; They make it easier for a person to simply follow through, and download the pics from their camera to "One"
 not realizing they have set in motion a dangerous app that will deleted all the photos that pass through its hallowed halls on their way to a valid photo collection maintained by the user (not by Microsoft and its app ), if they ever attempt to delete the
 app. All photos will be deleted that have the same name, I imagine. I tried it with one photo, deleting it from the 'One", and then going to find it again where I had just seen it in my own documents. It had disappeared!&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know from the experts here whether changing the name of the photo, once it is securely away from that nasty app will enable it to live on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know, then, how to get rid of the app once and for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A lesser problem, not applicable to me for too much longer, I hope, is the fact that when one is looking at these photos on "One" (why does that sound so god-like), there are no titles visible. I had to click on the picture to see the title underneath it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why I have to waste my time dealing with a nasty piece of trickery that Microsoft has installed here is beyond me. Why are these inventors so sadistic?</p>

<p>Hello Wilster,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear for the issue with privacy settings. A quick question, are you not able to play at all? So what is happening is the system is picking up you have a child account, in these situations you need to
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/security/add-family-member-on-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Set up a family</a>. When you add your account to a family with a parent account, the parent can then go in and
<a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/xbox-one-privacy-and-online-safety" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
change settings on the child account</a>. There are bugs as I have an adult account with settings all set right and I still get errors within the game.
<a href="https://forums.forzamotorsport.net/turn10_forum18_Forza-Horizon-4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Forza forums</a> have known issues posted and others with similar issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps,</p>

            I have an Acer Aspire 5612 with an Orbicam.&nbsp; I had problems with the camera not working.&nbsp; By accident I found a solution; by emptying the Pictures folder (transferring all pictures into a new folder say Picture Backup in the main Documents folder) the
 Orbicam started to work again.&nbsp; I sometimes forget and save pictures to the original Pictures folder, the camera stops again until I empty the folder.&nbsp; Don't know why it works but hope it does for you

<h2>            Win 10 login locked me out -now demands password</h2>
                    <p>My network adapter settings changed as I was having issues with my modem. I shut my computer down to restart it. Usually I use a PIN number through Microsoft to login with my picture but it wiped out the pin and now demands a password that I cannot remember
 as I haven’t used it in ages. What do I do now? I’m locked out of Windows 10; it’s an HP desktop computer. I have no rescue disk or USB for it. Ugh.</p>
