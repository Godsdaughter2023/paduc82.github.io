<h2>            Cloning a hard drive from one laptop  to a new laptop</h2>
                    <p>I have read a lot about cloning from one hard drive to another one, but if anyone has any suggestions, that would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY MAIN question, is how to connect the two computers.&nbsp; &nbsp;Is it as easy as a cable with USB's on either end (I have read this may not work), or do I need a USB transfer cable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a docking station for cloning, but I would rather not take out a hardrive from a brand new laptop if there are other possiblities.</p>

<p>Are you referring to a system drive, as in cloning a system drive from your previous laptop to your new laptop so that your new laptop will have the same OS and installed programs?&nbsp; If this is the case, you're going to run into major problems, as in it probably
 won't work, not only because of the Windows license, but also because the old drive is set up to run on your old laptop, not the new one.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cloning a system drive normally refers to either cloning for a backup, or cloning a system drive to a new drive that is going to go into the same laptop, like if you are upgrading to an SSD or upgrading to a larger size drive.</p>

<p>No cables are used. Instead, you copy the hard drive from the old computer and restore it to the new computer. It's that simple, except that there is one very important 'gotcha' to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, some terminology. There are two ways to make an identical copy of a hard drive: an image and a clone. An image excludes the empty sectors of a drive, while a clone includes everything. A clone is used by law enforcement to study the contents of the
 drive. You only need an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create an image, and to restore it later, you need disk image software. Of course, you'll have to spend some time learning how to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the big gotcha:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your existing Windows installation includes drivers for your existing hardware. But you're going to be restoring your image to a computer with different hardware, and that can result in big problems that are impossible to predict in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To deal with this, your imaging application needs to be able to do a hardware-independent restore. That's where the image is restored with generic drivers that will suffice to get the computer going. Then you'll have to remove the incorrect drivers and replace
 them with proper drivers.</p>

</p><p>This is the part that completely confuses me.&nbsp; HOW do I get the information from one computer to the other without a cable....&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do believe you are right about image, vs clone..&nbsp; When our computer guy at work did this, he did say image.&nbsp; Also he removed the hard drive and moved all the information to a new one, then installed the computer.&nbsp; So it did not go from one computer to
 another.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>AHHHH.&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I see what you're saying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I see people thinking that they can clone the entire drive.&nbsp; Like if someone were to build a new desktop, then want to clone the system drive from the old desktop to the new one so they don't have to buy an OS for the new desktop.&nbsp; Almost like
 taking the system drive out of the old and putting in the new and expecting it to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I know most laptops come with a preinstalled OS, but sometimes people buy them without such and install their own, which is what I was thinking might be the case here.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at all familiar with the procedure to do what you are talking about, but I believe that you can.&nbsp; I have so little on my desktop that when I build a new one or buy a new laptop to replace my old one I just transfer my programs and files from the
 old to the new using a flash drive, or if I can't, I just reinstall what I need, though I still have to buy an OS (for the desktop), or at least the license/product key for one and install from a disk I already have.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you have luck in being able to do what you want to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Multiple Microsoft services not working &#40;Skype, Windows Update, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple Microsoft services not working &#40;Skype, Windows Update, Store, Microsoft Account Sign In, ...&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had quite a few problems with my Windows installation in the last 7 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say in the beginning, the problems I will describe started out almost exactly 7-8 days ago when my ISP (called Amis, from Croatia) updated my router firmware. The update wasn't just for me, it was global so everyone received it. The router is&nbsp;Eltek
 R3621-W2 (firmware version R3621-W2_AM_v1.1.92).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm writing here is because:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I already tried solving this with my ISP, I called them three or four times and they haven't even touched the problem for the whole week.</p>
<p>2. I tried talking to two Microsoft technicians from Help Desk who even did remote sessions on my computer and they couldn't fix it.</p>
<p>3. The problem seems to be targeting exclusively Microsoft services... So it's Skype, Windows Update, Microsoft Account Sign In, Windows Store and Windows SmartScreen that don't work.</p>
<p>4. I'm clueless about what to do, because I tried everything similar posted on the net and it didn't work, reinstalled Windows 10 twice!! And still the same problems remained. So I need help from you guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright, so basically the first day it started happening I was on Skype with my friend and we were in a call when I realized that Skype refuses to update my status to "Online". It just showed that refreshing status gif, but the call still worked. And I could
 browse the net. So I tried canceling the call and restarting Skype, but since then I could not even sign in. This is the error message I've been getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe61a5c4-82ff-4f3c-a7cd-cf7d222c1f33" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe61a5c4-82ff-4f3c-a7cd-cf7d222c1f33" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing was that my internet (cable connected by the way, fiber optics 100/100 Mbit/s speed) was perfectly connected and I could browse the web normally. So I figured there must be something wrong with Skype and me and my friend turned to TeamSpeak
 instead which worked.</p>
<p>Yet, the next day I realize it's not only Skype, but also Windows Update that doesn't work. It searches for updates quite long and then error 0x800704cf pops up, just like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c06b641-d94d-43b1-a198-d1300fc18f06" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6c06b641-d94d-43b1-a198-d1300fc18f06" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I check my internet connection, it works great. Speedtest gives 100/100 Mbit/s no problem... Well alright...</p>
<p>Next, I ran Windows Store because I wanted to check out some apps, but it seemed to load infinitely and wouldn't go in. When it finally did I couldn't even scroll and it kind off glitched out and also returned an error about being unable to sign in.</p>
<p>That was enough for me to decide I don't want to wait anymore (because I already talked to my ISP and they didn't know what to do) so I reinstalled Windows 10 and same problems awaited, but I also found that I cannot sign in to my Microsoft account in Start
 --&gt; Settings --&gt; Accounts --&gt; Sign In with a Microsoft account instead. This is the error message I keep getting:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dad4172d-877e-4a34-9201-fdb514350e92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dad4172d-877e-4a34-9201-fdb514350e92" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To shorten the story now, later I also saw that SmartScreen doesn't work either because some setups take ages to run because SmartScreen is trying to check for safety, but then it returns an error where it says it was unable to check...</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I already tried (so don't make me do it again):</p>
<p>1. Call my ISP (3X-4X)</p>
<p>2. Call Microsoft Tech Support (2X)</p>
<p>3. In CMD (as Administrator) tried running:</p>
<p>-&nbsp;<span>sfc /scannow</span></p>
<p><span>-&nbsp;</span><span>DISM&nbsp;</span><span>/</span><span>Online</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>/</span><span>Cleanup</span><span>-</span><span>Image</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>/</span><span>RestoreHealth</span></p>
<p><span>- a Microsoft technician tried reseting IPv4 settings by writing two different batch files and restarting my computer, didn't work (commands included flushing DNS)</span></p>
<p><span>4. Reset my router (factory settings, tried enabling DMZ, no firewall) (10X)</span></p>
<p><span>5. Reset my PC countless times, obviously</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>6. Reinstalling my network adapter and it's coresponding drivers (</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Realtek® 8111F</span><span>)</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>7. Deleting all network adapters in Device Manager and restarting, scanning for hardware changes... Everything similar to that.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>8. The problems existed with a bare installation of Win 10, so a third party app can't possibly be causing this.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>9. Tried connecting to the same network with a wifi adapter instead to check if it's Ethernet problem, but it didn't work.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>10. Changed DNS servers to Google's and back to my ISP's (both in my router and on my PC), didn't work.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>11. Proxy settings are correct (I don't use a proxy) and Internet Explorer settings are correct (Googled for TLS and SSL stuff, tried all combinations, doesn't work).</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">12. ...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">There is probably more stuff, but the main point is that when I tried to open a hotspot on my Samsung Galaxy S7 (on whom Skype works perfectly when connected to the same network...) it worked perfectly! So, everything works when
 I changed the network. When I connected back to my home one, it stopped working again. I'm just wondering why is it that nothing works on this PC (also, laptop with Windows 10 has the same problems) and devices that don't have Windows 10 installed don't experience
 any isssues?</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I really want my Skype and Windows Update and stuff back...</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As you've mentioned, you were able to contact your <strong>ISP</strong> provider already for a couple of times and performed troubleshooting steps to isolate the issue and yet the issue with your computer connecting to your network still persists. One possible
 reason on this issue is the compatibility of the newest version of the firmware of your router to
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. We suggest that you try to connect the affected computer to a different network and see if the issue persists. If it does, we recommend that you contact the router's manufacturer for further assistance. They may help you out to
 check if the newest update of the router is compatible with Windows 10. <br />
<br />
We'll keep an eye out for your response.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you very much for your response, I must say I haven't thought of contacting the router manufacturer yet. I have, however, thought of connecting the PC to another network which made the issue go away. Obviously the conclusion here is that my network
 is somehow causing the problems described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the router's manufacturer website earlier today (Eltek, http://www.eltek.com/) and found no signs of any routers whatsoever (I figured maybe I can find some info on firmware versions or something)... I have sent them an e-mail instead asking for
 assistance. I hope they will reply soon and maybe be able to help so I can come back here with some more feedback. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you so much again for keeping an eye out on this question!</p>

<p>Alright,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some new information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have sent e-mails to two different companies, Eltek and Ping Communications, and it turned out it's Ping Communications who's my router manufacturer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically they have said that they cannot share firmware files with me because they only provide them to ISPs and said that I should talk to my ISP instead (which I did many many times now). Also, it turned out that the ISP is the one making changes to the
 firmware (based on their need), so I don't see how PingCom could help out here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than that, today a technician from my ISP came to my place to pick up a router my grandfather had from them (the same model I have now, just a different unit). I used some of his time to ask about the issue, and he just advised changing DNS server
 settings (which I already did) and putting another router into bridge mode with the one I already have... (which I'm unable to do because I just don't have another router and no one really has a spare one at home).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that's that, other than that I have managed to recreate the SmartScreen error so I will post it here now:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28944b9f-dba5-4a44-b988-8b3bc487848c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/28944b9f-dba5-4a44-b988-8b3bc487848c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now the only thing that's happening is that my ISP sent a ticket to Microsoft to check for errors in Windows 10 regarding the router firmware... But no one gave me any feedback on that in almost two weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this is my only way of getting it fixed really, I guess I'm not left with anything else other than waiting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you guys have some other ideas I haven't tried?</p>

            As you've mentioned, your ISP already sent a ticket to Microsoft to check if there are specific errors in Windows 10 with their latest router firmware. In the meantime, we suggest that you wait for their response to see if there are other ways aside from
 creating a bridge mode to resolve the issue. <br />

<p>Yes they did, but yesterday I called them again, and a guy on the phone told me that a technician finally made a comment on my issue in their system saying "The problem is not caused by us.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also asked if there is a possibility that they might be blocking something with some kind of firewall and stuff... He said that couldn't be as they allow all traffic through, no firewall whatsoever from their side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm getting pretty tired of this problem. No one seems to know what is going on, not my ISP, router manufacturer or Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thinking of switching to another ISP but as I don't know if that is the source of the problem I'm very afraid to do that as the problems might still continue. And also, I love this ISP for fiber optics and stuff until this happened.</p>

            We appreciate the update you've provided. As you've mentioned in your previous post, your computer was able to connect properly using another network. This means that your Windows 10 computer doesn't have any issues when it comes to connecting to a network.
 Changing or switching to another ISP can be an option too, but the assurance of this issue to be resolved still depends on the compatibility of your network to your computer.
<br />
<br />
Should you have any further concerns, don't hesitate to let us know.

<p>I think I didn't mention this, but the guys from PingCom (my router manufacturer) double-checked the firmware for my issue (I sent another mail after their first response) and responded that this firmware is in fact compatible with all Windows versions back
 to XP and including Windows 10 (not even counting Linux, Mac OS X etc...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't really understand how compatibility is an issue here? Because the firmware is compatible, we are certain about that now. PC doesn't have connectivity issues itself, it connects to networks normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And since the issue exists on my laptop with Windows 10 too, the Ethernet cable cannot be the problem either, because laptop is connecting using Wi-Fi...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now we have all three main components of the network out of the game, PC, cable and router all have compatible softwares...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look, I don't know anymore, I'm tired of this, everything just used to work, and then suddenly it all went bonkers. I've certainly done my part. It's so obvious that it is either ISP's fault because they seem to have changed some network properties or Microsoft's
 fault because all other devices work okay except on Windows 10 so maybe it's a bug in WIndows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what's the truth is that both of them, ISP or Microsoft actually have no idea what's happening here so I'm left with myself. I've done more work to fix this issue than Microsoft, router manufacturer and ISP together. (Not trying to say anything to you,
 Eileen, you really try to help, I'm just really annoyed because this went so complicated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Win 8.1 freezing after short period of inactivity - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasmullan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 8.1 freezing after short period of inactivity</h2>
                    <p>Since installing the win8.1 Pro&nbsp;update my Welcome screen on signing in displays my "Welcome Thomas Mullan" &nbsp;twice, before going to start screen.. Everything runs fine until I leave the screen inactive for a short period, 5-10 minutes and on returning to
 screen I find it has frozen. The cursor works but nothing responds.</p>
<p>The only exception is a Malware program "SPYHUNTER"&nbsp;which will continue to work regardless of all else frozen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The only way I can leave the program is to shut down and that can only be done by cutting off the power. Then restarting, everything starts up as before. No error messages displayed..</p>
<p>I run a Gigabyte MB/, Intel i5 CPU, /12 GB DDR3 ram/, AMD 5700 GPU,/ Win 8.1 Pro 64bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Until I installed the update 8.1 the OS was working great.</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can uninstall win 8.1 and return to Win 8.0 Pro?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I know that I can reformat the disc and reinstall win 8.0Pro 64 but that means losing everything on my PC</p>

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer might freeze when there is a program or application running at the background. There are other reasons as well such as pending updates offered from Windows Update, conflict from the third party security software or antivirus program and issues related
 to Windows maintenance. </p>
<p>Sometimes, outdated drivers might also cause Windows to freeze.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the Make and Model of the computer/ model of the Gigabyte motherboard?</li><li>Have you installed Spyhunter (third party anti-malware program) on the compute?</li></ol>
<p>First of all, I would suggest you to check for the application or program that is running at the background using Task Manager. Follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the computer freezes up, press <strong>Ctrl+Shift+Esc</strong> keys to open
<strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Find out the process or program that is taking high CPU usage. </li></ul>
<p>To troubleshoot the issue further, follow the methods suggested below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s boot the computer in safe mode and check if issue still persist. Follow the steps below accordingly:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>Refer to the link to boot the computer in safe mode:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>If the issue doesn’t occur, proceed to the next step. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s place the computer in a clean boot state and find out the application that is causing the issue.
</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”</p>
<p>You can refer to the section “How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Note: Please refer to the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the steps don’t resolve the issue, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If you have a third party security software (such as <strong>Spyhunter</strong>) installed, I would suggest you to temporarily disable it and check if it helps.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Important Note:</strong> Security software can help protect your computer against virus and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you
 should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled.</p>
<p>If the issue is still there, move to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Microsoft Safety scanner and check if there are infected files on the computer. Refer to the link to download and run the scanner:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss. This Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions,
 download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</p>

            <p>Hi Pinaki</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Having &nbsp;suspected that SpyHunter was the reason, I went straight to Method 2...</p>
<p>Prior to this&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp; couldn't leave the PC for more than 10 minutes or less before it froze as per my initial report.</p>
<p>.No response even when trying to&nbsp; Task mngr, restart or shutdown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;However, after disabling the SpyHunter system guard I have left the PC on for4hours plus and the o/s
</p>
<p>has not frozen since. </p>
<p>All programs respond. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Incidently my PC is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabyte P55A_UD6(C) Motherboard.</p>
<p>CPU Intel i5-750@ 2.67 Gh</p>
<p>Memory= 12 GB</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for an update on this issue.</p>
<p>

<p>If your Windows 7 product is an Upgrade, did you install it on a computer with a previous version of Windows? The Upgrade software doesn't allow an upgrade version of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive to be activated.<br />
<br />
Are you sure you're typing all the letters correctly? Look closely at B and 8, G and 6, etc.&nbsp; Product keys do not contain 1, I, O, or 0.
<br />
<br />
Are you using the correct Windows 7 key? A key for XP or Vista will not work with Windows 7. A Home Premium key will not work with Ultimate, etc.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Call Microsoft Using Manual Phone Activation<br />
<br />
If you have trouble activating Windows 7 you can call Microsoft to activate by doing the following:
<br />
1. With Windows running click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4 <br />
2. Press Enter on your Keyboard <br />
3. Select your Country. <br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, then call the number given and hold for a real person.
<br />

http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/18715-activate-windows-7-phone.html</a> <br />
<br />
Note: if you are still installing Windows and at the Enter Your Product Key page, do not enter your key and uncheck "Automatically Activate When Online" then click OK/Next to finish the installation.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: Make sure you are not installing windows on more computers then allowed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can't Activate Office With Windows Key:<br />
Are you using the Windows 7 key that's on your computer/DVD case? That will not work to activate Office - only an Office key will activate Office. Many new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced functionality mode
 unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license. Or if you're trying to activate a trial version of Office you'll need the correct trial key. If you need to buy a key for Office:<br />

                    Ok, I recently upgrade to windows 7 premium (from Windows Vista ultimate) using a iso that a co-worker gave me, Yes it's a vaild copy and not a burn, clone or bootleg copy. I installed it and it work great. About a couple of days ago I started up my laptop
 and right before it got to the part where the Windows 7 logo is forming I get a black screen with a dash on the top left corner. My laptop also start to beep over and over again until I press any key to shut it up. it goes into the logo part then the screen
 goes black again. I can hear the windows login theme like I am ready to login but the screen is still black, so I can't. The only thing to do is a hard reset and hit f8 to get to the part where it gives you options to "repair computer". which I tried. It goes
 thru the process, resets it''s self and SOMETIMES gets me back up and running. As well I have a couple of programs like Microsoft office that when now i start it up it works fine but as soon as I click anywhere on the page it open the open file window, and
 no matter how many time I click cancel it keeps opening the window.&nbsp; I have to resort to using task manager to shut it down. I have tried everything from a registry clean to checking my computer with windows defender, spybot, and norton, and nothing has worked.
 So I google and google and can't find a solution. I think my only other option is to do a Factory reset of my computer. So here is the kick. I have done factory resets on this laptop before when I had windows vista ultimate running it and it was very simple.
 Windows 7 is giving me some trouble as it does not have a factory system reset way of doing things. It has a system restore point, which in my case I didn't make one Ever. Here are the two options it give me when I go to system recovery "1.Use a system image
 you created earlier to recover your computer" (which again I never created one. ) and "2.Reinstall windows (requires windows installation disc)", Which I do not have the iso anymore as I deleted it thinking the system restore is just like vista. If anyone
 can help I would much appreciated. I am willing goes as far as even downgrading back to windows vista if it means getting my computer back up and running.
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

    <title>Stop windows synchronization with folder no longer available - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nothingsknower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop windows synchronization with folder no longer available</h2>
                    How can I stop windows synchronization from trying to sync with a folder that doesn't exist any more? I work on a windows XP machine that had a shared network folder on our old domain controller. It was set up to "work offline". This old domain controller
 has since died, but the XP machine is still trying to sync with it every time it logs off or logs on.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried deleting all of the temporary/offline files, I've tried going to windows&nbsp;explorer&nbsp;and going to Tools&gt;Synchronize, and then unchecking the folder that doesn't exist. I've tried going to the synchronization setup and unchecking the folder to sync
 when connected to the LAN. Nothing seems to stop it from trying to sync. There are also other folders that still exist that I DO want to keep syncing with, so I don't want to completely disable the synchronization. Does anyone know how to get it to stop syncing
 with just this one folder?</div>

<p>No Im not talking about ambassador. I read somewhere that the moderators on xbox live are volunteers that help keep boosters and cheaters off the games. I just want to moderate to keep them off of live instead of filing a complaint.</p>

<p>Hey there HUMANOID21. &nbsp;If you are wanting to become a moderator on the forums it is best to start being active and posting good post on the forums and over time, you might get it some day. &nbsp;If you are wanting to become a moderator for Xbox LIVE (aka XBLPET)
 you will need to go to the Microsoft careers page (<a href="http://careers.microsoft.com/gclp.aspx?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">careers.microsoft.com/gclp.aspx</a>) and check it out there. &nbsp;Thanks! :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Crashing while trying to update.</h2>
                    Alright. I'm extremely frustrated. I bought my computer from a company called CyberPowerPC. The computer came with Windows 7 pre-installed. Since then I have upgraded the computer to the point that it isn't even the same machine anymore except for hard
 drive. It was working beautifully. I wasn't having any problems. I upgraded to Windows 8 and then to 10. Two weeks ago my brothers were playing some games from Steam on it. I was told that it black screened and would not turn on. When I checked on it, it was
 turning on and it would show the msi splash screen (I believe that is what it is called) where it says to press f11 for something and del for BIOS. After that it shows the Windows logo and then restarts and keeps repeating that over and over without me touching
 it. I called many times and was told that I needed to take it to a technician. Technician said that it was a Windows corruption and to call Microsoft. Called, told me that I needed to get a new copy of Windows because they can'

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand how you feel about the situation with multiple issues on your computer. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I suggest you to follow these methods &nbsp;below to fix your issue:</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try to refer to the section “Restore from a system restore point” in the article mentioned below, to perform system restore and check, if it works.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Recovery options in Windows 10:</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persists, follow the method 2.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let us try to run Startup Repair and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</div>
<div><br />
I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform Startup Repair.</div>
<div>
<p>Refer to the following link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>(Refer to the section "Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool " in the above article for creating the tool).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1. Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order
 in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to start the Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
2. In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.<br />
3. Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Startup Repair'.</div>
<div>
<p>4. After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>There will be no data loss by performing Startup repair. It will format c: driver and reinstall Windows 10. It will remove all the installed apps and updates.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>

            Hi Serb, 
<br />
<br />I’ve seen this before where certain ISP’s kick off wrong locations, but it’s curious that happens only via wired network and not wifi. 
<br />
<br />Can we try to set it manually? 
<br />
<br />Settings - Privacy - Location - Set your default location in there, reboot, and see if we have any better luck.

<h3> bugg116  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10, stuck at safemode login, Password not correct</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to uninstall avast the other day, when I noticed that not all of avast's components were completely gone. I downloaded and attempted to begin to use the avastclear utility to uninstall it. Upon starting the application, I was told it needed
 to go to safemode. It went into safemode and I am stuck at the login in screen and it keeps saying my password (not using my pin) is incorrect. I went on my phone to Microsoft to reset my password, I did that and it still comes up as incorrect password. I
 also, noticed that I am unable to connect to my network from my Ethernet cable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched google like crazy for a way out of this but nothing upon nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Gone to troubleshooting, start up settings, f5 for network connection; No go. Still not able to access network.</p>
<p>-Have attempted to run through every other option such as restore point, recovery, and anything else that comes up on the blue page only to be told I need to enter my password, which always comes up incorrect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Attempted to use Offline NT Password &amp; Registry, loaded it on to my flash drive but when I enter BIOS it doesn't show my usb drive</p>
<p>-Attempted to use Windows Password Recovery from PassFab, when I entered BIOS that did show up but since it was only a "free trial" it required me to pay to reset my password, which I did not do as I don't want to drop $40 without knowing if it will work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run through every possible password I could think of, however, I have always used the same password for everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this problem? I would really like back into my computer. I don't care if avast gets uninstalled at this point just want my computer back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, wanted to note that when I boot up it brings up the blue screen saying "Choose a default operating system". It shows Windows 10 as current default but also gives the option of "Avast Ativirus Clear uninstall" as another operating system. I get stuck
 on the safemode login in screen no matter which I pick.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It seems that some of the system core files are either broken or damaged due to which you are facing this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On the password prompt screen, you can use the on-screen keyboard to see if you are able to get to the desktop screen.
</span></p>
<p><span>To open the OSK from the sign-in screen, select the ‘Ease of Access’ button in the lower-right corner of the sign-in screen, and then select ‘On-Screen
 Keyboard’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, then proceed further.
</span></p>
<p><span>To repair those system files, you can try to perform a startup repair or an automatic repair of Windows to check if that makes any difference. You need
 to use a different PC to download the Windows 10 ISO file.</span></p>
<p><span>You can download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool. Once you have the installation media ready, you can perform the ‘Startup Repair’.</span></p>
<p><span>Kindly refer to this link:
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have the installation media, follow these steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so.
 If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot sequence order in your computer so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to start the Windows Recovery Environment.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the ‘Windows Recovery Environment’, on the ‘Choose an option’ screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click, ‘Advanced Options’ and then click on 'Startup Repair'.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Once the repair is done, restart the computer to check if you are able to get to the desktop screen.</span></p>

            Dagesh Pro has an "autonikud" feature which apparently does the task what you are asking for.

<p>Hi Betty,<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you referring to the <strong>Mail app</strong> on Windows 10, or the <strong>
Outlook app</strong> for an iOS or an Android device?<br />
<br />
If you're referring to the Mail app, you may uninstall the <strong>Mail and Calendar
</strong>app by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>I</strong> keys from the keyboard to launch
<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>System</strong>, then <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Mail and Calendar</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select the <strong>Uninstall</strong> button.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you're referring to a different "Outlook.com" app, can you provide us a screenshot of the app icon you wish to uninstall?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>
        </p>
