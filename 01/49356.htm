<h2>            Epic bug&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing one night and I lost connection from Xbox Live when that happened i got frustrated and turned the Xbox off. The next morning when i logged on I saw that my rank was 1... I thought it was some sort of bug or glitch that would go away as i play
 but I started getting a little concerned when i hit rank 10. MY rank was 99 2 bars from 100. When i was reset I lost all my ribbons, medals, everything that you unlock over time, i even lost my beta status (the gold skin for retro, cole train) When i logged
 on and saw that my rank was 1 i looked at my stats and i still had my gnasher master medal equipped but &nbsp;the medal on the list of medals is reset. I even have the onyx skin on my gnasher along with the gold skin on my retro, but when i go to the skins, it
 says i haven't unlocked it. right now my rank is 17 and i have made very little to no progress with my old stats. I looked at my achievements and i still have the achievement to get to rank 50! How can i have that achievement if I was lying. I just want my
 old stats back because i don't want to start over, I have been playing since it came out and now to start over is frustrating. Please help Epic...</p>

            <p>You will need to post in the EPIC games forums to try an get an answer or info from them. From what I have heard, this is a known issue and it is unlikely that you will be able to get your rank back. I would post on there though to try and get info. </p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 102, 0, 1)">Online game stats are saved on the Game Developers servers. What happens is when you Dashboard or in your case lose connection for any number of reasons it doesn't give the server enough time to save your most recent stats. And
 somehow in the process your last known stats are not saved anymore either. I have heard of it happening in Black Ops a few times. Unfortunately there is nothing you can do about it here. You would need to contact the Game Developer as mentioned above for any
 further assistance on this matter. So head on over to their website and contact them either via their forums or their contact us link.

<p>I believe you might be hit with a 'rank reset'.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The information below will provide some pointers on how to prevent it from occurring in the future.</p>
<p>Source: http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/839288-**Important**-What-to-do-if-your-rank-is-reset-amp-how-it-can-happen.-Pls-read!!!?highlight=reset</p>
<p>[quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">If you haven’t already heard, there is a glitch occurring where people are having their rank reset to level 1 and all of their ribbons and medal progress wiped. While this has not personally happened to me, I can imagine how devastating
 it would be to lose medals and rank that you worked hard for. I have read nearly every post on this subject in the last couple of days, so I have compiled all the information that I have about this issue in this post. So apologies in advance, but this is going
 to be a LONG post (China will want their wall back). I don't work for Epic, so this isn't offical in any way. It's just my personal research on the subject.<br />
<br />
This post contains information about:<br />
What to do if you are reset and how to fix it<br />
How and when you can get reset<br />
How to avoid this happening<br />
<br />
I have posted this thread in both the main Gears 3 forum and the multiplayer forum as I want the largest amount of people to see and read this as possible. I am not trying to spam the forums, just help people to prevent this problem. Please help me keep this
 thread bumped so we can help people avoid this problem.<br />
<br />
**MOST IMPORTANTLY IF THIS DOES HAPPEN, DO NOT PLAY ONLINE AT ALL AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN RESET!!!!!**<br />
<br />
Many people are starting up a versus match, or horde/beast just to check if the problem will fix itself. However, this then OVERWRITES your old data and you can’t get it back. The most important thing to do if you have been reset is DO NOT PLAY ANYTHING that
 would give you xp or cause you to rank up. There is a way to get your levels back as long as you have not started ranking up after getting reset to level 1.<br />
<br />
To get your rank back you must DELETE YOUR GAMERTAG from your hard drive/memory stick and then recover it. This will read your data from the Microsoft servers instead of the glitched player data file on your hard drive and restore your rank. If you start playing
 ANY games it will overwrite your old player data file which will then be backed up on the Microsoft servers and all your old data will be gone.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, SpiderGear was reset offline and only cleared his cache and re-downloaded the Title Update and his rank was restored. You may want to try this first, or even as well as. Perhaps deleting your cache AND recovering your tag will cover all of your
 bases.<br />
<br />
If you try one of these methods and they work for you, please reply to the thread and let others know. Remember, you can’t have ranked up AT ALL.<br />
<br />
If you even THINK that there MIGHT be a chance you have been reset while playing, then BACK OUT immediately to the main menu and check. I will explain the ways you can be reset below so you know what they are. Don’t finish a campaign chapter, or horde match
 that you are playing because you will rank up at the end.<br />
<br />
<br />
**HOW/WHEN THIS HAPPENS AND HOW TO AVOID IT**<br />
<br />
There are a couple of different situations where people are running into this glitch, so I will list them all below.<br />
<br />
SIGNING A SPLIT-SCREEN PLAYER IN/OUT AT THE PARTY LOBBY SCREEN.<br />
This seems to be the biggest culprit. When you do this, it kicks you back to the main menu and asks you to press start. When you do, one or both players will have been reset to level 1. This can happen both if you sign someone in, or sign them out. I recommend
 if you are going to play split screen ONLY SIGN SOMEONE IN/OUT AT THE DASHBOARD. Don’t try to save time by doing it while you are playing.<br />
<br />
MOVING YOUR GAMERTAG BUT NOT YOUR PLAYER DATA TO ANOTHER XBOX<br />
People who are playing split-screen should pay particular attention to this. If you are going to play on another console that is not your main one, you should also transfer your PLAYER DATA FILE (it’s inside your Gears 3 save in system memory) to the usb/memory
 card as well. It contains your rank, unlocks, medals etc. And keeping them together should prevent any kind of data loss. I think players are having trouble when they sign in at the menu’s with a gamertag on a memory device and the game does not have a player
 that Xbox. Then this problem should not occur.<br />
<br />
TURNING YOUR XBOX OFF INBETWEEN VERSUS MATCHES, OR DURING HORDE, BEAST, OR CAMPAIGN.<br />
A lot of people seems to be having this problem when they turn their Xbox off without backing out of whatever they are playing. In particular, people are turning their Xbox off or dashboarding in-between quick matches. NEVER turn your Xbox off straight after
 a versus match, as this is when it is saving your stats, and can mess up your player data. This also seems to be happening to people who are playing horde/beast/campaign and just turn their Xbox off without backing out of the match. I would strongly recommend
 you ALWAYS BACK OUT TO THE MAIN MENU BEFORE SWITCHING YOUR XBOX OFF OR DASHBOARDING. There are a few people who say they waited for the next map to load in a quick match, then backed out before turning their Xbox off and they were still reset.<br />
<br />
FREEZING OR LOST CONNECTION DURING LOADING SCREENS.<br />
This is similar to the situation above, but much more difficult to avoid. During loading screens the game is reading or updating your player profile data, and any interruption to your internet during this stage seems to cause the glitch.<br />
<br />
PLAYING WHILE OFFLINE.<br />
Many people are having their profiles reset while trying to play while offline. From what I have read, the glitch seems to occur when you are playing offline AND THEN SIGN BACK INTO XBOX LIVE. For example, your internet or Xbox live is down so you play some
 offline campaign, or horde. Your internet/Xbox comes back online so you sign back in, THEN you are reset. I’m not exactly sure what the best way to avoid this is, but I definitely recommend NOT SIGNING BACK IN WHILE PLAYING SOMETHING. For example, don’t be
 IN a horde match, or be doing campaign then sign in. I would probably say going back to the dashboard would be safest. Or maybe even turn your Xbox all the way off and then back on. Unfortunately I’m not really sure, but signing in while playing is definitely
 a bad idea. <br />
<br />
CONNECTION DROPS OUT DURING VERSUS/HORDE/BEAST/CAMPAIGN<br />
This is actually the same as the above. The glitch occurs when you have been booted offline and then sign back in to Xbox live after you have just been offline. Some people are also reporting that they didn’t even sign back in, just turned their Xbox off and
 when they turned it on the next day they had been reset.<br />
<br />
SIGNING INTO XBOX LIVE ANYWHERE BUT THE DASHBOARD<br />
Similar to the above. Some people have said that they signed in for the first time at the main menu or party screen because their Xbox doesn’t automatically sign them in. They were then reset once they did this. This happens most frequently if you do it during
 a loading screen for obvious reasons.<br />
<br />
SELECTING THE WRONG STORAGE DEVICE<br />
If you select the wrong storage device your profile will have no rank, unlocks etc because your player data is not on that storage device. HOWEVER, a few people have been reporting that once they have selected the wrong storage device even when they went back
 and selected the right one they were still reset.<br />
<br />
**WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?**<br />
I am certainly no expert (at all), but it seems like the game in certain situations seems to fail to recognise the “player data” file that is stored in your memory, which contains all of your rank/ribbons/medals information. When this happens it seems to start
 a brand new one that is blank, i.e level 1. This new file then starts to overwrite the old file when you gain xp. You might be thinking “but all your rank information is meant to be stored on the Microsoft servers”, and it IS. However, it is only BACKED UP
 to the Microsoft servers. The actual information is contained in your player data file. This means, if the player data file on your hard drive is glitched and resets to rank 1 AND THEN YOU RANK UP it overwrites your old file AND sends this new information
 to be stored on the severs AND WIPES OVER THE OLD INFORMATION THERE AS WELL. However, if you recover your gamertag straight away it reads the information directly from the servers and recreates the player data file for you on your drive containing all of your
 actual rank/unlocks.<br />

<p>Yes you can connect to xbox live with a virgin mobile Overdrive pro hotspot you need to go to store you bought it from and ask to see the coverage zone see if your device has a good enough signal then open the devices settings by entering 192.168.0.1 and
 go into the advanced settings find router settings then enable the uPnP -(universal pack n play) some games want you to enable port forwarding like cod black ops 2. so go to a best buy or sprint store and ask to see the coverage map then follow tthese very
 simple instructions then you will have xbox live access I would get the the overdrivepro 3g/4g network 5gb 55$ no contract &nbsp;or if you are lucky to be in a major city good signal area you can get 4g speeds ulimited for 35$ a month no contract to, I hope this
 info can help its all true. oh and I play halo 4 with no &nbsp;lag when im on the go on the overdrive pro but im a verizzon fios lover at heart.</p>

<p>Some MiFi devices don't have UPnP.... including the MiFi 2200 according to &nbsp;<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/networking-hardware/03-hotspots/virgin_mobile/f/3326/t/411275.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../411275.aspx</a>
 - so I'd call Virgin Mobile support to ask them which of their hotspots have UPnP and Port Forwarding as those are often required for a decent connection.

            That is very dependent on the laptop you have. Look at your power supply brick. There should be a wattage rating on it which would be the maximum your laptop will use if you are still using the original brick for your laptop. Also check the bottom of your
 laptop as there should be a rating sticker there as well. Sometimes, at the power jack on your laptop, you will see a voltage and current label there too, multipling the two numbers together will also yield the wattage your laptop will use.

            Hello EMKPROMarketing 
<br />
<br />Here in a general response
<br />Laptop computers consume between 15 and 30 watts of power (some as much as 60 watts). Much less power is required when in standby mode. Most of this rated power is consumed during startup (bootup) and much less is used during usual operating conditions.

<p>There are 3 spiked shields I can think of - Crystal Shield, Spiky Shield and Crystal Ring Shield.</p>
<p>Have a look here, I think you may be referring to the Spiky Shield, which NPC invader Kirk drops (the phantom that invades in the depths) the second time you encounter him.</p>

<p>I killed kirk a couple times.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And I noticed when I went back to the chaos convenant to open the shortcut to lost izalith, and I saw a body up against the wall and it was the spike armor that kirk was wearing.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It's boo boo armor, but it does damage to enemies just by rollinging into them. It does VERY little damage though. It did like 11 damage to the zombies in the firelink shrine. So you already know it aint gonna do jack squat to enemies in anor londo or somewhere.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Completely useless, and AGAIN, another armor set that requires the STUPID twinkling titanite.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>EVERY friggin armor set I've picked up lately, either one, cant be upgraded at all, or two, requires twinkling titanite.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Why does SOOOOOOO many armor sets need twinkling titanite to be upgraded!? I have more armor sets in my bottleless box that needs twinkling titanite than regular titanite.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Seeing how rare that twinkling titanite is, making upgrading any of that stuff little to non-existant. I would like to for ONCE get a nice and cool looking armor set that requires NORMAL titanite to be upgraded. geez.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I wanted to use the use the ninja armor I found in blight town, and I was all excited to have it even thought it was kinda weak, but I was going to upgrade it, thinking it was gonna use regular titanite.......WRONG!!! It need twinkling...............SERIOUSLY!!??</p>

<p>if you dont mind using a slight exploit, snuggly can trade infinate amount of twinkling titanite, drop red moss or whatever, quit reload ect, but before picking up the twinkling titanite, drop another copy of the item, thus allowing you to get 99 twinkling
 titanite. haven't dont it yet but i kind of want to. </p>

            The latest full driver set for the scanner is for Windows XP.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can try installing the drivers in compatibility mode (right-click on the installer file and select
<em>Troubleshoot compatibility</em>) and if that doesn't work, you can get <a href="https://www.hamrick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
VueScan</a>, which isn't free, but it's brought many old scanners back to life.&nbsp; <br />

<p>When I open the CanoScan Toolbox and hit Scan-1 the following opens up and when I click on Scan I get a warning message appear that says, "Specifies the program where the scanned image is transferred" with an "OK" button. When I click OK it takes me to Disk
 C and wants me to select a executable file. I tried one in the CanoScan folder but nothing happened.</p>

<p>If compatibility mode didn't work, you're probably not going to get the scanner to work in Windows 10 without the aforementioned VueScan software.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 - BOOTMGR is missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aricc&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 - BOOTMGR is missing</h2>
                    <p>I have 4 drives (2 SATA 1TB and 2 older IDE 100GB). I disconnected power to the two small IDE because I heard clicking noises from one of them (probably HD failure).&nbsp; The Main Windows 7 Ultimate 1 TB drive never booted up again saying BOOTMGR is missing
 (immediately after Verifying DMI Pool Data .....).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted to an old Vista OS on the secondary 1 TB drive, and saw that it automounted the main Windows 7 drive just fine, and I changed owner and attributes to the user directory so I could copy off all my data to a 3TB USB backup drive just in case.&nbsp; (Done)&nbsp;
 The Windows 7 1 TB Drive was not set as Active so I right clicked to set as Active, powered down, disconnected the second 1 TB (old vista) drive and attempted to bootup.&nbsp; FAIL with the same message "BOOTMGR is missing".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then put the original Windows 7 Ultimate install CD in, booted to it, selected English, selected repair tools, and it offered to attempt to correct the boot problem automatically. I said Yes, it finished, I rebooted and FAIL.&nbsp; Same error.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I went back into the RE dos prompt and tried “bootrec /FixMbr”, reboot, still FAIL.&nbsp; Went back in RE did fixmbr again, this time followed up by “bootrec /fixboot”.&nbsp; Reboot, FAIL again.&nbsp; Went back to RE, backed up the original BCD, removed the -s -h
 -r attributes and ran “bootrec /RebuildBcd”.&nbsp; It successfully found my WINDOWS installation on C: as expected, and I hit Y let it configure for it.&nbsp; Rebooted, FAIL yet again, same error.&nbsp; The harddrive mounts and transfers data between drives as a secondary
 just fine, no speed issues, no errors, no clicking or noise, so I dont think the drive is failing, and the controller seems fine. But nothing I've tried so far has repaired the BOOTMGR, so im still locked out of my Windows 7 computer.&nbsp; It will not boot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I try next?&nbsp; What could this problem be?&nbsp; I'm running out of ideas and hope a professional in the community can shed some light on the real solution.&nbsp; If am really hoping my last idea doesnt have to happen, because there is no guarantee it will
 work, and reinstalling the OS (or reformatting and reinstalling) will lose all my data (requiring a massive data restoration process) lose all installed programs (requiring finding or buying original disks again and the time and effort to reinstall and configure
 everything), and of course the time and effort to reinstall windows is no small issue either.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing indicates a hardware issue with the drive, but i ran the 5 hour process to chkdsk /f/ /r itanyway, just for the rare case, since nothing else has worked.&nbsp; No bad file records, nothing recovered, file system checked and found no problems, and 0 bad
 sectors.&nbsp; Its a good drive!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a way to solve this, to fix windows to boot again.&nbsp; After all, all I did was power down, unplug a couple old drives, and power back up again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas or safe steps I could try next to fix Windows 7 to boot again?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you choosing Microsoft community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will do my best to help you fix this issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most common reason for <strong>BOOTMGR</strong> is missing include the boot files responsible for booting the operating system are either corrupted or missing. Another reason is if the computer is trying to boot from a hard drive or flash drive which
 is not configured properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow the methods provided on the below KB article and see if it fixes the issue.</p>

                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I want to be able to upgrade my&nbsp;
<pre>Acer Aspire 1 NAV50 netbook. <br />It's really hard to find official dependable information on this particular model. <br />Everything I've seen on the net suggests that with the Windows 7 Starter edition (my current configuration) this computer will only support a maximum of 1GB of RAM; <br />however, they say that 2GB is supported with other OS (none are specified). <br />Now your support site has several entries (e.g., <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/windows-7-starter-top-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">windows-7-starter-top-questions</a>) which state that Windows 7 Starter does support 2GB of RAM. <br />I don't know which to believe. <br />I don't want to needlessly purchase RAM I can't use, and I don't want to spend 80 dollars to Upgrade Anytime to another level... <br />especially if it's not necessary, and/or if an upgrade to Home Edition wouldn't help either.<br /><br />Is there some sure way to know? Maybe some application that could query my sy

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In Apps and Features when you choose Netflix, under Advanced Options is there a Reset button?  If not can you uninstall after a few restarts?  
<br />
<br />There is more about installing Netflix app including the hidden folder containing your downloads here:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/download-netflix-tv-shows-movies-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/download-netflix-...</a>.  **NOTE: There are ad links in boldest type intruding into the editorial copy of this tutorial so do not click on anything, just read the steps.  
<br />
<br />Can you System Restore to a point before you started installing it?  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

            Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: shell:appsfolder
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try launching Netflix to see if it launches. If not...
<br />
<br />Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />2. Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver
<br />
<br />3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />
<br />                          ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.

<h2>            What versions of Net Framework should I have on my computer&#63;</h2>
                    Hi:<br />
<br />
I am having issues with Net Framework installs/updates. I recently deleted .NETFramework 3.5, 1.0, and 2.0. These programs were listed in Programs and Features. But none of the updates would install, so I deleted the programs and figured I would start from
 scratch. I tried reinstalling the 3.5 version, yesterday, but it wouldn't install after several attempts. The list of NET Framework [NF] programs is confusing as to which versions I actually need?
<br />
<br />
I currently have the 4.0 version installed. I have been cleaning my registry of junk and unused/unnecessary files, etc. It seemed to help installing some previous 4.0 updates I couldn't previously install, so that's a good thing! But the NF 3.5 version downloaded,
 but wouldn't install.<br />
<br />
I read another article in this forum titled: "Net Framework updates won't install", but that article is dated 2009. I also have a 32 bit Vista Home Premium OS, as did that poster. She says she had success installing NF 1.1, 2.0, and 3.5, after uninstalling
 all NF versions, and using a NF cleanup tool. I used Revo uninstaller to remove all NF files related to NF 3.5, 2.0, and 1.0. After I uninstalled these programs I tried installing the pending 4.0 updates that wouldn't install previously, and they installed!
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what uninstalling the other NF programs had to do with installing the NF 4.0 updates, but I'm not complaining.<br />
<br />
So my questions are:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; What versions of Net Framework should I have on my computer or do I need?<br />
2.&nbsp; If I have the NF 4.0 version, do I need the other versions, ie; 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, etc.?<br />
3.&nbsp; Do I need to uninstall ALL NF programs, use the NF cleanup tool, then reinstall all the NF programs 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 4.0?<br />
<br />
Any assistance or help appreciated, Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Let's tackle your questions one by one:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1. Learn more about the different versions of .NET Framework and how they work:</p>
<p>http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb822049(v=vs.110).aspx</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Unfortunately, if programs you use were built using a specific version of the .NET Framework, let's say 2.0, you will need to have .NET Framework 2.0 installed. &nbsp;Same goes for all other versions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. From my experience, 1.1, 2.0 and 3.5 are must haves because a wide range of programs are built using these versions. And of course, if you are missing a version, the program will prompt you to install it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Using the cleanup tool to uninstall everything and installing them all in order is a good idea. Also, should you run into problems installing a specific version, look up the error code (if any) and try to sort that out first.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. Windows Updates will help you from time to time by downloading and installing the latest .NET Framework versions for your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So to sum things up, it is a good idea to have most if not all, releases of .NET Framework installed on your computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>R. Thanks, I read that and will soon become a computer tech/assoc.?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. Unfortunately, if programs you use were built using a specific version of the .NET Framework, let's say 2.0, you will need to have .NET Framework 2.0 installed. &nbsp;Same goes for all other versions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>R. The above link says: "Apps built for 2.0, 3.0, and 3.5, can all run on 3.5, but they will not work on version 4 or later." See Version History, paragraph 1, last sentence of that link.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This link also states in the <span style="font-weight: bold">NET Framework Versions and Dependencies

<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Q.a.</span>&nbsp; So if I install
3.0</span> layers with it, correct?<br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">Q.b</span>.&nbsp; But the above link doesn't specify if it is a 3.0 SP1 or SP2 version?<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="font-weight: bold">Q.c.</span></span>&nbsp; I presume maybe I should install the 1.0 or 1.1 version as well?
<br />
</p>
<p>But I couldn't find the 1.0 version on the MS site.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. From my experience, 1.1, 2.0 and 3.5 are must haves because a wide range of programs are built using these versions. And of course, if you are missing a version, the program will prompt you to install it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>R. I don't recall seeing any prompts to install these programs, after I uninstalled these programs? I deleted/uninstalled a 1.0 program, but not a 1.1 version?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. Using the cleanup tool to uninstall everything and installing them all in order is a good idea. Also, should you run into problems installing a specific version, look up the error code (if any) and try to sort that out first.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>R. Revo does a thorough job of uninstalling files and registry entries associated with the programs you want to delete. But I guess it can't hurt to run a Net Framework cleanup tool.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>5. Windows Updates will help you from time to time by downloading and installing the latest .NET Framework versions for your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>R. I uninstalled 1.0, 2.0, and 3.5 versions, as they were not responsive to Windows updates. Including the 4.0 version, but after I ran various file/registry cleaners, the 4.0 updates successfully installed. And after the 4.0 updates successfully installed,
 the other several pending updates for the 2.0 version disappeared from the update list.

            Anyone home?<br />
<br />
I downloaded and ran a Net Framework Cleanup Tool, then attempted to install the NF 1.1 program, but it failed 3 times. I got error codes 1935,and 2908.<br />
<br />
Same with NF 3.5 SP1 [Bootstrapper version], but that failed as well. I tried installing the Windows 3.1 installer prior to installing the NF 3.5 SP1 program, but the installer failed to install, no pun intended?<br />
<br />
I don't know how interrelated or relevant it is, but I have previously ran a SFC scan several times to check for issues, and I keep seeing that I have several issues with Processor_Architecture_Intel VC80, 8.0.50727.762, win32, that the manifest may be damaged
 [true].<br />
<br />
Also the MS Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable Program I have all seem to be interrelated with the above two programs in some way. I've had issues installing this Visual C++ program as well. So I'm like scrambled eggs with this convoluted mismash.<br />
<br />
Any help, would help.<br />

<p><br />
Long story, short version:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A1. Your Vista (SP2) computer came with&nbsp;<strong>.NET Framework 2.0 SP1 and 3.0 SP1</strong> installed by default. Any other versions were either offered as Optional,
<em>non-security </em>updates or were installed when you installed an application which required a version of .NET that wasn't already installed (e.g., QuickBooks; TurboTax).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A2. Installing .NET Framework 4 (Client Profile) does <em>not </em>replace any other .NET versions. See</p>
<ul>
<li>Do I still need older versions of the .NET Framework on my system after installing .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 [and/or .NET Framework 4.0]?<br />

<p>I purchased Fallout4 on release (11/10/2015) digitally from Live but I have not yet received message for my Fallout 3. I would not think that messages could be vanished? And the messaging system is automated I guess.</p>
<p>I know &nbsp;I need to contact the support but just wanted post this on forums if there is more people with same issue.</p>

            Hi  Andrew.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How was Windows 10 originally Activated on the PC?  Did it come preinstalled from Factory, was it Upgraded with free or paid Upgrade, or was it a retail copy and license?  
<br />
<br />For Upgrade, when you first upgraded and it activated it assigned a permanent Digital License to the PC in Microsoft Activation Servers so you can reinstall any time and in any way you want as long as you reinstall the licensed version.  It should reactivate soon after going online.  
<br />
<br />You can move the Digital License to new hardware following this procedure:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/windows-10-reactivating-after-hardware-change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20530/...</a>
<br />
<br />Factory installs have the Product Key embedded in BIOS or UEFI firmware and should activate themselves, but you can check for the key by installing ProducKey and look for the OEM-BIOS key:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a>
<br />
<br />Retail keys must be reinserted for reinstalls during install or in Settings. 
<br />
<br />What is the Status and Edition shown at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation.  If it says you have a Digital License then no matter what method above only the Generic Version Key can be inserted to reactivate:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />If this fails you can contact Microsoft Support:  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/windows/tech-services/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Most preinstalled Windows licenses are for Home?  Did someone reinstall the wrong version?  It will never activate if it's not a Pro license.
<br />
<br />Was it installed at the factory e..g. Dell, HP, etc?   If so you can install ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> to copy and paste the OEM-BIOS key in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.

            Hi Andrew,
<br />
<br />From your screenshot. the Windows 10 licence you are running is a volume licence version and is meant to run in a Company or organisation where the activation is re-armed on a regular basis or it is a cracked version of Windows
<br />
<br />You will need to backup your data and clean install the Edition of Windows 10 that your system is licenced for, which is most likely the Home Edition

    <title>Class driver has denied request to install Epson NX125 scanner drivers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baristaninja26  say:</h3>
<h2>            Class driver has denied request to install Epson NX125 scanner drivers</h2>
                    I (administrator) have been attempting to install an Epson Stylus NX125 all-in-one printer/copier/scanner.&nbsp; The drivers for the copier and printer were successfully installed and test prints and test copies work fine.&nbsp; During the installation process I
 received the error message "the class driver has denied the request to install and/or update this device" in regards to Epson Scan.&nbsp; I uninstalled everything, ran a disk clean-up, disk defragment, a full security scan and the command "scf/scannow".&nbsp; I also
 downloaded the individual drivers from epson.com and after a re-boot I attempted to install the individual drivers with Norton Firewall &amp; Anti-Virus off and the external hard drive unplugged.&nbsp; Same error message<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ONLY</span>
</strong>for the scanner.&nbsp;
<p>Next attempt was to uninstall all the USB root hubs from the device manager and reboot again.&nbsp; The installation resulted in the same error message.&nbsp; Device Manager shows under "Scanning/Imaging Devices" Epson Scan, with a yellow circle and an "!" in the
 middle of it.&nbsp; Attempts to "Add an imaging device" under the Control Panel show Epson as a brand, but only Epson PhotoPC for systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help?</p>

<p>Hi <strong>BaristaNinja26</strong>,</p>
<p>As we checked the compatibility of the device with Windows 7 operating system, we received a negative result.</p>
<p><strong>Visit this below link for more information.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=Epson%20NX125%20scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=Epson%20NX125%20scanner</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>First Connect your device to your computer and wait for Vista to recognize and install the drivers for it. When it is done, you may try installing the drivers on your computer and check for the issue.</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>If the issue still persists then, I suggest you to install the drivers in clean boot mode.</p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article:</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above KB article.</strong></p>

<h2>            skype keeps re-adding people automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've been having this issue for the last two years where people I delete from my skype contacts list randomly reappear in the list at a later point in time. I have even tried blocking and deleting them, along with going through every account [email,
 skype on all my devices, phone's contact list, etc] to make sure there were no traces of the contacts anywhere that they might be returning from, but they reappear again a few months later anyway.
<br />
<br />
It is really getting annoying, does anyone have any suggestions on how to stop them from returning to my contacts list?</p>

            <p>Hi Stacy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching us out on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like the access is denied prompt when the computer starts up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we need some more information about the issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>Please help me answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you&nbsp;installed any recent software?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to boot to the desktop?</p>
<p>3. Which anti-virus software do you use?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>This file is a Microsoft Windows system file.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I have a couple of steps which should assist you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Run SFC scan on the computer to make sure system files are intact:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></b></a><b><span>
</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong>Method 2:</strong>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span> I would suggest you to boot in safe mode with networking and check if you face the same issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts <span>Windows</span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
<span>Windows </span>are installed. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To boot into safe mode refer to the link provided below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Start tapping the <b>F8</b> key.</span></p>
<p><span>c) You will get advanced boot option window.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<b> </b></span><span>Select the option<b> “Safe mode with Networking”.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer to the link provided below for more information on safe mode:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode I would recommend that you perform Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot:
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>Put the computer to normal as mentioned in Step 3 from the KB article.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><span>Run a virus scanner and check:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Virus is known to cause these issues. Scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which helps to get rid of virus, spyware, and malicious software.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires after 10 days from the date of installation.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Emily,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be due to system files being missing/corrupted. I would suggest you to run System File Checker tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key +<strong> X</strong> and click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></p>
<p>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Hello again, lets give it another try:</p>
<p>
</p><p>See that red seal, guess what it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warning: If you are a System Builder: by opening the package you agree that you have read and understood the Microsoft OEM System Builder License affixed to this package and agree to its terms and conditions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fdsitsolutions.co.in%2fadmin%2fimages%2fsmall_thumbnails%2fwindows_8_oem_professional.png" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is from the End User License Agreement if you bought a new PC with Windows preinstalled:</p>
<p>
</p><p>By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its return policy. You must comply with that policy, which might limit your rights or require you
 to return the entire system on which the software is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the minute you start using the computer, the license is tied to the hardware.</p>

            <p>I really don't know the exact point in the installation process where activation takes place or your are past the point of no return. Even if I did know, I could not tell you as this falls under the general issue of attempting to circumvent activation.</p>
