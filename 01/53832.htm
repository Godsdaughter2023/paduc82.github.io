<h2>            How to get 2 network notification icons for dual LAN cards&#63;</h2>
                    <p>original title: Network Notifications - Dual LAN cards.</p>
<p>I have two Ethernet cards installed in my desktop. However, there is only a single notification for one of the ports when unplugged (In the system tray). Is there a way to be notified when each port becomes unplugged? Something similar to windows XP: when
 two local networks are installed, you would be given 2 computer icons and based on whether they were connected or unplugged you could tell easily from the System tray.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I Windows 7 you do not get 2 different network notification icons for different network cards like the Windows XP as this is
 by design of Windows 7 operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>To check the network status in Windows 7, you can right-click on the network notification icon and click on properties.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link for more information.</span></p>

<h2>            How to re-download Windows 8 Pro installable files&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>I currently have Windows 7 Home Premium on my laptop (Dell XPS 15, i3, 4GB Ram, 500GB HDD, DVD-RW...) and had purchased Windows 8 Pro through microsoft website. I have received the product keys. Accordingly had downloaded the installables, done system
 checks and proceeded with install. I currently face problem with install as it currently fails @ 20% when trying to setup windows 8. I have tried various options of creating iso file, installing with USB, removing all the external devices while installing
 etc etc.</div>
<div>Came across a topic in this forum to check for hash SHA1 of iso file and i find it is different from what it should be (PS: while downloading the windows 8 installable, it had stopped in middle as i had lost internet connectivity, but it resumed downloading
 again when i connected internet again). I assume as my download might have been corrupted (this also happened @ 20%), hence i need to re-download the reinstallable and try again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Request to let me know how do i re-download the windows 8 files again? GOing to the website, the only option to download again is thru buying the software again, which i do not wish to do as i already have valid Product Keys from my earlier purchase.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its been 3 days since i have been going round and round tryin to install windows 8 pro on my laptop. HELP!!!!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PS: I have also tried reinstall using&nbsp;Windows8-Setup.exe and&nbsp;Windows8-UpgradeAssistant.exe, which i downloaded from Microsoft website itself...</div>
                </div>

When it says redownload down I have to enter my legit product key in and then will this download a fresh clean copy of the installation files which then I can simply write to a bootable dvd recordable?

            Here's the simple answer: &nbsp;Go to https://www.mswos.com and enter the order number and other data from your initial purchase (yes, you will need it ... you don't delete emails, right? &nbsp;:-) Go search for it!). &nbsp;Click Submit. &nbsp;Then a link shows up at the
 bottom for "download windows 8." &nbsp;It's a setup file. &nbsp;You'll enter your product key, and be on your way! &nbsp;I hope I've simplified for you ... these threads don't get right to the point sometimes.

Hey thanks for this. Been pulling my hair out wondering where or how I could get my&nbsp;OS download. I even downloaded a 2nd copy and changed the options thinking that would change something. (Silly I know, but I got a bit desperate and I knew the offer was for
 a&nbsp;limited) now I have 2 copies. Probably give to&nbsp; a friend if I can't get a refund.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again. </p>

<h2>            Cannot connect my wireless Bluetooth mouse to my Windows 10 system.</h2>
                    I recently bought a Dell WM524 mouse for use with my laptop. I opened it up and followed the instructions, but it doesn't show up when I scan for Bluetooth devices, all the devices listed are labeled as "Unknown."(and I've tried to connect each one, and
 none of them get connected) The mouse is compatible with Win 10 as shown on the Dell site. How do I go about connecting it?

No, this sadly didn't work. I should add that the mouse is completely wireless Bluetooth, it doesn't have a USB connecter. So I don't think updating the hardware would help, as I've tried twice after you suggested it. Any other ideas?<br />

<h2>            Recent players not updating, and messages not being received on Xbox one X</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Xbox one x for 2 weeks and it still isn't showing me my messages via notification, and won't update recent players. It's had the exact same list up for 2 weeks, saying from 3 days ago. It's been 2 weeks&nbsp;and nothing has changed. But it says 3 days ago. I don't understand what is going on. And yes notifications are turned on. Also my messages don't get marked read when I read them.&nbsp;</p>

Thats ridiculous. That should be an Xbox Live service, not something for the developer to put in. I notice the same thing with Minecraft for Windows 10, Microsoft's own IP.

<h2>            pen and touch keeps disappearing saying no pen and touch for tis model</h2>
                    <p>regardless of the fact this laptop came with touchscreen and, theres no reason for it to continue to work correctly giving me back my touch screen then just as soon as it does it alsters itself and I have no touch screen again. I have no idea what to do,
 I have tried to reset the laptop, I have tried the windows 10 usb, that did not work, in fact I tried to buy media from HP and got errored out and It couldn't complete the install, I wasn't out of warranty at the time when this started but unfortunately, my
 laptop is now. I have tried all the 'fix-its' that are working for everyone else. Please I need help. I was my touchscreen back, I would like my laptop that isn't even 3 years old to work again.

<p>Hi Liza,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To have a better clarity on the issue and guide you accordingly, kindly help us with the following information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the exact model number of your HP machine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analyzing the previous threads created by you, seems like you’ve done some great troubleshooting. You may want to try the methods listed below and check if it works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><strong>Two button shut down:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong>Shut down </strong>your device using the power button.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press the <strong>power</strong> button and the
<strong>volume</strong>-<strong>up</strong> buttons at the same time, for at least 15-20 seconds.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Release the buttons after 30 seconds, let the machine sit for at least 10 seconds and turn it back on normally.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method</strong> <strong>2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Enable Tablet PC service:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <strong>‘Win + R’</strong> keys on the keyboard together to open the Run dialog box and type the following into the Run box:
<strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <strong>Tablet PC service </strong>
and check if it’s running. If it isn’t, <strong>Start </strong>the service and set it to
<strong>Automatic.</strong></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Exit <strong>services.msc</strong> and reboot the machine to see if it works.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            Good luck getting help. I purchased my all in one touch back in December 2017. Right exactly at a year the touch went out and HP refused to help with out me paying a fee first. I said forget it. My family and friends will NEVER purchase another HP product.
 Maybe you'll have better luck here. I have the same issue and I keep being told the same stupid directions that doesn't pertain to me. There's nothing in device manager to uninstall and reinstall.

            No luck here, I have been told by HP is Microsoft &amp; Microsoft says its HP but no one will do anything to fix it. I even bought the media from HP and it failed to restore my computer so now its running just windows 10 without a single HP service loads of
 fun. Im shopping for a new computer &amp; I’d sooner slit my throat then buy another HP especially since my laptop was still under warranty when this first started but HP refused to help me, HP is a complete rip off!!! I’m saving for a Toshiba I never had a problem
 that I couldn’t fix with my first laptop which was a satellite and when I couldn’t fix it the 1 button factory restore actually works but moreover the customer service doesn’t only talk to you after charging you $50+ dollars to leave you alone trying to fix
 your problem anyway!!!&nbsp;

<p>I'm sorry the laptop is the HP pavilion Beats special edition notebook 15 p390nr it is less than 3years old &amp; all of this started with the original fall creators update rollout. I can see the touchscreen when I go to device manager and click hidden devices
 or whatever but every time I turn it back on it updates to a wireless button and I have deleted the wireless button but then the laptop updates it back in always disabling the touchscreen and sending it back into hiding. And now when I go to the website to
 download the drivers they are not there, it's the wireless button. Whatever a wireless button does it's just a wireless pain in my arss!!!</p>

    <title>Two big shortcomings of OneDrive on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emilio bresk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two big shortcomings of OneDrive on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just upgraded from Windows 8 to 8.1, and have been highly disappointed by a couple of features of the new OneDrive functionality:</p>
<ol>
<li>In order to function on W8.1, <strong>OneDrive requires a Microsoft account to be connected to my computer</strong>.<br />
It is not possible to sign into the OneDrive App separately (i.e.: one cannot choose a Windows account&nbsp;to be used specifically for this app, without affecting other apps or the rest of the OS).<br />
<br />
I do understand this is supposed to be a functionality improvement, and it might in fact be quite convenient in most cases.<br />
But it can also be a trouble in some scenarios. Particularly, if you want to use a different Microsoft account for some other app (such as -in my case- the Xbox app).<br />
<br />
The Microsoft account I use for Xbox is different from the one I use for everything else (e-mail, OneDrive, etc.), so I need the ability to sign into the Xbox app and the OneDrive app with different Microsoft accounts.<br />
However, this is not possible. The Xbox app does allow for separate sign in, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
as long as you don't have a Microsoft account connected to your computer</span> (but then the OneDrive app won't work). On the other hand, if I do connect a Microsoft account to my computer (so that I can use the OneDrive app), then the Xbox app will default
 to that account, and I cannot change it...<br />
<br />
To make things even worse, the OneDrive <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">desktop</span> app is now "integrated" into the OS, which means&nbsp;one just cannot configure it (or even sign into it) separately.&nbsp;That is: you can still see and use the OneDrive folder
 on the Desktop File Explorer, and manage your files from there, but <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
only as long as you are using the OneDrive 'modern-style' app</span>.<br />
In other words, <strong>if you want to use OneDrive at all, you're stuck with connecting a Microsoft account to your computer</strong>.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>The functionality to <strong>fetch files from a connected computer is no longer available</strong> in OneDrive, for computers running Windows 8.1.<br />
This isn't something that I used very often, but I did once or twice, and I found it to be a really handy feature. It's quite unfortunate to see it removed on W8.1.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>

            <p>Ok, here is a real life scenario for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my personal notebook computer.&nbsp; I decided to bite the bullet and install Windows 8.1 on it, since I can use Classic Shell to reproduce the lost Start Menu.</p>
<p>I am working with a local nonprofit and have set up a Onedrive account with which to share files among the officers.&nbsp; On my desktop computer with Windows 7, I installed Onedrive and synched it with the account for the organization.&nbsp; Works Great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to the notebook with Win 8.1 installed.&nbsp; I can't log onto that Onedrive account, unless I change my user account on Windows 8.1 to that Onedrive account.&nbsp; So my personal identity has to change and I have to log onto my own computer with a shared Onedrive
 account used by all the officers of the organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, eventually, we will get our 501C3 status, and be able to apply for Office 365 for nonprofits and move on to Onedrive for Business. Then, I can use that with my personal Win 8.1 account. But until then, I have to logon to my personal Win 8.1 computer
 as the organization's shared account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boy, what a joke.</p>

            <p>It's against the terms of use to share a single onedrive account between more than one person, it's supposed to be private.&nbsp; It's not my job to defend them, but they wrote the "legal terms" that you agree to, and the basis of your complaint is that you can't
 do precisely what you "agreed" not to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest a file storage service that <em>does</em> allow sharing a single account/password for all people, but I honestly can't find one.&nbsp; I looked at Google, Drop Box, Box, Boxy, and a few others. They all have the same legal terms.</p>

            <p>Good point, although it doesn't address the original concern I had raised: on Windows 8.1, OneDrive only works if a Microsoft Account is 'connected' to the Windows session, and it only works for that specific Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>For any other purposes, OneDrive is unusable on Windows 8.1...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is a big disappointment.</p>

            <p>Same boat. I have a personal OneDrive account for my home PC, Surface pro and windwos phone. I had my work PC connected to that OneDrive account for some document sharing including One Note which I use across all my platforms. I can have all my workbooks
 on all PCs/tablets/phones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the only way to get my One Drive to sync is to connect my personal account to my works domain joined PC. I am the admin of the network, but still, I just want OneDrive to sync, I don't care about any thing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is BS behavior. Microsoft you are not apple, the reason everyone has MS products is because you never pulled stuff like this. Doing the same as a company with &lt;10% market share is not going to do you any favors. I like the integration, just don't force
 me to do all or nothing. FIX THIS.</p>

            <p>The point here is Microsoft decided to tie all Apps-including OneDrive-&nbsp;and some other functions together with a Microsoft Account. We don't have to like it but, we have to either accept it&nbsp; or find Something else to replace it. And personally don't see
 the big deal as this provides more and better Security which is what everyone has been screaming about for years and now that better Security is here the same people are screaming Foul. I think we all need to figure what it is that we really want from Microsoft.
</p>
&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

            <p>I understand security, and this has nothing to do with security. It is just tying all their services into one account tied to a PC. I don't want outlook, bing, xbox, or anything else connection on this PC. I want onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything, this goes against segmented security practices. I don't have to accept it. I can post on every MS post I can find that it is asinine that a service can't be used unless I tie my account to a PC. It's that simple. They are forcing me to connect
 my PC, my WHOLE PC, to their account to use one service. That is not MS, never has been MS and is one of the primary reason I refuse to use apple products. On my personal Surface Pro, I log in with my MS account, and it's great, awesome and it works wonders.
 But I should be able to load the app for that service and log in so I can sync a few OneNote workbooks with out tying my whole PC to my personal MS account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be like you have a dropbox account, and you have to log into your PC with drop box and everything on there is tied to dropbox. No one would use it. I just want to sync OneDrive. I figure that isn't a big thing to ask.</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>(...) We don't have to like it but, we have to either accept it&nbsp; or find Something else to replace it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a false dichotomy, and I don't think it reflects Microsoft's approach to customer satisfaction (luckily, as it'd be a pretty poor approach!).</p>
<p>There's a third option which I think is the best one: we can raise our voices to express our concerns,&nbsp;hoping that Microsoft will revise their decision. And this is in fact exactly what we're doing here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also agree with JeffreyMertz&nbsp;in that&nbsp;this has nothing to do with security. This is about user choice and freedom.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I do use (and am happy with) most of the Microsoft services that are enabled by a Microsoft account (OneDrive, Outlook, Bing, Xbox, etc). I just don't use the same login credentials for all of them, and it sucks that I'm forced to modify
 my usage pattern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users should have the option to decide whether we want each individual app to default to the 'main' Microsoft account tied to the Windows session, or if we want to be able to login to the app separately.</p>
<p>Actually, most apps do allow for this option. But the OneDrive app doesn't, and that's precisely what we're complaining about.</p>

            <p>To all who posted to me. It is about Security yes you can raise&nbsp; your "Voices" but you will find that more users will fight afor the increased Security that A Microsoft account and Internet explore and Widows Defender provide than object. Again you scream
 for more security and when it is offered you cry "foul"</p>

            <p>I installed windows 8 to my laptop and had to create user and password based on my email. Later on I signed up for office 365 with a different email address as I use that for any orders etcetera to do with payments to separate from personal emails.</p>
<p>Now as office 365 user I have been given 1tb storage in onedrive but cannot use the back up function in the built in onedrive as I can't sign off the other email.</p>
<p>the website does not allow me to add the first email to the second and says email is already in use! So in my Windows onedrive I have only some 10gb and cannot do backup for lack of space - on the other account I have 1tb but cannot set back up as it on
 the browser and not the app!!</p>
<p>this is infuriating!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't find any help - there seems no help button in the app!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Very dissapointed. We should be able to choose account uses the app!!</p>

            <p>Hi Bong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the version of Adobe Reader installed?</li><li>When you say, "some files&nbsp;can not be downloaded and some ... cant be read", do you mean that you are able to download and read other PDF files?</li><li>What is the location of the PDF files that you are trying to read/open?</li><li>Did you make any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>Adobe Reader XI is <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/ProductViewerWithDefaultFilters?TempOsid=Windows%208.1&amp;Locale=en-us&amp;Architecture=X64&amp;TextSearch=Adobe%2BReader%2BXI&amp;Type=Both&amp;CurrentPage=0&amp;TotalPages=1&amp;ShowCriteria=0&amp;SortCriteria=Relevance&amp;Compatibility=Unknown&amp;LastRequested=14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatible with Windows 8.1</a>. Check if you have installed its latest version. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to that, I would like to introduce you with the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/reader/8a4ae377-a4ab-4260-9b80-f9382360e291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reader app</a> that comes built-in with Windows 8.1. You may also refer to the section: “How to make PDF, XPS, or TIFF files open in Reader by default?” to set Reader app as the default app to open PDF files and check.</p>

<h2>            Huge power consumption in hibernate...</h2>
                    <p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I’m trying to figure out how to fix the sleep/hibernate/modern standby huge power consumption issue. Any idea is very welcome.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have Dell XPS 9365 2-in-1 with Windows 10 Version 10.0.16299 Build 16299 installed. I have an issue with huge power consumption when the device is not active. I specifically said “not active” because it is difficult to understand
 if it is really in sleep or hibernate or any other modes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If I manually put the device into sleep by clicking on Start &gt; Power &gt; Sleep. It looks like the device gets into some sort of standby mode. When I wake it up shortly after putting it into
 sleep it is still connected to the network which might or might not be correct behavior. If I let it stay for a while and then wake it up. It wakes up disconnected. The question is there a way to better control the intervals when the device stays connected,
 when it gets disconnected, when it switches any other mode? I’m interested in any native Microsoft or third-party solution.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If I manually put the device into hibernate by clicking on Start &gt; Power &gt; Hibernate. It looks like the device gets into some sort of standby mode. When I wake it up it wakes up disconnected
 and with Airplane mode turned on. Is there a way to control this behavior and make it not turning Airplane mode on?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If I manually put the device into hibernate by clicking on Start &gt; Power &gt; Hibernate and let is stay for a while and then look at the sleep study by running powercfg -sleepstudy this is what
 I see</span></p>
<p><span>START TIME - 2018-01-25 19:13:52</span></p>
<p><span>DURATION - 3:09:45</span></p>
<p><span>STATE - Modern Standby</span></p>
<p><span>ENERGY CHANGE - 3,357 mWh / 7% of battery</span></p>
<p><span>CHANGE RATE -7% of battery</span></p>
<p><span>% LOW POWER STATE TIME - 1,062 mW</span></p>
<p><span>That brings a few questions</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is Modern Standby and why it was in the Modern Standby even though I specifically asked to put the device into hibernate mode?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The power consumption is huge - 7% of the battery in 3 hours which gives approximately 42 hours until the battery is fully depleted. The device is supposed to stay in hibernate mode for weeks
 without significant change to the battery charge. What’s going on here? If it is not actually the hibernate mode how do I put the device into the real hibernate mode if clicking on the hibernate button does not do it?</span></p>

<p><span>All of them are FxDevice what means that they are supposed to be properly controlled by the operating system. I was thinking about disabling them but the first two are responsible for touchpad and touchscreen so if I disable them touchpad and touchscreen
 stop working. If I disable USB xHCI the front camera stops working. What can I do about that if anything? Of course, I have the latest drivers.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Another related question is the wake-up triggers. As I mentioned before touchpad and touchscreen are the major offenders and incidentally they are the wake-up triggers along with the keyboard.
 Is it possible to exclude them from being triggers? I’m perfectly fine with waking up my device by pressing the power button. I don’t even want the keyboard and touchpad to wake up the device. Please do not suggest to uncheck “Allow this device to wake the
 computer” on the “Power Management” tab for the driver in the device manager. All those check boxes are unchecked. I hope there is something else.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Overnight power drain is 29% from 70% to 41%. I read many articles stating that "modern standby" was introduced to improve user experience and speed up the device wake up to make it instantaneous and I can reluctantly agree that it may be important
 to somebody in day time but in night time the device is not in use the whole night. I'm sure there must be a way to put it into a real hibernate to stop this terrible power drain when it is not necessary but I cannot understand how to make it go into the real
 hibernate mode.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to tell that I tried the power troubleshooter as well. More over, I got very negative impression about this troubleshooter. It only recommended to reduce the time before monitor turn off and before putting the device into a sleep. I suspect it
 does not even analyze the possible power drains when the device in the sleep/hibernate/standby mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; My particular problem if you read my question again is the power consumption when the device is not active. I need a serious expert help somebody who understands how to analyze this problem on the low level. I'm sure it cannot be fixed with automatic
 troubleshooters, system scans and so on. It is something that most likely can only be fixed by direct registry editing of the setting which might affect power consumption or changing driver settings on the low level or even installing tools which would be
 able to change the windows core behavior in regards to sleep/hibernate/standby.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ideally, I would like to find a tool which would give me a total control over sleep/hibernate/modern standby settings and would allow me to put the device into sleep mode, hibernate mode and modern standby mode.</p>

<p>I too have the 9365 Dell XPS 13 2in1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having sleep troubles but hey are not as severe as yours. I constantly see around 500 to 700mw power draws during sleep sessions (By Microsoft's documentation that's too high for this sized laptop and results in about 50 to 70 hours of total sleep time)
 Mine can get into hibernation and while in hibernation does not use power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you have some driver issues, or firmware problems? Are you running 1.2.1 BIOS? I just looked and the latest posted is 1.1. (posted Nov 29 2017)... Which means they pulled the 1.2.1 Jan 8th bios I still have a copy but I am unsure why it's
 missing.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I've had an active ticket with dell since August about power draw issues. My latest response from them yesterday states that 536mw is the expected draw during a modern standby sleep session. If that was their goal during development they didn't put a big
 enough battery into the laptop to support modern standby sleep scenarios, and a traditional S3 sleep would have been better; since a maximum sleep of 92 hours is only achieved with a healthy battery at full capacity.</p>

<p>Also Alex one tool that is very useful in identifying what's on or drawing power while the laptop is "sleeping" is WPA's wpr tool.</p>
<p>Here's a link:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/capture-and-view-a-wpa-trace-for-modern-standby-diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/capture-and-view-a-wpa-trace-for-modern-standby-diagnostics</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the wpr diagnositic tool for about an hour while your laptop is sleeping to look at the power draw, application activations, or possibly any thing that may prevent your laptop from entering the sleep state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also this page may be useful if you do have a driver issue to look through:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby-sleepstudy-common-problem-examples#no-software-drips-or-hardware-drips-due-to-a-missing-driver" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/design/device-experiences/modern-standby-sleepstudy-common-problem-examples#no-software-drips-or-hardware-drips-due-to-a-missing-driver</a></p>

</p><p>What are your top offenders? or any of the other details of a troubled sleep study. I've been study sleep studies since about August trying to fully understand what's up with my system and why it only sleeps for about 2 days.</p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thank you for your post. It looks like you’ve got a lot of experience with this issue and I hope it can be solved. I have BIOS version 1.1.0 10/12/2017. I’ll definitely update it to the next one when it will be available but I
 think this is not the actual cause of the problem anyway. In my case the energy drain in modern standby is 1330 mW. I wish I had it as low as 500 mW however you are absolutely right even that is way too high. I looked over your screenshots but I don’t see
 the hibernate state in the table. There is only modern standby and active. You mentioned your device can hibernate. Could you show the energy drain in the hibernate mode? By the way, do you know a tool which would put the device into hibernate right away?
 That would solve a problem at least partially. It is not too difficult to run the tool when necessary.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My top offenders as I stated in the original question are 4 drivers: touchscreen, touchpad, camera and audio drivers. All of them are of FxDevice type so they have to be controlled by the system effectively but apparently, they
 are not. Of course, I updated them to the latest available versions. Potentially I can disable audio and camera but I definitely cannot disable touchpad and touchscreen. I wonder though why these drivers are not the top offenders in your case we have absolutely
 the same systems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I’ll do additional research with wpr/wpa soon and update the post.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Bluetooth on windows 10 PC Acer Aspire 5738PG</h2>
                    <p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the Windows 7 to Windows 10&nbsp; about a year ago. Recently I decided to activate the Bluetooth and I depared with a problema: I don't see any Bluetooth advice on my computer. On the Configurations/ Definitions there is an option for Bluetooth
 but when I click it the Bluetooth doesn't appear. I have installed brluetooth drivers but don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please tell me what the problem is ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>From your issue description, I understand that
<b>“you want to know how to save the regular play list". </b>
Please let me know if you are not facing this issue.<br />
<br />
Which application are you using to play the music?<br />
<br />
If you are using Windows Media Player, then I would suggest you to try the following steps to save the playlist.<br />
<br />
a. Press Windows key + C, in the search type Windows Media player, then click Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in
 the upper-right corner of the Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the Player Library, click the Play tab, if necessary, to open the list pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you need to clear the list pane before creating your playlist, click Clear list.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c. Drag items from the details pane to the list pane to add them to the new playlist.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To select multiple adjacent items, press and hold the Shift key while selecting. To select non-adjacent
 items, press and hold the Ctrl key while selecting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>d. To rearrange items, drag them up or down in the list pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>e. To save the list, click Save list at the top of the list pane, type a name for the playlist, and then
 press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By default, playlists are saved with a .wpl extension in the Playlists folder, which is located in the
 default save folder of your Music library. You can also save playlists with the .m3u or .asx extension. To do so, at the top of the list pane, click the List options button , click Save list as, and then change the extension in the Save as type dialog box.
 After you save the playlist, it's added to the Playlists category in the navigation pane.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To play the playlist in the list pane, click the Play button .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>f. To access the playlist in the future, double-click the Playlists view in the navigation pane or click
 the arrow next to Playlists to expand the view.<br />
</span><span><br />
</span>Hope this information is helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.<span><br />

<h2>            TrendChip Ap showing in my Network.</h2>
                    Hi everyone<br />
so,my network discovery settings are always set to 'turn off' .Mom asked me what is this in the network ,I didn't know,so I turned on the network discovery,and I see that there is something named TrendChipAP under the Network Infrastructures category.I have
 no idea what is it? I clicked on the properties and says<br />
Model&nbsp;Ralink Wireless Access Point, Model Number RT2860 &nbsp;and there are some serial numbers and things like that!!<br />
we just have a TP-LINK wireless modem router. so I don't know what is this Trendchip AP,and should it be there or not,and also is it possible that someone is using our network or accessing our computer....I'm a bit worried.I'll be glad if someone can help.Thanks.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I will try my best to assist you with this query.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if you can explain the issue with more clarity. I would like to ask few questions regarding this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Where exactly do you find the “<strong><em>TrendChip Ap</em></strong>” entry?
</p>
<p>2) Are you able to see this entry listed under the wireless networks as well?</p>
<p>3) If this issue has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It would be great if you can embed a screenshot image showing this entry in your next reply, so that it would be really helpful for us to understand that exact issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To embed an image in your post, you may refer to the WiKi article given below:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/feedback/wiki/fdbk_commsite-fdbk_getstart/how-to-embed-images-on-microsoft-community/f74dac61-38d6-492e-8e71-286ab2645b2a">How to embed images on Microsoft Community</a></span></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a wireless network connection on the computer, then you can keep it secured by taking these security precautions. They are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>1) Use a network security key</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a wireless network, you should set up a network security key, which turns on encryption. With encryption, people can't connect to your network without the security key. Also, any information that's sent across your network is encrypted so that
 only computers that have the key to decrypt the information can read it. This can help avert attempts to access your network and files without your permission. Wi‑Fi Protected Access (WPA or WPA2) is the recommended wireless network encryption method.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>2) Change the default administrator name and password on your router or access point</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a router or access point, you probably used a default name and password to set up the equipment. Most manufacturers use the same default name and password for all of their equipment, which someone could use to access your router or access point
 without your knowledge. To avoid that risk, change the default administrator user name and password for your router.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>3) Change the default SSID</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Routers and access points use a wireless network name known as a service set identifier (SSID). Most manufacturers use the same SSID for all of their routers and access points. We recommend that you change the default SSID to keep your wireless network from
 overlapping with other wireless networks that might be using the default SSID. It makes it easier for you to identify which wireless network is yours, if there's more than one nearby, because the SSID is typically shown in the list of available networks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>4) Position your router or access point carefully</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wireless signals can transmit a few hundred feet, so the signal from your network could be broadcast outside of your home. You can help limit the area that your wireless signal reaches by positioning your router or access point close to the center of your
 home rather than near an outside wall or window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Hope this is helpful. Please get back to us with all the relevant information regarding this issue.</span>

<p>Having an Update System that isn't working does not give me any confidence in the problematic UPGRADE to Windows 10</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may try this.</p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<h2>            USB 3.0 vs 2.0 issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a printer which operates using USB 2.0.&nbsp; It worked well initially with a new Windows 10 laptop after the updated (printer) drivers were installed.&nbsp; Several boot ups later it stopped communicating.&nbsp; The (tough crap) error message stated your device
 is not 3.0 compatible without even attempting to suggest an alternative or work around.&nbsp; I soon discovered the "try this" item uninstall the device driver and reboot yada yada yada.&nbsp; Perhaps a "reboot" button should reside alongside the "restart button".&nbsp;
 This work around seemed to fix the problem.&nbsp; UNTIL the next time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Aside from all the other unfortunate issues with this unstable platform (WIN 10); is there a way to stop this crap from happening again and again and again or should I just boot delete the USB 3.0 host then reboot again before trying to print my financial
 reports?</p>

            <p>USB 3 is backwards compatible with USB 2, meaning that a USB 2 device works fine in a USB 3 port, and a USB 3 device works fine in a USB 2 port. (It just doesn't move data at higher USB 3 speed.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does the manufacturer of your printer support your particular model on Windows 10? That's the manufacturer's choice to make and there isn't anything that Microsoft can do about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my Canon POS started acting weird on Windows 10, the first thing I did was to go to Canon's website and guess what? Not supported. That means there's nothing you can do. And that's good, because I'll get more enjoyment from dropping that lousy POS printer&nbsp;from
 the attic window than I ever got from it when it was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if your printer <em>is</em> supported on Windows 10, the manufacturer's technical support will help get it working properly.</p>

<h3> mcbarker69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there any way to stop Windows from resizing images in a screensaver&#63;</h2>
                    Is there any way to stop Windows from resizing images in a screensaver? I have tried making several image screen savers with a third party program (ProShow), and they all display perfectly when testing within that program. However, when I make that screensaver
 the default, Windows re-sizes the images within it, and the results are grossly pixelated images. I have been unable to find a setting anywhere in Windows 7 which will allow the screensaver to display the images at their original size (like the "Center" option
 in Desktop Background Slideshow. This has also happened with other third-party screensaver software packages that I've tried, and even happens with Windows Live Photo Gallery screensaver, so it's definitely a Windows problem. Any help with this annoying problem
 would be appreciated. Thanks.

            <p>Hi Alfred,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We still have the option to restore from a System Image backup drive. I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Follow the steps to open System Image backup:</p>
<p>a. Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X</strong> keys and open <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</p>
<p>b. Open <strong>File History</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Click on <strong>System Image Backup</strong> on the lower left corner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Restore from System Image backup:</p>
<p>a. Plugin the External drive that has the System Image Backup.</p>
<p>b. Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>C</strong> and click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>c. Click on <strong>Change PC Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>d. Open <strong>Update and Recovery</strong> (Last option on the lower left corner).</p>
<p>e. Click on <strong>Recovery</strong> and click <strong>Restart Now</strong> under "<strong>Advanced Startup</strong>".</p>
<p>f. When the computer restarts select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> option at '<strong>Choose an option</strong>'.</p>
<p>g. Select <strong>Advanced Options</strong> at <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> screen.</p>
<p>h. Select <strong>System Image Recovery</strong> at <strong>Advanced Options</strong> screen (As soon as you select the System Image recovery, the computer will restart).</p>
<p>Type your <strong>Username</strong> and <strong>Password</strong> when prompted at the
<strong>System Image Recovery</strong> screen.</p>
<p>i. The Re-image &nbsp;your computer wizard will be started after the restart.</p>
<p>j. Select the correct system image you wish to restore to, in the first page of this wizard.</p>
<p>k. Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the prompts to restore your&nbsp;computer to the selected System Image Backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you better.</p>

            <p>That assumes that windows is working!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What if it does not work?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In the past you could boot into a rescue cd and then restore an image.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I tried to do that before it said that won't work with 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I think the answer is to make another drive "bootable" with emergency procedures on them?</p>

            It can apparently be restored by booting from a Windows 8.1 dvd, which I expect, as we legal owners of the operating system, can acquire via download from Microsoft. Today I tried downloading it from Microsoft, entering my legit key to prove ownership,
 but I was told that I cannot download a retail version. Tomorrow I will be calling MS to see which version I own and requesting download of it.
<div>Anyway, here is the rundown.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
1. Insert the Windows 8.1 installation media,&nbsp;or system repair disc and reboot your computer.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
2. Press Enter if you see “<em>Press any key to boot from CD/DVD</em>”</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
3. In the Windows Setup window, click the&nbsp;Repair your computer&nbsp;link. on the bottom left.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
4. Click the&nbsp;Troubleshoot&nbsp;icon from the Choose an option Window.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
5. Click the&nbsp;Advanced Options&nbsp;icon in the troubleshooting Window.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
6. In the Advance Options window click on&nbsp;System Image Recovery&nbsp;icon.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
7.&nbsp;Choose the target operating system&nbsp;witch would be the&nbsp;Windows 8.1</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
8. Windows 8.1 will scan your computer to detect any recent images created.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
9. Because we booted of the Disk the drive letter might change but not the drive name or date and time.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
10. So click on next in the Re-image your computer window.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
11. Check-mark&nbsp;Format and repartition disks.&nbsp;click next.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
12. Confirm the re-imaging process&nbsp;by clicking on finish and click on yes to the warning saying that the drive will be re-image from the back up you created.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
13. Once you re-start your computer should boot exactly the same as when you created the image backup.</p>

            <p>This explanations assumes too much about the environment to be useful.&nbsp; Microsoft needs to publish more complete instructions on how to restore a system drive from an image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are just a few things missing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making an image backup likely will require that the shadow service be set to automatic.&nbsp; In my experience the default "manual" setting will cause the image backup to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The restore software that comes from the restore startup disk that I made could not log onto my LAN to locate images stored there.&nbsp; It could not find images stored&nbsp;under file names.&nbsp; It could not search local drives.&nbsp; Basically, everything I tried to get
 around one failure led to a new barrier.&nbsp; So far, I know of no way to restore an image on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure the above instructions work if the system is in some state that is assumed and unstated.&nbsp; But they don't work on my system in multiple ways.&nbsp; I need more complete documentation on what the environment needs to be in order for everything to work
 in the image restoration process.</p>

<h2>            Event Viewer error &#34;pagefile.sys&#58;&#58;&#36;DATA is blocking my ability to shrink the drive.&#34;, can I move pagefile to a different drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to shrink my C drive to add another partition on my main drive (SSD). I also have a D drive on the same drive. I have 56GB of free space on C and I only want to shrink it by 15GB, yet it won't let me saying there is not enough space. &nbsp;So I checked
 the event log and it says that my pagefile.sys::$DATA is blocking my ability to shrink the drive. &nbsp;Then I read on 2 Microsoft help pages that I should move the pagefile to another drive, shrink the one I want, then move pagefile back. &nbsp;I just can't find any
 information on how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that a valid way of shrinking my C drive? If so, how do I do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running 8.1Pro.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 no internet connection in safe mode with networking.</h2>
                    Hello. I have windows 10 installed on my pc. For some reasons I need to boot in to safe mode and have internet connection for troubleshooting, that means that is safe mode with networking. However, when I boot in to safe mode with networking, there is
 an option to press for it, I all the time booting in to safe mode, but without internet connection. I can not make windows 10 to boot in to safe mode with networking and connect to internet. When I look in to network properties or want to setup internet connection
 software shows that there no any hardware exist, but in adapter settings there is a WiFi card present that I use to connect internet. Any one know how to fix this bug and have to connect in safe mode with networking pc? Thank you. :)

</p><p>I have a program, reimage repair, that says it can do a better job if you run it in safe mode, though you can't get an internet connection in windows 10, unless there is a key or secret handshake..&nbsp; It used to be that I could do the f8 thing and pick safe
 mode with network connection but that option seems to be gone.</p>

            Hello. I did find some information that states that windows 10 in safe mode with networking can not run additional drivers work wifi cards, so it might work if network physical cable plugged in. is that is true or there is some another way to make wifi
 connect to internet in safe mode with networking? Thank you.&nbsp;
