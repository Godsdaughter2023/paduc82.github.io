<p>I'm having this problem now and I don't know what else to do. I've tried to boot into safe mode but this thing happened too. Tried the restore point thing too but it just showing errors too no matter which restore point I've chosen. I've also tried the sfc
 scannow and chkdsk from the cmd in troubleshooter but it was write protected. I've looked around the internet and I still have to boot it into safe mode which I cannot enter without facing this blue screen. Maybe my last resort is to clean install windows
 10 and lose everything such as games and any other installed programs I have in my laptop... If anyone have the solution for this please help</p>

            Hi Muhd.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You don't lose anything doing a Clean Install.  All apps and games can be reinstalled or no one would buy them because anyone who wants a healthy install regularly reinstalls Windows, or at least does one great install and saves it as a backup image so you never have to do it again. 
<br />
<br />1) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you Mr.Greg for your advice but I have a few questions. There is an option called reset. Will this help in my issue? It says that I can still keep my files but would the installed program inside programfiles folder still be kept?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus I got this message while trying to boot into safe mood:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop code: SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED</p>
<p>What failed: AppleUSBVHCI.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run a check about the Apple usbvhci.sys but I still need to enter and use my pc which still be my greatest problem here.</p>

            What Apple devices or software do you use?  I'd uninstall any in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features, see if it stabilizes, then reinstall after a PC restart to see if it comes back.  
<br />
<br />If you do a Reset you'll need to reinstall your personal apps and programs.  It will save only your files but of course they should be backed up anyway since a hard drive can die at any time and not having your files backed up is reckless. 
<br />
<br />If you want to skip the steps I gave which will most likely find and fix the problem and go directly to the Reset it is here:
<br /><a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-reset-your-pc-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-re...</a>
<br />
<br />There's a chance if the install is corrupted that the Reset may fail, so be prepared to create bootable media to do the Clean Install following the steps I gave above if necessary.  This usually solves all problems because it is the best install of WIndows you can have and nobody who follows the steps I gave ever comes back with another complaint, out of millions who have done by Clean Installs for ten years.

<p>Since I can't even enter either the safe mode or the normal mode to fix things, the clean install and the reset might be the only chance left am I right?</p>

            No internet connection needed.  Use another PC to create media if needed. <br /><br />Make sure to do the deep clean reset or delete all partitions during booted Clean Install to clear the write protection.  This is symptomatic of account corruption.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>launch Windows Virtual PC from Start menu &gt; All Programs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Windows Virtual PC interface looks like a typical Windows Explorer. I already have a virtual machine setup, but if I would like to add another one, I can do so. Lets take a look at doing that. On the command bar, click the ‘Create virtual machine’ button.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will start the Create a virtual machine wizard. In the above wizard page, you can enter details about the Virtual Machine such as its name to help identify it if you have more than one Virtual Machine setup. You can also choose a location where you
 would like to store this virtual machine. In regards to virtual machine, just go with the defaults. Once you have filled in these details, click Next</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on the version and edition of Windows you would like to run, you might need to allocate more memory than the default 512 MBs of RAM. Versions of Windows such as Windows Vista and Windows 7 will need more. This also means, the host system will need
 to have enough memory to run it and the virtual machine at the same time. When it comes to virtual machines, the more memory, the better. Since I am using Windows XP for this article, 512 MBs should be more than enough, but if you plan on running many older
 programs, consider increasing to at least 1 GB (1024 MBs). </p>
<p>Another option is Networking, if you plan on keeping the virtual machine maintained and updated, you will need to have an Internet connection for Windows Updates and obtain any available application updates. This is especially important for protection software
 such as Antivirus utilities in your Virtual Machine. Once you have made the appropriate adjustments, click Next
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next screen provides several options for adding a virtual hard disk which will be used to store and access the operating system. I recommend you go with the default since it will be less complicated and easier to manage since you can run into limitations
 if you create a fixed virtual hard disk and later find out you didn’t create it with enough space. If you already have an existing .VHD file, you can add it and use it. In this particular case, we are creating a new one. After selecting the appropriate options,
 click Create </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go back to the Virtual Machines window, there you will see the virtual machine we just created listed. Its status at the moment is powered down. To install Windows, insert your Windows disc in the disc drive. Select the virtual machine and click Open on
 the command bar. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The virtual machine will boot from the Windows disc and setup will begin loading files, it functions just like you normally would expect on a physical machine. Follow the on screen instructions to install your desired version of Windows. If it does not boot
 from the disc, Click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Windows Virtual PC &gt; Windows Virtual PC. Select Virtual Machine you just created and click Settings on the command bar. Select DVD drive in the Setting window.</p>
<p>If you are installing windows from a CD, select the option 'Access a physical drive' Make sure you select the physical drive where your Windows installation is located.</p>
<p>If you are installing from a .ISO image, select the option and browse to where the image is located.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have setup Windows in Windows Virtual PC you can do some additional task like install the integration components which will make the virtual machine perform better and easily switch between the virtual machine and host operating system along with
 using USB devices. Lets take a look at doing that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the top of the Windows Virtual PC window, click the Tools menu and click Install Integration Components.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click Continue</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
This will start the setup wizard in the virtual operating system. Follow the on screen instructions, if you don’t meet the minimum requirements, you will need to resolve those issues first before continuing. As you can see, Windows Virtual PC requires that
 Windows XP has SP3 installed before it can proceed. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you are finish using the virtual machine, you can shut it down by clicking the close button. You will be prompted for an action, whether you want to put it to sleep, shut it down or turn off the computer. Choose the desired action and click OK.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard shortcut for display profiles</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is it possible to assign a keyboard shortcut to switch between display profiles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>More specifically, let's say I have 2 monitors connected to Windows 10.</p>
<p>In profile 1, the desktop extends over display 1 and display 2.</p>
<p>In profile 2, display 2 mirrors display 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to toggle between both configurations using a keboard shortchut, thus avoiding having to always go back to the "Change Display Settings" dialog. Is it possible?</p>
<p>

            Hi Ze
<br />
<br />In Windows 10 that is usually accessed by pressing Windows Key + P and choose Extend or Duplicate
<br />
<br />You could put a new shortcut on your Desktop (right click your Desktop, choose New - Shortcut) and add the appropriate string in the  location box to perform the switch
<br />
<br />For Duplicate:  
<br />
<br />%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /clone
<br />
<br />For Extend:  
<br />
<br />%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /extend
<br />
<br />For the PC screen only:  
<br />
<br />%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /internal
<br />
<br />For Second screen only:  
<br />
<br />%windir%\System32\DisplaySwitch.exe /external

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>In my original message I presented a simpler scenario than my actual situation, to keep it simple, but ended up oversimplifying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more specific, I have 5 displays connected to the video card. </p>
<p>The video card's driver (NVidia GTX1060) limits the number of active displays to 4 at any given time.</p>
<p>Even though I don't game and only use the PC for 2D work, I haven't found a workaround for this driver limitation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time, display 5 (a projector) is off. But sometimes I need to mirror the output of display 4 to the projector. Since this exceeds the driver's 4 monitor limit, I need to turn one of the other monitors off to enable the projector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, everytime I connect the projector I have to go to "System Settings"&gt;&gt;"Change Display Settings", disable monitor 3, select "mirror monitor 5 on 4". Then after disconnecting the projector, go back to "System Settings"&gt;&gt;"Change Display Settings", disable
 monitor 5, enable monitor 3 again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this be done with keyboard shortcuts?</p>
<p>
</p><p>cheers,</p>
<p>Ze</p>

<h2>            Took apart Xbox controller, now can&#8217;t put it back together. HELLP</h2>
                    <p>This summer, I got bored and decided to change the shell on my Xbox one elite controller from black to white. I watched a few tutorials and read a few forum posts and then I felt ready to go. I followed all the steps and took it apart properly (or so I think) and after putting it back together, it no longer worked. Whenever I pressed the right bumper or left trigger, it would basically keep performing the action that it would have done, even though I let go of the button. Also both thumb sticks are now all wonky and don’t work super well either. I just would like to know if it is repairable or I should trash it and get it replaced. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, it's not possible to merge Xbox LIVE accounts. If you want the achievements and the save on your gold account, you will need to replay the games on the gold account. Save games are tied to the account they were played on, there is no way they can
 be merged.<br />
<br />
Sorry.<br />
<br />

<br />
</strong>Bonjour,<br />
<br />
Je suis désolé, il n'est pas possible de fusionner les comptes Xbox LIVE. Si vous voulez que les réalisations et l'enregistrer sur votre compte d'or, vous aurez besoin de rejouer aux jeux sur le compte d'or. Enregistrer jeux sont liés au compte, ils ont été
 joués sur, il n'ya aucun moyen qu'ils peuvent être fusionnées.<br />

<h2>            Faulty Console Repair &#47; Replacement.</h2>
                    
<p>So, I contact xbox support. My console won't connect with any controllers. Been through all the ways of connecting, plus factory default restore, offline diag thing and tried other people's controllers etc (my controllers work on other consoles).&nbsp;</p>
<p>My xbox is out of warranty, I don't doubt that, but I did first raise the issue in March last year at a time it WAS under warranty. We ended up tolerating it as, I thought at the time, something else of my doing was interfering with the sync setup. Turns
 out that's not the case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's some excerpts from my chat (name removed for privacy)... (some sentences removed as was hour+ chat)</p>

 wasnt dodgy but it was my xbox,i was talked into just sending the sensor off not the xbox also and when returned the issue was still there an my warranty run out at that time so wasnt able to get free repair. Not helpful at all.</p>

    <title>Windows 8 - Some programs will not become visible or maximize from - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p.e.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 - Some programs will not become visible or maximize from taskbar</h2>
                    This is an issue I have run into specifically with Windows 8, which I have just purchased on the weekend.<br />
<br />
After loading my computer, installing computer protection, Office University 365, and a few other programs and apps, I set up my second monitor which is connected using regular VGA to my laptop. I was using my computer to check on my stocks using the installed
 software to connect to my broker and my personal account and closed it properly when I was finished. I use the second monitor while I am at home as the second monitor is much bigger than the 13 inch screen of my desktop and charts are easier to read.<br />
<br />
During the daytime, I tried to re-open the software package to check something with my stocks again and I sat and waited for what I thougt to be the software loading. Unfortunately it was that the program was loaded, blinks as if it is about to open up on my
 desktop, but then remains hidden and open in the taskbar.<br />
<br />
Solutions I have tried:<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-performance/windows-8-program-immediately-minimizes-itself/134c6586-e6b4-490b-955f-7c6c3d9513b8<br />
<br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-windows_install/windows-8-task-bar-has-icons-that-do-not-maximise/33297be0-71e3-48e9-9dfd-42d3531bafb0<br />
<br />
1. Using the desktop icon to have the program Maximized when opened.<br />
2. alt+tab, alt+space, windows+d etc. <br />
3. opening the program while my computer security program is not functional<br />
4. opening the progam in safe mode<br />
5. uninstalling the software COMPLETELY including registry and folders info (Revo-Uniinstaller used), then re-installing the software and placed another desktop icon with the program settings to open the program Maximized completely.<br />
6. Deleting the registry components for the software then re-opening and thus forcing the program to create a new but clean registry key<br />
7. Changing the permissions of the software to open as Administrator everytime no matter what.<br />
8. Changed the computer security, including Windows security, to recognize the program as Trusted and safe and not prevent it from doing anything at all<br />
9. Reverted back to a saved copy of a working Windows 8 from before. (***The only thing that fixed the issue for a temporary time)<br />
<br />
I have figured out that in fact what the issue really is, is that when I was using a second monitor and using the software to be viewed using the second monitor, it opened up while under only the laptop attached screen and thus was 'stuck' on the now non-existent
 second screen. So if I have the program opened on my second screen and eventually unplug the laptop and take it to another place without the second screen, then re-open the program, it gets caught on the second screen, but without a second screen to use the
 program. THE ONLY SOLUTION FOUND so far is to travel all the way back home, plug in my second screen again, then the program is visible and useable again. PLUS, when I move the program to the laptop built in screen again, then close the program, and then re-open
 the program later on in the day again, the program is freely available for use on the laptop screen! So this shows that the program is simply 'stuck' within the bounds of the second monitor. I noticed this issue when I was unplugging the laptop to lay down
 and work on some things on the couch, but the program was 'stuck' on the second screen, but completely useless and un-useable to me. When plugged back in, the program is then visible on the second screen again, and then moved to the laptop screen, it is perfectly
 fine and works.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 does not automatically recognize that a secondary screen has been unplugged, and thus is NOT FORCED TO MOVE ALL OPENED PROGRAMS laying within the second screens desktop to the 1st screen. The desktop and taskbar being available to the second screen
 is a big step up from any other versions of windows, but if the OS cannot even recognize that the programs must now use the 1st screen only and thus remain open on the 1st screen only, instead of being 'lost' on the non-existent second screen, then how are
 users or mobile devices supposed to rely on Windows?? Seems like an easy fix and would prevent a LOT of time, money and hardship on users if this issue what properly fixed without the user having to go through everything I have already and continue to have
 to go through all the time.<br />
<br />
THERE WERE NO WORKAROUNDS AT ALL FOUND over the the course of about 20 hours of loading, re-loading, uninstalling, re-installing, changing settings, reading forums, attempting to contact technicians and then some. I am starting to think that my purchase of
 windows again after using Linux for years was as mistake. THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR THE TIME BEING IS TO PLUG IN A SECOND MONITOR AND TO SWITCH THE PROGRAM BACK TO THE FIRST PROGRAM, THEN UNPLUG THE SECOND MONITOR, in order to be able to use the 'lost' program.<br />
<br />
So is there a real solution to this real issue??<br />

            I am having this same issue as I sometimes use a second monitor for presentations at work. A few of my programs--it appears to be only those I've used on the second monitor--are now "lost" on my laptop. I have to minimize all open windows and then click
 on the program icon in the taskbar to have the "lost" program maximize.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I will try to solution suggest by the OP: "THE ONLY SOLUTION FOR THE TIME BEING IS TO PLUG IN A SECOND MONITOR AND TO SWITCH THE PROGRAM BACK TO THE FIRST PROGRAM, THEN UNPLUG THE SECOND MONITOR, in order to be able to use the 'lost' program."<br />

            <p>Been having same issue on a Windows 7 laptop for almost a month! It's with a Home Solar Panel monitoring program which connects via a USB cable and downloads energy used and energy generated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was really interesting was I could see the graph getting updated in the thumbnail preview from the task bar, so I knew the program was functioning - really frustrating!&nbsp; Was a year long, ongoing data collection project, and didn't want to lose the data!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having reinstalled and tried everything above, tried to <strong>use the Windows Key and Tab Key combination</strong> which scrolls through all running applications, and voila!
<strong>It appeared! :-) </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Much better solution than the idea of doing a system refresh - what a laugh!&nbsp; It would take me weeks to install and reconfigure my machine... I use my machine to work, and don't have the time to sit and reinstall, wouldn't get paid for it and the kids I
 teach wouldn't get taught!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft need to understand what happens in the real word.</p>

            <p>I agree. &nbsp;I am not interested in having to Refresh my machine when this happens because that is not a permanent fix in my eyes. &nbsp;And it is a serious problem. &nbsp;There has to be a good reasonable fix that doesn't involve doing some sort of restore every time
 it happens. &nbsp;Microsoft update maybe? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have experienced this on a Sony Vaio Pro and a Surface Pro 3 in my office. &nbsp;Does anyone from Microsoft have a real solution?</p>

            I found the very same issue yesterday while trying to use a program that has no scalable window, so cannot be "maximised" at all and yes: I too had to connect a second monitor to drag the screen back to my laptop's screen. In my case it was due to doing
 a presentation and dragging the the window from my laptop to the beamer and then closing the program there. I wonder if this is due to ill programming by Microsoft or by ill programming by the creator of the program. At least SOMEONE should be able to sort
 this out and come up with the right answer. In my case the Windows version is Vista, so the problem exists for a very long time already. Oh and: Vista does not have that nice thumbnail preview...<br />

<p>Horace, I just spent at least an hour trying to figure this out, and I had nearly given up when I ran into your post. (Whew!) The sad thing is that I know this has happened to me before, but it was years ago, and I couldn't remember the magic key sequence.
 This time I've written it down. Of course, by the next time it happens I won't remember where I wrote it down. (Sigh.) Thanks so much for your timely note!<br />

            Horace,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the solution! I am currently using dual monitors and this issue has been plaguing me for quite a while.<br />
<br />
Do you know why this is happening? When I move the program to the top of the screen to maximize it, it becomes invisible. I have no idea why anyone would ever want to do this when they attempt to maximize the screen. Is this a bug??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

Wes

Search settings for Camera does not show me what I would expect.&nbsp; Actually I don't know where to find what it would be trying to show me...&nbsp; Perhaps this one?&nbsp;&nbsp; ms-settings:privacy-camera&nbsp; which doesn't work but others
 do using that pattern.&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; Looks like the label should be Webcam instead.&nbsp; ms-settings:privacy-webcam&nbsp; works.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a search for Webcam supposedly leads us to Device Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;And I finally found what that would be referring to under Imaging devices, where
 mine are apparently called LifeCam--who knew?&nbsp; Also with those it looks like something is missing because with Properties Events I see an Information message for each device indicating "requires further installation".&nbsp; WTH does that mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do we use the cameras anyway?&nbsp;All Windows Search shows is "Trusted Windows Store app".&nbsp; Ok.&nbsp; That's there and it works.&nbsp; What's wrong?&nbsp; In its Settings under Press and hold camera button (WTH is that?) there is a Disabled option.&nbsp; That would probably
 explain your symptom.</p>

</p><p>Finding that was an adventure too with BING.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tried first to search with</p>
<p>
</p><p>camera&nbsp; site:apps.microsoft.com&nbsp; loc:us</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last term was obviously ignored because I got anything but en-US in hits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then tried BING's suggestion</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download Camera windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>which did find it?&nbsp; I was looking for Help not a Download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the links in that Download page (on the Store) are just generic.&nbsp; So still no help for Camera.</p>

            <p>I just tried to simulate something like that by disabling both cameras and got a "Something went wrong" message.&nbsp; See if disabling both does the same for you.&nbsp; If you're lucky toggling them back on may fix something that would be due to just the devices.&nbsp;
 Am still seeing that "requires further installation" mystery message.&nbsp;&nbsp;In fact, it looks like in my case it is only the Rear camera which needs to be re-enabled.&nbsp; I don't know how to pick the other one.&nbsp; Where's the Help (again)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

</p><p>You may try to go the Device Manager, uninstall the camera driver then restart the device. After restarting the Surface the driver should be installed by Windows update.<br />

            I think the problem (or at least my problem)&nbsp;is the app not the camera itself.&nbsp; The camera still runs if I ask OneNote to insert a video recording, for example.&nbsp; The app om teh start screen seems to be corrupted - it has no icon and won't initiate/start
 the camera.

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a student and I am using my Surface Pro 3 for video recording of lectures. As the lecturers are using projector screens for the presentation slides in a dim lighted room, the exposure for the camera has to be turn down to be able to see the contents
 of the slides on the screen in video recording with the built in front camera. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since Windows 10 upgrade, the exposure setting for the camera could not be found in the default camera software. I am pretty sure that before the upgrade it is possible to adjust the exposure to be able to see the contents on the projector screen when
 video recording. Is there any where this setting could be hidden at? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            SC should learn his facts before assuming he's a big nose. Google, dual boot on macs and keep your lack of knowledge to yourself. Cheers Noob. Still no change after updating drivers. Got W10 on a crappy intel celeron but not on a Intel Xeon. It doesn't
 make sense

<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2, with Windows 10.</h2>
                    Just installed Windows 10, and now my Microsoft Wireless Optical Desktop 700 v2 &nbsp;keyboard does not work. Windows tells me there is no driver for it, cannot find a driver for it, and perhaps the problem is that the device is designed to run on Win 95! Contact

            <p>Thank you, but the problem now seems clearly that Microsoft do not have an updated driver for their product! No searches i have made show me such an option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone from Microsoft know what the firm is doing about this? Do we all have to throw away our Microsoft keyboards and buy another brand??</p>
<p>A real puzzle.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi cvs334, would you unplug the ethernet cable from all these devices "network box, the hubs, the wireless router, the DSL modem and the win 2k3 box" then unplug the power cord for each. Then after about 60 seconds, connect the DSL modem power cord wait
 for sink. Next connect the router power after sink connect the router to the modem, then connect hub and the other devices. This will allow the router to re-address the automatic DNS from the modem. The router maybe failing or the LAN port on the router could
 be failing.<br />

            <p>Hello LD,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This usually means that the Bluetooth device driver is not installed or it’s out of date or even not compatible with Windows 7. You need to install the latest device driver or if the device is a Windows mobile device you can install the Windows Mobile Device
 Center to fix the issue. There is a KB article that gives more info on the issue and helps to fix it, see:</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to corrupt display driver or if BIOS is not up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>uninstall and reinstall display driver </strong>
and check. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>together and click <strong>device manager.</strong><br />
b. Click to expand <strong>display adapters.</strong><br />
c. Right click the adapter and click <strong>uninstall.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to restart the computer afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you may <strong>reinstall the latest display driver from the computer manufacturer's website.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer this article:<br />
<strong>Download and install drivers</strong><br />

(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please also <strong>update BIOS from the manufacturer's website and check the issue.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
