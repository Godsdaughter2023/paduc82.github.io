<h2>            Windows 7 Product Key Activation</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7 Professional says today that my product key has expired, and asks for a product key. I am using a laptop and this Windows was already installed on it by the manufacturer(HP). I found out the product key which my Windows was using till now and
 typed it into the Windows Activation Client, but it says:</p>

<h2>            Video playback in Windows Media Center is slow and laggy.</h2>
                    Video playback is laggy, I just bought a DELL Inspiron Laptop with an I7 cpu, 8 GB RAM and Windows experience index rating of 5.9. When I watch video on Media Center, playback is laggy, audio is fine. Tried in Media Player, same problem though not as bad,

            There was no need to install DirectX as&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 7 supports DirectX 11.And I am sure the graphic card installed in your system must be a directx11 compliant.<br />
I asked about other media player so that I could have a possible idea regarding the problem you are facing.(decoder).<br />
I shall suggest you to reset WMC.<br />
<br />
Run Setup Again.<br />
<br />
Open WMC &gt; Tasks &gt; Settings &gt; General &gt; Windows Media Center Setup &gt; Run Setup Again<br />
<br />
Does it help?<br />
<br />
If the above doesn't help then try resetting WMC:-<br />
<br />
Open Control Panel &gt; Uninstall a Program &gt; Turn Windows Features on or off &gt; Scroll down to Media Features &gt; Uncheck the box against Windows Media Center &gt; Follow on screen instructions &gt; Reboot &gt; Again open Turn Windows Features on or off under Control Panel
 &gt; Scroll down to Media Features &gt; Check the box against Windows Media Center.<br />
<br />
Now reconfigure WMC again<br />

<br />
When there is a choppy playback look at the CPU usage.<br />
<br />
If the problem still persists then contact DELL support as your laptop is a brand new one and must be under the warranty.<br />

<h3> tonybouttell  say:</h3>
<h2>            word 2010 mail merge has an issue when printing double sided</h2>
                    <p>I have a seven page document.</p>
<p>When I use Mail merge to print it, I usually have 70 or more copies.</p>
<p>Printing double-sided, is resulting in page one being printed on the back of page seven, from the previous copy.</p>
<p>I have a macro that corrects this problem. But this is not really satisfactory, as anyone who wishes to run this particular mail merge also needs this macro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original document has written is word 97/2003 but was converted to word 2010. Is this relevant?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>This was my solution.</p>
<p>But it is unsatisfying. As was my macro solution.</p>
<p>The problem with the blank page, is that if the page numbers are variable, (lets say i included a table that grows or shrinks). I would constantly need to add or remove bkank pages.</p>
<p>The printer in question, is a Xerox 550.</p>

    <title>How to know which Windows 10 version a Windows 10 ISO file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to know which Windows 10 version a Windows 10 ISO file includes&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I have downloaded many Windows 10 ISO files by the MediaCreationTool<br />
<br />
While using Media Creation Tool to download Windows 10 ISO file,&nbsp; I see the file name given automatically to the ISO file is named wtih only 'Windows'. So, over time,&nbsp; I don't remember which Windows version this ISO file includes.<br />
As long as Media Creation Tool can be updated over time, Media Creation Tool 1709, Media Creation Tool 1803, etc, then I think Windows ISO file can be named with the version it includes. As a result, I can still remember&nbsp; which Windows 10 version a Windows
 10 ISO file includes.</p>
<p>So, if I have earlier Windows ISO files, then I will delete them to get free space of my storage since I'll&nbsp; no longer need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at this screen shot, and you'll see that this ISO file which was downloaded two years ago, and it was named with only "Windows". However, I don't still remember which Windows 10 version this Windows 10 ISO file includes.</p>

<h2>            Used friends copy of Win10 for fresh install, it wont accept my valid serial key</h2>
                    Ok here we go, I bought Windows 8.1 a few years back and upgraded to Windows 10. I ended up with some sort of failure in windows which required a wipe and reinstall. In order to save time (or so I thought) I borrowed a Win10 bootable DVD from a friend.
 Come to find out it was for Windows 10 Pro. I had Windows 10 Home Edition. Therefor my key will not work. Is there any way around this? Besides having to re download another version of Windows 10?

            Hi Josh.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it was Home we could help you change to Pro.  But you can't change backwards. 
<br />
<br />So create the bootable media for you version by installing Media Creation Tool here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then  follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Sorry Josh, you will have to reinstall Windows 10 Home for your Product Key to work.
<br />
<br />Does your friends DVD contain just Windows 10 Pro, generally Windows 10 media contains Windows 10 Home, Pro and the Single Language version. 
<br />
<br />Then when installing, you can choose which version to install from a drop down box on the first or second screen

<p>After using my Dell which is running Windows 10 as an upgrade from Win 8.1:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Went to shut down computer, chose the "shut down after downloading update package".</li><li>Next AM turned on computer... message "installing updates" or some such, do not turn off.</li><li>Checked after 2-3 hours and it's at 42%.</li><li>Went to other computer, did other things, came back 4 hours later, machine had shut down.</li><li>Turned on machine.</li><li>Light gray screen made of vertical gray lines and tiny horizontal spots of blue, red, yellow.</li></ul>
<p>Nothing I tried could make this disappear.</p>
<p>

            Hi Willie.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update.  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Willie, Press and hold the Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down.
<br />
<br />Start your System, it should boot to the desktop, this problem should reappear when your system Sleeps . . .
<br />
<br />Your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver

<h2>            Getting blue screen of death with error 0xc000021a</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Win 8.1 upgraded automatically and rebooted, now I have blue screen of death with error 0xc000021a, how can I get windows to load?</p>
<p>
</p><p>hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i searched the forum briefly and couldn't find my issue.&nbsp; i'm not a techie. i have a toshiba satellite C55-A, about 1.5 - 2 years old with win 8.&nbsp; yesterday windows automatically updated to win 8.1, i think, which required a reboot.&nbsp; Only it wouldn't reboot.&nbsp;
 I get the error message 0xc000021a.&nbsp; I don't even know what my machine is running, but I believe it's 8.1 because one of the troubleshooting methods said I would have to reinstall Windows 8.1:&nbsp; it brought me to "Refresh Your PC" (i didn't go through with the
 refresh) and it said my personal files won't change, </p>
<p>
</p><p>"And your PC settings will be changed back to their defaults.&nbsp; Here's what you'll need to do afterwards:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the Windows Store to reinstall Windoes 8.1 and your apps...</p>
<p>Reinstall your other apps from discs and websites.</p>
<p>Use Windows UPdate to reinstall all updates."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried various troubleshooting for the past 6 hours, a slow process for me since I'm not technically savvy, it won't boot to safe mode using f8 or the method within the BSOD.&nbsp; automatic repair wouldn't work, it indicated there exists a log file C:\WINDOWS\System32\Logfiles\Srt\SrtTrail.txt.&nbsp;
 I tried various advanced options offered.&nbsp; none worked.&nbsp; I tried a fix described here http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-system/windows-8-pro-cannot-boot-error-0xc000021a/ebf26ca7-e594-4c56-bbe0-cca43dfe5978?page=5, and detailed below,
 but it didn't work for me either.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend said the hard drive needs to be removed and copied to an external drive, to save my data.&nbsp; Provided i can get that done through friends instead of taking $100s of dollars and weeks of time, what do i do then?&nbsp; Try to re-install win 8.1 somehow
 on this machine, and then copy my data back to it?&nbsp; I think this it folks, this last problem is going to push me over the edge and make me move to Macs, which I'm typing on right now.&nbsp; I've held back through the decades of issues with MS operating system upgrades
 and updates, because of my extreme use of MS Outlook to manage many details of my business for the past 20 years, and the fear that i won't be able to access all my outlook data properly from a mac.&nbsp; But I think I'm willing to take the risk now.&nbsp; I can't take
 this b.s. any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any help.&nbsp; the details of one of the&nbsp; many fixes i tried is listed below.:

<p>Hello All</p>
<p>
</p><p>There hasn't been a fix for this issue it appears in this topic, I'm sorry if someone already provided you with this tip, but have you all tried to remove any pending update on your system with DISM.exe? This issue seems to be caused by an update which cannot
 be applied upon the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have access to the CMD Console then try to execute the following steps:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">DISM /image:C\ /cleanup-image /revertpendingactions</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">After that rename the file Pending.xml in the Windows\WinSxS folder to pending.old and try to boot your system again. (More detailed explanation for non advanced users:&nbsp;<a href="http://windowsinstructed.com/0xc000021a-pc-ran-into-problem-and-needs-to-restart/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span>It has been helpful for some people i&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">advised</span><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;this, for some it did not work, I hope it&nbsp;</span></span>at
 least<span><span>&nbsp;helps some&nbsp;of&nbsp;you, and I'm sorry if someone else already asked you all to try this.</span></span></span><br />

            <p>hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer you question, I have a Toshiba Satellite C55-A5311 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My IT friend tried to restore my machine to a different restore point.&nbsp; Didn't work.&nbsp; He thinks I need to re-install Windows.&nbsp; I don't have
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your instructions on creating installation media, must this be done on a Windows machine?&nbsp; I don't have another Windows machine.&nbsp; I'm writing right now on my husband's Macbook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>carmen</p>

            <p>here's an update.&nbsp; I just got off tech support via telephone with Toshiba.&nbsp; they were unable to access the hidden partition and restore windows.&nbsp; Contrary to your suggestion, Ashish, Toshiba will NOT provide a product key.&nbsp; They told me your suggestion of
 creating a Windows 8.1 installation media won't work, that they cannot access the hidden partition, thus the product key won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore wouldn't work.&nbsp; We tried several steps with Toshiba support.&nbsp; Nothing worked.&nbsp; They say I have to reinstall the OS, and they will send me recover media, of exactly what was included on my machine when I purchased it new September 2013, but
 it will take 7-10 days shipping and cost $39.95.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like MS should provide me the OS and MS Office (all included on my machine when i bought it) installation media and/or product key.&nbsp; I already bought it when i bought the machine.&nbsp; Can't MS provide it to me?&nbsp; In the old days the OS installation CDs
 or DVDs came along with the purchase of the machine.&nbsp; I don't want to have to pay for it again, and most importantly, I don't want to wait another 10 days.&nbsp; I've already been without my machine for 6 days.</p>
<p>

            <p>microsoft phone support, even after escalating to supervisors and the next level, indicated they would not help me.&nbsp; so i had to order he $40 drive from toshiba, essentially paying for windows 8 which i already paid for when i bought it pre-installed on
 my laptop 18 months ago.&nbsp; now i've got to figure out how to restore all my settings after i copy them over from my backup on an external drive.<br />
</p>
<p>and i don't know how to do that. wish me luck.</p>

<h2>            Windows cant find rsop.msc</h2>
                    I'm having the "Windows is not genuine" problem. I've received an answer (not sure how to post on my original thread) and they told me to go to start, run and type in "rsop.msc". When I do this I get the response: Windows can not find rsop.msc. Make sure
 you typed the name correctly and try again.<br />
<br />
I did type it correctly but windows cant find rsop.msc......<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.....<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Ads normally appear with ad-supported apps or free apps from Windows Store. If you are experiencing issues loading those ads before playing the game, it could possibly be
 due to a server connection error or a corrupted cache.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern, you can perform the following solutions on your computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 1</span></strong><span>. Perform a clean boot to start Windows by using a minimal set
 of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10. You can go to this
</span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">link
</span></a></span><span>and follow the steps perform a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 2.</span></strong><span> Reset the game from the Settings menu. This process can help
 restore corrupted game installation files.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>
Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
System</strong>, and then select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Find the game, and then click on
<strong>Advanced</strong> options.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Reset</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Solution 3</span></strong><span>. Remove temporary files.</span></p>
<p><span>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't
 delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>
Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
System</strong>, and then select <strong>Storage</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
This PC</strong> and click on <strong>Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>
Temporary files</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
Remove files</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested solutions above.</span></p>

<p>What antimalware program are you using?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The upgrade to IE-10 is probably coincidental. &nbsp;Never heard of infections being spread from a Microsoft download site.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your PC is<b>&nbsp;probably&nbsp;</b>infected with the newest variant of Sirefef AKA Zero Access. &nbsp;One of the symptoms is that downloads are (falsely) identified as being a virus...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Win32%2FSirefef" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Win32%2FSirefef</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The easiest solution is use HitmanPro Kickstart which should remove this malware and repair the changes made to the computer by the malware:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.surfright.nl/en/kickstart</span></a>&nbsp;
 &nbsp; You must use an uninfected computer to download it to a flash drive and then follow the specific directions on how to run the program on the infected computer. &nbsp;Hitman Pro Kickstart is available as a 30 day trial version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks, Le Boule. I'll give it a try. I downloaded Windows 8 several months ago, and the same thing started happening - couldn't download anything. So, I got rid of it, which solved the problem. I really don't want to get rid of Internet Explorer to solve
 the problem. I hope your suggestion works. &nbsp;

            This is only meant as a suggestion/opinion: there are a lot of other browsers around. Having a Windows Operating System DOES NOT mean that one HAS to use Internet Explorer.&nbsp; No, most people are using different browsers....<br />
Why do I say that? Because I see that "THE normal user" is experiencing disasterous problems caused by faulty Internet Explorer releases.<br />
<br />
Searching the internet for opinions and advices on this topic might be interesting....<br />

Did you run Hitman Pro Kickstart to determine whether your computer was infected?
<div><br />
<div>I suggest you review the following:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_other-protect_scanning/update-and-opening-attachments/df777772-298b-4442-a11f-8b04d88e12fc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_other-protect_scanning/update-and-opening-attachments/df777772-298b-4442-a11f-8b04d88e12fc</a></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>But if Hitman Pro Kickstart does not identify Sirefef/ZeroAccess malware then you may be seeing a similar issue with IE-10 as is being reported here with IE-11:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-windows_7/new-virus-for-internet-explorer-11/827d8926-08e6-411d-a9d1-6661d168ac2f">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-windows_7/new-virus-for-internet-explorer-11/827d8926-08e6-411d-a9d1-6661d168ac2f</a></div>

    <title>Folder Renaming Freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> icecubebeast  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder Renaming Freeze</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I create a folder and name it or when I rename an existing folder, the windows explorer page freezes and the folder won't change its name (the text box doesn't go away and no action occurs). Then, after waiting for a minute, the folder is either
 renamed or I have to exit the browser since the folder won't be renamed and crashes. This shouldn't happen since I have used windows xp, 7, and 8 and they didn't ever have this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this issue? Whenever I'm organizing my files, it can detract 15 minutes of my time just because of this issue. This is pretty annoying along with the other bugs that windows 10 has.</p>
<p>

<strong>Bruce Nesmith</strong></span>; and <span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lead artist</span></span>,
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)"><strong>Matt Carofano</strong></span> we now have a lot more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Will the character be able to change into certain creatures?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;We’ve done various things like that in our previous games, and it’s something that we probably won’t be talking about specifically on this one. Don’t read anything into that, we just prefer to not discuss this one. We’d like to leave
 that an open question until the game is out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What sorts of cosmetic options, like beards, tattoos, or body proportions, are available? Can we edit them later in the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;There is a large amount of customization available for each race. You can choose from multiple hair styles, beards, scars, and face paint. Each race and gender has a light and heavy build and you can pick any level in between. We’ve
 completely redone our facial system, and we’re really excited to show off the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is armor handled like in Oblivion (with each body part being welded together) or in Morrowind (with each body part separate)? Will you be able to wear both clothes and armor at the same time?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;The armor system is very similar to Oblivion’s. The main difference is that the upper and lower body armors, the cuirass and greaves, have been combined into one piece. This helps create armor styles that have the look we needed for
 Skyrim. In most of the Nordic designs we created, the upper armor would completely cover the lower armor, making it unnecessary. We get much better visual results combining those pieces, and it renders a lot faster too, so we can put more people on-screen,
 so that was an easy tradeoff for us. We can also make a lot more armors now, so the number and variation types are more than we’ve ever had.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are the main and faction quests branching or linear? What about side quests?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;We’ve focused on telling one story well. There are decision points in all the quest lines that can change things, but overall it’s a single story. Because the side quests are smaller stories, they are more likely to have major branches.
 For example, you can decide to save or betray someone, which changes the whole end of the quest. Overall the quest structure in Skyrim is closer to Oblivion than Fallout 3, in that there are many more quests, but they have fewer branches.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are loot and quest rewards level scaled, like in Oblivion? Will there be any powerful un-scaled items?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;We’re handling leveling stuff similar to how we did in Fallout 3, but with a few new twists that we hope players won’t even notice. The enemies and loot are based on the “encounter zone” you’re in, so it could be higher or lower level
 than your current level. We do have a new concept of epic or “special” loot that you can randomly find in many cases, regardless of the zone, and you will still get better stuff in the better zones with your level higher. Same goes for quest rewards. We try
 to make them appropriate for what you did. Sometimes that is random, sometimes that is a set item. There’s a lot of specific stuff that is very powerful, like the Daedric artifacts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will items present in Morrowind but not in Oblivion, such as spears, medium armor, and mark/recall spells, be making a return?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;They are not in Skyrim for the same reasons we didn’t include them in Oblivion. I’ll address each one. First spears, the truth is we’d love to do them, but it becomes a priority and development time thing for us. We feel it’s better
 to spend our time right now making sure the gameplay for the other play styles is really solid. That includes sword, sword and shield, two-handed weapons, and bows. You can also add magic to that list. Getting those all working well together, while feeling
 different, is our priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as medium armor, that’s not a time or polish thing, it’s a design choice to focus on two armor types and making sure those feel different and the player appreciates them. We try to make your character move and feel different between light and heavy
 and having a 3rd one in the middle just muddies it up in how it plays, as well as visually. And even now, we still have to tweak those two armor types so they feel different, while remaining fun. Every time we slow down heavy armor more, it feels bad, but
 it’s the main way of balancing it. We’ve added other ways of balancing it that feel right-like different stamina drain rates when sprinting and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark and recall is one where it’s a lot of fun, but like levitation, was removed so we could design better gameplay spaces and scenarios. We were really limited in Morrowind because the player could recall or levitate out of many situations and break them.
 There was a lot of good gameplay and level design work that we just couldn’t do and now we can. Back then it seemed like many good ideas we had were shot down when another designer would say “oh yeah, I just levitate or recall away.” So we got rid of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Will we be able to have relationships with the NPCs, romantic or otherwise?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely! You make friends with people by doing things for them. Friends in the game will treat you differently. Some of them will even agree to go with you into dungeons and on adventures. You can even get married. If you own a
 house, your spouse will move in with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Are there any new armor/weapon materials unique to Skyrim?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;One of the most prized and rarest sets of armor is made from dragons. It can be forged in both a light and heavy variant. You’ll see a return of many armors from previous games, such as leather and steel, however these have been redesigned
 in the Nordic style.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can we have some specifics about the PC version of the game? How will its UI be different? Will there be a 64-bit executable?</strong></p>
<p>Todd: 64-bit specific exe? Not at this time. As far as UI, it visually looks the same across the platforms, but the controls are entirely different. There’s also a lot of “power user” stuff we do with the keyboard from how favorites work, to quick saves,
 and more that is similar to what we’ve done before in that area. We’re packing a lot of info on the screen and the whole interface is much less ‘look at giant fonts!’ than, say, Oblivion. The PC version also gets higher res textures, larger render modes, and
 a bunch of other effects you can scale up if your machine is a beast. Last but most important, is the Creation Kit we’ll be releasing for the PC. Modding the game and making it your own is very important to us and our fans, so we’re going to keep doing whatever
 we can in that area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How will enchanting work in Skyrim? Will we have to constantly refill our enchantments with soul gems like we did in Oblivion, or will it be more like Morrowind in which the weapons recovered after a certain resting period?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;The method in Oblivion worked really well, so we kept it. Magic weapons use charges and have to be refilled with soul gems. Magic armor is always on and doesn’t need to be recharged. Soul gems and their lore and usage are a staple
 of the Elder Scrolls.</p>
<p>We have revamped the enchanting system though. Enchanting is now a skill. The better your skill and perks, the better you are at creating enchanted items. You’ll be able to find enchanting stations all over the world, which will make it much more accessible.</p>
<p>There are some changes from Oblivion, including the effects you can use when creating items, as well as how you learn effects. You now learn enchanting effects by “breaking down” a magic item you find, as opposed to them coming from spells you know. This
 allows us to separate enchanting from the other magical skills better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are the differences between the races? I guess they’ll have different skill bonuses, but will they also start with different perks or have different “hard-coded” attributes, such as different running speeds or maximum encumbrance, etc.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;They each start with some skills that are higher by default, but those aren’t hard to overcome with another race in a short time. They also have different starting spells and each has its own passive abilities, like before, as well
 as powers, like before. So Khajiit can see in the dark, Orcs have a berserk power, Redguards have Adrenaline Rush, and so forth. They work differently in the new system, but the flavor is the same. We kept all the racial movement speeds the same, that’s now
 a factor of what you’re wearing and have equipped. And starting max encumbrance is the same and is based on your Stamina attribute.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is there any game content (story, quests) that might be locked for a character based on race/faction/politics allegiances/morality/choices? Or one can experience all the content in one single play?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;We do have some stuff that gets locked out based on decisions you make. It’s wherever it felt natural. It wasn’t a goal that you could or couldn’t play everything with one character. The game’s honestly so big that we don’t think about
 it much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>To what extent will our racial / gender selection at the start of the game affect our gameplay? Are there relationships affected by these choices?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;Your race is very important. It’s more than just how you look. Each race has a bias toward certain types of characters. If you want play a wizard, it will be easier with a High Elf or a Breton. If you want to play a warrior, it will
 be easier with a Nord or a Redguard. However, just like in Oblivion, we don’t force you to follow that bias. If you want to be a Nord wizard, that’s completely viable.</p>
<p>Gender does not change any initial skills or abilities. There is nothing that men do better than women or vice versa in the game. Other characters will recognize your gender and address you properly. Some may have prejudices for or against a particular gender
 as a part of their character, but it won’t change what you can or can’t do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to include non lethal ways of defeating opponents?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;Depends on what you mean by “defeat”. We have various stealthy ways of getting past people, and the various poisons and spells allow you to basically render enemies harmless to you, whether that is casting a calm or fear spell, knocking
 them down, or something else. Oh, and we now have tavern brawls that are non-lethal! I love those.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will boss fights involve interesting mechanics involved as opposed to just more health and hits harder?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;We have many new combat behaviors in our AI that makes fights with certain enemies very dynamic and interesting. It matters what the enemy can do. Dragons, for example, can do a lot of things from multiple shouts, bombing runs, picking
 guys up, and more. An enemy that has a sword and shield, a bow, magic spells, and potions will use all of those things, and those fights are the most interesting. But we also design some combat encounters where the player simply may get mobbed by more simple
 enemies, and those have a different pace and strategy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Do companions have skill and perk trees we can train?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;No, you only manage your own. Though companions often have certain perks so they behave different or better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Is the culture in Skyrim strictly Nordic, or are there places (like Cheydinhal in Cyrodiil) that show influence from other cultures nearby, like architecture, religion, etc</strong>?</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;While there are pockets of other races in the game, we focused on the Nordic culture and their regional differences. The architecture between cities is dramatically different and reflects how the Nords live in that area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So, the dragons are big and powerful. Did you include some destructible environment so they could leave marks and scars everywhere they attack? Can they demolish buildings, break trees, start avalanches, burn houses, things like this that emphasize
 their power?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;They do leave marks and scars everywhere, but as far as destroying buildings and such, it’s rare. It does happen, but not a lot. Systemically destroying our spaces is something we have not found a good way to handle yet, because it’s
 so dynamic. We’re dealing with places that we have NPCs living, and providing quests and other game services. It’s something we avoid in every game unless we can specifically wipe it off the map, like Megaton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any difference between the animation sets of male and female as well as human-like and ‘beast’ characters?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong>&nbsp;The animation system is completely new and dramatically improved. You will notice huge difference from previous games. There are differences between male and female animations, and even beast races have some specific animations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will any sort of karma system be incorporated like there was in Fallout, or will it be the Fame/Infamy system of Oblivion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;We don’t provide a numeric score that you can track, but the game knows if you’ve been naughty or nice. We felt that a number really didn’t do your fame justice. Characters in the world will acknowledge the specific things you have
 done rather than just a generalized reputation. If you are a criminal, they’ll know that too. But if you pay your debt to society, all is forgiven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will crafting (weapons, armor) be effected by the tools you use as well as the ingredients used in the crafting? Such as the hammers and clippers, mastery level of the weapons and your level? Basically, will I be able to produce a more powerful,
 or even unique, weapon if I use a master hammer or clipper as opposed to novice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bruce:</strong>&nbsp;The blacksmith’s shop includes a forge, a grindstone, and a smithing bench. You can improve your weapons at the grindstone. The higher your skill, the more you can improve them, and the more damage they’ll do. Same thing for armor
 with the smithing bench, only the armor rating gets better. The forge is actually used to create new weapons and armor from raw materials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will your character have a voice? So that you can hear yourself having a conversation with other people?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;You do have a voice, but you only hear it in grunts and shouts. So we have recorded for each race and *** you can play, all the different combat grunts, as well as the dragon language shouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Obviously every character is “Dragonborn”, but not every character will be playing the same way. The question is: Will dragon shouts support all types of characters? Are there long ranged shouts? Some kind of stealthy “shout”?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, the shouts support all character types. We’re not ready to talk about the other shouts yet, but soon enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Are there going to be places where you can use nature to your advantage? Like make a trap out of a falling tree or climb a tree to stealth attack an enemy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong>&nbsp;Yes and no. You can’t make things, but our environment is so dense, you’re almost always using the natural terrain to get an advantage, especially with stealth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Will you be able to carry on after the main story?</strong></p>
<p>Todd: Yes, absolutely.</p>

<p>yes, it really is, but i'm excited to see and play with the new armor sets so i can maximize my Nordic role-playing.</p>

<p>hopefully there'll be some joke or Easter egg weapon and armor sets, specifically thor's armor, considering the region and culture. maybe a big crater somewhere with a unique hammer in the center.</p>

<p>YAY you can get married! &lt;3 I've always wanted that in oblivion/fallout</p>
<p>That lovely vague answer leads me to believe that you can become a werewolf, which is awesome! I just hope it's a more wolf-like werewolf like in morrowind and not the hollywood bipedal&nbsp;man-beast werewolf.&nbsp;Running around like a regular wolf on all fours
 in morrowind was fun.</p>
<p>I'm also glad that different sexes/races have different animations and whatnot. It always bothered me how an orc moved with the same amount of grace as a high elf, and that khajiit. On a random note, why do female argonians have boobs? What would a lizard
 need boobs for? On that note shouldn't khajiit women have alot of boobs? like 4-12. More to love..Mmm................. :p</p>

<blockquote>I added a new user account.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft word and other programs that were installed on the main user account are not showing up on the new user account</blockquote>
<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>There is no easy answer for this question.</p>
<p>Most newer programs will have the options to either Install for the Current User or Install for All Users. If the current user is selected, whether you can use the program with a new user account depends on the&nbsp;folder locations and registry locations&nbsp;where
 the program installs it's files.</p>
<p>Here is one thing you can try.</p>
<p>Log on with the account that was used to install the programs. Copy a shortcut for the target program and paste it into the C:\Users\Public\Desktop folder. This is the all users&nbsp;location and everything in that folder will be placed on the Desktop of every
 user account.</p>
<p>Log on with the new user account and try to start the program from that desktop shortcut.</p>
<p>If this does not work for a particular program, you may need to reinstall the program and select the all users option during the installation.</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>

<h3> erika weeks  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded.</h2>
                    Ok, to start off, I have a Windows 7 computer. I was just using my computer the other day, working fine. I turn it off, next morning turn it on, go to logon and see this message, "User Profile Service failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded." I
 only have one account, thats my main administrator account. So I ran in safe mode, (only way to get in), I got into it, made a new user profile, but cant be the admin of course.<br />
So I made the new account, and here I stand. Unable to do anything because Im not an admin. Yes the icon pops up, asking for a password, and when I do, I usually get an error message, or simply nothing happens.<br />
I am so frustrated, as I need to get to work ASAP! <br />
So my question is...<br />
<br />
1. Can I fix my original profile? (Note: I cannot log in at all, unless in safe mode.)<br />
2. Can I delete my old admin profile, and make the new one the admin. (Ive tried various ways but still nothing happens...)<br />
3. Why would it cause this so suddenly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Any comments/help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
My name is Erika.<br />

            Just had a computer come in with same issue.<br />
<br />
Start in safe mode with command prompt.<br />
<br />
At command prompt that comes up, type:&nbsp; <br />
<br />
rstrui.exe<br />
<br />
System Restore will start, if system restore was turned on you should have up to 3 months/90 days of restore points to choose from.<br />
<br />
Choose a restore point that will take you back to before this happened,&nbsp; I always choose a point at least a month prior.<br />
<br />
Let restore do it's thing.<br />
<br />
It should come back to life for you.<br />
<br />
At that point, I go into System Protection, and turn off System Restore on the Root Directory (OS (C:)) to clear ALL restore points.&nbsp; Then turn it back on, and create a new restore point.&nbsp; Then check for MS Updates.&nbsp; Watch all updates, Recommended and Optional.&nbsp;
 One of these updates could have caused this.<br />
<br />
Also, I just noticed that this unit has AVG Anti-Virus.&nbsp; This may also be the culprit.&nbsp; Presently, AVG has 4 and I say FOUR Rouges floating around out there.&nbsp; They will damage your system irreparably, and you would need to do an External System Backup, and
 re-install your OS. <br />

            <p>Have the computer completely powered down. &nbsp;Unplug, and take the battery out. &nbsp;Open the computer and press the "Power" button for 10 full seconds,(NO POWER). &nbsp;Plug in the computer (don't put in the battery). &nbsp;Then I usually start tapping the F8 key as I
 press the power button to turn the computer on. &nbsp;I never wait for the Mfr splash screen to come up before pressing the key. &nbsp;If the "Fast Boot" is enabled in the Bios, it will never bring up the Safe Mode choices if I wait to start tapping the F8.</p>
<p>If it still won't let you enter the Safe Mode Choice screen, then press and hold down the power button to shut completely down, and then try to power back on again tapping the F8 key. &nbsp;This shut down procedure, is known for being hard on the hard drive,
 but is unavoidable. &nbsp;After several attempts and failures, the Safe Mode Choice Screen should come up automatically.</p>
<p>If this fails, then I suggest that the hard drive be removed and connected to another computer as an external. &nbsp;The computer may come up (before autoplay) and indicate the hard drive needs to be scanned. &nbsp;Then choose Scan and Fix. &nbsp;That may help you get
 into Safe Mode. &nbsp;Sometimes I have seen the result after "Scan and Fix", where it could not be "Fixed". &nbsp;Indicative, of either an Imminent Hard Drive Failure, or the need to Re-Install the OS. Your option then, would be to get all your documents, files, music,
 and pictures copied from the hard drive while it is already connected to the other computer, then you know that you have saved what you can in the case that you have a complete HDD failure, or have to reinstall.</p>

<h2>            External 3 Tb harddrive not reconized</h2>
                    <p>We have a 3 TB Hitachi Touro Pro&nbsp;, USB 3, external harddrive.The drive worked fine on our older computer running Vista o/s, but since we upgraded to a new computer running Windows 8 the 3 tb drive is not reconized.</p>
<p>We have tried many suggestions from various forums, but none have worked.</p>
<p>We have this huge harddrive that is only good as a paper weight, thing is we've gone paperless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an updated&nbsp;driver available?</p>
<p>Do we have to configure something on our new computer, it worked plug and play on the computer running Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            <p>We have tried a &nbsp;USB 3 PCI Express card and have reformatted the drive.we have discussed the issue with Hitachi support,they say the drive is plug and play and that drivers come with the operating system, and that there needs to be an update to the usb 3
 drivers. That was in Nov.2012.</p>
<p>We are up to date on windows 8.1 ,but still no change.</p>
<p>Someone suggested changing some settings in the registry, but that is beyond my comfort zone.</p>
<p>At present we have the hitachi drive connected to the older computer and connect to it via network cable to the faster computer. We are only getting usb 2 speeds and cannot view some hd movies stored on the drive.Plus the older computers processor can't
 keep up.Hope this info is helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been issues with some Hitachi drives, as well as some Toshiba, and Win 8...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you tried the USB 3 card, did you use the drivers that came with the card, or whatever Windows installed...
</p>
<p>If you&nbsp;used Windows, try obtaining the latest drivers for the cards chip from either from the card manufacturer or the chip manufacturer....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might investigate a possible Firmware update for the Hitachi drive itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly what happens when you hook it up... error messages, or just nothing ?</p>
<p>Have you tried a USB 2.0 port just to see if it will work ?</p>

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>We used the drivers that came with the card.</p>
<p>Our newest computer is an Asus, only 1.5 years old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have tried usb 2 and usb 3 ports on this computer,&nbsp; front and back. </p>
<p>when we hook it up, nothing happens on the monitor.The external drive does power up, as we can here it running and the pilot light is on.</p>
<p>We will try your firmware update idea.</p>

drive,did a restart, did not see the device. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then deleted the USB driver,followed by a driver update. The date on the driver was the same.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The maximum disk size for MBR is 2TB, so you need to use the GPT....</p>
<p>Something must have formatted for it to say disk size is less than minimum...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try deleting everything on the drive and try again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... is your Vista a x64 bit machine ?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is that some drives like Seagate have a chip in them that tricks the OS...</p>
<p>A 3TB or 4TB Seagate USB drive, for example, will work even on 32 bit XP because of this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try formatting the drive with a program called Partition Wizard Ver. 8.1.1...</p>
<p>It's free and downloads as a ISO Image that can be burned to a bootable CD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you have any better luck formatting it on your Win 8 machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also investigate as to whether there is a BIOS update for your machine.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The 3 TB drive appears in disk management, ( sometimes ), at other times it does not.</p>
<p>Sometimes I find it in Printers and Devices.</p>
<p>The last time that I saw the drive in disk management, I tried to access it but it disappeared when I click on it. Funny how it is visable sometimes and not others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The vista machine is 32 bit. I did formatt the drive on the vista machine some time ago, could that have caused it to not operate on a 64 bit machine, ( our Asus computer is 64 bit using windows 8 ).</p>
<p>I have since connected the drive to the vista machine and deleted all info on the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Partition wizard on the windows 8 machine, but it is not visable on the app.</p>
<p>I cannot access the drive on the windows 8 machine therefore I cannot format it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Asus has said that the BIOS is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ,</p>
