    <title>Changed username in Windows 10, lost admin privileges&#59; no admin - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toddfreeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Changed username in Windows 10, lost admin privileges&#59; no admin account</h2>
                    <p>Gotta love when being a little too **** about things totally ruins everything.. "Couldn't leave well enough alone"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm helping a friend with their PC (had difficulty upgrading to v1151), and was all done when I asked about the user account. Seems he hadn't capitalized the spelling of his first name but had capitalized his last. It looked sorta funny so I asked about
 it. He'd apparently done that by accident, and it had been bothering him ever since. So we set about trying to change it, and landed on using 'netplwiz'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After changing the name, the system (at first) reflected the change after we were logged out. Then the trouble started. As soon as we'd entered the password, the name (which was still showing as the account was being logged-in to) reverted back to the former
 spelling. I thought it might require a restart to make the change permanent, so restart we did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine comes back, we log back in, and now we've really got a problem. No admin access. No admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run into something like this before on W8, where I had to boot into Recovery and replace the assistance button on the login screen with a command prompt. Does that work in W10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's also this post here:</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/lost-administrator-account-on-windows-7/62a99dcc-b976-4ad1-9ac5-e7bf803eab83?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone think that'd work in W10? I won't be able to try until I visit him again (later today), but I'd like to have some kind of gameplan going in that isn't exclusively, "We have to reinstall the OS".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: Forget to add, the switcheroo I was referring to on the login screen would end with steps similar (or exactly) as those found in the link I referenced.. enabling the built-in admin to restore privileges to the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I'm at it, it'd be really nice if someone from Microsoft could chime in about why changing the account name online didn't change it at the PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT 2: This looks extremely promising (option 4):</p>

            <p>Hello Todd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand the frustration when things don't do the way they supposed to. Let me assist you with additional information form here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are facing two issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes made to Microsoft Account online does not reply in your PC.</li><li>The Account you are referring to does not have Admin rights.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to deploy the Microsoft Account troubleshooter from the below which automatically resolves sync issues.</p>
<p>Ref: <span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-cant-450-LEFKPM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/sign-up-create-account-cant-450-LEFKPM</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the above does not apply, Microsoft account has a security feature called
<strong>Trusted PC</strong> for verifying your identity automatically and performing sensitive actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can mark a device as trusted just by selecting a check box. When you're prompted to enter a security code to verify your identity, select the
<span>I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code.</span> check box, and we'll no longer ask you for a code when you sign in on that device.
</p>
<p>
</p><div>Here's how to mark a device as trusted:
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the device you want to trust, go to the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=263779" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
</li><li>
<p>You'll be prompted to enter a security code. Choose whether to receive the code through email, text, or an
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/authenticator/9wzdncrfj3rj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <span>I sign in frequently on this device. Don't ask me for a code.</span> check box, and then tap or click
<span>Submit</span>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Visit: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/what-is-trusted-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Trusted devices: FAQ</span></a></strong></p>
<p><span>Refer to the “I've lost access to one of my trusted devices. What should I do?” from the following link,
<strong>Remove and re-add all trusted devices</strong></span>. This should help you in adding&nbsp;the device as trusted again, which resolves most of the sync issues in Microsoft Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to answer to your second query, I would like to know if you have set up multiple user accounts in your computer (except for the Built-in-Admin).</p>
<p>If yes, did you check if any of those have admin rights to it?</p>
<p>If no, were you able to restore the admin rights using the Built-in Admin User account?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Write to us with the updated information for us to be able to assist you better.</span></p>

<span>However, if I were you, I wouldn't do this just for the purpose of running the minimum number of programs. Despite what many people tell you, you should be concerned, not with how *many* of these programs you run, but *which*. Some of them can
 hurt performance severely, but others have no effect on performance.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Don't just stop programs from running willy-nilly. What you should do is determine what each program is, what its value is to you, and what the cost in performance is of its running all the time. You can get more information about these with
 internet searches and asking about specifics here.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>You ask whether&nbsp;some tool is safe to use, but you don't tell us what tool it is. And in my view, such a tool should be unnecessary, and *might* be dangerous.</span></div>

            "Too many" programs starting when your computer first starts isn't really the right way to look at things.&nbsp; What you need to do is decide which programs you need and which you don't.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If you're concerned about "slow" startup, the usual culprits are programs that perform some sort of scan of your computer -- which is what takes up time.&nbsp; These are programs that you really want to keep, such as your antivirus program and Windows Update.&nbsp; Some
 antivirus programs are more efficient than others as far as start up scans are concerned.<br />
<br />
Many programs can be prevented from starting when Windows starts by using the program's "options" menu and unchecking an item that says something such as "Start Skype when I start Windows" (obviously for Skype).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Another thing to do is click the Start button, then All Programs, then Startup.&nbsp; The contents of the Startup folder are shortcuts to programs.&nbsp; If you don't want a program to start, just delete its shortcut from the Startup folder (this will NOT delete the
 program; you can still start it either from a desktop item or from its own entry in the Start &gt; All Programs list).<br />
<br />
There are other methods that some programs use to start automatically, and that's why "startup manager" utilities exist.&nbsp; Some of these (e.g.,
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Autoruns</a>) need to be used with caution so that you don't disable something that really needs to be started (even if you don't think it does).<br />
<br />
As far as your specific question is concerned, we have no way of knowing what video you're watching or what tool you're referring to.&nbsp; If you want advice about something like that, please provide the URL (web page address) that you're looking at.<br />

my desktop Icons are gone completely. When I try to move them from User/myname/Desktop/ i cannot move them on the desktop. Windows says it cannot move to the same position. But why does the desktop not show them?<br />

            I am having the same problem. I moved "My Documents" back to the correct folder from a temp folder they were placed in. This has now happened 3 times. Antivirus is not picking up an infection. It all began when I was accessing a public network at a motel.
 Any solutions short of a complete recovery and starting over?

 response says go to manage' which isn't even an option. Can i lose my skype number? Its been fine for over 3 years! I am checking this via the website. I don't have an app downloaded on my MAC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/9ef6a08f-da58-44c5-bb6d-045ff076374c" title="HelenFord1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've successfully purchased a Skype Number you should've received an order confirmation email.</p>
<p>From that email, you'll find the Skype Account it is linked to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you check the email to find out which Skype account it was linked.</p>
<p>It can be linked to a specific Skype Name/Username or an email address which is your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that signing in to Skype using your email and Skype Name/Username is different.</p>
<p>If you made a purchased but doesn't appear in Skype then you are probably not on the correct Skype account.</p>
<p>Make sure to check your the order confirmation email first&nbsp;to see which account it was processed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

                    <p><span>Last week, my game list stopped updating. This is the same issue I had for nearly a month back in August that was finally resolved on September 5th.&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p><span>I talked to support on Thursday and went through all the tests and they agreed something was wrong on the server side of things. They said they were passing it along to the escalation

            This is an ongoing problem for Xbox at the moment. Sometimes looking for an update for the game or uninstalling and reinstalling the game fixes it though.

<p>I'm in the exact same boat. Had this issue at the end of July and it lasted all the way until early September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a week ago, the same issue arose. No game I play updates to my Achievement List, nor are stats tracked, but all of the achievements I unlock end up on the Activity Feed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really aggravating. I call support and I get the same troubleshooting reports. I know this isn't a "me" problem or system troubleshooting.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Question - do you play on numerous consoles in your household? I'm starting to wonder if that's an issue, or why it seems like the same people are having this problem vs. others who don't experience at all. I remember you posting about this before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Phoenix and all</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That was going to be my question how many are in the preview or insider program? That could be part of it being you do beta test new and upcoming updates it could be messing with achievements and such. You can check out the
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
preview forums</a> here maybe it is an issue there.</p>

<p>I just un-enrolled both my consoles from the Xbox Insider program and now it's working properly. I don't know if it was working before that, I wish I had tested a game before unenrolling.

<h2>            How do I regain my permissions on a folder&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I inadvertently set all the SYSTEM permission on a folder to Deny - long story, but that's what I did.&nbsp; Now,&nbsp;if I&nbsp;go to the Security tab&nbsp;under the folder's Properties to try an
 correct my mistake,&nbsp;the Security tab shows&nbsp;the sentence, "You do not have permission to view or edit this object's permission settings".&nbsp; I am the administrator of my system&nbsp;and the creator of the folder.</span></p>
<p><span>If I click on Advanced,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Owner tab shows under Current owner, "Unable to display current owner."&nbsp; If I click Edit and try to change the owner to myself, it gives me an error
 of "Access is&nbsp;denied"</span></p>
<p><span>I also tried going into Safe mode and executing the command 'takeown' from the command prompt, but it again returned, 'access denied'.</span></p>
<p><span>Stranded - please send help!</span></p>

<p>It's directly above the Start Orb and actually says Start Search inside it.</p>

Each Computer&nbsp;Manufacturer has their own way of doing it(Recovery to Factory Settings).<br />
Read info below and contact them with any questions/problems that you have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

    <title>Cursor keeps deselecting text fields in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bam_bmt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cursor keeps deselecting text fields in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 and have found typing excruciating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor randomly selects and deselects within the text box. My writing gets cut off before I've finished typing. It happens online in every text field including email, fb, online forms (including this text field) and in Word and Excel. It also affects
 pull down menus, which cut off before I've finished scrolling through them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a student and this is affecting my work and research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is a Lenovo Z570. I learned too late that Lenovo hadn't tested the upgrade with my computer model and resent that the automatic update appeared on my desktop as if it would work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using a USB mouse and upgraded my drivers but the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions? Is it possible to go back to Windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>I am having the same problem but I used a wires mouse. Even without a mouse connected to my (Lenovo Y560p) laptop the issue persists. is my only option to rollback windows 10?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional advice would be appreciated as it even takes several minutes to write this brief statement. Some times the text cursor just will disappears/unselect and the there half of the time it seems to select the text field and then replaces what the first

            <p>So I have the same laptop, the lenovo Z570 and just upgraded to windows ten and found the same thing. It looks like the problem was that the Synaptics Touchpad driver was not working, so I just uninstalled it and it seems to be working for the moment. In
 fact, it prompted me to uninstall this as soon as I went to mouse settings as it recognised this was not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know if the problem re-occurs.</p>

            <p>How strange</p>
<p>the same thing is happening with me it's driving me up the wall as I can't do anything with this laptop now. It's the Lenovo z570.</p>
<p>ive just given up trying to fix the drivers as its eating into my time and I've invested too much. I'm also a part time student and working so rely on my laptop for actual typing and not just internet shopping. This really pissed me off as it was meant to
 be a simple switch. I've now decided that since Apple are doing a deal for students I'm selling this and getting an iMac. It's really annoyed me that much. Arghh Lenovo and Microsoft should have picked this problem up before the release. It's not a small problem
 it's rendering the laptop a nightmare to use&nbsp;</p>

            I was having this same issue (Lenovo IdeaPad). If you're still having this problem, you may want to try checking out Lenovo's beta drivers
<a href="http://support.lenovo.com/us/en/downloads/ds102364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. I ran the setup (and it actually appeared to be unsuccessful) and on reboot it works perfectly! Now I can actually use my laptop again. Hope this works for everyone else!

    <title>Incorrect rendering of jpg&#47;png files inserted in Journal files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boundaryvalueproblems  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect rendering of jpg&#47;png files inserted in Journal files using Microsoft Print to PDF</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I have a windows journal file that contains a couple of jpg or png images. When I view this journal file, these images are displayed nicely as I expect. However, when I convert this journal file to a pdf file using "Microsoft Print to PDF", these images
 become either invisible or incorrectly scaled in this pdf file. This happens under Windows 10.</p>
<p>The exactly same journal file has no problem under Windows 7 with "Print to Adobe PDF".
</p>
<p>I am wondering whether this is a bug of "Microsoft Print to PDF" or journal app under Windows 10. I would greatly appreciate it if you could tell me how to fix this problem. For example, if I purchase and install Adobe Acrobat DC under Windows10, would this
 problem be solved?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, but none of the methods you suggested solved the problem.</p>
<p>I really think the problem is in the Windows Journal (version 1511 OS Build 10586.71) on Windows 10. I further checked and found out the following:</p>
<p>(1) Not only with "Microsoft Print to PDF", but also with "Send To OneNote 16", the same problem happened. In other word, the journal file printed and imported to OneNote 16, the resulting figures were rescaled and zoomed incorrectly.</p>
<p>(2) On the other hand, the rescaled rendering problems only occur on some jpg/png files, not all of them.</p>
<p>(3) Yet, the same jpg/png files having problems on Windows 10, when I use the Windows Journal (version 6.1 Build 7601: Service Pack 1) on Windows 7, and generate a pdf file by printing it to "Adobe PDF", I don't have any problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>Hence, my conclusion is something wrong with rendering/conversion part of the Windows Journal on Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I did further experiments, and found out the following really weird problem.</p>
<p>* If I set the orientation as "Portrait" in Page Setup, and generate a pdf file via "Microsoft Print to PDF", the same problem occurs, i.e., the jpg/png images do not scale correctly or no show in the pdf file.</p>
<p>* However, if I set the orientation as "Landscape", and generate a pdf file via "Microsoft Print to PDF", then those same jpg/png images are correctly rendered and displayed in the pdf file.</p>
<p>I am very puzzled. Why does the page orientation affect the rendering of jpg/png files in the Windows Journal in Windows 10??</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hello.</p>
<p><em>Finally, I could resolve these problems at least temporarily!</em></p>
<p>If I convert those jpg/png files to <strong><em>gif</em></strong> format files and insert them into a Journal note, then the resulting pdf file correctly shows these figures!! So, clearly this is a bug in the Journal app under Windows 10. I would greatly
 appreciate it if Microsoft engineering team working on the Journal app fixes this problem since it is rather cumbersome if we need to convert image files to gif format everytime when we need to insert them into journal notes.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Windows 10 on my new machine (surface pro 4) is completely up to date; it's KB3135173. Yet, the problem persists unless I use gif files as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not explicitly installed Windows Journal on my surface pro 4 myself. It was automatically installed on my new machine when I tried to open a .jnt file that I created on my older PC running Windows 7.
</p>
<p>If you insist, I'm willing to uninstall and install the Windows Journal on my surface pro 4, but I do not know where I can get the Windows Journal app.&nbsp; At least, it is not listed in the MS Store.</p>

<p>However, there's no difference. I still get the same problem unless I use gif files.</p>

    <title>Office 365 user not showing up in skype for business - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Office 365 user not showing up in skype for business</h2>
                    
<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>We recently migrated to office365 and are starting to test skype for business. There are a couple users that are not showing up in the skype to business section of office365. I was wondering if this was because their e-mail was previously signed up for skype
 or what could be causing this. While in the office365 admin console if I bring up their names and then click edit skype for business settings the page never loads for these users.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help,</p>

<p>Lance</p>

<p>hi lance,</p>
<p>to clarify the issue, i’d like to confirm following information:<br />
1. about “office 365 user not showing up in skype for business section of office 365”, do you refer to these users aren’t showing up in skype for business admin center?<br />
2. could you confirm skype for business licenses are properly assigned to these affected users?<br />
3. are there on-premises lync server deployed in your organizagion? if so, i'd like to confirm if the affected users are enabled on the on-premises lync.<br />
4. by saying “i bring up their names and then click edit skype for business settings the page never loads for these users”, could you please provide more detailed information about it. some related screenshots are appreciated. to upload a picture, please click
<strong>use rich formatting</strong> and then click the<strong> insert image</strong> icon.</p>

<h2>            Missing Avatar Awards. All Of Them.</h2>
                    
<p>So today I log in and out of curiosity check halo waypoint because I've been working to try to unlock one of the awards through there and discovered that I don't have any avatar awards. The ones I previously had unlocked didn't become re-unlocked either.
 I don't know what would have brought this on. I haven't moved my profile in months. I'm part of the beta program and recieved an update yesterday. Could that have caused this? I'd appreciate the help. I worked really hard to earn some of these awards and wouldn't
 be able to earn all of them again due to not owning some of the games anymore. Thank you.</p>

<p>I just noticed this and think it's worth mentioning; When I go to the awards tab it will still say that I have them unlocked. for example it will say Halo Waypoint 9 of 15 awards or Portal 2 4 of 8 awards but when I click on them it says "Your avatar awards
 appear here. Unlock awards by playing games."</p>

    <title>Device Registration Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nortecemployment  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device Registration Failure</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to register multiple surface pro&nbsp;devices for repair but cannot!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately; irrespective of web browser used&nbsp;I cannot register any of the devices. When I&nbsp;log onto register the devices initially it&nbsp;appears the request has been successful but the device remains unregistered and I cannot arrange for a repair on any of
 the&nbsp;four devices. The devices do not appear on my device registration page. Logged out of the profile, restarted my surface pro (updates applied and firmware updated). Still no improvement. I have accessories that I cannot register either - the same issue
 I experience with the surface pro devices occurs for the keyboard covers, pens and power adapters. The delay we are facing means employed staff cannot work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition to this frustration earlier last week&nbsp;I did manage to&nbsp;register one surface pro device - the repair was paid for (receipt of paid invoice from Microsoft received). The device was sent to Microsoft through their repair process only to be&nbsp;returned&nbsp;unrepaired
 with a letter indicating the repair was deemed as an out-of warranty repair. The request when submitted was requested as an out-of warranty repair and the amount was paid at the time of submitting the repair request so I do not understand why it would be returned
 to me in this state!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - you have my money and you had my device and you didn't repair it. Why?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have to try to engage your technical team - which will be problematic as when I do this is the error message I receive
</p>
<p>'We’re sorry, but something went wrong on our end. Please try again later. (hg0wOvL/swKk8NE2.0)'.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhat frustrated.....</p>

<h2>            My Windows DVDMaker limits me to 150 minutes</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 Home Premium Edition, kept very up-to-date with the latest Win7 patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I run Windows DVD Maker, I always insert a brand-new, blank DL (8.5 GB) DVD into my DVD (Drive G:)</p>
<p>Then I run Windows DVD Maker, the bottom left always says "0 of 150 minutes" to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this, I cannot fit several files (4) which total less than 7 GB because Windows DVD Maker already says "will not fit".</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many blog "experts" say to select the "right drive capacity" of "DL/9 GB" at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>WHERE?&nbsp; There is no such thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>Correct; Windows DVD Maker doesn't support DVD Blu-Ray.</p>
<p>As a suggestion, Freemake Video Converter work very well as a DVD Blu-Ray authoring software package.

3.&nbsp;Select “<strong>Compatibility”</strong> Tab. <br />
4.&nbsp;Place a check mark next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and select operating system from the drop down list.<br />
5.&nbsp;Let the game install and then check the functionality.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you are getting a black screen when trying to login to computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem occurs due to BIOS and Graphics driver outdated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and then try to update BIOS&nbsp; and chipset drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now you can try to press the shift key and then try to restart the computer, this should give you recovery options, from there try to boot to safe mode and then uninstall the graphics drivers and reboot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps, for further assistance please reply.</p>

            Did you ever figure this out? I downloaded Windows 10 and the recovery from sleep mode was so bad that I reverted back to Windows 7. Otherwise, I liked what I saw of Windows 10 and would like to reinstall it if I can find a fix to the sleep issue. Any
 thoughts? Thanks

            did you actually expect microsoft support to help or even understand your question accurately? &nbsp;I find that everything I used to do in Windows 7 now takes about twice as long to do/load in Windows 10. &nbsp;It is painful.

<h2>            Xbox Party Glitches</h2>
                    <p>Hello this is a loyal Xbox user, that has an issue with this user named Ra*** getting into me and my friends invite-only and turning the party into a joinable party. We have tried blocking him and have tried making clubs and banning him but he has a glitch
 that allows him to get back in the party. It is getting really annoying and i was wondering if you were able to make an update stopping him from doing this.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As much as we would like you to&nbsp;transfer to the correct forum unfortunately, Xbox does not have community forum&nbsp;query.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>With that being&nbsp;said, we strongly advised&nbsp;you to contact Xbox support, <strong>
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here.
</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you! </p>
