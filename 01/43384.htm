<h2>            Was a call made while i was offline</h2>
                    i was offline and am not sure if a call was made in a group chat i was in with 3 other people. when i came back i had no notifications that a call had been made so i am not sure if they had made that call in that particular chat group. i know for a fact
 that a call among the 3 of them was made though.

    <title>Can&#39;t activate windows 7 - &#34;Application not found&#34; Legit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t activate windows 7 - &#34;Application not found&#34; Legit License key not accepted</h2>
                    I have an older Alienware m17x R1 with a copy of Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1 pre-installed. I bought it for my son's birthday off of craigslist back in July 2012. It had so much stuff on it already I did not wipe it and the Operating System was
 already licensed, activated, and recognized as legit.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Again, the Operating System was already verified as legit and fully activated and I used Windows Update and Windows Security Essentials extensively as I prepped the machine for his birthday and there were no issues.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyway, in mid October 2012 my son suddenly starts seeing warnings that "This copy of Windows is not genuine" &nbsp;and that he needs to activate it. So, not having contact with the person I bought the computer from I went ahead and bought a copy of Windows
 7 Home Premium online for about $220.00 from the Microsoft store online and rather than downloading and wiping the machine and re-installing (we Mac people never have to deal with such nonsense) just to 'fix' things, I logically and wisely clicked on Start/Control
 Panels/System and then clicked on "Change Product key" and entered the valid, legitimate, product key that I'd just purchased.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But entering and submitting the valid, legitimate, official, product key taken from my download page at the Microsoft Store returns the following error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Code: 0xC004F050</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"The Software Licensing Service reported that the product key is invalid"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, thinking that I may have purchased the wrong Operating System I checked, and verified that I do indeed have Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 installed, and that I did indeed buy Windows 7 Home Premium. So, I appear to be well screwed. True, the normal Microsoft
 'solution' in such a situation is to wipe out all of your years of data and vaporize your machine and then rebuild it from scratch, but as a Mac guy I'm hoping I'm not at that point yet and an intelligent solution to this Operating System's problems can be
 found.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Also, when I launch slui.exe and click on the "Go online and resolve now" link, I get the following arcane error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=89429&amp;OSV=6.1.7601.2.00010300.1.0.003.09.1033&amp;LS..."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Application not found"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried rebuilding the licensing store per the excellent feedback given on this page:&nbsp;http://www.sevenforums.com/windows-updates-activation/227921-windows-7-all-sudden-saying-its-not-genuine.html but it didn't resolve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, I've spent good money on a new Operating System on a great gaming platform which is fast becoming a brick. Any tips on how I can correct the problems this Windows 7 machine is having and get it to accept the valid licensing key I purchased at the online
 Windows Store and get it activated and legit, again, would be most appreciated!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div><br />

            <b>Thanks for the reply but I'm a bit puzzled. Having bios older than a given Windows Operating System has never prevented an Operating System from being activated in my nearly 20 years of using Windows</b>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>An OEM SLP key requires a compliant bios marker in order to self activate. Retail keys and OEM system builder keys do not. When you purchased your computer likely an OEM SLP key was used along with an activation hack.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div><b>unless there is something wrong with the Operating System</b>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>there is something wrong with the operating system. it has been hacked<b>&nbsp;and therefore is not genuine.</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div>Windows Activation Technologies normally runs every 90 days so it can sometimes can take a while especially if the WAT update is disabled.</div>

<div>
<p>
<span>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>A)&nbsp;&nbsp; OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the special instructions found only on that Manufacturer's
 computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory) Windows 7 looks at the motherboard and sees the special instructions and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom,[ or inside the battery compartment]) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but
 should only be used in limited situations (such as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of
 Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)</span></p>

<h2>            WLAN stopped working for no apparent reason. Cannot get it working again.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is about 2 months since I upgraded my Samsung laptop to Win 10 from 8.1 &amp; although the WLAN adapter&nbsp;(<em>Qualcomm Atheros AR9485WB-EG Wireless Network Adapter</em>) originally did not work after the upgrade, some recommended steps in this forum got it
 working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today at one point, I noted after a restart that the network symbol in the system tray was missing, I restarted explorer via the taskbar. The network symbol came back, but no WLAN. I did many checks . The adapter in the device manager is shown no be working
 &amp; even, uninstalling &amp; re-installing does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried several measures recommended in online forums, including trying to start/restart WLAN AutoConfig, which is actually set at "automatic", but it does not start. Tried
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/wireless-adapter-issues/d62879f5-02a9-437a-ac5d-7894a8616ef4">
this from this site</a>, &amp; lots of others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot imagine what triggered this. Before that I had updated different programs, including Iobit Malware fighter &amp; Malwarebytes anti-rootkit &amp; Malwarebytes (found nothing) &amp; had used to scan the laptop. I have had these programs &amp; have never had any issue
 with them. I otherwise uninstalled some unused programs with Iobit uninstaller &amp; tested Ashampoo uninstaller pro, which was offered as a Giveaway for today.</p>
<p>Nothing unusual.</p>
<p>That us why I do not understand what has led to this.</p>
<p>Other ways I tried included "sfc /scannow", it said it could not fix all problems, certainly not this one.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, after restarting the PC, the network symbol in taskbar did not reappear, not even after restarting windows explorer, although I am now connected via a LAN cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting the network (without LAN) repeatedly finds no problem with the network.</p>
<p>Win 10 repeatedly only accepts its WLAN adapter driver saying it is more up-to-date than that from the adapter's manufacturers site. It is this SAME driver that has always worked, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 Network &amp; Internet settings, it does NOT show any adapter .... there is NO "WLAN" at all(!!!!!), which is normally above "Flight mode" &amp; "Data usage" &amp; co, although in device manager the adapter is activated like it is usually &amp; "This device
 is working properly" ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ashampoo Uninstaller, which has a facility for starting services, if u try to start WLAN AutoConfig, says<em> "This service started, but stopped immediately. May be the service needs hardware connected to yoiur system or an application started first"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate some help to get WLAN working again, which as implied has always worked since the upgrade to Win 10, until earlier on today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALL available Windows Updates are installed, including a couple today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

</p><p>Thank you for replying &amp; for the suggestions.</p>
<p>The driver installation did not take place yesterday, but 2 months ago when I upgraded &amp; I have been using WLAN with no single problem until yesterday when without warning, it stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had already mentioned above:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>exactly that leads to Windows determining "The best driver software driver for your device is already installed"</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp;</strong> I tried installing that driver from vendor, but it makes no difference, even after restarting PC. In the task bar, there is just the network symbol with a yellow exclamation mark. Normally, you have the WLAN symbol loading, since
 I almost only use WLAN &amp; there are lots of networks around ...</p>
<ul>
<li>In Windows 10 System Settings =&gt; Network &amp; Internet, WLAN does not even appear &amp; this is normally at the very top! Only Flight mode, Data usage, VPN, Dial up, Ethernet &amp; Proxy show up. WHY, if the device manager shows the adapter is there &amp; functioning????<br />
</li><li>In Control Panel =&gt; Network and Internet =&gt; Network Connections, the WLAN adapter is shown to be there &amp; activated</li><li>Right-clicking on the WLAN adapter above &amp; selecting "Diagnose", leads to "Problems found =&gt; The windows wireless service is not running on this computer"</li><li>I select "Try these options as administrator". Result: Troubleshooter was unable to fix all of the issues found automatically .... "The windows wireless service is not running on this computer - Not fixed"</li><li>No other useful options are offered other than contacting support.</li></ul>
<p>I had mentioned yesterday I have already tried several steps including starting "WLAN AutoConfig" service &amp; trying out "sfc /scannow", which were recommended by some folks to
<strong>no effect</strong>! </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems the problem comes from the WLAN service not running &amp; not even allowing to be started manually - though I am not an expert on this ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried an external USB-WLAN-adapter - it could also not work.</p>
<p>Regarding the additional link&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3084164" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3084164</a> it seems they address issues caused by VPN clients.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not use Cisco &amp; co.</p>
<p>I have however the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>F-Secure Freedom, I think a VPN program, which I hardly use &amp; is mostly not activated at all. I cannot imagine how this could be a problem, it has been there all along &amp; not interfering. There is Freedome TAP driver in Device manager =&gt; Network adapters<br />
</li><li>Hide My IP 6 ... I hardly use &amp; it was NOT on when WLAN failed yesterday &amp; if they was a problem, both programs would have led to network problems at the time of installation, weeks ago, not yesterday.</li><li>In Device manager =&gt; Network adapters, there was Team Viewer VPN, which after reading this, temporarily uninstalled it, but I think has nothing to do with this. I have always had &amp; used TeamViewer with no issue, also with this WLAN adapter.</li><li>I nevertheless tried using the troubleshooter http://aka.ms/diag_cssemerg68309 recommended at above link, but it "couldn't identify the problem"</li></ul>
<p>I have just re-run sfc /scannow again, which it says it found some corrupted files, but "but was unable to fix some of them". Results are summarized in some looooong list of stuff in an 12 MB CBS.log file, some I think from yesterdays scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would very much be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am grateful for your support, but I would very much appreciate if you bothered to read through the problem description and the different steps I have ALREADY tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the original post I had already written:</p>
<p><strong><em>The adapter in the device manager is shown to be working &amp; even, uninstalling &amp; re-installing does not help.
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I tried several measures recommended in online forums, including trying to start/restart WLAN AutoConfig, which is actually set at "automatic", but it does not start. Tried
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/wireless-adapter-issues/d62879f5-02a9-437a-ac5d-7894a8616ef4">
this from this site</a>, &amp; lots of others.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In Windows 10 Network &amp; Internet settings, it does NOT show any adapter .... there is NO "WLAN" at all(!!!!!), which is normally above "Flight mode" &amp; "Data usage" &amp; co, although in device manager the adapter is activated like it is usually &amp; "This
 device is working properly" ....</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Ashampoo Uninstaller, which has a facility for starting services, if u try to start WLAN AutoConfig, says</strong><em><strong>"This service started, but stopped immediately. May be the service needs hardware connected to your system or an application
 started first"</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After your original response, you suggest updating the driver something I had already mentioned I had already tried &amp; it did NOT help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In yesterday's response, I again take the time to write in detail the different steps I have tried &amp; they include:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I had mentioned yesterday I have already tried several steps including starting "WLAN AutoConfig" service &amp; trying out "sfc /scannow", which were recommended by some folks to no effect!
</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>It seems the problem comes from the WLAN service not running &amp; not even allowing to be started manually - though I am not an expert on this ....</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of it, you say:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Login to your computer through Administrator account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows key + r</strong> and type <strong>
Services.msc</strong>, hit Enter.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check for the <strong>WLAN AutoConfic Service.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>On the top left panel in the Services windows, there is an option named Start. If it stopped, click on the
<strong>Start</strong> option to start the service.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the service is started the click they select the Restart Option to restart the service again.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>If I follow those steps I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is the EXACT wording of the results:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows could not start the WLAN AutoConfig service on Local computer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Error 0x800c0006: The system cannot locate the object specified.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I had mentioned yesterday, restarting WLAN AutoConfig fails!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other day, I had tried to locate a solution to <strong>Error 0x800c0006 </strong>
but 1 or 2 solutions I tried did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also mention an external WLAN adapter, which had always worked before does not work as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Via Windows 10 Task Manager,</strong> if you change to the Services tab, the process "<strong>WlanSvc</strong>" with the description " WLAN AutoConfig" has the status "stopped".
<em>If you try to right click it &amp; select "Start", it immediately returns to "stopped", however much u try to manually start it.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please kindly note the other steps I mentioned above, including the different diagnosing/troubleshooting steps &amp; results, which I am sure would help locate the source of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>WLAN AutoConfig service</strong>&nbsp; is definitely faulty &amp; restarting it manually does NOT help &amp; certainly part of the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>
<p>

<p>I was even thinking of going back to last recovery point, but there happened to be only one, a day AFTER the WLAN issue, and in fact during an attempt, it was not even completed because of some error, which I forgot to note down.</p>

            <p>Well, I had no choice, other than to re-install Windows 10, at the cost of losing many useful licensed programs I had got over the last 2 years as Giveaways, most which the condition is - there are no updates, or possibility of re-installation, etc.</p>

<p>Hi, I had got the same problem, exactly one month ago.</p>
<p>I have tried a lot of suggested resolution but nothing have worked for me as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you solved it by re-installing Windows 10? If yes, what tipe of re-installation procedure have you choose?<br />

All the best, Luca.</p>

            Thanks but its been like this since the last patch, earlier this week. We've tried restarting, we've even tried logging his account onto my Xbox and it always presents the same message. It displays a message on where to find the settings and I have confirmed
 it is setup correctly for him but it does not allow him to play. It's like its not recognizing that its set correctly.&nbsp;

            No, it is not disabled. He can play from his Switch, just not his Xbox. This seems to be an Xbox settings issue as its not recognizing that I have enabled this cross platform for his account.&nbsp;

            Cross-platform play is disabled for all child accounts? Where is the source for that? I have found nothing on this. Every topic I have ever found on this subject says their child account was corrected when Microsoft released this "cross platform" option
 in December.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Brian,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with cross play. Sometimes when updates come out they reset some settings. On the parent account you want to access the child privacy and online settings. When you choose Xbox live privacy go to view details and customize, under communication
 and multiplayer, make sure <strong>You can play with people outside of Xbox live is set to allow, the second is You can communicate outside of Xbox live with voice and text.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helpsBrad</p>

            Thanks Brad, but as my initial post says I have already verified that these settings are correct. I have even tried resetting them and putting them back to enabled but he still receives the message as though its disabled.&nbsp;

    <title>Setting A Microphone Minimum Volume for Transmission - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setting A Microphone Minimum Volume for Transmission</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to set a minimum volume limit for transmission on my microphone to cancel out background noise. Basically, what I want it to do is to not transmit any sound until the sound is above a certain threshold.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a directional microphone that is able to pick up my voice when I am speaking and cuts out other noise, but when&nbsp;I am not speaking, the background noise comes in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated, whether it is settings, additional software or additional hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you want the Microphone to detect the sound when it is above a certain threshold. However,
 if the Microphone detects any background noise when you are not speaking it will be captured.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I commend you for noticing this feature not being within Windows 10. We would like to hear your thoughts and
 suggestions, as there may be other users with a similar requirement. Hence, I would suggest you to post a feedback in Microsoft

<p>while running the Memory diagnostic tool , I am prompted by system to insert O/S&nbsp; CD.<br />
<br />
I want to know&nbsp; if I insert the O/S cd in , will it cause loss of data on my system i.e; whether my previously&nbsp; added softwares and&nbsp; documents will get wiped out ?<br />
<br />
Is the effect of this activity&nbsp; similar to "Re-installation" ?<br />
<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks
<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.memtest.org</span></a><br />
<br />
For the Vista Memory Diagnostic Tool<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; Memory - find Memory Diagnostics tool at top of list - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
follow the instructions<br />

    <title>Xbox Live becoming free June 1st&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evolte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live becoming free June 1st&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Is it true that Xbox Live is becoming free on June 1st? I'm not a pessimist or anything but I don't get why you're doing this? You're losing millions of dollars and promoting hackers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Oh, did my account get suspended? Why don't I just make another one? And another one? and etc..</p>

<p>I bet accounts will get 3 doubled at this time.</p>

<p>But, you're also getting more players to xbox and more gamers, but that's not covering that million loss.</p>

<p>So, are the rumors true?</p>

<p>Xbox live will never be free. This kind of rumor has been going around since 2004 on and off. Microsoft runs a company and a company has to make money therefore Xbox is only one part of that money making puzzle. Xbox live will never ever go free for all
 it's services and content.</p>

    <title>Strict Nat keeps stopping me connecting to online games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Strict Nat keeps stopping me connecting to online games</h2>
                    
<p>Hi...I have problems with&nbsp;inviting Friends to the Lobby of Gears of War 2&nbsp;or&nbsp;joining&nbsp;Friends games that are in progress that&nbsp;have space for more people. I am on my third Router in 9 months in an attempt to cure the problem. When the router is first installed,
 every thing seems to be ok'ish. with only the occasional problem of trying to connect to a friend. But then after a few days the problem starts all over again.
</p>
<p>In the house&nbsp;we have 3 desktop computers running through the router, 2 directly connected via ethenet and 1 via wireless. I have 4 Xboxes running through the router, 1 via ethenet and 3 via wireless. There is also 1 PS3 and 1 WII connected via wireless,
 but these aren't used as often as the 4 Xboxes and the 3 Computers. The most that will be running at a time would be 4 Xboxes and 1 computer. We Like playing Gears of War 2 as a Family group, but are now struggling to connect to each other to do so. We can
 connect to Social online Gears of War 2 games, but not to Friends games for some reason. I have restored the router back to it's Factory Default Settings, but to no avail. And the router says the Security settings are set to standard to allow all gaming.</p>
<p>At the moment we can make a Family and Friends game on the Hord game of Gears of War 2, but we can't make a co-op Campain it won't allow us to set one up as Social or Custom. It just says the Nat setting is to strict and won't allow us to even start the
 co-op campain.</p>
<p>My Network provider&nbsp;are not&nbsp;able to help in any way, as they are only trained up on the workings of the router and the connection of the Internet service and are not provided any training on Xbox 360's connecting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>ACan you&nbsp;help please</p>
<p>Regards Derrill</p>
<p>RDB339</p>

<h2>            Borderlands 2 - Season Pass, DLC attempting to charge me &#40;again&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to find some help getting the Season Pass for Borderlands 2 to work on my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I try to download the new Psycho Pack (through the in-game menu)&nbsp;the system is trying to charge me the 800 points, and this DLC&nbsp;should be included&nbsp;with the season pass. I originally purchased the Season Pass on 10/18/12 with MS Points. I've successfully
 gotten the other DLC to download without incurring additional charges, but I can't seem to do that this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I've tried to&nbsp;delete&nbsp;my Season Pass&nbsp;and redownload it from the Download History account area, and I also cleared the system cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I look at the the entry for Borderlands 2 under Settings -&gt; System Settings -&gt; Storage -&gt; Hard Drive -&gt;&nbsp;Games and Apps -&gt; Borderlands 2 I see the following items:</p>
<p>Borderlands 2: Installed Game</p>
<p>4 Compatibility Packs</p>
<p>Season Pass</p>
<p>Saved Characters (5 of those)</p>
<p>Previous DLC (3 of those)</p>
<p>Premiere Club (?)</p>
<p>Mechromancer download</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas on how I can get this to work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi, following a bit of research, I'm afraid to tell you that the Psycho Pack is not included with the season pass.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second pack, the <strong>Psycho Pack</strong>, contains a sixth playable character for Borderlands 2 - a Psycho named Krieg. Psychos are psychotic enemies fought during the main Borderlands 2 campaign. He is a primarily melee focused character with an
 action skill called "Buzz Axe Rampage", which boosts his melee damage and causes him to regain health whenever he kills an enemy. It will be released on May 14th and
<strong>is not included in the Season Pass.</strong></p>

<p>medium bloke is right that DLC is not included in sesson pass read whif atention the marketplace description and you see no seasson pass word in nothing in theory the only content from seasson pass is 4 new campains/add-ons but they give a extra, because
 the delay of tina´s dungeon last Borderlands 2 DLC...most people put their faith that will be the psyco, but i wait and one week before the launch of six class they release a tresure pack for people have seasson pass for free...that is their excuse present
 and not the psyco class...sorry man...(go in game market and search for your "present").</p>
<p>I hope i help you and forgive my bad english it´s self learnerd.</p>

    <title>Full Screen Preview Window Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xrossbow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Full Screen Preview Window Problem</h2>
                    Do any of you see this problem?<br />
<br />
When opening an existing project and running it in the full screen preview mode, all pictures look fine. But after doing some editing on the story board and then jumping back to the full screen preview mode, most times the pictures are now displayed in a low
 resolution mode. The only work around that I have found is to save my project, exit, and come back in. The pics display in the full screen preview mode as they should at that point, at least until I do some more editing.<br />
<br />
Same thing happens on two different systems.<br />
Windows 7<br />
Movie Maker 2012<br />
<br />
Any fix for this?<br />
<br />
Thx in advance<br />

            <p>The preview mode is just that, a preview.&nbsp; If Movie Maker has to lower the resolution to keep up with displaying your photos in near real-time or to reduce memory used, it may.&nbsp; On the other hand, when you save your project as a final movie (File &gt; Save
 movie) it will then use the full power of your computer (CPU and GPU) to generate the movie in the specified resolution and bitrate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to look at your movie on the full screen, finish your edits, save the movie and play it full screen in your media player (e.g. Windows Media Player).</p>

            Thanks for the reply, Guy. But try this little test.<br />
<br />
Put one sample picture on the storyboard. Play the full screen preview mode and it looks sharp, does it not?<br />
<br />
Now, add a simple one word caption to that picture and then hit the full screen preview. How does your picture and text look?<br />
<br />
Mine looks crappy to say the least. Until I added the the caption it was fine. There seems to be other edits that cause the situation too, I just haven't isolated them yet.<br />
<br />
I threw in about 3 dozen pictures with all kinds of animations, along with audio files and they all worked fine in the full screen preview mode....&nbsp; until I added a caption on one picture.<br />
<br />
This is on a Win 7 system:<br />
Intel Core I7-2700k processor, quad 3.5 ghz core, 16gb ram<br />
2x2gb Vividia GeForce GTX 660 video card<br />
<br />
I would think this system should not be stressed with rendering a single picture with caption in the full screen preview mode.<br />
<br />
And once the situation has developed, just starting a new project does not clear the problem. You have to exit the program and come back in. And having to save, jump out, and then come back in to see how your work looks at full screen is not something a user
 should have to do. Gets very aggravating.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, in my humble opinion, full screen mode should not look like something out of the 80's technology. It looks as if the software has not kept up with newer technology capabilities such as more memory available, etc.<br />
<br />
And there appears to be one or two other bugs, related to audio, which I won't go into detail in this message.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>I see what you mean.&nbsp; It appears that when a caption is applied, then Movie Maker renders differently in full screen mode.&nbsp; It seems to take whatever is shown in the smaller preview window and do a plain scaling.&nbsp; But yes, the first time it just showed the
 photo in its original resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when I did save the final movie, it had the full resolution again... so yes, you have identified there is an issue with the way the full screen preview is rendered when text is applied.&nbsp; But fortunately the final movie is unaffected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One workaround I found was to resize the preview window as much as possible before switching to full screen.&nbsp; That at least then uses that scale as the initial resolution before scaling to full screen.&nbsp; To do that, just drag the vertical dividing line further
 to the right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe one of the moderators can escalate this to the Movie Maker developers and get a better answer as to why the full screen preview behaves that way.</p>

            <p>Hi Xrossbow,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. In addition to the post of Considerate_guy, I simulated your concern and experienced the same issue. I would like to ask some questions for further isolation:</p>
<ul>
<li>You said it happened on 2 systems, are they both using Windows 7 and Movie Maker 2012?</li><li>Is the editing particular to adding caption only or you found other editing methods that produced the same issue? If so, please provide the method.</li><li>Does the issue happen when using videos instead?</li></ul>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            Hi Richard,<u><br />
<br />
</u>1. Yes, both systems are on Win 7 and Movie Maker 2012<br />
<br />
2. In the testing I did yesterday, with a couple dozen pictures and sound thrown in, with some animation, at some point the full screen preview went stupid again. But I have not been able to duplicate it again. So for now, consider it isolated to the caption/text
 problem. <br />
<br />
3. Yes, the issue can be duplicated with a movie file also. Just take a single picture and save it to a movie file. Start a new project with that simple movie file and add a caption. Try the full screen preview and you will see the problem.<br />
<br />
And of course, if you select a built in movie theme, you will see the issue. But these themes also have text involved.<br />
<br />
Thx<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>Adding details on my testing:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also using the latest version of Movie Maker 2012 (16.4.3508.0205).&nbsp; I tested on a Windows 8 system and got the same result.&nbsp; So it would seem that the version of Windows is not a factor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I saw the issue when a caption was applied, but not when just an effect or transition was applied.&nbsp; Also, after the text was applied and previewed, even if I removed the text, the resolution did not go back to the full resolution.&nbsp; Even added photos after
 that were now at the lowered resolution of the preview window, not the full screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I saved the project and came back, now the full screen preview was again good, even if there were added captions.&nbsp; The problem returned if I added a new caption in that editing session.</p>

            Here's another temporary workaround on this problem until Microsoft does a permanent fix.<br />
<br />
As we have discussed, as soon as you add a caption on your storyboard, the “Full Screen Preview” goes stupid and resolution is lowered. You can “Save” your project, “Exit” the program, and then come back in to recover the resolution. A real pain.<br />
<br />
Work around #2:<br />
Click on the "Project" tab and change the "Aspect Ratio" to the alternative of what it is right now. If you have it currently set at 16:9, change it to 4:3, or vice versa.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Then check your Full Screen Preview. It should look fine........ until you add another caption.
<br />
<br />
A some what better workaround than saving the project and exiting.<br />
<br />
Just remember to set the correct Aspect Ratio before saving your movie and burning those dvd's.<br />

<h2>            How do I installThrones and Patriots after downloading the original Rise of Nations&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Dell Inspiron 7520 using Windows 7. I recently bought Rise of Nations Gold edition which includes both the original game and Thrones and Patriots on one DVD-ROM but with a product key for both. I had some difficulty installing the original game
 off the disc, but after I did, I couldn't find out how to install Thrones and Patriots. I have a product key, but I cannot get to a point where I enter the product key to install Thrones and Patriots.

<p><span>As the issue is only with Nero 6 being not able to burn CD/DVDs, I would suggest you to install the latest version of Nero and check if it helps.
 You may also try running Nero 6 in Windows Vista and Windows XP compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p>However from the fact that you are telling us that you are using a portable hard drive I think I know what your problem is.&nbsp; Some games do require a Microsoft Hard drive in order to function properly.&nbsp; It's possible that you recently downloaded an update that screwed up the game a bit.</p>

                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I've been noticing that network drives (disconnected ones) slows the opening of "Save As" or whatever pop-up windows to manage files.</p>
<p><br />
I would like to know if there is any features/workarounds to resolve this, because I wouldn't want to disconnect the drives..&nbsp;<br />
(The reason is that I have over 15 drives that are all connected to a "Hub PC" in my basement and sometimes I need to remove the drive for some reason or the PC needs to update, currently dealing with the Win 8.1 Preview expiration)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the answers in advance &nbsp;!</p>

<h2>            The App Tells Me Some Weird Stuff</h2>
                    <p>some context first:</p>
<p>I have been using the Xbox App for like 6 months, everything ok, but, this week, when I did upload a profile image from my phone, the next day it was erased (the image did not contain sexual or gross content anyway) then, when I tried to upload it again,
 the app tells me, in a text box, that I need an adult account, but my account is for adults, OR, how I make my account “For adults”?</p>
<p>The image is for christmas purposes, dont ruin it, thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely Yours, ya boy, bgd.</p>
