<h2>            Windows 10 update 6&#47;14&#47;2019 infinite loading screen</h2>
                    <p>as the title suggests&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since the new update I can no longer access my desktop normally, after logging in I get stuck in an infinite loading screen with no way out but restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- rebooting several times&nbsp;</p>
<p>- running recovery (this has failed according to the system)</p>
<p>- booting safety mode, once I get into the menu it freezes and I cant select anything and require another reboot&nbsp;</p>
<p>- cannot uninstall the latest update (this has also failed)</p>
<p>- cannot use the clean restarts (everything fails)</p>
<p>
</p><p>my last option to is to reinstall from a disk or stick</p>
<p>
</p><p>anything im missing?</p>

<p>glitches in the actual game would happen on any console,but loading glitches or errors of some kind could be a console problem.loads of games have daft glitches, if you go to the forum for the actual game you are having most glitches on there are probably
 people on there saying the same things</p>

<p>Some of the glitches seem to be context sensitive as in its how you've played your game, thats why even before the first patch came out some people made it all through the game with no problems, eg getting locked out of New Vagas if you dont have the Cowboy
 hat, if you dont do the mission where you kill the guy wearing it until much later on you dont get locked out do it to soon after getting to New Vagas for the first time &amp; you do, by completing one quest you may cause a problem with another.

            Hi Alison, 
<br />
<br />Click start, and type "services" and open it. 
<br />
<br />find "print spooler" and right click and stop it. 
<br />
<br />Then, click start again and type "this pc" and open it. 
<br />
<br />navigate to here:
<br />
<br />C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS
<br />
<br />Clear out any jobs that are present. (if no jobs, keep moving forward)
<br />
<br />Go back to the print spooler within services, right click and start. 
<br />
<br />Once the service starts, reboot, and see if your queue is cleared. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

            Try this.
<br />Go to search and type services.msc and open it.
<br />Then go to Print Spooler right click and stop it.
<br />Leave that window open.
<br />Then go to file explorer and go to C:\Windows\System32\spool\PRINTERS
<br />Delete everything in that folder then close file explorer.
<br />Then go back to services.msc and start the Print Spooler service.
<br />
<br />If that does not work then go to start - settings - Devices - Printers and Scanners. 
<br />Select your printer and then remove it.
<br />Then in the same window click add printer and readd your printer.

    <title>Gadget control panels are inaccessible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> claviger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gadget control panels are inaccessible</h2>
                    I have several gadgets on my (Windows 7 Ultimate) desktop, and they work fine, but all gadget control panels are inaccessible.&nbsp; By this I mean that if I click the "wrench" icon on any of the gadgets, nothing happens.&nbsp; If I right-click on the desktop and
 select Gadgets, nothing happens.&nbsp; If I run a new .gadget file, nothing happens.&nbsp; if I go to Control Panel-&gt;Windows Sidebar Properties, nothing happens.&nbsp; If I go to Control Panel-&gt;Appearance and Personalization, and click any of the links under Windows Sidebar
 Properties (including, say, "Restore desktop gadgets installed with Windows", nothing happens.&nbsp; I can't do
<span style="font-style: italic">anything </span>having to do with managing gadgets -- I can only view the ones I have, and move them around.<br />
<br />
Things I have tried:<br />
1.)&nbsp; Killing and restarting sidebar.exe<br />
2.)&nbsp; Killing sidebar.exe and running a new instance of it as admin.<br />
3.)&nbsp; Rebooting, many times.<br />
4.)&nbsp; Disabling UAC.&nbsp; <br />
5.)&nbsp; Enabling UAC.&nbsp; (This is my normal state, but I tried disabling it and rebooting to see if it would fix the problem; it did not.)<br />
6.)&nbsp; Deleting my IE9 Security Zones.<br />
7.)&nbsp; Running sfc /scannow as admin -- 100% complete, no errors found.<br />
<br />
I tried to go to Programs and Features to remove the Windows Gadget Platform and add it again.&nbsp; However, in Programs and Features, Windows Gadget Platform is not checked.&nbsp; If I check it and hit OK, I get the message "An error has occurred.&nbsp; Not all of the features
 were successfully changed." but no indication of what the error is.<br />
<br />
Finally I tried removing all my gadgets and rebooting.&nbsp; This also didn't help, only now instead of working gadgets I can't edit, I have no gadgets at all, which is not an improvement.<br />

                    So,I have bought a genuine windows 7 copy and got it installed.I know that one licence is for one install that I used up.Now,I wanna install the same copy on my friend's laptop,he does not need genuine copy and he is happy with the non genuine copy.So,since
 I'm also using that licence will it make my windows 7 lose genuineness if I install it on an another computer?

            <p>If your friend does not activate the license within 30 days, it will go into reduced functional mode and he won't have a functional operating system anymore, in addition to that, it will make the user vulnerable since they won't be able to get security updates
 for Windows. Also, the disc clearly says, do not lend</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>No, the key which can be used with either 32 or 64 bit Windows 7 is only intended for use with 1 of the disk. You cannot use it to install both. 1 license, 1 installation, so choose wisely. If you want to install Windows 7 32 or 64 bit on another partition
 or another computer, you will need to purchase an additional license.</p>

            License if for ONE installation on one computer at a time.&nbsp; Even though it will be listed on "non genuine" you can risk getting your true "genuine" install as not genuine.&nbsp; Windows 7 will always check for "genuine" at least at every boot, if not at other
 times.&nbsp; Microsoft is the only "entity" that can determine when they will "non genuine" a genuine version.<br />

    <title>Is there a way to flip integrated USB webcam with usbvideo.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victor meirans  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a way to flip integrated USB webcam with usbvideo.sys driver&#63;</h2>
                    I have ASUS U31Jg laptop running Windows 8.1 64bit. The laptop comes with Chicony (Sonix) USB 2.0 VGA UVC WebCam. As far as I know this webcam has no drivers for Windows 8, but have sucessfully installed the latest Windows 7 64bit driver from ASUS site.
 The picture was flipped and mirrored, but I corrected it by changing the registry settings. It works fine with Skype but the problem is with Lync 2013. Lync can not start&nbsp; video in call, claiming that the camera is already in use or not configured, although
 it is showing the picture pretty well in Lync - Options - Video device settings.<br />
<br />
The funny thing is that Lync 2013 video works when I roll back to Windows stock driver. But the image is upside down and I can not find the way to flip it. The is no "Settings" registry key like with Chicony (Sonix) driver. I tried to create one with "Flip"
 DWORD value but nothing changed. Any ideas? <br />
<br />
<b>Is there a registry key I can add or change in order to flip it vertically?</b><br />

            Hi Ben,<br />
<br />
Yes I have the correct driver installed from ASUS website. And I have even found more recent driver, tried to install them in all possible ways, including compatibility mode. And it works great with everything (Skype, VSee)
<b>except Lync 2013</b>. If I want to start the video call in Lync, I get the error:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2bc7b184-a2ab-4b50-8ccd-7fdc017f7650" /><br />
<br />
Which is not true. No other programs are using camera and it is set up in Lync options.<br />
I also checked it with troubleshooter, the only issue I get is this:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/129fa16b-5f6d-4934-81d3-95251063d066" /><br />
<br />
So I thought it would be simpler to try to use the stock windows driver if I can find a way to flip the image vertically.<br />
<br />
<b>Is there a registry key I can add or change in order to flip it vertically?</b><br />

</p><p><span><em>Are you using the Lync desktop application or the Windows store app?</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We don’t recommend performing any registry changes now as the webcam is working fine with the other applications. The error message states that the camera is already used by another service. It is possible that some other background service is using
 the camera and is conflicting with Lync. To check if this indeed is the issue, I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check. Booting the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause
 of the issue. You can refer to this article for more information:</span></p>

<p>I have an ASUS U36SD which experiences ViC's vertical flip problem. I have tried all options with ASUS Win7 drivers for the integrated Chicony camera. In all cases the I cannot get Skype or the Win 8.1 camera app to "see" the camera with the ASUS driver.
 Only the stock Microsoft Win 8.1 driver works.&nbsp; Also, I have tried the Windows 8 compatibility install options. The compatibility option does not work with .SYS or .DLL files that are part of the ASUS driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is really needed is a registry key option for the Microsoft stock driver that would allow a vertical flip. I have tried the "manycams" option but it turns the camera on permanently once installed, plus it doesn't seem to work with Skype...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears many people are experiencing problems when upgrading 2011 laptops from ASUS with Chicony cameras. I like the way Window 8 works on a laptop and would prefer not to be forced to revert to Window 7.&nbsp; Please advise if this is possible or if there
 are any other options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Best "solution" I have found, is to install the Windows 7-drivers in Windows 8.1 Pro. This way the camera does not work under the modern Windows/Metro-layout, but when I install Skype for Desktop, it works. Skype for Desktop has an option to flip the image
 of the camera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is of course a non-solution, as it does not fix the underlaying problem. However, it works for me, as I only use my webcam for Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify: this will NOT work on the Skype app for Windows 8.1/modern layout/metro, only for "Skype for Desktop". And maybe it works with the stock drivers as well as the Windows 7-drivers. I did not try that. But Skype for Desktop definitely has more options
 to tweek webcam settings than the Skype App.</p>

<p>This issue caused me to stay with Windows 7 permanently on my 2011 ASUS Ultrabook. It is regrettable that it cannot be upgraded as a result of this driver issue. I question whether to ever purchase another ASUS notebook for fear that driver update support
 is very limited and their designs seem to require unique drivers. (If they had not installed the camera upside down, a special driver would not be required)....</p>

                    <span>
<p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>This is my first post here, so here goes.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded from Vista ultimate to Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit on two computers on my home network. There is also one Vista and one XP laptop on the network (that doesn't really matter). When I try to connect the two Windows 7 PCs, I get the above
 error 0x80070035 with, 'Check the spelling of the name. Otherwise, there might be a problem with your network. To resolve network problems, click Diagnose.' Diagnose, obviously doesn't work and since both PCs can connect to the internet, I presume its not
 a problem with the network. As a result of this problem, I also can't use Homegroup features. At this point I should also add that, when the antivirus software (Symantec endpoint protection) is disabled on the Vista laptop, both Windows 7 PCs can access the
 Vista laptop but it doesn't work Vice Versa. My Firewall on windows 7 is switched off on both PCs and the antivirus is disabled, so that doesn't work either. I should add that, as Vista PCs (before upgrade) the file sharing was never an issue.</p>
<p>If it matters, I'm using build 7600.16385, which is the retail/RTM version, with a D-Link router.</p>
<p>Please Help as I have been looking forward to the improved networking ability when it comes to Homegroup on Windows 7. I understand that Homegroup is only for Windows 7 and therefore will only apply to my two separate PCs.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help in advance and I am looking to resolve this as it is dampening my entire Windows 7 experience.</p>
<p>I am a mac convert so I am sorry if my language is noobish and please help me</p>
<p>and also if it matters, do the logon credentials have to be the same across the PCs?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p><span>I have few steps which might help you.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step1</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Check if “file and sharing” is enabled in firewall on the Windows 7 computer.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Turn on network discovery, file and printer sharing, and public folder sharing in Windows 7. To do this follows these steps:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open Advanced sharing settings by clicking the Start
 button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type network, click Network and Sharing Center, and then, in the navigation pane, click Change advanced sharing settings.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click the chevron to expand the Home or Work network
 profile.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select the options to turn on network discovery and
 file sharing.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under Public folder sharing, do one of the following:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To share your Public folders so that people on other
 computers on the network can open files in them but can't create or change files, click Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can open files.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>To share your Public folders so that people on other
 computers on the network can open files in them and also create or change files, click Turn on sharing so anyone with network access can open, change, and create files.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>7.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click Save changes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>In Windows 7 Network and Sharing:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Network Discovery should be ON (So it can see the other
 computers) </span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Network set to Private (Public is for hotspots, airports,
 etc)</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>File Sharing should be ON.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Public Folder Sharing must be ON
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Password Protected: OFF (unless you want to set up identical
 usernames and passwords on ALL <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>computers in your Network) If you have it ON, and no identical usernames/passwords set up, you will be asked for a username and password when you try to access a Windows 7 computer from an Vista computer,
 or a Vista computer.</span></p>

            <p>I had this same problem. Mine was caused by Flexisign by SAi. Go into C windows SysWOW64 in my case, I have a 64 bit operating system. Find 3 entries that start with SAi. Right click on those and change permissions to full control!! Then Delete Them!!! Now
 Go and empty your Recycle bin. Do a restart, and Whalla!!! It's Gone, For good! If you are smart,&nbsp;don't install anything by SAi. It took me over 2 weeks to get rid of these little parasites. But they are gone for good now! I sure hope this helps some people
 out. It worked here like a charm. I googled TODO &lt;File Description&gt; 32 bit several times. No one on google had the answer for this one, I was really surprised about that. But I kicked it's BUTT!!! It doesn't slow me down anymore. Go to task manager, click
 on more details. Click on details tab at the top. Look for SAi processes. Click details again and find where they are located on your system and Delete them. Empty your recycle bin, just to make sure they don't come back.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Just trying to help some people out,</p>

    <title>Xbox Game DVR Recording &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crimson eclipze  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Game DVR Recording &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    Well not sure if this will get any attention, or any feedback/responses, my issue here relies in when I try to use Xbox Game DVR for games I'm playing on PC, and with this it's about a 50/50 shot on it actually working, when it works, it works great, otherwise,
 you'll either get a black screen for a minute, or be left with a recording stuck on one frame of video, with all the audio in the background, this is disheartening, seeing as I've had a ton of great moments, that I wish I could've recorded and saved, but rather
 than that, it just presents me with the before listed results, is there any workaround to this, or any fixes I might need to try? Also, I don't back out of the game while recording, that isn't the issue here, thanks for reading, and thanks for your time and
 support

            Hi! I know that some Steam games disable this feature in order to prevent any performance hiccups from happening. So if you experience this issue only with certain titles, try searching online for information in order to find out if Windows 10 Game DVR
 was disabled for these titles.

            Thank you for your response, unfortunately, the issue relies in games I know can run Game DVR just fine, and like I stated it works 50/50, let say example, Rainbow Six Siege, I record only for it to record a black screen with nothing and just audio, or
 it works and records the whole prior minute and works just fine, is in not guaranteed to record? Or is it just a chance it may or may not? To this, I'm not sure, but thanks for your consideration either way, still open to responses&nbsp;

Alright, it took me a while to respond, sorry for that, but I've went on to see if the issue persisted and it did, thank you for taking the time to respond but all the troubleshooting options aren't really what I'm seeing any issue/aren't offering much of any
 solution to what is happening, I know the games I'm trying to record work with recording, because half the time it records it in full, audio in all, everything works fine, but other times, it just a black screen with audio in the background, is it just as
 simple as taking a 50/50 shot on it working? Or is it something on my end I'm missing, in this, I still don't get it, but anyway thanks in advance for any further responses, just want to see this issue be resolved

<p>Hey Crimson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've experienced issues like this in the past and it usually has something to do with a background program. See if there's anything in particular that you have running when it's working compared to when it's not working. Also, alt-tabbing can cause some
 inconsistencies with some games. Think back to when it didn't work, did you alt-tab that session prior to recording?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Hey Crimson,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've experienced issues like this in the past and it usually has something to do with a background program. See if there's anything in particular that you have running when it's working compared to when it's not working. Also, alt-tabbing can cause some
 inconsistencies with some games. Think back to when it didn't work, did you alt-tab that session prior to recording?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>
<p>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah actually, I think that's the issue there, I do alt tab but not during the recording, let's say I play for 2 hours I would alt + tab out to reply to a message on discord or look up something and an hour later I would record a clip, guess that's what
 it is then, thanks, but is there any work around other than having to reset my game completely when I alt + tab because usually I have to do that during a game session, if not, that's fine, just looking for any answer with that</p>

            If you're running the game in fullscreen mode, switching to windowed/borderless windowed mode may help. If it's a steam game, I would also recommend turning off their overlay.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it's as simple as that, but of course, there are so many variables it may take some trial and error.&nbsp;<br />

            Hello, I see that you are having some trouble getting your microphone working again. Before we get started, make sure that you have your microphone plugged in, or have the latest version of audio drivers installed. Go into your Sound Settings on your Windows 10, and select Recording Devices. Find your microphone and click on set as default. This should do the job!
<br />Hope this helps!

            Hi sontorahman, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to Privacy - Microphone 
<br />
<br />Make sure 'Allow apps to access your microphone' is turned on and make sure the appropriate app (Skype) is also set to On
<br />
<br />
<br />Then in Settings, go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - Recording Audio
<br />
<br />Run that troubleshooter
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you:
<br />
<br />The new Skype app it is being updated constantly to bring it up to the functionality of Skype 7 . . . 
<br />
<br />In order to improve Skype, please provide feedback to Microsoft regarding any shortcomings or bugs you have found in the new Skype app on this thread
<br />

<br />
<br />If you are unhappy with the new Skype app, Microsoft have decided to extend the period for which Skype Classic (version 7) will be available, the September deadline, no longer exists
<br />
<br />Here is the direct download link for Skype Classic:

<br />
<br />Press Enter
<br />
<br />After the install process finishes, you have the Windows 10 Skype app back
<br />
<br />If the problem persists, I suggest you install Skype Classic:
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,  then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            It's a Samsung LED TV SERIES 7. The HDMI lead being used was previously and since been used to my xbox. And proved to work fine.
<div><br />
<div>Method 1: Checked and still no audio.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 2 falls down at stage (e.) HDMI Output is not a selectable tab. And i've been unable to configure such a tab.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Will view the "Connect your computer to TV" pages. And report back if they produce a positive result. But as of now, back at square one. Thank you for your interest Sharath.</div>

            Having looked at the "Connect your computer to a TV" pages. It has presented the possibility that my motherboards HDMI output does not support audio, This would seem to me a huge oversight for a Gigabyte GA-Z77MX-D3H. But i've raised the issue with them
 as well. i will report back with my findings.

            Hi Sharath,
<div><br />
<div>Hold on a minute! lol&nbsp;</div>
<div>What do i do if the HDMI option at point (e.) of your instructions i missing? How i configure for a HDMI? THere are further driver selection option and such but at that point i become out of my depth. What do i need to do?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm still awaiting gigabytes response but having looked at the manual it appears the problem lays on the windows side. Can you walk me through the fix in the absence of a HDMI output in the sound control panel?</div>

            Please note that HDMI is not an audio out technology.&nbsp; It is a cable technology that allows audio and video to be sent out over one cable.<br />
<br />
Look through the sound control panel and enable the digital audio output.<br />

            I think most people reading this know that HDMI carries both a video &amp; audio signal. The confusion lies with why do i have a video signal and no audio to accompany it?
<div><br />
<div>As i've stated previously i have already looked through the sound control panel. To no avail. To clarify the options presented to me are:</div>
<div>-Speakers high definition Audio Device</div>
<div>-Digital Audio (S/PDIF)&nbsp;high definition Audio Device</div>
<div>-Digital Audio (S/PDIF)&nbsp;high definition Audio Device</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried all combinations of Default/Ready/ even gone as far as disabling one at a time or all but one. Do i need to go into Properties to create a&nbsp;-Digital Audio (HDMI)&nbsp;high definition Audio Device profile perhaps? If so how?&nbsp;</div>

            Ok i've had a response from gigabyte saying to check drivers are installed. √&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Appart from that everything should be working fine. I guess in a round about sort of way i have been asking for the properties of a Digital Audio (HDMI) profile. As i do not have one set up as default. I have a speaker 3.5 jack out and two optical jack
 profiles that are identical.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can i now ask directly for the properties of a &nbsp;digital Audio (HDMI) profile so that i might configure one?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is quite ridiculous that you have engineers spending time on touch screen features. When basic functionality is still an issue. I could and have in fact plug some separate speakers in to be getting on with. Or i could plug and unplug a 3.5 jack every
 time i wanted to flip between sources for my TV. But i don't really want my system to be cobbled together like some Heath Robinson project.</div>

            Bump still stuck. Don't suppose anyone out there could give the profile in properties off a working Digital Audio HDMI profile. So that i can try to copy them on my system. Since it has fail to come up on the default settings in Windows 8.

<p><span>Hi Joe,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Are you using Windows Mail or Outlook as your email program?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Steps to disable “Auto spell check” in Windows Mail</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span>Windows Mail comes with built-in spell checking features; the spellchecker can be enabled or disabled as you want, and you can configure the spellchecker
 to be silent until the point when you are ready to actually send an email message. Microsoft also lets you customize the language for which you are going to check the spelling, and customize into details which words should be checked or ignored.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to access and customize the spell checking settings and options in Windows Mail:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you are inside Windows Mail, click on the<strong>Tools</strong> menu </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Choose
 "<strong>Options</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>When
 the<em>Options</em> dialog opens, click on the "<strong>Spelling</strong>" tab: this is where Windows Mail centralizes all available spell checking settings you can configure.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>The
 first option these accessible through the "<strong>Always check spelling before sending</strong>" checkbox: if checked, Windows Mail will not let you send an email message before warning you of any grammatical mistakes or spelling errors that may have caught.
 You can uncheck this option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re using Outlook, then visit the link below to know<strong>how to turn off automatic spelling checking and automatic grammar checking
 in Office programs</strong></span></p>

                    When I try to add a new user for my partner it types numbers instead of letters in the field for email. I am going crazy!!! keyboard works fine until I go into change settings and click on users and then add users. I start to type in users name or email
 and all it does is numbers!!! I know my keyboard works fine or I would not be typing this. Drivers are supposedly updated. I installed a driver update thing, paid $40.00 and it still did not fix the problem.PLEASE HELP SOMEONE!!! I am not that computer savvy!
 I had to do a recovery a couple months ago and it messed everything up and it took me hours to get everything back to the way it was before. My printer would not work and that was the reason for that recovery. PLEASE HELP SOMEONE????

<h2>            Where&#39;s the &#34;Wait for the program to respond&#34; option in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I recently upgraded to windows 10, and it's alright, I suppose. Cortana and the start menu don't work but whatever, that's not the topic right now. My computer is a fairly slow one but things manage to run, if I wait for the program to respond. But since
 the update, it won't give me the option to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b13094c-cf06-4322-971a-bebffd5a922b" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It skips this pop up menu and just crashes it. I'm just asking if ANYONE has seen the option to wait for the program to respond in Windows 10, or if there's a way I can bring this back. I need this option because I use an art program without an autosave
 and it tends not to respond often near the end when the file is big, but it always works after I just let it process. Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>

    <title>problem with flight simulator x locking up during game play - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> triple t photography  say:</h3>
<h2>            problem with flight simulator x locking up during game play</h2>
                    Good day, since loading my Flight Simulator X on my 64 bit version of Windows 7, the game will lock up on a regular basis and the only way to unlock is ctrl alt del and end task. Is there a fix for this problem? I looked up msxml 4.0 and found several
 versions. The latest indicates it's for XP and Vista and once installed cannot be removed. Sorry but can't seem to find the correct version of msxml 4.0 and being a rookie I'm leary of haphazardly downloading something in the off chance it'll solve my problem.
 Is there a fix for this so a rookie can resolve the problem. And remember, the game is loaded and works.....it just continously locks up during game play. Thanks in advance, Terry
