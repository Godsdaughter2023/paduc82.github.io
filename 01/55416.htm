    <title>How do I stop a window from always being on top&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I stop a window from always being on top&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I use Adobe Photoshop, for some reason the Adobe Photoshop window constantly wants to be on top. For example, whenever the Photoshop window is open, even if I click on other windows that are open on screen, the other windows will continue to appear
 to be beneath the Photoshop window. I have to minimize the Photoshop window before I can access the other windows. I don't know how to stop this from happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The worst thing is when a dialogue box pops up behind the Photoshop window, but since it is being covered by the Photoshop window, I have no way of closing the dialogue box. This especially bad when the computer doesn't allow me to do anything else - including
 not being able to minimize or close Photoshop - until I close that hidden dialogue box that I can't even see. My only option when that happens is to try to make use of the remaining space on the screen not currently occupied by the Photoshop window in order
 to open the task manager and force Photoshop to close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I stop the Photoshop window from being on top all the time?</p>

    <title>Puzzling Keyboard &#38; Mouse Problems Arise When Starting Game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sdg411  say:</h3>
<h2>            Puzzling Keyboard &#38; Mouse Problems Arise When Starting Game</h2>
                    <p>I am absolutely puzzled at an issue I am consistently running into with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;Every single time I start any game on my computer, my mouse &amp; keyboard start to act weird. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am in a game, the tab button on my keyboard will instantly go to an alt-tab status, meaning I can hit the tab key once and Windows will cycle thru all available windows. &nbsp;The Escape key also changes function, whereas as soon as I get into a game,
 the Esc key will now act as a minimizer for the game window and take me directly out of the game to my desktop on every key press. &nbsp;The game doesn't close, just minimize. &nbsp;Most other keys on my keyboard seem to work, but I do believe the Enter key changes
 as well, but I haven't tested this out fully to say it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time this occurs to my keyboard, my mouse buttons also act weird. &nbsp;Inside of the game shell, the left click works fine, but the right click doesn't function at all. &nbsp;When I goto my desktop, a single left click works fine, but double left clicking is
 now different and if I dbl click on a shortcut or file, Windows will take me to the properties window of the file/shortcut. &nbsp;Right click still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the main keys/clicks I've found to be so problematic and consistent when starting a game anytime after a bootup. &nbsp;The problem can occur after 6 hours of my PC running and just starting a game or 2 minutes after a bootup. &nbsp;It only happens when starting
 a game, and could be any game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've completely uninstalled my devices and reinstalled them. &nbsp;Ran them w/o installing drivers &amp; software for the devices and even swapped a keyboard out and had the exact same problem every single time. &nbsp;I have removed the devices in the device manager and
 booted in safe mode to remove any lingering drivers for the devices that I can find. &nbsp;I've disabled any windows accessibility features I can find (sticky keys etc), and when the problem has occurred, I've stopped every task possible in Task Manager to try
 and narrow down the problem. &nbsp;Still cannot figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, sometimes the problem is short lived and either goes away or fixes itself after my facerolling all over the keyboard. &nbsp;The problem doesn't seem to reoccur after it has happened from a fresh booth and recovered after that, but it consistently happens
 after every fresh boot up. &nbsp;The problem can last tho until I restart my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Quick update to my issue: I narrowed the problem down to a single mouse button that I had mapped to the ; key. &nbsp;The Logitech G700 has 4 buttons on the side and 3 on top plus the left/rclicks. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, which I still haven't figured out, is when I pressed the button that was mapped to the ; key often in a game, it would toggle on ALT keylock. &nbsp;I couldn't figure out anywhere that this keystroke would toggle on ALT keylock, or anything that
 associated the mouse button with the ALT key at all. &nbsp;This problem was intermittent tho and didn't exactly act as a toggle, but would lock on the ALT key and wouldn't unlock with consecutive presses. &nbsp;Not even the onscreen keyboard could unlock the ALT keylock
 once this issue arose most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I had uninstalled the drivers &amp; software multiple times to no avail. &nbsp;Then I realize that my G700 mouse stores 'profiles' in the mouse itself, not in the software (or on my computer) which is one of the reason this issue was so puzzling and I think
 the cause in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then cleared the onboard mouse memory, uninstalled &amp; reinstalled everything and remapped the button to a different keyboard key and the problem hasn't arose since,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot would have done nothing as the issue I believe was caused by the mouse's onboard stored memory profiles. &nbsp;It was my original error in not swapping out the mouse to try to isolate the problem before posting the issue here (I just didn't have
 another mouse handy). I realize it's standard fanfare to point to the obvious 'software conflicts', however I had already eliminated any software conflicts before I posted this issue.</p>

    <title>Surface Laptop 2 Touchpad not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamielo1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 Touchpad not working</h2>
                    <p>It seems as though my touchpad has just stopped functioning properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my Surface Laptop 2 in December 2018 and from then till around two weeks ago the touchpad was working. I stopped using it for a week or so and when I turned the computer back on the touchpad seemed to be a little strange. Over time scrolling became
 more difficult as when I tried to click something or scroll down, the cursor would select everything and highlight all the text or photos on my page. At first, it did not occur too often but as the week goes on the touchpad just gets worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I try to use the touchpad to do anything other than moving the cursor it does not respond at all and when it does it highlights everything on the screen. I have resorted to using a Bluetooth&nbsp;mouse which is working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to try and fix these problems?</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We really sorry for the inconvenience that has caused you on your Surface touchpad that won't work properly. We really understand that this is important also with you. There's a different of probable causes why this happening to your Surface Type Cover.
 This could be a software related issue which can be fixed by doing troubleshooting steps. This could also be hardware issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For us to better understand that concern, please answer the questions;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>Is there any changes on the Surface device before this issue happened?</em></li><li><em>Have you tried any troubleshooting steps on your Surface touchpad? If yes, what are those steps?</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here are the few things we can highly suggests you do;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Press
 and hold the power button for 20 seconds.&nbsp;<span>The Surface may boot to UEFI. This is normal. Please exit UEFI screen.
<em>(</em><span><em>The device may be in a “hung” state. Force Surface to completely turn off all power and restart.&nbsp;</em><span><em>Performing a forced shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets
 the hardware and clears all the cache and memory for your hardware)</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong>We will make sure your Surface device is up-to-date. To check the updates, go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Update and Security &gt; Windows Update, </strong>on the right side please tap/click the button "<strong>Check for updates"</strong> for us to know if there's any pending updates that needs to be installed on your Surface device.
<em>(Note: If there's any pending update on your Surface device, please do the update and while the Surface device is downloading/installing the updates, please do not perform any steps on your Surface device, let the Surface device completely installed the
 updates).</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Please download and run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit on this link
<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/surfacerepair</a>&nbsp; it is a self-healing tool which looks for potential issues and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. The tool takes about
 15-30 minutes to run.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Uninstall/R-install Keyboard driver.&nbsp;</strong>On your Surface Laptop, at the lower left corner in search box, please search for "<strong>Device Manager"
</strong>then enter. On the pop-up window for Device Manager, at the top there's a tab for
<strong>"</strong><strong>File, Action, View and Help"</strong> tab. Please click/tap the
<strong>"View" </strong>tab then tap/click on the <strong>Show Hidden Devices. </strong>
On the same pop-up window, please tap/click on the <strong>"Keyboard" </strong>then there's a drop-down for
<strong>"HID Keyboard Device"&nbsp; </strong>kindly click/tap <strong>on each</strong> and then tap/click "<strong>Uninstall device"
</strong>click/tap <strong>"Uninstall".&nbsp;</strong>In order to re-install the keyboard driver, please
<strong>RESTART </strong>the Surface device so that the software/firmware will refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. Looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me so quickly, I did not notice any change on my device before the issue started happening; I have tried all the steps and the touchpad is still not working. It only worked momentarily before it started to glitch and highlight
 everything again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Your console has lost connection w&#47;the game server</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Getting kicked from every 2 or 3 matchmaking games on Halo 5. </strong>
</p>
<p>Started Wednesday, 10.28. Does not lose connection with xbox live and the games have excellent connection when i am not getting kicked. I have my router dialed in with DMZ and so on and a great internet, all of which have worked well for previous games as
 well as on the Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Maybe the issue will be fixed assuming it is before my modem, but it would be great not to have to wait weeks to be able to really play the multiplayer part of the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>What Country/State/Province do you live in? Louisiana</span></p>
<p><span>Modem brand &amp; model number: **** CM820</span></p>
<p><span>Router brand &amp; model number: TpLink TL-WR841N</span></p>
<p><span>How many Xbox 360 and Xbox One consoles are connected to this router?: One</span></p>
<p><span>Wired or Wireless (for each console): Wired</span></p>
<p><span>Things you have tried: &nbsp;Everything (console reboots, clear mac address, reboot modem/router, NEW modem, connected directly TO modem, internet settings and tests, different cables and cords, reset router to factory to then
 re-apply the settings for OPEN NAT and DMZ; also had the ISP technician come out to run tests.)</span></p>
<p><span>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/No/Unknown: YES</span></p>
<p><span>Who is your ISP? (Internet Service Provider): Suddenlink</span></p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DETAILED NETWORK STATISTICS</span></p>
<p><span>Upload: 80 mb/s</span></p>
<p><span>Download: 8 mb/s</span></p>
<p><span>Packet Loss: 0%</span></p>
<p><span>MTU: 1480</span></p>
<p><span>Ping: 79 ms</span></p>
<p><span>NAT Type: Open</span></p>
<p>I welcome any insight that i won't find on the xbox help pages, as i'm aware of and have gone through all of that, or you just taking into consideration that it is quite possible that something is amiss with the servers, if it is not my ISP having cable
 issues of their own.</p>

            I’ve checked using Safari on my iPad &amp; get an error saying it couldn’t establish a connection so imo either the site is having problems or the domain name has expired &amp; they are in the process of renewing, hence why you’re asked whether you wish to purchase the domain name.
<br />It’s a surprise a Government domain has been allowed to lapse but not unknown.

            Having re-read your message I realise it isn’t the Gov site which isn’t sending you to buy the domain but the comments I made about the domain name having lapsed is still valid.
<br />If you post the URL then I’ll check that too.

<h2>            ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED for a specific website after being hacked</h2>
                    <p>In June my Steam account was hijacked and hacked, and my items were stolen from my account.</p>
<p>What is most distressing is that I cannot access any form of Steam servers from my main laptop; I get the error message:</p>
<p>
This webpage is not available
</p><div style="color: rgba(119, 119, 119, 1)">
<p><span>ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED</span><br />
</p>
</div>
<p>
</p><p>This is only on my main laptop - my old laptop and other computers in the house can access it fine.</p>
<p>Because I cannot access Steam servers on this computer, I can't get to the support pages that Valve offer, and cannot completely recover my account on this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already run several anti-malware programs and network checks, along with steps such as clearing cookies and cache, but nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if this has to do with a security certificate on this particular laptop which was criminalised in some form?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Cameron</p>

            I apologize for the late reply but in case you have not figured it out yet, you can give yourself permission to edit the file by right-clicking it, going to properties, going to securities, and giving yourself (the user) access to writing and modifying
 the file. Then, you should be able to edit the file, as I have found out.

<h3> dan cole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling Windows XP Home Edition</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to reinstall Windows XP Home Edition to reinstate my computer to ensure a recent malicious antivirus scan malware application is eliminated.</p>
<p>When attempting to install Windows XP Home Edition from the XP disc, the installation prompt says it cannot install XP as the version currently on my computer is newer than the one on the disc. The disc is an original licensed copy V2002.</p>
<p>How can I get past this or delete Windows XP from my hard drive to allow me to reinstall XP Home Edition?</p>

<p>First of all you are trying to perform a Repair Install and not a Clean Install. Keep in mind that a Repair Install will not rid your PC of malware.</p>
<p>Second of all, even if a Repair Install were warranted, you are booting off the hard drive instead of the CD (it is recommended to boot off the CD, by the way). Furthermore, your CD is at an earlier SP level than what is installed on your hard drive.</p>
<p>If you want to perform a Clean Install, that would surely get rid of your malware, but it would get rid of everything else, too. Have you safely backed up all your data (office documents, e-mails and address book, browser favorites, mp3s, photos, videos,
 etc.) to external media (like an external hard drive)?</p>
<p>As I see it, your choices are to perform a Clean Install of XP Home, which can be very time-consuming or simply remove the malware. Depending on the malware and the anount of damage done, you might very well wish to avoid the Clean Install.</p>
<p>What is the name of the malware? If we know what it is, we can probably guide you to ensure it is completely gone.</p>
<p>If you would like to perform a Clean Install, we can give you pointers. What SP level is your XP Home installation CD at? (If it's the original edition, it's pre-SP1.) Also, what is the make and model of the PC? Is this the disk that came with the PC?</p>

<p>I believe the malware is Antivirus scan malware possibly Zlob.fam but I cannot locate its files to be sure. I suspect it is sleeping in the PC right now as I ma not seeing it but don't believe it could just go away as mysteriously as it appeared. I wanted
 a clean boot sector for installation to be sure it's gone. Otherwise I would not have confidence that someone is gathering keystroke data when I use the PC.</p>
<p>I already have the boot order as CDRom - hard disc - disabled third boot. Despite how I restart the PC it seems to actually boot from hard disc rather than CD. If I insert the XP CD I get the failure mentioned above. The details behind the dialogue box suggest
 if I proceed anyway with the installatiuon of the older versionall settings will be lost. I can appreciate that would be true but it does not let me proceed to installt the older version from the disc.</p>
<p>I think I prefer the clean install. Is it simply a matter of formatting my hard disc to clean it before installing from the disc?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Regarding the Clean Install, again, what is the make and model of the PC? Is this the disk that came with the PC? Do you have access to all the hardware drivers? Installation files or CDs of all your programs? Is all your data backed up, including e-mails
 and address book and browser favorites?</p>
<p>Bleeping Computer's removal guides usually do the trick. Unfortunatley, you didn't identify the malware (other than the fact that "Antivirus" is a part of it). But search through some of these hits:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=antivirus+removal+guide+site%3Ableepingcomputer.com&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=antivirus+removal+guide+site%3Ableepingcomputer.com&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=</a></p>
<p>It might help to jog your memory. And then just follow the directions from the appropriate guide.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I stop email sharing between accounts&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a two 365 accounts (one for my company [A], one at a company I work with [B]) and two google accounts (one for my company [A] and one for another company I work with [C]). I want to see calendar events from my company gmail [A] and the other company
 gmail [C] in one place, so I added both accounts to the windows calendar app. Great! It worked - all very good. BUT I then noticed that some emails from my company gmail [A] appeared in the 365 Outlook account for company [B], which I cannot have happening
<em>at </em><em>all</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I stop the office 365 account for [B] from receiving email from [A]? I'm extremely concerned about this having happened in the first place and for now have had to disconnect windows calendar from my [A] account. Why would email sent to [A] appear in
 [B]? They are different 365 accounts. All I want to do is combine calendars!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi InterestedBystander 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />What app are you using?
<br />I would suggest using just the calendar app built into Windows.
<br />That is what I use for my gmail and corporate account and don't have any issues.

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I did was add my company gmail to the standard Windows calendar app - some emails to my own business gmail account from a particular contact then somehow appeared in the 365 account I have with a different company. The contact in question also emails
 me at that 365 account (and so is known to that 365 account), but I was distressed to see email sent only to my own company gmail appearing in the Outlook account inbox at the&nbsp;<em>other</em> company - as my contact's company and the one I have the 365 account
 with are competitors, that absolutely should not be happening, and I don't know how it did (ie I did not forward anything).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it is I've unlinked my accounts from Windows calendar (I don't use Windows/Outlook to manage my own company email) - I don't know what else to do other than not to use it.</p>
        </p>

            Oh okay.
<br />I think what could have happened to is when you compose a new email you need to make sure you check the From box and make sure it is focused on the email box you want to send from.
<br />I have done that before, where I have sent a personal email using my corp account because the from was corp rather than personal.

</p><p>I didn't send any email, just added my gmail account to my own Office 365, and then found emails from my gmail inbox in the Outlook inbox for the 365 account with the other company when I logged in to check it.&nbsp;</p>

            I see. That should not happen. 
<br />I would suggest you give your office 365 support a call.
<br />See if they have heard of this issue.  
<br />Let me know what they say if you don’t mind and sorry I cant be more help.

<h2>            Splitting Family account</h2>
                    
<p>Thinking of purchasing a family account, however only 1 would be used on my console. The remaining 3 would be used on my wifes console for her account and 2 kids accounts. Is this possible? as I have had my account for 6 yrs and don't want to lose everything.</p>
<p>Is the Family account done by 4 codes or another way?</p>

<p>For the Family Plan, you will need to purchase it with your gamertag making it the primary account, then add all of the other gamertags onto your console (just to add them to the family plan). Once you have all of the gamertags added to your family plan
 then you can re-download them onto the other console and all will have Xbox Live Gold. Here is a

<p>Have read through alot of the FAQ on family pack, it doesn't say all accounts have to be on one console, and that I just add their ID's to the secondary accounts.</p>

<p>HLR, that is true. They need to be all on the same console in order to be added to the family pack but after that they can be recovered and used anywhere.</p>

</p><p>There is not a portable charging option for Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>One&nbsp;option you can consider is using an inverter.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 not asking for password when connecting to password-protected Windows XP network shares</h2>
                    My netbook running Windows 7 Enterprise is not asking for a password when I try to access a Windows XP Professional machine (which I will call the server machine) with password-protected shares, and instead gives an error about not having permission to
 access to the password-protected shares on the server machine. I can still see a listing of the shares and access shares that I have given "Everyone" full access to, but get the error about permissions when I select a share that I only gave one user account
 to access over the network. However, I have checked on another Windows 7 machine and two Windows XP machines on the same network, and they all ask for a username and password when I select the server machine in the computer list, and I then have access to
 all shares.

 a Live account to view pictures that I put in a SkyDrive folder until I convinced him to...&nbsp; So now that I receive emails from him, and the header says that it is from

<p><span>So tell me, how does Live Mail work, since it is obviously NOT like Outlook Express at all...&nbsp; Why is it routing his email, based on his ISP, through Live, and is there
 a way to avoid this, as he doesn't want this to happen?</span></p>

<h2>            administrator account</h2>
                    This morning on opening my computer it did not give me the administrator account. I could only connect with a standard account. Impossible to find the administrator account. I always get the box in which you are asked to give a name and password, but no
 box to type in these values. How can I get my administrator account back? Thank you for your answer.

            <p>Thank you so much for this information. Now I see on the instructions that in order to run the tool you need to be an administrator !!!</p>
<p>My question is : can I run the tool on another computer and then use the USB drive on my computer and follow your instructions? Or do I have to do it on my computer knowing that I am not an administrator...</p>
<p>I have downloaded the "download tool now" (which is only a small file called MediaCreationTool.exe.</p>
<p>I suppose I have to run this on a computer and that it will then install the necessary files on the USB stick, or am I wrong?</p>

            <p>Before I start to do this repair, are you sure that I will not need to be administrator to perform the above procedures? I have already gone to the troubleshoot and so on part after putting the computer in safe mode, but when I try to put in the line net
 user... I always get the error message 5 saying that I have no&nbsp;right to make the changes. Will this be different when I do the procedure with the USB key to go into the windows repair?</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer(s).</p>
<p>ps I tried also to enter the register (suggestion on the internet) and to change the value in "state" for the administrator, but similarly, I cannot change that value (which is supposed to be at zero but which is set at 0x00000100) probably because I have
 no administrator rights.</p>
<p>If you think that Monica's procedure will work without the administrator rights, then I will proceed to that.</p>

            Does Monica think, or does she know, that it works without the administrator rights? Because that is the problem, I don't have those rights. The administrator does no longer appear on my start menu, this happened due to an update from windows during the
 night. So I can only connect myself to my computer with an invited account.

            <p>It would stand to reason that Monica's suggestion will probably work as booting from the installation media, you are not signed into Windows with restricted privileges, so I would definitely give it a go . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, the only other option is to try to restore your system back to a time before tha update that you say has caused all this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to do that, press the Shift key while clicking Restart - this will bring you to the Windows 10 Recovery Environment</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if there is a recent Restore Point you can go back to, this may undo the changes that caused the Administrator Account to disappear.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But I definitely would try Monica's solution first.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A word to the wise, if and when you do get it sorted out, make your account an administrator account so you do not have to go through all this again . . .</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue could occur due to corrupted system files or conflict with a third-party application. We suggest that you start your PC in Safe Mode wherein it will use a limited set of files and drivers. You can
 refer to this article (<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10</a></strong>) on how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We also recommend you to perform a Clean Boot to eliminate software conflicts, and to determine what conflict is causing the problem. Please visit this article on

            I think I understand now.&nbsp; I thought the operating system had more to do with "Intel Inside" or something. something other than Windows 10. Turns out, Windows 10 IS the operating system. Can't get much more closely related than that!&nbsp; Sorry for my confusion;
 I am sort of new to this stuff.<br />

<h2>            I cannot get Spider Solitaire and Mahjong Titans to run</h2>
                    <p>Original title: <strong>Microsoft Games</strong></p>
<p>I have been playing Microsoft games (spider solitaire &amp; mahjong titans) and today I cannot get the games to run. &nbsp;I played them yesterday. The game selection appears, I can choose a game and click it (or right click and choose play) &nbsp;and nothing happens.
 I have not made any changes in hardware or software. It just stopped working. I use Microsoft Window 7 ultimate.
</p>
<div>I tried "Fix It" and it gave me an update or re-install for DirectX. I did that and still no change in the ability to play any game. I know its not the laptop &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(HP TouchSmart PC) because I have been playing games on it for months.
 Has this happened to anyone else?? &nbsp;Thank You :o)</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try the following steps and see if it helps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s first try opening the games from the source folder (Program Files) and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>Navigate to the following location on your hard disk:</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Program Files\Microsoft Games</span></p>
<p><span>Try and open the games and check what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to turn off the Windows feature for games and turn it on again and check if that helps you to play the games.
</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, follow the link given below.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Uncheck Games and restart the computer to disable the games. Re-check the same and restart to enable the games.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Turn
 Windows features on or off</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you are still facing the issue, then you can try runnig the System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing or corrupt files &amp; check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
<span>For further information, you can refer to the following link.</span></p>

 File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 4:</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>You can also refer to the manufacturer’s website and try updating the Graphics card and check.</span></p>

    <title>I&#39;ve been charged twice for one DLC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phatsniperuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            I&#39;ve been charged twice for one DLC</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I purchased a pre paid 2100 points card today and redeemed it on my Xbox fine a few hours ago. I then attempted to purchase 'Alan Wake - The Writer' DLC for 560 points and received an error code. My points balance dropped by the 560 points so I assumed the
 purchase went through and the download had trouble starting so I tried again with the same result but with my points balance staying the same.</p>
<p>I've been following the status page and realised there are technical difficulties so I waited a while and just tried again now. Success, the DLC is now downloading but I've also been charged ANOTHER 560 MS Points, paying twice for the same DLC.</p>
<p>For the record I checked my download history before I tried purchasing again and the DLC did not show up on the list at all! I totally understand you are working on the problems right now but obviously I'm concerned I've lost 560 points and would like to
 know if they will be refunded automatically as the service is brought back online.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>samething, I bought 1000 points then tried to download a game for 800 points. It took my points and then a error downloading. The game I bought is not in my download history. I called support but they said its an active issue they are trying to fix and because
 its an active issue they would not refund my points so i could download it again. Its funny how there was no issue taking my money just with giving me what i paid for and refunding me. So in the end they said to wait and see if my points get updated back to
 me and if not just keep calling back everyday until its no longer an active issue, then they can refund my points back to my account. From what I've read on other post this has been an active issue for a long time and some people believe its was designed to
 mess up the download sometimes to increase their profit. Also no one I read about has gotten a refund and peobably never will...... I should have got a PS3.</p>

<p>Thanks BOBBOOB for informing us on the situation when you rang them. As I've stated I have no way to ring from home so it'll be a while before I can get hold of them myself to try and resolve the issue. I understand that it's an issue they're still fixing
 but I would have hoped those of us who got basically robbed of our money would automatically get refunded, especially as we brought it to their attention here.</p>
<p>When I get through to them myself I'll put the information here, please do let us know if you have any luck with them!</p>

<p>hurry up and give me my points back, buying this game was a fathers day present that i haven't got to use yet and when my five yr old daughter keeps asking me why im not playing my game yet and i have to say its because the bad people won't give me it, you
 are creating another person who will love playstation and hate xbox, over 800 points, come on refund them now and if i get double credited later at least youll still have an entire family not switching to playstation forever. Losen up the purse strings cheapo.
 Its your mistake anyway. I have already been waiting all day for what i paid for.</p>
