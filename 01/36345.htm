            Some of my devices and applications are not working, what should I do?<br />
<br />
A: If your internet connection is working in Windows 7, I suggest you try obtaining the drivers through Windows Update. Click Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Windows Update &gt; Turn on Windows Update. A list of available updates will then be downloaded, you will have
 the option to view them, do so and check off the appropriate drivers or software patches you need and click Install. You can also check the manufacturer’s website for patches, updated drivers or to simply find out about Windows 7 support for the particular
 product.

    <title>update removes taskbar icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanhutchings  say:</h3>
<h2>            update removes taskbar icons</h2>
                    performed MS update, numerous fixes For Win Vista. Unfortunately once again one of them removed Volume and Network icons from Notification area and greyed out the Volume and Network check boxes in the Control Panel's Start Menu and Taskbar Properties Notification
 Area tab. Clock and Power are still there, not greyed out. I really like Network and Volume to be there too. Can't updates leave my Volume and Network icons alone? How do I get them back? Last time&nbsp;Fixit50229.msi corrected the problem, but this time it did
 not.&nbsp;

<h2>            Update 1903 destroyed performance on my PC.</h2>
                    After the update, I am getting major frame loss in gamess, programs taking double the time to open, and crazy lag in the desktop. Drivers are updated, no issues with RAM or hardware. Would love to know if there is a fix available because I can't rollback
 to an older version anymore.

            Hi Nicholas
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809 , if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

<h2>            FTP problem. Can not upload larger files.. &#40;no issue with small files upload&#47;transfer less than 20kb&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><br />
Hello support team,</p>
<p>Last 2 days I am not able to upload files (FTP) to the remote server from my laptop with vista on it.&nbsp; Problem uploading files with size over 20kb.&nbsp;&nbsp; It seems after windows updates - service pack 2 and some security patches it stops uploading files correcty...&nbsp;
 It was working OK before these updates...as I am doing FTPs every day....</p>
<p>I tried using filezilla..&nbsp; which gives error 'time out' after upload of about 20kb file..</p>
<p>When tried FTP from command prompt.. It keeps waiting for over 1 hr for a this such a small file of 25kb and then gives time out error.</p>
<p>When tried uploading very small file of 15kb. it works OK, file transfer for this tiny file takes just 1.5 seconds.. so that's fine with the small file.. but the problem is when loading files over 20kb..&nbsp;</p>
<p>I disabled norton antivirus, firewall but the problem still exist...</p>
<p>I could not find any solution to this issue so raising the supoort request here. Please assist in solving this problem..&nbsp; I have 2 laptops bought recently having windows vista home premium and this problem appeared on both these machines at almost same time
 as it updated service pack 2 and some security related patches...</p>
<p>I have another desktop PC with XP on it and that works OK for all FTPs.&nbsp; So it seems no issue with ISP or remote server as FTP is working properly with XP machine..&nbsp; So the problem seems to be VISTA laptops recently (3 days ago) updated with Vista service
 pack 2 or associated security patches updated.. <br />
<br />
Please help...</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>
<span>Hi Pushkar2009,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>I have few steps here that might fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>You may have to change the settings for FTP under internet explorer settings, follow the steps to change the settings:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Open Internet Explorer &gt;&gt; click Tools&gt;&gt; click Internet Options&gt;&gt; Click on Advanced Tab&gt;&gt; under Browsing, find Use Passive FTP (for Firewall and DSL modem Compatibility) and put
 a check mark&gt;&gt; click apply &gt;&gt; click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now check if you can upload the files greater than 20kb, if the issue still persists, go to Step 2.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>Click Start&gt;&gt; click on All Programs &gt;&gt; click on Accessories &gt;&gt; right click on the command prompt &gt;&gt; click on “Run as Administrator”, now in the command prompt copy and paste
 this command “<strong>netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled</strong>” (without quotes), this command is used to disable the TCP/IP autotuning.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Now check if you are able to upload the files, if the issue is not resolved, I suggest that you enable the TCP/ IP autotuning level to normal from the below commands.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Paste this command in the elevated command prompt “<strong>netsh interface tcp set global autotuningl=normal” (without quotes)</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>If the issue is not resolved,&nbsp;go to Step 3 and download a hotfix from the link below:<br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
Step 3:</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>You may be unable to use an FTP application to upload a file to a remote server on a computer that has Internet Explorer 7 installed:

<h2>            CANT get this printer to work at all&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Howdy,&nbsp;<br />
I have been trying to get this stupid printer to work for 2 weeks now, and It seems like nothing I try has worked. It's an HP deskjet 6940, brand new ink, connected via usb (I have an all in one and unplugging it to take both over closer to the internet modem
 would be a pain, which is the only reason I have not attempted to set it up wirelessly.) &nbsp;I purchased it second hand, and DID witness it working with no issues before purchasing.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have followed all the step-by-step tutorials from both HP and windows websites, including doing things such as removing the device completely and then reinstalling, checking for driver updates, &nbsp;restarting the spooling services, resetting the printer, etc
 etc. NOTHING is working! My computer sees the printer, but anything I try to print just sits pending.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am running windows 10 anniversary edition, and have attempted windows printer trouble shooter also.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If anyone can help me, I would be SO Thankful. I have never had a problem with such a simple appliance, and this is beyond frustrating. I HAVE to be able to print some school work tomorrow and i'm just in panic mode now. Please help!

            <p>HP no longer offers support for this printer. Their step-by-step simply ends with 'you can now use your printer'....No I can't.&nbsp;<br />
The step by step instructs to ensure that windows is configured to automatically update when installing, which I have selected. But, when its connected I hear the USB connection sound, but nothing happens past that. Windows sees the printer, but everything
 sits pending.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, they sent me to you guys.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
I'm a single mother and a full time student. I literally spent ALL the money I had on this printer and the ink for it. Neither windows nor HP will help me to get it working, and I cant afford to buy a different printer. So where do I go from here? Am I just
 out of luck? </p>

    <title>Occasional BSOD after installing new graphics card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miniegun  say:</h3>
<h2>            Occasional BSOD after installing new graphics card</h2>
                    <p>Recently I installed a new graphics card and RAM into my computer as well as a new fresh SSD. The graphics card and RAM are compatible and I have a big enough power supply for it. Ever since installing the new graphics cards I have been getting BSOD and
 the errors seem to point to a driver related issue. I did a clean uninstall and reinstall of my Nvidia drivers hoping it would fix it but it didn't. Also, a few errors ago I had an error that apparently was related to my network driver, which I updated as
 well. I am still getting BSOD and my last one was memory corruption related according to a quick Google of the error. When I am playing games that I put on my new SSD, I often get fatal errors and the game crashes. Once again I'm not sure if this is driver
 related. The errors and BSOD are not consistent. Prior to tonight I haven't had a BSOD for 11 days. 11 days ago I had about 3-4 in two days. When the blue screens occur I am not doing anything new or different to what I usually do, nor am I stressing out my
 PC or graphics card. I am lost as two what driver is causing it, as I have installed fresh Nvidia drivers three times now and that is the only driver issue I would think is the culprit as prior to installing my new card I did not have blue screens (I had faulty
 RAM causing boot issues but that has been fixed with the new RAM installed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my last three minidump files as well as an MSinfo file:&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hUwmsjGhMIP1b8egfPKYEkoFw1zgNR2R?usp=sharing</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate help getting this fixed as myself and everyone I know are baffled as to what is causing my random blue screens.&nbsp;</p>

            - I don't think your Nvidia driver is the most recent version. The current version<em> 390.65</em> has security fixes that I believe are supposed
<p>to help offset performance issues caused by MS's meltdown/spectre patch (more details in the drivers Release Notes )</p>
<p>If you have been allowing Windows Updates to do your graphics drivers you may find updating them manually will</p>
<p>give better results.</p>
<p>Note that going off line before you reboot after uninstalling the current driver via Programs and Features</p>
<p>or using Display Driver Uninstaller (DDU), can help prevent Windows from reinstalling an older driver before you</p>
<p>get a chance to install your new driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Find.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NVIDIA Driver Downloads - Advanced Search</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You can also use the <em>Show/hide</em> tool in the article below to prevent Windows Updates from messing with your drivers</p>
<p>(The bi-annual 'feature' updates may override this though). </p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to temporarily prevent a Windows or driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You sometimes also have to update your BIOS when installing a newer graphics card. Also check with AsRock
</p>
<p>to see if they have released a more recent chipset driver for your motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- You may also want to disable the <em>itunes helper </em>and<em> Discord</em> in<em> Task Manager &gt; Starup</em>, at least while troubleshooting.</p>
<p>also check for updates to these two software, if you have not recently.</p>
<p>- <em>Game Mode</em> is still developing and is known to cause issues with some games (and generally not much help with others).</p>
<p>- Or, if you have&nbsp; Chrome browsers open while gaming, this could also be the problem ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is it a new GTX970 rather than a GTX1070, or second hand new to you 970 ? </p>

<p>- I will try updating my graphics driver, I do it manually through the Nvidia app (the option that only installs driver - not all the junk) but I'm not sure it being out-of-date is going to be the issue. All the drivers they have released since around November
 when I put the card in have all had the same issue, and I have used DDU to reinstall the drivers each time and it's had the same result.<br />
<br />
- I have disabled the Windows Update driver install. I did it when I first started having issues and it was suggested on another forum I read. I currently have a 'Feature Update' waiting to install now but I will install my driver first and then let the Windows
 Update do it's thing while I reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- My first assumption was a chipset update, which I downloaded of AsRock and did in the first week I plugged the new card in. It doesn't seemed to have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- iTunes and Discord are Disabled, just checked :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I didn't know about Game Mode, but my crashes (mostly with WoW) have returned driver/hardware/addon issues when I have searched the error. I eliminated addon errors, so it's down to hardware or driver, however most of my BSOD errors point to a driver issue
 of some sort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Is pretty much brand new. My GTX970 was used for about a week in a LAN PC by a friend. The PCs were pulled apart at the end of the week and one was given to me. It was purchased early last year.</p>

<p><em>"All the drivers they have released since around November when I put the card in have all had the same issue,"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so the new driver may not help in this instance, but because of the security fix it would be advisable to use it. Once installed</p>
<p>start looking for the real culprit. Whatever it is that sets the event in motion that eventually crashes the Nvidia driver.</p>

</p><p>If the 1709 feature update has not already downloaded, use the <em>Update Assistant</em> instead of Windows Updates. This is a bit safer</p>
<p>than allowing WU to do these big updates, partly because the download is done in one go, and partly because you can limit</p>
<p>what you are doing to simple tasks to allow more resources to be used for the download process.</p>

<p>
</p><p>- Personally, even though I have not had an issues from any of four 'feature' updates,&nbsp; I won't do one of these updates without
</p>
<p>making a clone of my Windows as a backup first.&nbsp; These big updates overwrite a lot of Windows, which does seem to lead to
</p>
<p>corrupted systems fairly regularly. Having a clone gives an original base to go back to and avoids the perils of a 'rollback'.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"most of my BSOD errors point to a driver issue of some sort."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>They almost always do, but often as not the driver gets tagged because it is the last thing to go down.</p>
<p>There are two drivers involved in the dump files - <em>win32kfull.sys&nbsp; and HAL.sys (Hardware abstraction layer)</em>.
</p>
<p>The other issue is with a Windows function that deals with driver request - <em>
ntoskrnl.exe . </em>This one may be caused by whatever</p>
<p>is leading to the two drivers crashing, or it could be causing the two drivers to crash.</p>
<p>- Have you tested the new RAM and your SSD yet ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of things that can lead to these drivers crashing. Hardware faults and software conflicts among them.</p>
<p>It leave it to you to trawl the internet (again ?) to discover what may be causing these drivers to have issues in your case.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just finished updating my computer to W10. And one thing immediately strikes me:</p>
<p>The command ALT + TAB doesn't provide the access to the desktop anymore. Of course I can switch between the different programs that I are running, but I cannot switch directly to the desktop from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I change this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Merci,</p>

            First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Advanced Options.
<br />
<br />When you get to this point see if you can do a system restore point.
<br />
<br />If you can't get here then you might need to do a clean install.
<br />See link provided by Greg Carmack on how to do this.

<h2>            No boot, Error&#58; &#34;Reboot and select proper boot device or input reboot media&#34;- Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>&lt;Original title: Windows 8.1 reboot - not recognising HDD&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I was hoping someone can help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday my desktop was running extraordinarily slowly. I ran a virus checker and nothing showed up. I started it today and i got the error message " reboot and select proper boot device or input reboot media". I used the windows 8.1 reboot DVD. Repair
 functions (both refresh and re-set) did not function. Refresh comes up with the error message "The Drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock and try again". Reset comes up with the error message "Unable to reset your PC. A required Drive partition
 is missing". Attempting to reinstall windows from the DVD leads to a screen instructing me to remove the disk and restart the computer to continue installation but this just starts the cycle again. I have also been unplugging the power cord after turning off
 each time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the Bios screen I have checked that everything is running in UEFI/ IDE as recommended on several forum posts, and that the computer is booting from the HDD where windows is installed. I have seen no change. Whether I boot from the disc or my HDD I
 end up in a loop of error messages. If I boot from the disk I get a different screen, at the bottom it reads "bad boot, press F1 to restart" which leads back to the BIOS screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not changed any hardware in my computer, have no external hard-drives attached to the computer and only 1 internal hard-drive. I had taken automatic windows updates due to issues a few months ago where an automatic update messed up my screen and keyboard
 drivers, but it has been running fine since.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated, I'm out ideas and out of my depth!</p>
<p>Pippa</p>

            <p><span>Hello </span>Philip<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are not able to boot the computer to the desktop. I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the Windows&nbsp;system file corruption. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to login to any other computer and <strong>create a new Windows 8.1 installation disk</strong>. Using that disk you can perform the troubleshooting methods given below.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the link to&nbsp;create the installation disk:</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>How to create installation media for a PC refresh or reset:</strong>
<br />
</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After creating the Windows installation disk, I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Notes: </span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>1. Disconnect all the external devices connected except mouse and keyboard.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><span>2. To&nbsp;boot the computer through&nbsp;Windows 8.1 installation disc, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included
 with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>3. <em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Perform an Automatic Repair</strong> through bootable Windows 8.1 installation disc.<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so,&nbsp;follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Insert the Windows 8.1 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>b. After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Click<strong> on Repair your computer </strong>in the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e. Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>f. Click on <strong>Advanced options </strong>in Troubleshoot screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>g. Click <strong>Automatic Repair </strong>from Advanced Options screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>h. Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>i. Windows 8.1 will then look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span> </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the automatic repair doesn’t work, then&nbsp;try to <strong>rebuild the Windows boot sector</strong> from the Windows RE command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so, follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Boot the computer using Windows 10 installation media.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. In the “<strong>Windows Setup</strong>” dialog box that appears, set the Time and currency format, Keyboard or input method and the language to install and then click “Next”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Click on “<strong>Repair your computer</strong>” from the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. From the “Choose an option screen”, click on “<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. In the “<strong>Advanced Options” screen</strong>, select “<strong>Command Prompt</strong>”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Now type the following commands at the Windows RE command prompt and press<strong> Enter
</strong>after each command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>c:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>cd boot</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>attrib bcd -s -h -r</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>bootrec /RebuildBcd</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7. Restart the computer and&nbsp;check if you are able to boot the computer successfully.</span></p>

<h2>            False bad reputation, how to fix&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. Cannot play online with friends due to a false bad reputation. What can be done to fix this other than getting a new account or going to PlayStation?</p>

<p>Going to ps won't fix it</p>
<p>The only person who can fix your bad rep yourself </p>
<p>Shouldn't your question be how do I improve my rep?</p>
<p>Literally your rep is the community's opinion of you not what you think it is</p>
<p>Changing systems won't solve your problem. It only cause more by making you spend unnecessarily without solving the issue</p>

<p>You can play non matchmaking games like never winter etc or just party matches with your friends</p>
<p>Nothing stops you from playing against your own friends only on open matchmaking</p>
<p>So basically you would have to join a party then they start a game with your 4friends that's it</p>

<p>Lol. This is a joke right? I mean, by your logic, anyone in prison is deserving to be there right? No such thing as wrongly convicted, because it's not what you know you've done, it's what other people say you've done. It makes me sick how quick people with
 a good rep are to say "you deserve to be where you are, be nicer and play better, you're the problem, not the rep system." Explain to me why I am in avoid me status with 14 reports against me? How does that make sense? But the system is above reproach by your
 standards right? I've been a member of Xbox live since 2004, if I am such a lowlife player why has this never been a problem for me before? The truth is some of us do deserve to be in this predicament, but a lot of us do not. Some people are trolls, they exist
 to torment others. Some other people are just good, a little too good in fact, and the gamer that rests just between casual and hardcore doesn't want to play that really good person. So they block them. And that block goes against that person's reputation.
 Sometimes a player only plays hardcore mode and the only server available is a "sniper only" lobby. Unfortunately for the players in that lobby, it's a ranked server, and therefore they can't dictate such things without violating the TOS for that game. But
 that doesn't stop those players from blocking/reporting the guy who doesn't bow to their will. Well, that's how I ended up where I am. But maybe you think after reading that, that I do deserve to be in this situation. OK, fair enough. But that's July half
 the problem. My only recourse now is to "play online without getting reported", which is pretty hard to do considering I can't get into any games online because of my reputation. This coupled with the fact that there's no one you can call, and forum posts
 just incite cookie cutter responses, and you understand why people get so enraged when this happens to them, especially when they have other people telling them that they're the problem. Or maybe you won't understand, and if that's the case I pray you find
 yourself in this boat with us, because I can't wait to hear that tune change. As for me, I've been unfortunately playing battlefield hard-line for 3 monthes straight at a rate of about 5-10 hours a week, with no change in my rep at all. 64 player lobbies,
 you would think I'd be at least one rep level up by now, but sadly I am not. </p>

<p>What you are suggesting is lets say you go to school and do something bad and the community there sees it and givds you a bad rep</p>
<p>Can you go to the principles office and get him to change their opinion?</p>
<p>Nope it won't happen </p>

<h2>            Xbox Oe X Scorpio HDR Washed Out</h2>
                    <p>I received my Scorpio edition today and got everything setup but upon checking Netflix anything in HDR is completely washed out. I have tried 5 different cables, every TV setting, and every Xbox setting I can find or think of.&nbsp; I have even bypassed my Denon X7200WA completely and connected my One X directly to my 2017 LG OLED 65C7. I also have an Apple TV 4K, an Oppo UDP-203, and Nvidia Shield with HDR working perfectly fine. The LG Internl apps work fine too. The only way to fix the Xbox Picture is to turn HDR completely off in settings.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Can't help you there, but my scorpio doesn't even detect HDR on my LG EG9600 (2015 model; has HDR on netflix streaming perfectly; I selected Deep Color in settings). Still get 4K, but can't even get HDR to work. And my LG TV is the&nbsp;OLED mode if that has anything to do with anything. </p>

            <p>I had some of your issues as well using an LG49SJ810V but then I&nbsp;discovered I'd used the HDMI2 port and apparently not all HDMI&nbsp;ports support the same specs on LG televisions. So I&nbsp;purposely plugged the X1X in the HDMI1 and lo and behold, it showed a 4K HDR with all bells and whistles! I'm using the HDMI2 port now only for the TV decoder and have the PS4&nbsp;pro plugged in the HDMI3 port and AppleTV in HDMI4. That apparently solves it all!</p>

    <title>Can the All in One Media keyboard firmware be updated to support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microsoftuseranthony  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can the All in One Media keyboard firmware be updated to support three-finger gestures&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;The Microsoft All in One Media Keyboard does not appear to currently support Windows 10 three-finger gestures. Why is this the case? Are there hardware or software limitations that prevent the All in One Media keyboard from supporting three-finger gestures?
 Is there currently a way to get the All in One keyboard to support three-finger gestures?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was recently a firmware update that allowed for Fn lock (Fn + Caps) to be used on the keyboard (presumably after grievances for its absence). Will the firmware for the All in One keyboard (originally released after the Windows 8 release) be likewise
 updated to support current Windows 10 three-finger gestures? (Task View, Desktop view, App switching gestures, etc.)&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Titanfall Custom Pilot Loadouts Not Working</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">Hey Guys,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">I have been looking everywhere for an answer to this but so far haven't found anything (I apologise if I missed it). Basically, I am playing the campaign mode on Titanfall and when I reached level 5 (I am now
 level 9) it unlocks the option to customise your pilot. So I choose my settings, in particular I wanted to have my primary weapon as the
<strong>Smart Pistol</strong>. However, no matter what options I pick whenever I enter the game it simply gives me the default weapons and settings! I have restarted, tried different maps, I even tried customising all three of the custom pilots. I am at a loss...
 is there something I am not understanding? Or is this some horrible glitch with the game? Is anyone else experiencing this?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">I hope its just me and someone can tell me what I'm doing wrong :-) Thanks in advance!</span></p>

<p>It pops up during the "cut scene" before you drop out of the ship of each match. You can select your burn card and Loadout. Make sure you go down to the Custom Pilot Loadouts you made and not just choose the 1st option set (which is what I was doing for
 awhile lol). The same goes for picking your Titan as well. Don't worry I thought it was glitched as well until I actually looked at all available options.</p>

<p>Nope -once you select your Pilot and Titan it will keep that selection until you change it. &nbsp;You can even change loadout immediately after you spawn, just push that little button with the lines on it.
</p>
<p>I don't know why this isn't working for you, maybe you are choosing a burn card with a special weapon? &nbsp;That will only last one life, then you are back to your standard loadout. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I know how to select loadouts and all that jazz, but sometimes when I'm playing it assigns one of the default classes when I die instead of giving me the custom loadout I selected. &nbsp;It only happens occasioanally. &nbsp;Just enough to make me midlly irrititated</p>

<p><span>Hi Dan Cross,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Windows Vista answers forum.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Programs like Internet Explorer will open to the same size and placement as they were when they were closed.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>If you want Internet Explorer to open full-size when you start it up, you must first start IE, and then maximize the window. Now click File, and then Close. Now restart
 IE, and it should start up in a full-sized window. If half of the window is off the screen when you start a program, bring the window to the location you want and then click File and then Close and it will re-open in this position the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Changing the size of windows that appear when you click on an Internet link takes a few more steps.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Open Internet Explorer. Now open another instance of Internet Explorer so that you have two running at the same time. In the second one, right-click a link and select
 “Open In New Window”. If the new window does not start in full screen, simply resize the window by dragging the edges out to the sides of the screen. Do not use the max button.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Close the first window by selecting File, then Close. Now close the window you just made full size. But close it by holding down the Control key and selecting File,
 then Close. Do not release the Control key until the window is closed. </span></p>
<p>
<span>Now close the last Internet Explorer window. If you do this right, the settings will stick. You may or may not have to reboot, depending on your operating system.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you use the Quick Launch Toolbar to open Internet Explorer, then you can right click on the IE icon in the toolbar,
 select Properties and then change Run-&gt;Normal Window to Run-&gt;Maximized. Thereafter, any time you click the IE quick-launch icon, IE will open full screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know if it helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks and Regards,<br />
Santosh<br />

<h2>            Monthly withdrawl of &#38;&#35;163&#59;5.99 for xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>I am sending you this mail because my bank has asked me to write to yourselves rather than addressing them. I changed my e-mail some months back and because of the different router, xbox live (although I've tried for a long time) connection is impossible.
 Hence this mail to cancel the £5.99 per month.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Malcolm Evans</p>
