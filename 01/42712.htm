<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Are you seeing a continuous “Data Center Searching” or a “Retrieving Matchmaking List” message when playing Titanfall on the Xbox One? If so, then let’s go ahead and run through these suggestions to see if they are able to help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s be sure to power cycle the console with the steps posted on the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>Power cycle your Xbox One console</span></a> article &nbsp; </li><li>When the console is off, let’s restart the entire network the console is connected to. To do this, unplug any wired or wireless router for approximately 5 minutes and be sure to do the same with any modem or gateway device as well.

<span>Slow Performance</span></a> troubleshooter. </li><li>Next let’s go ahead and power the console back on and launch Titanfall to see if that was able to help.
</li><li>Make sure the correct Data Center is selected per your region. You can access this menu by Pressing the “X” button on your controller when you see the “Data Center Searching” message in the bottom right corner of the screen. From there, choose the appropriate
 Data Center based on your physical location. For example: If you were living in the Seattle, WA area, you would choose “West US”.
</li><li>If that was no help, then let’s try a wired connection direct to the modem in your network to see if that helps.
</li><li>If it does help, add any routers back in to play that you were using in your connection and test playing Titanfall one more time.
</li><li>If that does not help or it does revert back to being an issue when the routers are back in play, let’s try checking out the NAT solution here and apply it to the networking devices the console connects through with the steps in the

 the exact step that seemed to resolve the issue for you. We would love to hear from you. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Nothing worked, choosing all of the server options, resetting my router and modum, my NAT type is open, I run around a 4.50 MB upload .80 MB download 139 Latancy and I am wired, performed a power cycle and nothing, deleted my profile and uninstalled the game, and I am having trouble of reinstalling it again. Took me two days to install it the first time. The thing would freeze at 99%. Finally, on the third day, it fully installed. Now it is installing slower than ever and I have a bad feeling it will not install completely again. EA stop saying it isn't you because it is. I can do anything else with x box live but play your game. Last time I buy one of your games EA. next time why not make sure that there is a solo mode that a player can play without getting onto your servers hell at least a tutorial! I know that other games have crashed worse than this GTA 5 COD 4 but at least there was single player. Good to get that off my chest sorry for ranting.</p>

            <p>Okay I have one more thing for people to try. EA says tht you might have to open ports to the Titanfall servers. Here are the ports:</p>
<p>Xbox 360 &amp; Xbox One players</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;UDP: 53; 88; 3074</p>

            <p>I am currently stuck on the "Retrieving Matchmaking List" and have been stuck since I downloaded Titanfall 6 days ago. I have gone through every single step on this guide, Opened the DMZ, opened Ports, but nothing is getting me past the "Retrieving Matchmaking List" screen.</p>
<p>I use an Apple Airport Extreme V. 7.7.2</p>
<p>My NAT type is moderate and has been since I bought my Xbox One. </p>
<p>Test Internet Connection - It's all good.</p>
<p>Test Multiplayer Connection - It's all good.</p>
<p>Download Speed - 31.54 Mbps</p>
<p>Upload Speed - 11.04 Mbps</p>
<p>Download/Upload Packet Loss - 0%</p>
<p>MTU - 1480</p>
<p>Latency - 71 MS</p>
<p>I have no issue connecting to any other game online when I attempt to play those. I also had no issue playing the Titanfall Beta and was able to get into matchmaking/chat without any problems. I do not understand why this is happening when I have not had a problem before. Please, is there anything else I can try? </p>

<p>To clarify, you did go ahead and try step 6 "If that was no help, then let’s try a wired connection direct to the modem in your network to see if that helps." And still saw no resolution? If so, is your modem a gateway device that acts as a modem and router in one device? Let us know and let us know the make and model of that device if so if possible. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey everyone just want to let you know that what you should do is:</p>
<p>1. Set a Static IP address for the Xbox One (Settings&gt;Network&gt;Advanced, look on the right hand side for your IP Address, Gateway, and Subnet, write them down and click "IP Settings" Type the written information inside there, if you know what you're doing you can customize it but otherwise using the same info you wrote down is best) </p>
<p>2. Go to your router and find "DMZ' and click "Enable" Then enter in the static IP you gave the Xbox One. Then reboot and try again.</p>
<p>NOTE: If you have any manual ports set up to that same IP address you are using for the Xbox One you must remove them or they can cause complications on specific routers. </p>
<p>If the above steps don't work then go into your router and disable "UPNP", save, then enable "UPNP", and save again, sometimes if UPNP isn't working properly it can get in the way.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT: The reason I suggest DMZ is because each and every game has the ability to have its own ports, with manual port forwarding you have to keep editing and updating your router configuration with each game you get, with DMZ all ports are open and you will not have to configure anything again unless you get a new router or new Xbox. Make sure you only use DMZ with the Xbox and never use it for a computers IP address. </p>
<p>Also, I'm N+ (Networking) Certified, so take my advice and don't waste time with manual port forwarding. </p>

            <p>I have tried step 6. I have also tried setting up the DMZ and ports on my router. Nothing is working. I cannot access UPNP with my Airport Extreme. I believe the problem stems from my apartment's network which I have no access to. Is there any way around this? Why is it that Titanfall will not work but all other online games will?</p>

            <p>Hi I've done all the suggestions on this site, and others.</p>
<p>I'm on xbox one...</p>
<p>I have the pleasure of the occasional full game, sadly it says I've completed the game... But as I was dropped into the levels just before they ended... I'm sure you will agree I have not had the pleasure or satisfaction of playing this game through from start to finish properly.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's quick to load,and I actually get on, others it's slow and times out saying SERVER FAILED!</p>
<p>Other times I'm in the middle of the game when a grey box pops up saying trying to re-connect to surver... Which on a rare occasion it does, but 8/10 times it fails and shows a page where the message is server timed out, cannot connect to server, server failed.</p>
<p>I can play every other game I own on xbox one, 360 and our ps4 with no problems, so why do you think that every machine out there is at fault?</p>
<p>Does it not make much more sense that it's your servers that can't handle the volume of players to this online-only game?</p>
<p>Is that why EA have decided to let playstation have Titanfall 2 instead of it being exclusive too xbox... Which will be bad for you if you haven't resolved the server issue and playstation do not have the same issues as xbox!</p>

                    <p>matshitadvd-ram uj8b0 dvd drive not working after upgrade to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>am using an asus K53TA laptop and the drive worked on windows 7, 8, and 8.1 with no issues. there does not seem to be a compatible driver for it yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when i click on driver details it states "No driver files are required or have been found for this device. i have even gone as far as to force it to use a generic driver to no avail. there is no driver avalable on the asus driver downloads site either. apperar
 the driver may not exit for windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>as a pc tech i may be forced to convert back to win 8.1. at least the drivers there work<br />

            <p>I would bet that that device never had a driver. Wasn't sure if you meant you couldn't find any driver or couldn't find a W10 driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a windows 8 driver have you installed it in compatibility mode? Or uninstalled the device and scanned for new hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think the manufacture would have a driver for at lest windows 7. </p>

            <p>This was in a post from another user that had problems and it worked on my asus a53z laptop with the same dvd drive UJ8B0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok I was able to figure this out on my&nbsp;laptop and fix it. I noticed that besides my DVD drive missing that my SSD was very slow like a slow hard drive. It was indeed caused by the generic SATA controller driver Windows 10 installed for the AMD SATA Controller
 in my system. I had downloaded the latest chipset drivers from AMD before but I didn't notice the installer didn't update the SATA controller driver. I had to do it manually in Device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for anyone else with an AMD based system that's having this problem, give this a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download the latest AMD Windows 10 Chipset drivers at http://www2.ati.com/drivers/amd-catalyst-15.7.1-sb-sata-ahci-win10-win8.1-win7.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the installer which will extract the files to your hard drive and&nbsp;may update some other drivers. When it's done, reboot your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open device manager by right clicking "Start" and then click "Device Manager". Look under "IDE ATA\ATAPI Controllers" and then right click on "Standard SATA AHCI Controller" and click "Update Driver Software". Click on "Browse my computer for driver software"
 and then browse to where the AMD installer extracted the files. It should be "C:\AMD". Make sure the box for "Include subfolders" is checked then click on "Next". It should update the driver and rename it to "AMD SATA Controller". Click on "Close" and then
 reboot your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it, after rebooting your CD/DVD drive should show up and work again. I hope this helps.</p>

Had tried almost every other way but your solution worked, and it was very simple.<br />
AMD doesn't let you link directly to download files, so as you said in other post its the 50 MB AMD Chipset Drivers you need to download. From this url the download file is a bit easier to find<br />

<p>It was a bit confusing and AMD moved the location, but if you look you will find them.</p>
<p>Also the program starts to auto install, you have to stop it.</p>

<p>I've taken the quest to get the dish and help 3 Dog on GNR. &nbsp;Now I did go to Rivet City and met with the doctor who informed me about dad's status, so I ended up visiting 3 Dog again, and he said that he will sweeten the deal, and give me something else
 if I complete that quest to look for the dish. &nbsp;I went to the museum, got the dish, installed it at the Washington Monument, and when I return to GNR to speak with 3 Dog, the GNR door is locked. &nbsp;I&nbsp;hit the buzzer, and it tells me that the door is opened, but
 it's not. &nbsp;Everytime I reload it tells me the objective is to go back to 3 Dog, so I don't know what to do. &nbsp;Is there something I'm missing here?</p>

<p>I love the game, and I know the game is glitchy due to how huge it is, and the such, but this is a major missing from the main game. &nbsp;What gives?</p>

<p>If you don't want to go through all that again, maybe go to the back door. &nbsp;Remember when you left to start the Quest? &nbsp;You could go back that way. &nbsp;See if that works if not then all I can say is go back to a earlier save. &nbsp;Listen to the Radio as well to
 see if 3dog knows that you installed it</p>

<p>Won't be able to access the back door of GNR building since exit/entrance is located atop a collapsed floor that is unreachable once player drops down to start GNR quest.</p>
<p>___</p>
<p>I know upon fast travel during quest (after killing behemoth) triggers other combat sequences thus leading to door being locked down until all supermutants are killed. See if there are any supermutants in area, kill them, then try accessing door. If that
 doesn't work, do some other quest, overwrite current save that gives you trouble, then try again see if that might fix issue.... or try waiting 3 days in game see if that "might" reset issue in game.

<h2>            SFC errors almost fixed but I need help on the last few errors</h2>
                    I had the trojan that wiped out my desktop and hid everything. I reformatted my Harddrive before re-installing, and I am afraid that either I may have had another virus or past software that has left these errors on the sfc scan and would like to know
 if I can just delete these registry keys or to find a way to cure this issue before I make a system restore disk for the next time something happens. &nbsp;If you need the entire log I can post it, but these are the issues I am concerned with:

<h2>            windows 8.1 won&#39;t copy&#47;paste to folders</h2>
                    <p>i'm logged in as administrator. everytime i try to paste from the file manager to any folder i get a bell. i checked the properties for that folder and there's a black box in the read only box. i unchecked it and it seems to take the read only flag off the
 files but i still can't paste to any of my folders. all of my folders have this black box in the read only checkbox. i also unchecked, checked and unchecked the read-only box but nothing works. i'm on the latest update to 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>the file manager window seems to have changed in the latest update. not sure if that has anything to do with it. nothing i've searched for and tried has worked including, setting up a new account, changing ownership of the folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>any of my software and read/write to these same folders, i just can't paste to them</p>

            <p>Windows has a number of recovery features to get "back up and running" quickly after a problem occurs. Some of these recovery features are more impactful than others, to be sure to read the impacts carefully.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option One: System Restore</strong> (Safest, try this first)<br />
If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files. It only takes a couple minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn't
 fix the problem on the first try. When you aren't sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+R</strong> to show the Run box, type
<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore, or try another date.</li></ol>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 2: Create a new profile</strong><strong><br />
</strong>Because profiles are separated from each other and the system, creating a new profile on your computer can help troubleshoot and resolve issues. Many times an issue in a profile can be resolved by creating a new one. It takes a little time to set up
 your preferences and drag your files to the new profile, but it can save many hours of headache. As with the System Restore, this is a "safe option", because no files will be lost if you try this.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Open the PC Settings app, go to Accounts, Other Accounts, and then Add An Account.</li><li>When adding the account, choose "Sign in without a Microsoft Account" and create a Local Account.</li><li>Login to the new account and see if the issue is fixed. If so, you can open the C:\Users folder and drag your files into the new profile.</li></ol>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 3: PC Refresh </strong>(keep your files, but reinstall Windows)<strong><br />
</strong>If your PC&nbsp; isn't performing&nbsp; as well as it once did, and you don't know why, you can refresh your PC without deleting any of your personal files or changing your settings. All your personal files and settings will be kept, but any programs you installed
 yourself from CD's or websites (like Firefox, Office, games, etc) will be removed and you'll have to download them again on your own.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Open the PC Settings app, go to Update and Recovery, then choose "Get Started" for the refresh.</li></ol>
</ol>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option 4: PC Reset</strong> (a full factory reset -- everything will be removed)<strong><br />
</strong>If you want to recycle your PC, give it away, or start over with it, you can reset&nbsp;&nbsp; it completely.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Open the PC Settings app, go to Update and Recovery, then choose "Get Started" for the reset.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi Killer,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to Start / Control Panel / Default Programs / Associate a&nbsp;File Type with a Program&nbsp;and&nbsp;scroll to&nbsp;.pup.&nbsp; Now double click on it or click on it and click change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From there you can select a different default program.&nbsp; If you wish to add another program, you can click on browse and add another program.&nbsp; Something will be the default - so choose what makes life easiest for you and if necessary, right click and click
 on Open With to select a different program (which doesn't help in the PS3 but if that's what's selected, then you should be fine).&nbsp; When plugged in, does your PS3 program appear or can you browse to it and select it as&nbsp;a choice to be then set as the default?&nbsp;
 I don't&nbsp; have a PS3 but believe this should be possible.&nbsp; If not, proceed on:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to unassociate the file type from any default at all once it has been associated, that needs a 3rd party program:
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/231/1/An-Utility-to-Unassociate-File-Types-in-Windows-7-and-Vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/231/1/An-Utility-to-Unassociate-File-Types-in-Windows-7-and-Vista.html</a>.&nbsp; Follow the instructions, do it for .pup, and you should be good to go.&nbsp; Be careful with this program (if you decide to use it - it is a 3rd party
 program so you do so at your own risk)&nbsp;- you can unassociate a lot more than you want if you don't follow the instructions carefully.&nbsp; But if you're cautious, you should do fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            I also had this problem. I was able to fix it by signing out, signing back in, and relaunching the .sdx from my downloads folder. It popped up, went down to 99% complete, finished downloading and then continued to the verify and unpack steps. Hope that
 helps,

    <title>Via Chrome 9 Still Not Supported by Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Via Chrome 9 Still Not Supported by Windows 10</h2>
                    We love our old laptops so we don't want to trash them and I think that they deserve Windows 10! I have 2 laptops home that only work with the basic Microsoft driver. The first release of Windows 10 was compatible with Chrome 9 but only worked until next
 big upgrade. Does anyone have success using the proper driver in version 1809? I hope so. But I have to say that the generic Microsoft vídeo driver Works fine, but does not have hardware acceleration. Couldn't be possible to Microsoft develope a generic driver
 that somewhat recognizes the chipset and emulate hardware acceleration? Thanks for any help.

            Sorry, Chrome 9 is too old release and using it means a risk to Security. You would have to upgrade.
<br />Also, Any reason why you are using Basic Display adapter instead of graphics driver supplied by your laptop?

            Thank you for the answer. Chrome 9 is very old but it's nearly impossible to replace a laptop chipset. I have a brand new Lenovo Laptop but I don't forget my old Itautec W7635 (Fic) and my Positivo Premium (Clevo). They are good and working fine after
 all these years. Basic Microsoft driver is really good and I wish someone could add some hardware acceleration (maybe a simple emulation). Recently I found a 3DFX emulation for any new graphic board . I don't have the knowledge to do it but I think it is possible.
 I could go back to the laptops old Windows versions and I did but they don't run fine as Windows 10 in those machines. Best regards.

<h3> allen heathcliff  say:</h3>
<h2>            Anticheat GameGuard hides its process and doesn&#39;t end it until reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm really into a game running nProtect's GameGuard, the biggest problem I have with GameGuard is how tricky it is and how it doesn't really do it's own work well. Rant aside, the issue is that everytime I run the game, once I'm done I'll have to reboot
 to get the GameMon64.des process to end.<br />
The process hides itself after a while and won't appear in Process Explorer or the taks manager.<br />
<br />
If I don't end the process by rebooting another process will spawn once the game is launched and won't close once the game has shutdown because of an np1002 error. This second process won't hide itself since another on is already running but will still run
 while the game is closed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also whenever I try to kill the visible process with the Task Manager or Process Explorer it says "Error terminating process: Access Denied".<br />
Trying a "taskkill /PID &lt;pid&gt;" says that no process was found while I still have an eye on the PID.<br />
Trying a "taskkill /IM GameMon64.des" says:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">ERROR: The process "GameMon64.des" with PID 1200 could not be terminated.<br />
Reason: There is no running instance of the task.</p>
<p>While there is no visible "GameMon64.des" with 1200 as PID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also while I know that an anticheat must use dirty tricks to prevent cheating, the command line is as following:</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">\x01\xd4\xe1\xea\xed\x99\x2a\xb2\xf4\xbf\xe9\x9d\x1d\xc6\x3f\x66\x01\xf8\xf3\x4e\x94\x76\xd9\x74\xf6\x67\x83\x06\x4d\xb0\xd9\xd4\x25\x58\x93\x2a\xbe\xd7\xe1\xf6\xb1\xe8\xa1\xcc\xcd\x10\xf9\xb4\xc4\x2b\xb5\x8d\x59\xb4\x99\x54\x45\x58</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get access to kill the process ?<br />
</p>
<p>I'm running Process Explorer as an admin on Windows 8.1.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd like to find a way to kill the hidden process once I'm finished playing.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hello Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to contact the software vendor regarding this issue. Probably the service of this Anticheat product runs even after the game is closed as to avoid the gamer from cheating. Software developer might have an update/patch to fix this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can also run <strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Safety Scanner</a></span></strong> as these kind of programs are known to contain malwares.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Note: </span></em></strong><em><span>Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, I would have you contact their respective support for further assistance-</p>

            Run Windows Update.&nbsp; It's good at installing device drivers that weren't found during Windows 7 installation.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't fix it, you probably need to download and install device drivers for your computer model from Sony.
