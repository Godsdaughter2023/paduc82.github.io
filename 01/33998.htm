<h2>            Windows 10 has made Foxit PhantomPDF stop working AND I cannot get ANYTHING from the APP store&#33;</h2>
                    I have looked both of these things up and found basically nothing helpful except to reset to factory settings, which I do NOT want to do. I have way too much stuff on here to do that. I removed Foxit from my computer, because someone said you could just
 download the free one online, then when I went to do that, I realized, it's not the one that you can actually type new info into your PDF and now I'm pissed! I also am pissed that I cannot get ANY new apps from the app store on my laptop because it won't let
 me sign into it, nor will it let me sign into the new Cortana thing, so I can't use that either. Windows 10 sucks, and I will be telling everyone I know to steer clear of it! If there is anyone with anything really helpful to say, please let me know what I
 can do, this computer is basically useless to me now...

    <title>repair &#34;bootmgr missing&#34; AND BOOT FROM hiberfil.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ms3  say:</h3>
<h2>            repair &#34;bootmgr missing&#34; AND BOOT FROM hiberfil.sys</h2>
                    
<p>I hibernated my laptop running W7 Professional and when I restarted, I got the message "bootmgr is missing, press Ctrl Alt Del to restart". I can't think of any reason why this happened except this:</p>
<p>I was encrypting an external harddrive with TrueCrypt and had another external hard drive with two partitions also connected to the laptop. I was checking something in the Computer Management Partition console and saw the option to set a partition as "Active".
 I didn't know what that was and stupidly, just to try it, selected this option, as far as I remember to one of the two partitions on the second external harddisk. I didn't manage to undo this but thought it wouldn't be any bad. So the first question: could
 this be the reason for my problem? Although, I did actually try to redo the same with another laptop (except using TrueCrypt), and setting a partition of the external harddisk didn't cause any problems to restart from hibernation of the laptop.</p>
<p>Anyway, the thing is I now don't only need to recover my computer (which would probably be fairly easy I hope), but I need to boot from the existing hiberfil.sys (I checked in DOS, a 3 GB-hiberfil.sys is there) in order to resume my TrueCrypt process, otherwise
 I will loose all data on the first external harddisk.</p>
<p>I did run the system repair from the W7 install disk with the following result:</p>
<p>"Windows found problems with your computer's startup options"<br />
<br />
-&gt; If I then go to "View details": <br />
<br />
The following startup options will be added: <br />
Name: Windows 7 Professional (recovered)<br />
Path: Windows<br />
Windows Device: Partition=C: (476838 MB)<br />
<br />
Name: Windows Recovery Environment (recovered)<br />
Path: Recovery\8e943f0c-43bd-11df-8dfe-b79437f1c98d\Winre.wim<br />
Windows Device: Partition=C: (476838 MB)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore I see two options:</p>
<p>* I use the system repair of the W7-install disk, but then I need to be sure that after fixing the bootmgr the laptop will still start from the hiberfil.sys - will this be the case?</p>
<p>* I backup the hiberfil (how to copy it, maybe with a live Linux CD?), repair the startup options, restart the computer and then somehow try to write back the hiberfil?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would greatly appreciate any suggestions and help, thanks a lot!</p>

<p>It appears that you changed the active partition on your disk, thus preventing it from booting. By selecting the Boot Repair process while in Repair Mode, you can fix this problem. A less intrusive method would consist of using a partition manager (e.g.
 Acronis DiskDirector 11) to mark your boot partition as active. If you follow this path, make sure that the partition manager is certified for Windows 7. Most aren't.</p>
<p>I doubt that you will be able to boot from your hibernation file. Doing so involves an initial normal boot, followed by a changeover to the hibernation file which is triggered by some unknown flag. On the other hand I do not think that this will be necessary.
 When encrypting files with TrueCrypt then the usual process to is to copy them to the TrueCrypt volume, then to delete the originals. If your TrueCrypt volume is incomplete or inaccessible then you still have your original files. If not then (and I hate to
 say it) it's time to review your backup policy.</p>

    <title>Bluetooth mouse stopped working after driver updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petr lepcio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth mouse stopped working after driver updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>my Microsoft Sculpt Bluetooth mouse stopped working (again) on Win 10. I've done a complex maintenance including update of multiple drivers to fix some other bugs that had started to appear after the recent Windows update and the mouse stopped working after
 system restart. This has been happening pretty much constantly since I installed the Windows 10 but if nothing else, removing the device and pairing it again eventually helped. This time, however, my ultimate resolve fails too. More precisely, I am able to
 remove the mouse but it always reappears after BT restart (switch off/on in control panel) regardless the mouse being on or off. The BT itself works and connects smoothly to another device as does the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed several suggestions including this</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/cannot-remove-bluetooth-mouse/fd0bf703-a77c-4ec8-9454-40d6e8c04bc3</p>
<p>and this</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/remove-failed-for-bluetooth-device/ca5d85c5-8ff6-4024-a762-43ebe0c8ba75</p>
<p>
So far, I've tried:
</p><p>- remove it from the list of paired BT devices (reappears after BT restart)</p>
<p>- remove it in device manager (reappears after BT restart) </p>
<p>- remove it in devices and printers (does not reappear)</p>
- remove it in registers, it failed first but the entry eventually disappeared at some point, not sure when exactly
<p>- turning off wifi makes no difference</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, any other suggestions will be greatly appreciated. No way I am doing a full system reset because of the mouse, it's an endless source of troubles and I'd rather throw it away if there's no easy fix. Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Petr,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I see that you have exhausted quite a lot of troubleshooting step for this issue. Fixing a Bluetooth connectivity problem could be a little tricky, since there are plenty of possible cause that we can overlook. As a start, you can try running the
<strong>Windows Troubleshooter</strong> specifically for Bluetooth. You can find more information, as well as the troubleshooter download link
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. Try it out and let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you for your effort, I really appreciate it. Unfortunately, the troubleshooter was to no help, as usually to my experience. I progressed on my own though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I identified the following three entries in the event log to be connected with mouse uninstall/reinstall:</p>
<p>1. Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-PnP/Device Configuration (when I remove of the mouse)<br />
Device BTHENUM\DEV_3059B775A2B7\8&amp;D851973&amp;0&amp;BLUETOOTHDEVICE_3059B775A2B7 was deleted.<br />
Class Guid: {e0cbf06c-cd8b-4647-bb8a-263b43f0f974}</p>
<p>2. Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-PnP/Device Configuration (when BT was turned back on)<br />
Device BTHENUM\Dev_3059B775A2B7\8&amp;d851973&amp;0&amp;BluetoothDevice_3059B775A2B7 requires further installation.<br />
3. System (immediately after previous entry)<br />
Driver Management concluded the process to install driver bth.inf_amd64_ca26197f0dc6870d\bth.inf for Device Instance ID BTHENUM\DEV_3059B775A2B7\8&amp;D851973&amp;0&amp;BLUETOOTHDEVICE_3059B775A2B7 with the following status: 0x0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went through registry and deleted all the items which included the device number 3059B775A2B7. Now the mouse stay removed and only returns to the device manager list when actually connected to pc. Sadly though, it still doesn't work. I guess I deleted
 little too much entries so I'll recover the registry and try to find the correct combination of items which have to be removed and which have to stay.</p>
<p>

<p>I have the same problem. Microsoft bluetooth support is a piece of ****. I bought myself a Microsoft Designer mouse, and after 2 hours of using it (YES! TWO HOURS!!!) it stopped working. It works with other devices though, like for example an Android phone.
 But Microsoft mouse doesn't work with Microsoft Windows 10 on a Windows 10 certified HP top shelf laptop. Congratulations!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't give back the expensive mouse to the store, so Microsoft community - do you have any option how to make this work again? I tried the troubleshooter and it told me that it turned off and on the bluetooth and that's it. Mouse is visible, is connected,
 but doesn't move the cursor.</p>
<p>

<p>Petr, the problem is not with bluetooth mice, but with the way Microsoft programmed bluetooth support in Windows.</p>
<p>For me, what helped (now, it is still not 2 hours that it work again, so further problems might arise), is that Bluetooth LE Generic Attribute Service disappeared from the list of bluetooth devices in Windows. For me reinstalling the MICROSOFT driver helped.
 I don't understand what happened, because before I had exactly the same MICROSOFT driver for my mouse, which is called MICROSOFT Designer Mouse. Seems like Microsoft has problems implementing drivers for its own expensive hardware.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is up to date, i try the troubleshooter app but he doesn't work. The app offered me 2 choices, ignore and left the app and the second choice was reset the store and open it after. I choose the reset choice, and i have got the same problem as
 when i did the wsreset command. At the end, the troubleshooter app say me that the cache is probably damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for the speed of your response.</p>

<p>Thank you for the feedback, Lenny. Since you already tried performing wsreset.exe, let us perform the
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> and <strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)</strong> to scan and fix corrupted system files.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for keeping us updated, Lenny. Since the troubleshooting steps that was provided did not work, I would suggest that you perform a reset. The best thing about performing a reset is that, it will allow you to reset Windows 10 without removing your
 files.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After long times without the windows store (because i didn't want to reset my computer) i got it back by joining the insider program of Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have the same probleme, join this program can probably solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bye and good luck.</p>

            <p>I assume it is a laptop you are using?</p>
<p>If it is its down to the sensitivity of the mouse pad. You may be able to lower this in the settings but many find this doesnt cure the problem. There is however a peice of software that disables the touchpad when you start typing and automatically re-enables
 when you stop. You can find <a href="http://www.mypchealth.co.uk/FreeTools.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
touchfreeze here</a> under additional tools.</p>
<p>See how you get on with that.</p>

<h2>            Since that shytty end of November Win 10 update my laptop...</h2>
                    <p>My ASUS X553M LAPTOP was no longer working correctly after I, unfortunately, upgraded to horribly intrusive, forced on you/unremoveable/adware/spyware app filled garbage Windows-10 back on August 1st.
</p>
<p>I tried to waste MY time sorting each issue out, some I could fix, some I could not, but than that awful end of November "update" that did NOT update ANYTHING and only put a newer lousy-er full version of horrid Win-10 on MY laptop that has really screwed
 things up! </p>
<p>
</p><p>My ASUS originally came with 8.1pro, I never had ANY problems with it! But, since this newer snoopier version of Win-10, MOST Apps and programs would NOT work/open at all, some that would open would not work correctly! So, I had to waste MY time and reinstall
 this annoying, intrusive, horrible Windows 10 OS (since it would NOT let me go back to 8.1!, And since I reinstalled a few days ago, I no longer have BlueTooth capability (BT capability IS installed inside of here, but retarded Win-10 only says "No BT hardware
 can be found") and can no longer pair with my wireless speakers! </p>
<p>
</p><p>This IS such typical MS BS! And why IS that? Was my BT components made by a company that does NOT kick back to MS or is not partnered/owned by MS? Probably!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also no longer have touch SCREEN capability! </p>
<p>Touch PAD works, now that I fixed THAT. </p>
<p>But NO touch SCREEN! </p>
<p>And I can NOT roll back to older driver, so **** before one of you halfwit troll nerds try telling me to do that lame BS!
</p>
<p>There is also NO longer a tab for touch SCREEN in mouse properties in control panel either, and device manager does NOT show ANYTHING for touch SCREEN!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as for as getting any help from MS, as ANYONE on earth already knows, those MS clowns at "tech support" were as usual NO help at all, because as ANYONE with common sense (not too many of us left here on Earth these days so it seems) knows, those outsourced
 non-English speaking/understanding raghead relatives of terrorist morons really know absolutely NOTHING about computers at all and ARE only reading off nonsense FAQ cheat sheets that NEVER solve ANYTHING, EVER! And all they want to do is "connect remotely"
 which will NOT do ANY good for solving a touch SCREEN issue! Or they want to push you over to the 'pay for help' morons who know nothing either!
</p>
<p>And I should NOT have to pay for what MS fked up, especially NOT at the scam rates MS rips people for! F.U. MS!!!
</p>
<p>I WANT/DEMAND my touch SCREEN capabilities back! </p>
<p>It ain't right that shytty windows ruins MY stuff and gets away with it! </p>
<p>It's NOT right that they shove/force terrible operating systems on us! </p>
<p>YES nerds, it was FORCED! </p>
<p>I could NOT select NO I don't want it!, And I can NOT select which updates I want or don't want!
</p>
<p>I can NOT select which apps I want on MY LAPTOP, and I do NOT need nor want all the trackingware like "Cortana", "Bing", "Edge", "XBOX", "Groove", "Maps", Finance" or ANY of that other yuppy phaggit shyt on MY laptop!,
</p>
<p>But I can't remove ANY of it!! And that is just so horribly WRONG!</p>
<p>If I try to remove ANY of it, MS just automatically puts it all right back, of course, because they just HAVE to sniff and list everything we do so they can make more money off of us all! GREEDY ****!!!
</p>
<p>FIX MY SHYT that YOUR shyt Fked up I WANT my touchscreen BACK!!!</p>

            <p>Jeeesus H! **** did I just say about the FAQ cheat sheets!!!!!?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>IDIOTS! IDIOTS! IDIOTS! WHY do you FKN IDIOTS WASTE MY FKN TIME!!! </p>
<p>IF you DON'T know ANYTHING about computers/laptops than you should NOT even be here! Your bullsh it "methods" do NOT give any steps for getting any REAL HELP to fix the situation and you ARE just blabbing the old useless pablum that you got off useless FAQ
 sheets! That tells ME that YOU know NOTHING about computers, nor operating systems!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And go RE-Read what I TYPED, than you may go and shove that worthless FAQ cheat sheet straight up your ****!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1-When I said I already TRIED EVERYTHING!, that INCLUDED trying to use the WORTHLESS MS "Troubleshooter" which not only NEVER finds ANY problems nor ever fixes ANYTHING at all, there is NO option in it to look for problems with a touchscreen! It only wants
 to check internet connections and audio devices and printer issues, so what fkn good is it?! I've also tried to force ASUS drivers and programs to install, to which Win 10 stops any installation and says there's "no device or hardware to install drivers for...blah,
 blah, blah, make sure you device is installed, contact the manufacturer", which I don't need to do and which IS a huge load of BS! The Touchscreen worked perfectly prior to Win-10 so I already know that it IS in here so **** would I need to contact ASUS for....</p>
<p>
</p><p>...Since,... </p>
<p>...#2-I also stated that ASUS website is NO help! They NEVER ARE! They won't help anybody with anything, ever, and always only tell everyone to go to the Windows website for problems or issues related to windows operating systems, probably because NOBODY
 at ASUS can speak or read or understand English, nor understand Windows!, I'm NOT joking either, they ARE all Asian dudes! Why do you think that their website has so many grammatical errors and so many sentences of poorly translated jibberish. The ASUS website
 does have very few basic feature drivers/programs available for downloading for Windows 10 and for my laptop, but, NONE are for the touch-screen! I was able to get "Smart Gesture", but that IS only for the touch-pad/mouse! At least now I can scroll pages again!
 But still NO touch SCREEN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3- I Also stated that after so many problems, glitches, errors, crashes and freezing after upgrading to Win-10, I clean re-installed windows 10, I SAID that I CAN NOT roll back to 8.1! I TRIED that already too, it says "There is no version to go back to"!
 So, unless you plan on mailing me a disk version of 8.1 pro I am STUCK with shi tty win-10 on my touchscreen capable laptop which now doesn't work with win-10!!!!! MS should than give ME a REFUND on the price of my laptop since I can no longer use it'd features
 that it came with that I PAID for!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unless you actually know how to fix the issue and can direct me how I suggest you ****!,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for NOTHING! As usual!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I feel the same exact way. Decided to splurge and get a nice Toshiba 15.6 inch laptop with great specs. 4k touchscreen, 512 SSD, 16GB DDRL3 RAM, 4GB NVIDIA 950 GTX graphics card on costco.com for $1199. Came with Windows 10. Thought this was too good to
 be true. It was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First hour my computer has the Blue Screen of Death with the error "Driver Power State Failure" and has to restart. Maybe that's a glitch I thought to myself. NOPE NOPE NOPE!!! In the past 5 days this thing has had that error dozens of times. The computer
 has crashed a few times as well. After I spent hours and hours downloading movies and shows and music to the freaking thing, it got so bad I did a reset of Windows as an option to get the computer working again but had to lose everything I downloaded. Did
 that help??? Of course not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In those 5 days I learned about dump files and tried to learn how to read them(yeah this is what I bought my laptop to do, sure). When it got too confusing I put them on here to get help. Do you think anyone that could actually understand how to read the
 error dump debugging stuff replied to me???? NOPE OF COURSE NOT. Just another Karthica type(who responded here) who reads more FAQ nonsense" did you try this or that" lol. What a joke. There are a few experts on this forum that understand how to read the dump
 errors and pinpoint what driver is bad and what I need to fix. Do they respond to me though???? Nope, no they don't. I have seen these experts respond to other posts asking for the dmp files and help them. Why not get back to me??? Is this just random for
 these guys to pick and choose which person to help???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add to that, I downloaded drivereasy and reimage thinking those programs would help me. Boy did I get duped. I paid all this extra money for a subscription and I should have flushed my money down the toilet. $300 roughly for NOTHING. Still the BSOD Driver
 State Power Failure error over and over, with a few crashes mixed in</p>
<p>Any calls I made to Microsoft or Reimage or Toshiba was all to the Philippines, ALL OF THEM. Same script, same lack of help, same push to pay more for "better help" which gets you nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So bottom line, I feel like giving up, and want to return the laptop to Costco and order a replacement model. Is this going to happen again? Did I get a defective one as bad luck or is this the norm in most of these high-end machines with Windows 10??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel the ops pain and it is a joke. Microsoft is a disgrace plain and simple. Speaking to anyone competent and in the US is almost impossible and they know how awful Windows 10 is and could really care less. I had a windows 7 laptop for the past 4 years
 until I lost it and Microsoft kept pushing me to upgrade it to 10. They would install these files on updates dumping them in my laptop all windows 10 ****. I had to read online how to remove them because I didn't want that on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I lost my laptop and decided to splurge, I was hoping that a new windows 10 machine would be okay. Windows 10 wouldn't be that bad I thought. WRONG, IT'S MUCH WORSE THAN BAD, IT'S UNBEARABLE.</p>

            <p>Michael, I think you only get help here if you, #1-Have a female (so all the rapey dune coons come running with their little brown sausages in hand!) and/or #2-Have a relative sounding camel jockey or pineapple sounding name!
</p>
<p>Make an account with the name Abdulah or Mohammad or Sandeep, and than I'll bet you 10k that 999,000 "relatives" of "Abdul" will probably fall over themselves coming out of the woodwork to help you!
</p>
<p>Otherwise your stuck with a shi tty operating system that is incompatable with almost everything inside of your machine that you paid for!
</p>
<p>Windows sucks! </p>
<p>I'm about to wipe my entire hard drive squeaky clean and go with linux or any other OS!
</p>
<p>And WHY does windows partition MY hard drive? </p>
<p>I did NOT ask it to! </p>
<p>Why cant I just have all the junk in ONE place/ONE partition? </p>
<p>I PAID for a 500gig laptop so that I can have room to store my files, photos, videos and other fun stuff, it's near impossible when Win10 partitions MY hard drive into 200/200/100 partitions!
</p>
<p>Where the **** am I supposed to put/fit all of MY stuff? </p>
<p>.. </p>
<p>But, As far as your issues go, it sounds like a power management driver could be busted or corrupt or incorrectly installed, it happens, if you can get onto your desktop, right click the "This PC" icon, than. on the drop down menu that will pop up click
 "Properties", than select "Device Manager" on the left side, when that pops open I would start to click each arrow next to every single item (i.e.; "Audio Inputs and Outputs", "Computer", "Disk Drives", etc., etc., etc.), and I would right click over each
 and every item listed under the categories and select "Uninstall" on each and every item, and than restart, windows will than automatically re-install, or try to reinstall drivers for each item again, most times that cures issues like yours, as it will try
 to use drivers from the source cabs, which will normally give you older but possibly more reliable working drivers that can than be updated. I learned that trick way back on old Win95!
</p>
<p>lol </p>
<p>My problem is that NOTHING detects TouchSCREEN capability and EVERYTHINB that had to do with Touchscreen is now completely GONE!
</p>
<p>Windows SHOULD be fkn sued into non existence for ruining people merchandise and for such TERRIBLY insufficient, UNDER-TRAINED tech support! My laptop wasn't cheap! Neither were about 20-25 hard drives windows burnt out or blew up on me over the years! And
 they THINK that they cover their **** against lawsuits by throwing overly wordy bulls-hit "licenses" and "disclaimers" on everything in every file and folder! Sorry biiitches! Disclaimers ONLY work if the product(s) you sell or supply or FORCE onto the public
 works/operates correctly (which NONE of it NEVER does!)! </p>
<p>FK Microshit-MUCHO GREEDY BASTARDOS! </p>

            Almost all laptops have this capability.&nbsp; Typically, you have to press the Fn key and one of the F keys to switch between (1) use laptop's display, (2) use external display, (3) use both.&nbsp; See the User Guide for your laptop for details.<br />
<br />
In addition to telling the laptop's hardware to send a signal to the external monitor, you most likely can configure what shows on the external monitor (a duplicate of the laptop screen or an extension of it) by right-clicking a blank area on the Desktop, selecting
 Properties, and then selecting the Settings tab.<br />
<br />
Finally, some applications (such as Powerpoint) have their own internal settings.&nbsp; This is for Powerpoint 2003 --&gt;

<h2>            Gears of War 3 Tops 1 Million Pre-Orders To Become 360&#39;s All-Time Fastest Pre-Ordered Game</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft and Epic Games have today announced some big numbers for Gears of War 3, including statistics for the multiplayer beta, which managed to attract a staggering 1.29 million fans across 145 different countries. This has no doubt helped in making Gears
 of War 3 the fastest pre-ordered game in Xbox 360 history, netting orders exceeding 1 million units worldwide.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's a lot when you consider that Gears 3 won't even release until September, making the guys at Epic Games incredibly happy. “An overwhelming success – we can’t thank the fans enough,” said Epic Games Design Director Cliff Bleszinski.
 “While the beta was a fun way to give players an early taste of our game, it also provided us with invaluable feedback to help us refine and polish ‘Gears of War 3’ to ensure it’s truly the culmination of the trilogy we promised to the fans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are some of the frankly quite impressive statistics from the Gears of War 3 public multiplayer beta, just to give you an idea of exactly how successful it was:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>1.29 million people participated in the beta </li><li>145 different countries participated in the beta </li><li>249 years worth of matches played </li><li>More than 11 million matches completed </li><li>More than 927 million kills recorded </li><li>More than 131 million executions performed </li><li>More than 23 million deaths by chainsaw </li><li>Nearly 23 BILLION bullets fired </li><li>460 million ribbons and 294 million medals earned&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>435 thousand people earned the beta exclusive Thrashball Cole skin to use in the retail game
</li><li>234 thousand people earned the beta exclusive Gold Retro Lancer to use in the retail game
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gears of War 3 releases worldwide on September 20th, 2011</p>

<p>I missed out on Thrashball Cole. &nbsp;I was aiming for it but then I sort of lost interest in the beta for the final week or so.</p>
<p>Ah well...I still got my Flame guns. &nbsp;Looking forward to some 12 year old accusing me of hacking the game when I chainsaw him with my flame lancer lol.</p>

<h2>            Some Windows 8 Apps won&#39;t connect to the internet</h2>
                    My windows store app, mail app and massaging app will connect to the Internet but all other apps will not connect, it says "No Internet Connection". And everything on my desktop connects. I am using a USB Mobile Broadband Connection. So how do i get all
 the other Apps to connect, like the news app, sport app and the travel app? <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh the Apps connect to the Internet when i connect to WiFi.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that </span><span>your windows store app, mail app and messaging app is connecting to the Internet but all other apps are unable to connect, it says "No Internet Connection". Apps like the news app, sport app and the travel app are not
 connecting. The Apps connect to the Internet when you connect to Wifi.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s start with some questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>What is the exact Error message when you try to open other apps?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would recommend you to follow the given methods and check, reply with the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: </span></b><b><span>Check for any updates for the mobile software.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</b></a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important: Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these
</span><span>steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Disable anti-virus.</span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>a) Press “Windows + R” key to open Run Window.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
b) In the Run window Type Control and click ok to open Control panel.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
c) Select security in control panel and then select Security Center.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
d) Click on Malware protection. (If Windows can detect your antivirus software, it will be listed under Virus protection.)</span></p>
<p><span><br />
e) If the software is on, check the Help that came with the software for information on disabling it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><br />
Windows does not detect all antivirus software, and some antivirus software doesn't report its status to Windows. If your antivirus software is not displayed in Windows Security Center and you're not sure how to find it, try any of the following:</p>
<p><span><br />
• Look for the antivirus software in the list of programs on the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
• Type the name of the software or the publisher in the Search box on the Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
• Look for the icon in the notification area of the taskbar.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<b>Note:</b> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps, if you still have any query feel free to post. I will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            Sorry to hear of the issue, but you should be posting in the reddit forum here https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/ so the insider team can help you fix it.

<p>Hi xkmvenum2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. If you've already attempted the Offline System Update, have you attempted using a different USB port on the console to load the operating system on the console?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know.</p>

<p>The offline OSU should not be used by Insiders I believe.</p>
<p>Have you tried a factory reset after ensuring you have your account details.</p>

<p>Head over to Reddit Insiders as stated above and I'm sure you will get some answers.</p>
<p>You might consider dropping back to a lower ring also.</p>

<p>On my skype calling list, I have a friend that has that 'muted' icon, next to the time of the last call.</p>
<p>When I start a new call with him, the speaker is automatically muted. I can manually unmute it, but the next call is automatically muted again.</p>
<p>I can't click, double click, right click, or exorcise out this icon in any way.</p>
<p>This is happening on MacOS with the latest skype.</p>
<p>Does anyone know where I can change this?</p>

</p><p>You can change this from the user's profile. Right click on the user's name and select view profile. From the profile window scroll down to see
<strong>chat settings </strong>and toggle <strong>notifications </strong>on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if that helps.</p>
