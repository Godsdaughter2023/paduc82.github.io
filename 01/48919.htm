    <title>Explorer column width too small - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Explorer column width too small</h2>
                    I need to increase the default name column width within Windows Explorer so <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
every</span> folder I open shows more information. The current default width is currently 200 pixels - way too small for my needs and windows won't remember to fit columns when I select a subsequent folder.

    <title>MD5 error during installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andr&#233;strydom  say:</h3>
<h2>            MD5 error during installation</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded my Finale music notation software from the 2011 version to the new 2014 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely uninstalled the old version (on the recommendation of the makers of the software), but keep running into a problem when I try to install the new version.&nbsp; Everything goes fine until it comes to installing the various instrumental sounds.&nbsp; About
 halfway through the process, I get this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Two subsequent MD5 checks on _____ provided the same bad result.&nbsp; Installed sample set is corrupted.&nbsp; Please reinstall it.&nbsp; Installation canceled."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried about six times to do this installation, but get the same result every time.&nbsp; And the files on which the MD5 check failed (represented by the underscore above) is different with each installation attempt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been working on this problem for about two weeks now with the makers of the software, and they no longer have any suggestions.&nbsp; So, my hopes are pinned on you gurus on this web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>FIFA 15 Fails to Start Installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vi nightmar3 iv  say:</h3>
<h2>            FIFA 15 Fails to Start Installing</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased FIFA 15 this morning and am still unable to install the game. &nbsp;I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.</p>
<p>Whenever I begin trying to install the game it fails and says "Installation Stopped". &nbsp;It never reaches 0%.</p>
<p>Below are a list of things I've tried:</p>
<p>1) Cold restart.</p>
<p>2) Disconnecting from the network.</p>
<p>3) Signing out all profiles.</p>
<p>4) Signing in different profiles.</p>
<p>5) Uninstalling FIFA 15 demo from the console.</p>
<p>6) Uninstalling FIFA 14 from the console.</p>
<p>7) Restarting install (many many times)</p>
<p>8) Updating the console. &nbsp;(It was already up to date)</p>
<p>I've also tried just about every combination of the above.</p>
<p>If someone has any insight into why this is happening I'd appreciate the feedback.</p>
<p>Addition information that may be relevant:</p>
<p>1) When I downloaded the FIFA 15 demo about a week ago, FIFA 14 started messing up. &nbsp;It would always start the game in a match (even after a cold restart). &nbsp;Couldn't connect to the EA servers and sometimes would fail to load the game all together. &nbsp;This
 has continued even after uninstalling the FIFA 15 demo.</p>
<p>2) I've never been able to get the auto-start feature to work for FIFA 14. &nbsp;Even after turning off the 'resume game' option settings it still tries to do it and always fails. &nbsp;Either gets frozen in the menu or fails to load the actual match. &nbsp;I've been getting
 around this for the past couple months by doing a cold restart everytime.</p>
<p>3) My OS version is listed as: &nbsp;6.2.11511.0</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Kyle M.</p>

<p>Mister Quimby,</p>
<p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;I was attempting to install it from a disc. &nbsp;And no, unfortunately no error codes. &nbsp; &nbsp;I ended up restarting our modem (which I had tried previously) and it seemed to fix the problem. &nbsp;Still not sure what the issue was, but I can
 at least play the game now.</p>

<p>************** JIT Debugging **************<br />
To enable just-in-time (JIT) debugging, the .config file for this<br />
application or computer (machine.config) must have the<br />
jitDebugging value set in the system.windows.forms section.<br />
The application must also be compiled with debugging<br />
enabled.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.</p>
<p>My question is how do I make this go away???</p>
<p>Thanls</p>

            Hi angel1243.&nbsp; The problem is caused by Dell DataSafe Online running at startup and apparently it is required for the automatic backups to run.&nbsp; See here http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/services/datasafe/en/datasafe_faqs?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=19
 for more information.&nbsp; If you are not a subscriber and dont intend to use the service then you can safely uninstall the software.&nbsp; If you are a subscriber then you should contact Dell Support to troubleshoot the issue.<br />

            <p>Hi Kim,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be assured that we would do our best to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to incorrect keyboard layout setting enabled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to follow the methods below and check if it helps to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>I suggest you to reset the keyboard layout by reinstalling the language and check if it fixes the issue.
</span><span>Follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows+R&nbsp;</span></strong>keys and type “<strong><span>intl.cpl</span></strong>”. Hit Enter. It will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; open Region window.</span></li><li>
<span>Go to "<strong><span>Administrative</span></strong>" tab and click on "<strong><span>Change system locale</span></strong>" button.</span></li><li>
<span>Select the correct language and country from the drop-down box.</span></li><li>
<span>Now, navigate to the location tab and check if region settings are appropriate.</span></li><li>
<span>Apply the changes and Windows will require a reboot.</span></li><li>
<span>Check if that fixes the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.</span></li></ol>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Let’s add another keyboard layout and switch back to English (United Kingdom) language and try to fix the issue. Follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Refer to the link to know add a language: (You already have the English (UK) language. Try adding the English (US) language):</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>After adding the language, follow the steps from the section “<strong><span>To make a keyboard your default keyboard</span></strong>” in the section to make English (US) as the default language:</span></p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<span>Restart the computer. Check if the mapping for the keys on the keyboard are appropriate. Then, proceed to the next step.</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the steps to remove the keyboard layout for English (US) and set English (UK) language as the default one:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Press&nbsp;<strong><span>Windows and X</span></strong>&nbsp;keys together and click on&nbsp;<strong><span>Control Panel.</span></strong></span></li><li>

<h2>            Why did Homegroup just enable itself&#63; is there a log to see what anything &#39;shared&#39; without my knowledge or consent&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hi All
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I refer you also to the question asked in 2010&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>

What does Homegroup do and how did it get installed on my PC?
<div>The answer given to this question showed how to disable homegroup but it did not answer the fundamental question of why did Homegroup suddenly install/enable itself. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Like the previous correspondant the Homegroup ICON just appeared. I didn't ask it to. I was not asked to enter a password nor was I asked to limit what could be shared.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I cannot see any kind of log to show what if anything was shared nor who or what prompted Homegroup to enable.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Has someone been into y computer and viewed important data?????</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Should I be ringing the bank and closing all my accounts?????</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Should I be changing all my passwords??????</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is very unsettling. Please gave someone give a prompt response.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thx</div>
                </div>

            <blockquote>Hi All
<div><br />
<div>I refer you also to the question asked in 2010&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
What does Homegroup do and how did it get installed on my PC?
<div>The answer given to this question showed how to disable homegroup but it did not answer the fundamental question of why did Homegroup suddenly install/enable itself. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Like the previous correspondant the Homegroup ICON just appeared. I didn't ask it to. I was not asked to enter a password nor was I asked to limit what could be shared.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I cannot see any kind of log to show what if anything was shared nor who or what prompted Homegroup to enable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Has someone been into y computer and viewed important data?????</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should I be ringing the bank and closing all my accounts?????</div>
<div><br />
<div>Should I be changing all my passwords??????</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is very unsettling. Please gave someone give a prompt response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thx</div>

Homegroups are the Windows 7/8.x default local networking&nbsp;system for file and printer sharing on a local network. It is meant to be a simplified&nbsp;alternative&nbsp;system to setting up a conventional&nbsp;"Workgroup" on your LAN.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Homegroups are created automatically when a new network connection is detected or created on your computer. Possibly a nuisance but nothing scary in it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As the name implies it is intended&nbsp;for use on private networks (LAN), not&nbsp;public ones (ie. internet).&nbsp; Homegroups can only be used by Windows 7 and Windows 8.x computers. That makes them&nbsp;nearly useless for networking with computers that use different operating
 systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each computer with a full version of Win7&nbsp;(not Basic or Starter) can create its own Homegroup but these different Homegroups do not connect to each other. To have the Win7&nbsp;computers connect to each other's shares&nbsp;they must all join the same Homegroup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Windows by default generates a random password for each new Homegroup. You can change the password. No other computer on the network can join&nbsp;any &nbsp;Homegroup without entering the current password for that specific Homegroup.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You still need to designate which files and folders&nbsp;will be&nbsp;shared on the network and provide the Homegroup password to the computers you want to have&nbsp;connected to it. You also control whether other computers have write permissions in your shared resources.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To get rid of an unwanted&nbsp;Homegroup every computer that has joined that Homegroup must leave it. This includes the computer that the Homegroup was created on. Once the Homegroup is gone you'll need to set up a conventional network Workgroup if you want to
 share files etc. with other computers&nbsp;on&nbsp;your local network.&nbsp; If you've only got a single computer you need to make sure that file and printer sharing is not enabled on "Public" networks. That should be the default anyway but double checking never hurts.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>All the relevant settings&nbsp;can be&nbsp;accessed via the "Network and Sharing Center".</p>

            The Question Is, "Why does the<b>&nbsp;Homegroup</b>&nbsp;icon come and go on its own??" when I log on it will be there...then the next day it is Not there... then days later, it is there. You cannot deleted it or move the icon to trash...&nbsp;
<div>My understanding of this Is, when They are on My computer the icon shows up and when They are not on the computer it go's away!&nbsp;</div>
<div><u>They= Windows (Microsoft)</u></div>
<div><u><br />
</u>
<div>*It say's to, 'allow windows to manage&nbsp;<b>Homegroup</b>&nbsp;connections (recommended)&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have everything disabled BUT the 'allow windows...</div>
<div>If I have No other devices, WHY would I allow windows to manage my connections?</div>
<div><br />
<div>PS. I see it saying another city on my computer when the icon has been on my page. then when its not on my page, it goes back to my city location.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I.E 'Weather' app say's 'NY' when I live in 'SC' and goes back to 'SC' when the homepage icon is gone (also with Facebook) It will say I posted from NY when I am in SC!!??</div>
<div>As well as the computer slowing down and not responding at times...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>ANY insight to this would be greatly appreciated and not 'how to' but 'WHY?'&nbsp;</div>

            <p>You really should have started your own thread. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft doesn't get onto your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know how your connection to the internet is set up but it sounds like you&nbsp;have either&nbsp;enabled network discovery and possibly file and printer sharing on Public networks;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OR, </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Your computer&nbsp;has a direct connection to the internet through your ISP and you have set that connection up as a Private network connection when it is&nbsp;actually a Public network connection.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You should only&nbsp;enable&nbsp;network discovery and sharing&nbsp;on Private (a home or work LAN connection isolated from your ISP) networks.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems that every so often your computer is discovering some of your ISP's&nbsp;other customers' computers&nbsp;that have&nbsp;similar network settings and also&nbsp;happen to have a Homegroup set up. In short, your computer is treating your ISP connection&nbsp;as your private
 LAN and is making LAN connections to other customers who have made the same mistake&nbsp;when setting up their network connections.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This also&nbsp;ties in to&nbsp;the reasons to allow Windows to manages network/Homegroup connections.&nbsp;Mainly, because many people know just enough about network settings to mess them up.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As for the location&nbsp;issues with the weather and Facebook postings, its possible that&nbsp;your ISP operates servers in different states and it sometimes switches your DHCP server location between SC and NY for some reason. Compare your network IP now against
 what it is&nbsp;the next time you see the location changes&nbsp;happening (SC vs NY). Web services can recognize the originating location of the IP you are connecting&nbsp;from and might be adjusting your location data based on that.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To check this, you can use this&nbsp;webpage to find out just where your current IP is originating from:</p>

            Well, that was not at all helpful.

<div><span>So Ralf_G &lt;&lt;I was going off that So why would I start a new thread</span></div>
<div>
<div>after reading your response I felt sincerely, you did not answer it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do not want or need a <b>Homegroup.</b>&nbsp;Also, I did not set-up a&nbsp;<b>Homegroup.</b></div>
<div>so I did what everyone&nbsp;said&nbsp;to do, change settings</div>
<div><b>CHANGE ADVANCED&nbsp;SHARING&nbsp;SETTINGS....</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;*<u>Change sharing&nbsp;options&nbsp;for different network profiles&nbsp;</u></div>
<div>Under Private: everything is turned off BUT why is there a (recommendation) for the follow 1st option&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>**allow windows to manage&nbsp;<b>Homegroup</b>&nbsp;connections (recommended)&nbsp;</div>
<div>**use users accounts and passwords to connect to other computers</div>
<div><br />
<div>Of course, since it said, recommenced. I left that checked.</div>
<div>so, I still had&nbsp;<b>Homegroup icon-</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic"><span><span>It</span>&nbsp;just&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(153, 153, 255, 1); text-decoration-line: underline">appears

 next log in.</div>
<div>&nbsp; So, I decided to change that</div>
<div>I just click the the 2nd option ^ (that is NOT recommended) and that mysteries '<b>Homepage</b>' Icon has NOT shown up like I stated before.</div>
<div>&amp; I no longer see my weather from other states or my Facebook locations coming from another state</div>

            <p>The problem was with your tacking on a different set of problems to&nbsp;the original poster's&nbsp;questions and both of you referencing some 4 year old&nbsp;thread without providing any link to it... as if anyone reading this would automatically know&nbsp;which exact post
 from 2010&nbsp;you were talking about. In any case I did answer the questions&nbsp;asked by the OP in my first reply.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To address your points: Firstly, HomeGroup doesn't install itself, it is an integral part of Windows networking. It is
<strong>always there</strong> in the background,&nbsp;<em>available to be used on <strong>
private</strong> networks only</em>. You can either&nbsp;start up&nbsp;a&nbsp;HomeGroup on a Win7/8 computer (Windows starts doing this automatically&nbsp;when you have a new Private network connection)&nbsp;or you can join&nbsp;a&nbsp;Homegroup that was created on a different computer on the
 same local network that your computer is connected to.&nbsp;&nbsp;If no one joins the HomeGroup it is pretty much just being there doing nothing and you can ignore it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you create a Homegroup on your own computer your computer is automatically joined to that Homegroup and it is&nbsp;always present. IOW you wouldn't be invited to join it. Other computers can only&nbsp;join it&nbsp;if you provide them the Homegroup password. No password,
 no sharing, no unwanted guests.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you haven't created a Homegroup but you keep getting the option to join a Homegroup then the likeliest cause&nbsp;would be&nbsp;that you are intermittently connecting to other computers that DO have Homegroups enabled. &nbsp;It is always possible to join a Homegroup
 on a private (Home) network so the invitation automatically pops up asking if you want to join. You cannot actually join those Homegroups unless you have their passwords.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The thing is it should not be possible to detect Homegroups that are&nbsp;not in&nbsp;your own&nbsp;local area network (ie. a home LAN)&nbsp;that your computer is connected to and Homegroups should not be able to exist at all on Public networks. The only way that a single computer
 connected directly to the internet could detect other people's HomeGroups would be if both your computer and those others have their internet connections configured as a Private network. If that network connection is changed to "Public" the Homegroup(s) should
 no longer appear.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As far as your concern about whether to let Windows manage Homegroup connections or to use user accounts and passwords, it really is a non-issue for anyone who is not sharing files and printers on a network. If you're not joined to other computers in a Homegroup
 then there are no connections to manage and if you aren't sharing files and printers&nbsp;over a network at all then&nbsp;there are no other users or their passwords&nbsp;needed to make network connections either. In your case it makes no real difference whichever option
 you pick.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<div><b>&lt;&lt;what was my mistake again</b>?&nbsp;</div>
<p>Without knowing the precise details of how your computer is configured to connect to the internet everything is guesswork at this point but the things you describe happening suggest that you have a direct&nbsp;internet connection that has been configured as a
 Private network in Windows.&nbsp; <br />
That would be the mistake. A direct internet connection should almost always be configured as Public.</p>
<i>
<p><br />
</p>
</i>
<div>Is it that I did not set-up a <b>homegroup</b>&nbsp;/ it keeps asking me to do so???</div>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Nope, nothing to do with it. IMO Windows keeps asking you to set up a homegroup because like most people your internet connection&nbsp;may be given a different IP address every time you connect to your internet service.&nbsp; Because (as I suspect) you have that connection
 set up in Windows as a Private rather than Public network, Windows is treating each different new IP address the computer gets as if it is a brand new Private network connection.&nbsp; Since the HomeGroup&nbsp;&nbsp;is the new default networking option in Windows 7/8 , Windows
 asks if you want to create a new HomeGroup whenever it detects there is&nbsp;a new private network connection. Supposedly that is meant as&nbsp;a convenience to the user rather than just annoying. If the network connection was set to Public there couldn't be a Homegroup
 on it so Windows wouldn't ask if you want to create one. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Did you ever try&nbsp;that link I gave last time to see if&nbsp;it detects you in different cities/states whenever the HomeGroup appears compared to when it doesn't?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Yeah I know homegroup does not install itself but thanks for letting me know.
<div>No, I will not even have a homegoupe on this computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div><i>'the likeliest cause&nbsp;would be&nbsp;that you are intermittently connecting to other computers that DO have Homegroups'</i>&nbsp; How can I have that stopped?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, thanks for answering but when I was searching for a answer to this, this was the only post with the following question that had somewhat answered close to question... I didn't want a bunch of similar post if I had started a new thread. Because you
 did so well.....</div>
<div>Also. &nbsp;"<i>whether to let Windows manage Homegroup connections or to use user accounts and passwords</i>,
<i>it really is a non-issue&nbsp;"</i></div>
<div><i>&nbsp;</i>It does not happen any more! after checking that box '<i>use users&nbsp;</i></div>
<div><b>Plus, if it&nbsp;doesn't&nbsp;make a difference, they should not make it an option.</b></div>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>Everyone said, it had Nothing to do with that Icon not showing up anymore...</div>
<div>Well, I beg to differ. it was showing every day off and on&nbsp;</div>
<div>Ever since I did that, NO more icon showing up, no more different locations showing up, from FB and weather.... I know its only been since 02/07</div>
<div>If it appears again. I will come back and say 'I eat cow' &amp; I'm a dumb azz</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;I corrected the problem without really getting a good reason WHY it happens, the random '<b>homegroup icon</b>&nbsp;....'-AND those putting in the same question as I, will see this.&nbsp;<i>regardless of how old the post is and maybe just maybe it will help someone
 ...its a problem for 2010 but still happening Now</i></div>
<div><b>Everything&nbsp;you said was point on &amp; correct, just not helpful to this problem. or just not for me. even though I have it&nbsp;corrected&nbsp;It was by checking that&nbsp;unnecessary&nbsp;box.&nbsp;</b></div>

<p>Homegroup should not 'install itself' - which I find that it does if certain patch updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think this to be true especially if the machine is already part of an active directory LAN and so has a domain network profile.</p>

<p>This Homegroup thing is extremely intrusive. I run a small home network (also used for business) and I set up every PC to use User accounts and passwords to connect to other PCs. I can't stand this Homegroup feature - I give every PC a static IP address
 and I know what I am doing when it comes to networking (I am an IT professional) - I even DISABLE the two Homegroup services to try to prevent them from functioning - and everything works just fine, like it is supposed to. But whenever there is an unexplained
 networking glitch, I go and check on my PC and Lo and Behold, the Homegroup has somehow re-enabled itself, sometimes changed my network to Public (??) and has forced my system to Allow Windows to manage Homegroup connections!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOOOO!!!! Microsoft!! DON'T assume you know better than I!&nbsp; DON'T change my settings without my permission!! And DON'T re-enable things I have purposefully disabled! That is so intrusive and Big Brother. I don't like it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And all it actually seems to do is exactly what DHCP was designed to do, plus handholding through file sharing. We are NOT all dummies! I would be so happy if somebody posted a patch that allowed me to completely delete all Homegroup traces from every PC
 I ever used. It's an annoying solution to a non-existent problem.</p>

            This Solved all my problems after a re-Install of Windows 10. I had all my simulators/games installed on a separate drive so I wouldn't lose the install and progress. I ran into a boot problem and as said above re-installed windows 10. Upon creating shortcuts
 and testing each game I ran into a few games&nbsp;and &nbsp;wouldn't start cause of various DXd3d_# error's. Consider the problem solved....Thank's slance310 for linking.

    <title>Bluetooth audio lag on windows 10... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonjohnson519  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth audio lag on windows 10...</h2>
                    <p>I know I can't be the only one who experiences this because I have tried several different bluetooth headsets and speakers on multiple PC's, laptops, and even a surface pro 4. &nbsp;For music it's not big deal because you can't really realize the delay. &nbsp;However,
 watching videos or playing a game it becomes extremely noticeable. &nbsp;Its generally a lag of about somewhere between 250-500ms as a rough estimate based on adjustments through VLC and Kodi. &nbsp;This seems to be the case for all devices on all systems. &nbsp;I even came
 across an open source Bluetooth fix, which made it slightly closer, and have gone through tons of forums saying to turn off power management for the Bluetooth and disabling audio enhancements.... However, there's always a lag (had the same issue on windows
 8). &nbsp; Also, when I use my android tablet or phone, there is no noticeable delay with any of these devices. &nbsp;If it helps, I've tried using powerbeats Bluetooth headphones (firmware up to date), some generic Bluetooth headphones, Amazon Echo, and Amazon Tap.
 &nbsp;Each seem to have the same delay. &nbsp;I know I can adjust audio sync manually&nbsp;in programs like kodi or vlc, but I'm not looking for a "band-aid" fix. Especially since I primarily use Plex to stream my personal content (which does not have an audio sync setting).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a windows issue since I have no delay when connecting to non windows devices. &nbsp;With all that said, does anyone have any other ideas or possible solutions to this issue?</p>

            While I appreciate the response, that link has literally nothing to do with the issues I described.... I have no issues with connectivity, only a delay in the audio which is present across multiple devices running windows 10, and with any bluetooth audio
 device I pair. &nbsp;

            <p>Jenicel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You send a consumer question to a MSDN piece on lowering audio latency in Win10?! What are we supposed to do, rewrite the audio drivers ourselves to use the new APIs?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is no helpful at all. It seems this audio lag is a known problem in Windows but doesn't happen enough to get any attention? I have two different brands of bluetooth headsets that both have this video-audio lag on windows but not on my Android devices.
 It's very frustrating that MS experts are so clewless.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for backing me on this. &nbsp;I don't understand why this issue doesn't seem to get more attention. &nbsp;I know in programs like VLC and Kodi, you can adjust audio latency for video, but that is only helpful if you have the media on your pc and not streaming.
 &nbsp;Watching netflix or playing games is just pointless with bluetooth headsets / speakers. &nbsp;Microsoft's customer support refuses to actually address the issue. &nbsp;It's like they aren't even reading the post and letting a bot provide the response. &nbsp;First they give
 me a troubleshooting guide for bluetooth that doesnt pertain to the issue I describe, then a ridiculous link for the drivers....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, this issue needs to be addressed. &nbsp;If Apple, google, and linux can provide bluetooth audio without latency, you can too. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought a bluetooth headset in the hopes that it would free me from the wire clutter. First test was with an android tablet and it works flawlessly, audio sync nicely with video. At that point I didn't even realize audio lag is even a possible issue. Well,
 next test is with Windows 10, and boy what a disappointment :(. Audio lags in every video player I tried. Games are even worse. I would've thought even a mid-end PC would stomp on android tablet anytime anywhere in the performance department but boy was I
 wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A Windows 10 PC, lags where a tablet does not, this is very sad. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Microsoft even acknowledging this issue? Changing driver from the built in one to CSR driver, switching to High Performance power profile, makes no difference at all. LatencyMon is showing all green.</p>

            If you're trying to watch videos, you can use VLC player... "J" and "K" on the keyboard will adjust latency so you can at least watch without wanting to throw your headphones at your monitor... As for gaming, forget it... So frustrating, and it seems Microsoft
 doesn't care to address the issue. Really quiet unbelievable because as you said, works great on my Android tablet

<p>POZAR XDXD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely don't fix it yourself. Opening the console will void any warranty you have. If you want to get it fixed by Xbox, go to their&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device Repair Website</a> and submit
 a warranty repair claim.&nbsp; If you aren't sure if it is still under warranty, go through this process and it will let you know. Let us know if you have any questions!</p>

            Hi, I bought it at online store "morele.net" (it's a polish site). Xbox has lots of room, it lays on my desk. Yes, the noise started immediately on start up.

<p>Thanks for responding back so quickly, I recommend reaching out to the retailer to see what return options are available. As well if the console is under warranty you can register it on our

                    I don't understand. How can Microsoft Silverlight (64-bit) Version: 5.1.10411.0 operate in Firefox 14.0.1, a 32-bit browser and within plugin-container.exe also running as a 32-bit process? How can a 32-bit plugin container contain a 64-bit plugin? Silverlight
 64-bit does work in Netflix under Firefox with this very configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; o.O&nbsp;&nbsp; Isn't this defeating the purpose of 64-bit Silverlight and/or negating any advantages of 64-bit operating systems and CPU's?

<p><span>Microsoft Silverlight installs a 64-bit add-on for Internet Explorer 64-bit and installs a 32-bit add-on for 32-bit Internet Explorer and other

            Hello. Thank you for the reply. <br />
<br />
Although this makes more sense to me, It does not support what is reported by Microsoft Silverlight Configuration under Firefox 14.01 (32-bit) for both ca.movies.netflix.com or movies.netflix.com.<br />
<br />
The Microsoft Silverlight Configuration About tab clearly reports as Microsoft Silverlight (64-bit) Version: 5.1.10411.0 under Firefox 14.01 (32-bit). Perhaps this is false and misleading information reported via Microsoft Silverlight Configuration utility
 under 32-bit browsers like Firefox 14.01...<br />

<h2>            win8 notepad print not responding.</h2>
                    Just started! Worked properly yesterday, today notepad print returns not responding. Everything else in notepad functions properly. I have not made any changes between it working properly and not working properly. All other apps, wordpad, word, wordperfect,
 spf edit, print properly. The printer and drivers are working just fine, the notepad app, print is not.
<div>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks</div>

            notepad opens a print window. the only thing in the window is a dimmed slider bar. after waiting a few minutes I attempted to close the window and got the response "Print not responding". I closed the window again and had windows search for a solution
 which did not return any results.
<div>The printer worked with at least 6 other apps, therefore the driver and printer worked correctly.</div>
<div>I solved the problem by restoring from my last backup 10 days ago. Since I store any important data on a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;drive. the only thing I lost was a update to c++ that I updated right away.</div>
<div>Anyway, it is working properly now. Sorry if someone else has the problem and does not have a backup.</div>
<div>To restate:</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; It does not appear to be a driver or printer problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; It dos appear to be a problem with the print portion of notepad.</div>
<div>Thanks for the answer.</div>

    <title>4GB RAM on 32-bits WINDOWS 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eduardo samayoa  say:</h3>
<h2>            4GB RAM on 32-bits WINDOWS 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys I'm here for 2 sample questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Microsoft says Windows 8 could use as maximum of ram 4GB on 32-bit, but O.S. only recognize 3GB; WHY?<br />
<em><u>[I know if I want to use 4GB I need install the 64-bits version of windows 8.]</u></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Whatever be your answer, is recommended the use of 4GB&nbsp; on 32-bit of OS?<em><u> If your answer is NOT please explain me.</u></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<em><u>
<p><u>--------</u></p>
</u></em>
<p>I'm doing these question because I don't understand what's the difference between 32 and 64 bits. I only know the maximum of RAM you can use between each one, and some programs only work with x86 architecture and others with x64 like a servers ,who's use
 a lot of RAM.</p>
<p><u>--------</u></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the question. I see that you want to know the difference between 32 bit and 64 bit version of Windows. Let me help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would like to let you know that the main difference between the 32-bit versions of Windows and the 64-bit versions of Windows relate to memory accessibility, memory management, and enhanced security features.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The terms <font><b>32-bit</b> and <b>64-bit</b> refer to the way a computer's processor (also called a
<b>CPU</b>), handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you're using a 32-bit version of Windows, the amount of usable memory might be less than the total amount of memory installed. PAE enables 32-bit processors to access more than 4 GB of physical memory on capable versions
 of Windows and is a prerequisite for NX.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi justinrpg7,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Generally, whenever your computer is scanned by Microsoft Windows Server for updates, it will only download those updates which
 are important and necessary for the computer, so that the computer is up to date. In order to check for the updates installed on the computer, you may go to Windows Update site and check the update history.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may also check whether the Windows Update is automatically set to scan for updates every day.<br />
Control Panel &gt;&gt; Windows Update &gt;&gt; Change settings &gt;&gt; Install updates automatically (recommended).<br />
<br />
Let us know if that helps.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can set the time to be when it is not inconvenient.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Updates - on left Change Settings... pick a better time and/or even once a week.<br />
<br />
You can also have it only download and not install until you say or just notify you of their availability<br />
or not update at all (you can do it totally manually on demand).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            There is no email program associated to perform the requested action - Email message</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am receiving the following message, both when I start my PC and seemingly randomly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association in the Default Programs control panel."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine that this has something to do with me removing Office 2010 (I believe it was). I never used anything associated with the program and try to keep my PC clean. I have no idea what the requested action is, that the message describes as this is when
 Windows is starts up. I have never used any sort of thick email client and only use gmail webmail (and even then the last time I used my actual email for something other then paying bills I don't remember).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a gaming and entertainment PC using fully updated Windows 10. I don't want or need an email client based in windows. Is there any way to get rid of this annoying message? I've looked all over for an answer to this message but it's always setting
 a default email program in windows, but none of the questions really seem to focus on someone who has absolutely no use for an installed email client or the mailto function.</p>

</p><p>From the description, it is understood that an email program has been removed from your computer.&nbsp;In this case you can set the built in&nbsp;Windows 10 mail&nbsp;app as the default email client in control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> +"<strong>X</strong>"</p>
<p>Select <strong>control panel</strong></p>

<h2>            Minecraft shader</h2>
                    Hello, I'm writing to you today to find out if Minecraft will ever have a shader pack.&nbsp; Since the last announcement of microsoft for this dlc very promising, we have no news, which does not surprise me.&nbsp; For some time I have said that developers and microsoft,
 make no effort for the community.&nbsp; For example: exclusives, devices and prices still high.&nbsp; I have a slight hope that your company will bring out good games and will not cancel every time good ideas like vr helmets that were to arrive.&nbsp; Unfortunately I find
 it sad that all playstation players make fun of us, because of their exclusivities and playstation vr, that I jealous.&nbsp; It's good to make us 4K games, and want to make the strongest console, but this is not enough for the players, we need stories, realism,
 content, and do not make us all so expensive&nbsp; .&nbsp; I know that work in the gaming industry is not so easy, but sometimes you have to know how to listen to customers, people, so your commu

            Hello, certainly as important as the power may be, obviously the titles are too, and the acquisition of Microsoft of new studios (like Ninja Theory and Obsidian) will ensure that new games will be announced available only on Microsoft devices during E3
 of this year.

<p>Yeah they do have a pop at americans quite often. (remember stigs american cousin) Can't say i've ever seen the USA or australian versions but are they not the same against us brits? I remember when clarkson and co had the aussie guys on the uk show and
 it was tit for tat the whole 60 minutes</p>

<p>They are not bias toward american cars thats for sure. &nbsp;So I wouldnt expect a whole lot of American cars in the Autovista. Or the few that are in there, might not have many nice things that will be said. &nbsp; haha&nbsp;&nbsp; Dan said that they did not edit anything

<p>If we can't laugh at ourselves, who can we laugh at? &nbsp; Lest you forget that they're not above taking shots at themselves either, commenting on how Brits can't make a decent car and they're all put together in a shed with a hammer (not a direct quote, but
 you get the idea). I'm American, and I find the show to be hilarious. &nbsp;Clarkson, Hammond, and May's comments are meant to bring entertainment value to the show and to be "edgy". &nbsp;If they don't get a rise out of people, then they're not doing their job. &nbsp;If
 you take to heart everything that they say, perhaps you need to lighten up a bit.</p>

<p>Honestly, I'd be highly surprised if he DIDN'T have anything bad to say about Americans or American cars.&nbsp; If it's true that T10 didn't edit any of his commentary, then I'd expect digs at American cars for not being able to go around a corner, Italian cars
 for being temperamental and impractical, German cars for being cold and lifeless, etc. etc. Why bother having his commentary if it's just some canned, watered down version of what some PR exec wants him to say to make everyone feel warm and cozy?&nbsp; They could
 get a lot cheaper voice talent than Jeremy Clarkson to do that, if that's what they wanted.</p>

<p>I'm american and I absolutely love everything top gear uk. Can't stand Top gear US. I also happen to agree with the majority of the things they say about most all of the cars. Some things I don't (I drive a wrx) and they bashed it in an episode a while back.
 But it's a game and they will make it entertaining for sure.</p>
