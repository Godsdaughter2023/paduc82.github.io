<h2>            Slow and no response for 10 minutes after starting up</h2>
                    
<p>Each stage if startup really slow, from windows splash to login, log in to User interface and then interface to actual usage.&nbsp; Machine will run ok after 10-15 minutes but it takes that long to warm up.&nbsp; Task bar does not respond and neither will the start
 button, i can press icons like IE but nothing will happen for 5 mins and then another 5 mins of program not responding brfore it will be workable.&nbsp; 2 other machines running win7 on the network and no other issues with them. After i did the initial install
 everything was super quick but it degraded quickly to this state.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Clean install of 32 bit win 7.&nbsp; No compatability issues from pre-check<br />
Athlon 64x2 dual proc 4600= 2.4 Ghz 2 gig ram.<br />

<p><strong><span>Hi smiths,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It looks that some startup items are taking the time to boot your computer. Initially you may disable the Antivirus if at all
 running on your computer and then check. I would also suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and then check in clean boot. Check one by one for the startup programs that are taking the time to boot up –</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Below are steps to boot</span><strong><span> in Safe Mode.
</span></strong><span>In Safe mode, you have access to only basic files and drivers.</span></span></p>

<br />
<p>I FOUND SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM!</p>
<p>The crash of your computer during Windows Updates has caused that !</p>
<p>I had this issue on my laptop since November, and it really bugged me.&nbsp; I sifted through the event log and found the pattern of events that preceded the issue, and, probably, caused it.<br />
<br />
In short, the pattern is as follows: Windows updates run automatically as scheduled, and when reboot is initiated after the updates are finished, the computer crashes (probably during reboot sequence).&nbsp; When it boots up, it reports that the last shutdown was
 unexpected, and the issue begins to occur.<br />
<br />
I spent 2 days trying to dig out a solution from the Internet, to no avail, until I came across
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/list-services-running-under-svchostexe-process/#advanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>.&nbsp; It doesn't say anything about this particular problem, but it gives more information about SVCHOST process that starts many services, including Group Policy Client.&nbsp; It looks like during reboot a vital registry settings were lost during crash
 and Group Policy Client "don't know" how to start.&nbsp; Let me explain:<br />
<br />
There are two places to look in the registry:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</strong> this path should contain
<strong>gpsvc </strong>key (a folder), which is responsible for service parameters and configuration.&nbsp; I found that the key was intact, so, you do not touch anything here - just check that the key exists.</li><li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SVCHOST</strong> This is the most important path you should look into, as it must contain the keys and values referred in the key #1.&nbsp; Below are descriptions what must be present there.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>There must be Multi-String value called <strong>GPSvcGroup</strong>. My laptop was missing it.&nbsp; So, you should create multi-string value named
<strong>GPSvcGroup </strong>and assign it value <strong>GPSvc</strong>.</li><li>Next, you must create a key (a folder) and name it <strong>GPSvcGroup</strong> - this key normally should be there, but, again, it was missin on my laptop.</li><li>Then open newly-created <strong>GPSvcGroup </strong>folder and create 2 DWORD values:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>First called <strong>AuthenticationCapabilities </strong>and you must give it a value of 0x00003020 (or 12320 in decimal)</li><li>Second is called <strong>CoInitializeSecurityParam </strong>and it must have value of 1.</li></ol>
<p>Once you complete all steps above, reboot the computer and the problem will be fixed.</p>
<p>Video walkthrough for those who are not very technical is here:&nbsp;<a href="http://youtu.be/4m5KEmckWK4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://youtu.be/4m5KEmckWK4</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/4m5KEmckWK4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/4m5KEmckWK4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>
</p>
<p>I am so relieved I was able to fix it, and hope this will help others with the similar issue.

<h3> doomeddisaster  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello brings me to second log in screen</h2>
                    Ever since the last fall update I try to use windows Hello to log in. It works fine while logging in from sleep mode. While starting up from being off completely it sees me then sends me to the log in screen again where I have to use my pin. Apparently
 the settings are synced to my laptop as well. My laptop will bring me to a second login screen after I enter the pin since it doesn't use Windows Hello. I have tried everything including re setting up my pin and windows hello. If the computer restarts from
 an update it works fine or waking from sleep. I have to log in twice when starting up. All my updates are good and the camera's firmware is also up to date. I use Logitech 4k Brio which worked fine until the Fall update.

<p>Hello Doomeddisaster,<br />
<br />
As stated in our <em>Why a PIN is better than a password</em> article: <br />
<br />
<em>Windows Hello enables biometric sign-in for Windows 10: fingerprint, iris, or facial recognition. When you set up Windows Hello, you're asked to create a PIN first. This PIN enables you to sign in using the PIN when you can’t use your preferred biometric
 because of an injury or because the sensor is unavailable or not working properly.</em><br />
<br />
<em>If you only had a biometric sign-in configured and, for any reason, were unable to use that method to sign in, you would have to sign in using your account and password, which doesn't provide you the same level of protection as Hello.</em><br />
<br />
This translates to your PIN being your second authenticator in case that your biometrics sign-in fails.
<br />
<br />
Due to the fact that the other laptop doesn't have Windows Hello, the system would ask for your user account password since your device PIN is enabled.
<br />
<br />
Please note that PIN is tied to the device. It is not necessarily tied to your Microsoft account. Your Microsoft account password is transmitted to the server—it can be intercepted in transmission or stolen from a server. A PIN on the other hand, is local to
 your device. It isn't transmitted anywhere and it isn't stored on the server.<br />
<br />
You may refer to this support article for more information: <br />

    <title>BSOD after the NVIDIA GPU is activated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lu&#237;s aserportela  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD after the NVIDIA GPU is activated</h2>
                    <p>For the past month i've been struggling with an issue on my laptop, related to its GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever my NVIDIA GPU and the Intel GPU are activated, and the NVIDIA GPU isn't under stress for about 5 minutes, (by "under stress" I mean using programs that require detailed graphics and a lot of graphical processing) the BSOD will appear showing the
 message error "NMI_HARDWARE_FAILURE". </p>
<p>Somehow I've tackled the issue of the BSOD by deactivating the NVIDIA GPU and solely use the Intel GPU, whenever I feel the NVIDIA GPU isn't required for my actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even so, it is annoying to have to activate/deactivate the NVIDIA everytime i need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already used programs such as WhoCrashed and BlueScreeView to understand better the causes of these crashes. Those programs say that the leading cause of the BSOD are the files "hal.dll", "ntoskrnl.exe" and "PSHED.dll".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if there is a way to correct these errors and how should I proceed to correct them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop specs are:</p>
<p>Acer Aspire 7 A715-72G-79XK</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i7-8750H</p>
<p>GPU: Intel UHD Graphics 630 and NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1050</p>

            Hi Luís,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />

            Hi Luis
<br />
<br />Most likely the new Nvidia device driver is causing this issue, a lot of users are reporting issues with the newer Nvidia device drivers . . .
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running
<br />
<br />If the above does not resolve the issue with your Nvidia card, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point 
<br />
<br />2. This is due to hardware failure. The cause is CPU only. Attach your nVidia and run these two -
<br />a. Download Intel:registered: Processor Diagnostic Tool and run it

<h3> mariadykstra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker won&#39;t publish my movie - gets to 6&#37; &#38; won&#39;t go any further</h2>
                    I recorded a film and brought it into Windows Movie Maker without problems.&nbsp; Then I edited the film (did not add anything only trimed and spliced).&nbsp; Now I want to save the film as a movie.&nbsp; However when I do, it will only get to 6% and then if freezes.&nbsp;
 It will not convert any further, I even left it overnight to convert (made sure my computer did not turn off) and it still did not get past 6%.&nbsp; Is there another way to change the film from a project to one that I can run on a computer as a film?&nbsp; Or do you
 have a solution to get the movie maker to work?&nbsp;&nbsp; - Thanks

 all my drivers and still no improvement. &nbsp;I'm using WMM 2.6 so there must be some other compatibility issue.
</blockquote>
=============================================<br />
What type of editing did you do and did you add a music file?<br />
If_Yes_what was the format?<br />
<br />
Before saving...try going to...Tools / Options / Compatibility tab <br />
and uncheck 'All' the filters / OK...then try to save.&nbsp; If it still fails...<br />
try saving in the .DV-AVI format.<br />
<br />
To save as a DV-AVI movie file...<br />
Type...Ctrl+P (or go to...File / Save Movie File)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to open the Save Movie Wizard /<br />
Choose...My Computer /<br />
Next /<br />
Enter a Name and a Save Location /<br />
Next /<br />
Show More Choices /<br />
Other Settings /<br />
Open the drop window and choose...DV-AVI /<br />
Next /<br />
Wait while the movie is saved /<br />
Finish...<br />
<br />

<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>I have a old Lenovo Desktop PC that came with Windows 7 Key activated.</p>

<h2>            iNSANE DiSASTERS - Recruiting Members&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Heya C: Never been on this before but I thought I'd give it a go :3</p>
<p>So me and my friends made a clan a couple of months ago just for the four of us. We named it "iNSANE DiSASTERS". Our names are based on elements/weather type things. We are originally for Halo: Reach but we have had a few new members joining and we are now
 spreading onto more games. We don't want to be too serious we want to have fun and win.
</p>
<p>Anyway, recently we decided we'd try and recruit people to our clan. We do trails if anyone is interested. We only really play Modern Warfare 2 and Halo Reach at the moment but we have more games on the list - we just need the members :)!</p>
<p>We made a quick, basic website today to try and get the point across and make it easy for people to contact us and find information about the clan.
</p>
<p>www.idisastersx.webs.com (Extremely basic but hey - we're only 16, web-design isn't our speciality :3)</p>
<p>Anyway if you're interested at all message:&nbsp; iD x AvALaNcHe </p>
<p>Thanks :3</p>

    <title>Can anyone tell me how to widen the columns of file explorer&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cgannville  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can anyone  tell me how to widen the columns of file explorer&#39;s file names&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In every program I've ever used, all the user has to do to make a column wider is click on the divider bar at the top (or side of the colulmn)&nbsp;and drag the column wider. Instantly. Easily. Almost second nature without looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, along comes clunky Windows 8, and it is so frustrating!&nbsp; I've gone on line and seen hundreds of people griping about the same thing, and some of the answers are to right click at the column heading and click on
<strong><em>size</em></strong>, or to pick the longest title of your file and right click and pick
<em>auto size</em>, but I have none of those options.&nbsp; I right click on the longest title and don't get any choices like auto size or size.&nbsp; There is not a definable column heading.&nbsp; Above the list of files is a lot of stuff in the ribbon, none of it centered
 above the list of files.&nbsp; Higher&nbsp; up, there are&nbsp;a few opportunities for a right click to produce the word "size" in the box that opens up but it is not an active link and I cannot click on it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm amazed that I bought this "top of the line&nbsp;new release everyone will go to" &nbsp;and it doesn't function with ease.&nbsp; It doesn't calculate how wide to make the column...computers are great at calculating.&nbsp; Why can't Windows 8?&nbsp;&nbsp; When a program makes you work
 harder, take four or five steps to do one little thing, that isn't good product design. It should do it for us, we shouldn't have to mouse over the right side, click the left side, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main question is how to accomplish widening the column, and my secondary question is how can we get Microsoft to listen to us?&nbsp; I have read comment after comment on dozens of complaints, this being one of the most common.&nbsp; So, besides wishing they'd listen
 to us...I am going to call their help line tomorrow and complain...does anyone in the meantime know what I can do to see all the title of&nbsp; my files?&nbsp; Right now they are all cut off about half way through.&nbsp; I just want to grab that bar on the right and drag
 it to the right to reveal the file name in the manner of the way most computer programs work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It almost seems as if Microsoft tried to make this harder for their installed base of users and their new users.&nbsp;&nbsp; It boggles the mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd sure appreciate it if anyone can tell me if it is even possible to make the column wider, and I'd love it if there was an answer that is easy without going to a lot of steps.&nbsp; Thanks in advance to anyone out there who has figured it out!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            There's no difference in the way you make the columns wider if I am understanding the question.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I assume you see something similar to this (sans the highlighting and red arrows pointing to the column headers and the dividers you would hover over, click+hold and drag to make wider/smaller in the method you describe):<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e6472eb-25bc-4330-bb0a-7cff9bc2109d" /><br />
<br />
Or are you speaking of something other than the "file explorer" you mentioned in your subject?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Also - if you get the "double-arrow" cursor by hovering in the same spot as you would for dragging to make the column size wider or more narrow and instead - double-click - it will (as it always has) calculate the width needed to see everything in the column
 to the left of the divider you are clicking on and re-size accordingly.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
I think the right-clicking of a column heading (see the highlighted portion above) and changing the size to fit refers to this menu you would get when right clicking on the column headings highlighted in the image above...<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f2961c6a-66fc-40c9-9377-1ccc000d3809" /><br />
<br />
Now there is one trick to all that - you have to be in the DETAILS view (as always) in order to get those nice columns.&nbsp; The "Extra Large Icons", "Large Icons", "Medium Icons", "Small Icons", "List", "Tiles" or "Content" views will not have columns to sort
 by...<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/725cd0b1-55fc-425c-8756-5f35292158eb" /><br />
<br />
Also, if you notice in the last image, when in the "Details" view, you should, depending on your window size, see "Size all columns to fit" as an option in the View menu.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
And the "Size all columns to fit" as shown in the two methods I could think of off-hand to show does the calculations for all columns and adjusts wider/more narrow for all visible columns in the file explorer view across the board.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Oh - and in case you want the "Details" view to be the default view from this point forward for your "Windows Explorer" windows... Change to it (as shown above) and find the "Options" button in the top ribbon (usually the farthest one to the right) and click
 on it (not the arrows to the side of it - click on it to select it) and a new window should open called "Folder Options".&nbsp; Choose the "View" tab and click "Apply to Folders" and all other folders you open from this point forward will have that "View" by default
 (unless you change it.)&nbsp; *Special Note* here - you cannot be at the root of the "Computer" or "My PC" Windows Explorer view - you have to at least have a drive folder (like "Local Disk (C:)") selected and active in order to see the "Apply to Folders" button
 active for clicking.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Again - this has been basically the same since Windows XP.&nbsp; Some of the options have changed names (heck, even Windows Explorer is referred to as "This PC" now instead of "Computer" and "My Computer") and there have been some additional views added and removed
 - but even the advanced stuff is similar enough to the past methods to be inferred.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Hope that helps.&nbsp; Ask if you have more questions and please come back either way to let everyone know if the answer was satisfactory!<br />

    <title>Create Partition Problem in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shakeel7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Create Partition Problem in Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>REMEMBER : I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WINDOWS 7.</p>
<p>I didn't Install Windows 7 or create any partition. I bought Toshiba Laptop (Intel core-i3 processor, 4GB RAM, 500GB HDD etc.) two days ago from future shop. Windows 7 was already installed and&nbsp;I only made recovery CD's (4).</p>
<p>I think 3-partitions were already created below:</p>
<p>Partition 1: C: 430.95GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (boot, page files, crash dump, primary)&nbsp;<br />
Partition 2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21.13GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (primary partition)<br />
partition 3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.21GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (primary partition)</p>
<p>and after making recovery CD's, the system made :</p>
<p>partition 4:&nbsp; 1.46GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (active, recovery partition)</p>
<p>After that through Windows 7 Disk Management: Right&nbsp;click on C: and click on<strong>Shrink Volume&nbsp;</strong>and after that&nbsp;I made&nbsp;5th partition as below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Partition 5:&nbsp; unallocated 99.00GB&nbsp; (trying to make this one allocated)</p>
<p>Right know, I have deleted Partition 5 and space shrinked to C: drive.</p>
<p><strong>I just want to create two partitions&gt; &nbsp;D: drive for&nbsp;Personal Data and E: drive for Linux Read Hat.</strong></p>
<p>Any solution for this?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Shakeel</p>

<p>With MBR partitioning you are limited to four partitions. You can have four primary partitons as you have or you can have three primary and one extended partition. The extended partition can then be divided into logical drives. The problem is you have four
 primary partitions. I'd be leery of deleting any of them as you may not be able to recover the system. It sounds like&nbsp;the thre extra partitions&nbsp;are all part of the Toshiba recovery process. To get more drive letters you'd have to delete one of the primary
 partitions. Slide all the partitions so you end up with one continuous unallocated block. Create an extended partition in this block then create however many logical drives you want within the extended partition. Because of the way Toshiba created the partitions
 it is unlikely you'll be able to get a continuous unallocated block with the built in Windows tools. You'd probably need a third party partitioning tool. As I said though you'll probably lose the Toshiba system recovery functionality if you do this.</p>

<p>This means that through Disk Management in Windows 7, you can't create more partitions which is drawback. I don't know which third party free Partitioning Wizard software will work.</p>

<p>You can't create more than four partitions no matter which partitioning program you use. It is a limitation all operating systems face if they use MBR partitioning.</p>

<p>As suggested by Mr. J W Stuart, the following partitions were nothing related to OS. I dropped the following partitions as I need big ones:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Simple&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (primary partition)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21.13GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 21.13GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 %&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %0</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Simple&nbsp;&nbsp; Basic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (primary partition)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.21GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12.21GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 100 %&nbsp;&nbsp; No&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %0</p>
<p><strong>After that I shrinked C: drive to create unallocated spaces of 100GB &amp; 100GB and right click on these unallocated spaces to make simple volumes of</strong></p>
<p><strong>E: &amp; F: drives. </strong><strong>Now I have C: ,&nbsp; E: &amp;&nbsp; F: drives.</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for all specially Mr. J W Stuart to help me.</p>

<p>Windows 7 has the option to resize, this means you can shrink or extend partitions. The Disk Management in built utility is able to do the job of shrinking and expanding partitions and it does not require any 3rd party utilities. To manage your partitions,
 open Control Panel and type "partitions" or "hard disk" in the search bar on the right corner and you can see the link "Create and Format Hard Disk Partitions" under administrative tools.<br />
This will open up the disk management utility for Windows 7<br />
To shrink any volume, right click on the desired volume and select the option "Shrink Volume". This will open up the Shrink Volume window and you need to specify the amount of space you want to shrink.<br />
If you want to extend any volume in Windows 7, right click on the drive to be extended and select "Extend Volume". In the next step you need to specify the amount of space by which you want to extend the volume.<br />
Please note that extend volume for any drive will work only if there is continuous free space available on your hard disk.</p>

            <p><span>According to my practice, there are some restrictions on Windows Disk Management, such as Create Partition, Extend Volume and Shrink Volume.</span></p>
<span><br />
Create Partition: When creating partition, you cannot decide the partition type. After creating three primary partition, the forth will be automatically created as extended partition. In such case, you cannot shrink C drive to create new partition, you will
 receive error message: you cannot create a new volume in this unallocated space because the disk already contains maximum number of partitions.<br />
</span>
<p><span>Shrink Volume: 1. you cannot decrease the allocated space beyond the point where the unmovable files are located. 2.the unallocated (shrunk from primary partition) or free space (shrunk from logical drive) only can be created at the end of the partition.
 This restriction will limit “Extend Volume” feature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Extend Volume: This function only can extend partition into contiguous unallocated space which is at the right side of the partition (behind the partition).</span></p>

<h2>            SCrolling Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC has scrolling issue due to the latest update. A page scrolls to the bottom of the page and cannot move up the cursor. I have applied the fix given in the microsoft site but no luck.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span>You can resolve this issue using the following steps:</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span><span><span><span>From
 Start, search for <span>cmd</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Right-click
<span>Command Prompt</span> in the search results, and choose
<span>Command Prompt</span> in the search results, and choose
<span>Run as administrator</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>At
<span>Run as administrator</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>At
 the command prompt, type or copy/paste:</span></span></span><br />
<span><span><span><span>reg add
<span><span><span><span>reg add
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Pen /v LegacyPenInteractionModel /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f</span></span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Press
<span>Enter</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>
<span>Enter</span></span></span></span></span></li></ol>

<p><span>After the command executes, the issue with panning and scrolling should be resolved.</span></p>

<p><span>Microsoft is working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.</span></p>

<p><strong><em>&nbsp;A page scrolls to the bottom of the page and cannot move up the cursor.
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>How many pointer devices do you have?&nbsp; I used to see this symptom when I had two and concluded that it was a case of duelling drivers.&nbsp; E.g. each one would think that it had to move the pointer after the other had moved it.&nbsp; My workaround was to add a third
 pointer device to the picture:&nbsp; Mousekeys.&nbsp; E.g. activating Mousekeys and causing a pointer movement using a press of one of its Numeric keypad pointer movement keys was always enough to break the "loop".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you have a full keyboard or at least a full Numeric keypad try activating Mousekeys (LeftAlt+LeftShift+NumLock initially, thereafter just toggle NumLock to turn it on) and then press one of its "arrow" keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck</p>

<h2>            Computer is freezing while running programs</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Please help me fix my computer! Asus laptop, major freezing problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am in desperate need of getting my computer functional again because I use it for work and can't afford to replace it right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am willing to run any program I need to, post any logs you ask for. I have a basic working knowledge of computers and can follow instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running 64 bit Windows 7 on an ASUS K401J/K501J Series. 3GB of Ram. 93.9Gb free of 283GB on the hard drive. I can free up another 100GB probably from mp4s that are stored on my hard drive, although I've had this problem since before I loaded the movies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer screen sporadically freezes for around two minutes at a time, fairly often while I'm using it. Once an hour, at minimum. I know I have some programs causing some major CPU usage from monitoring my task manager, I often have a dozen or so Chrome
 tabs open and Chrome will show multiple instances running even after my windows have closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's also laggy at times, and the fan seems to run quite often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I probably need some major maintenance. I routinely run Spybot and Adaware, and have Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am desperate to get this fixed, because it's getting harder and harder to work with the screen freezing the way it does. Please take pity on me and help!</p>

<h2>            No games loading and now profile won&#39;t sign in</h2>
                    <p>My games were not loading, for&nbsp;example I would launch star wars and it would just boot out of the loading screen to the home screen after only a few seconds. Then I go to my games and apps and nothing is loading there all I see is the loading green circle. I go ahead and&nbsp; hard restart&nbsp;my Xbox but no change. I then go and remove my profile and when I try to sign back in it says there was a problem and gives me this code: 0x8007042C.&nbsp;</p><p>Something to note I could open Netflix&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

            <p>My experience is similar. I try to load up a game and the initial game screen loads but then it just goes back to the home screen. When I open Games and Apps, it just spins forever, and it never shows the number of "games", "apps", "ready to install", or "updates". However "memberships" populates just fine. My cable company "Spectrum" has an app and i'm able to watch TV using that App, but "CrunchyRoll" app never loads. Lastly, if I try to go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage, the menu freezes. I have to use the home button to go home and quit&nbsp;the "Settings" app. Have you tried going to the "Storage" menu on your xbox. Does it open for you and tell you how much space you have left?</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p><p><br /></p><p>We appreciate you two reaching out to us. For this issue, we have a few steps that are worth looking into. Let's have you transfer one of the affected games or apps to your internal drive if you're using an external drive and unplug the external drive. Power down your console, unplug your console and router for five full minutes, and power on your devices again while testing out the game without the external drive. We also recommend making sure that your console is plugged into a wall outlet and never into a surge protector or power strip as they can cause issues and damage your console. These tips should be helpful in getting your games to load. </p>

<p>Yes, I can view my account picture in Settings &gt; Accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was functioning properly prior to the Anniversary Upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was using the 'remove password login from Windows 10'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run netplwiz and tick "Users must enter a username and password to use this computer" box, and reboot (thus requiring a password), the account picture displays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I manually log in, and run netplwiz and untick the "User must enter....." box, and enter&nbsp;my password and&nbsp;click the OK button; when I reboot/restart the computer the&nbsp;account picture does not display.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned previously, it worked before the Anniversary Upgrade (with the no password login).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue still persists.</p>

            <p>Since WMM 2.6 is based on the XP version of Windows Movie Maker 2.1, it has some inherent limitations based on the typical hardware in use at the time.&nbsp; I believe that means you are limited in the amount of memory it can use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm curious if there is a reason you aren't at least using <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WMM 6.0</a> (which has a 64-bit version and better memory management)?&nbsp; Or why you wouldn't be using the latest version of
<a href="http://download.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Movie Maker 2012</a>?&nbsp; Do you have an insufficient GPU (graphics card) that can't handle the later versions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally, just combining 4 DVD videos together shouldn't be taxing on your system. I'm puzzled as to why it wouldn't work even in WMM 2.6.&nbsp; What converter did you use to turn the .vob files into .wmv files?&nbsp;Perhaps it didn't do a good conversion? Have
 you tried Freemake Video Converter instead? Incidentally, it can also join videos into single files, so perhaps WMM isn't needed to do what you want?</p>

<h2>            I sure wish I had good ol&#38;&#35;39&#59; MechAssault on the Xbox 360.</h2>
                    
<p>I miss those days...a lot. &nbsp;And don't tell me "they" can't make it work, or the old servers are down, or anything like that. &nbsp;If someone wanted it done, it could be done. &nbsp;I miss that game bad. &nbsp;Simple, fun, lots of good online play. &nbsp;The only thing I ever
 wished it had was a lab for beefing up the mech.</p>


<p>Dear Microsoft, Mr. Ballmer, could you please make someone put MechAssault on Xbox 360? &nbsp;I had good times with that game, playing it with my kids who are much older now, playing new games with new friends. &nbsp;I think they'd play again, one last time, before
 they start their own lives. &nbsp;One day their games will fade away too, and their children won't understand either. &nbsp;Then my children will realize just how meaningful those times with Dad and MechAssault really were.</p>
<p>Thank you for any consideration,</p>
<p>TheHinge</p>


<p>ps: &nbsp;I want it to play online please. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

<p>Right around the time MW2 was launching I remember reading in the OXM that they were working on a new MechAssault/MechWarrior game for the 360/PC. Since that issue I have seen nor heard of any more info. By now I figure they shelved the game. The Armored
 Core franchise seems to have taken over. If you like Mech ganes check out the AC series. There a number AC 4, For Answer, and recently AC V.</p>

<p>Mechassault was a nice welcome to the live family, after only having Whacked and NFL fever to death in beta. I spiked my first controller playing mechassault. :)<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not saying that it will never happen but, it could be a nice arcade game at least. Hang in there and you may see it in the future. Also if you are into mech games, Hawken is still in development and right now its designed to come out for the pc but who knows,
 they may make a port for the consoles. It looks like it plays like the original mechwarrior 2 games.</p>

<p>Huh.. I never seen MechAssualt, looks pretty good and it was an exclusive too. They should definitely bring this game back. MWO coming back and AC just came out, more mech games the better.</p>

<p>I never realized MechAssualt was so...&nbsp; bonding, and emotional. If there's such enormous sentimental value in this game, why don't you just play it "one last time" on the original Xbox?</p>

<p>Because Microsoft dropped multiplayer support in favor of giving us a friends list that exceeds 100 people. We'll it's been 2 years now and i am still waiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now while I was not the biggest MA fan, I did still play it from time to time. The game that was really sentimental to me however was Unreal Championship. Playing against bots just wouldnt be the same.</p>
