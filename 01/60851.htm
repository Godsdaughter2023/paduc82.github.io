    <title>Windows 8.1 store not loading after hours of attempted fixes. Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesbriant  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 store not loading after hours of attempted fixes. Error code 0x8e5e0530.</h2>
                    For the last few days my ASUS Vivotab Smart (windows 8.1 32 bit) hasn't been able to open the Windows Store. The app opens and either gets stuck on the<br />
green loading screen with the forever turning loading circle, or it gets past that and says "Loading store" but reached no further only to have once or twice given me an error code 0x80080005. This however, has got me nowhere. I updated the device to Windows
 8.1 after I received it as a Christmas present.<br />
<br />
Prior to the update which downloaded and installed perfectly as far as I'm aware, the store and other apps that required the internet worked perfectly. I can now no longer open the Windows Store, nor check for windows updates in the settings I recently found
 out. Things I have tried to solve the issue include:<br />
<br />
Running this powershell command in Administrative CMD. This did nothing.<br />
<br />
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.xml<br />
<br />
running "WSreset.exe" Again, this did nothing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Checking I am not using a proxy for my internet connection. I'm not and never have.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Disconnecting my Microsoft account and loading the store. Didn't work.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Reconnecting my Microsoft account and loading the store. Didn't work.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Check the date, time and time zone are all correct. They are and were.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Run the app troubleshooter. This returned nothing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Tried running the "net stop wuauserv" command in CMD that ClanLeo4 posted here on the 14 July 2013:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1_pr-windows_store/why-is-windows-store-not-working-after-windows-81/941645b6-714d-4aa8-8a71-d62809895cbd<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
This however gave an error that said the program is either starting or closing even though the application wasn't open. I tried the command again<br />
when the windows store was stuck on the loading screen, it returned the exact same. I didn't proceed further with and of the steps, let me know if&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; you think I should try.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
"SFC.exe" in administrative CMD took a while but eventually solved nothing.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Checked that my account doesn't need verifying and I can't anything that would suggest that it does.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I checked that everyone on the PC has the same rights to open apps. (Although this is just me.) But I don't remember how I did this or find the<br />
internet post that explained it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated but I really can't see much of a solution for this even though I need one.<br />
I haven't tried a reset yet and don't really want to. I'd rather find a fix.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
First of all, having checked the screen resolution it is 1366 x 768 so should be OK.
<br />
<br />
I then checked the UAC and it was and still is now set to default.<br />
<br />
I then followed of the steps for the clean boot. 1 clean boot, I tested the store and it loaded. I can see apps to download. Different categories load as do descriptions of apps. But, I went to go and download an app to test and make sure everything works.
 I saw the Wikipedia app, only 650kb big so shouldn't be too much of a problem. It begins to install and I see in the top right of the screen "Installing Wikipedia". Tap on that and it tales me too the Installations page and there is Wikipedia, sitting there
 saying pending. The green progress bar is all grey to indicate it hasn't progressed at all.
<br />
<br />
I then set back to a normal restart and launched the store to see wikipedia has still progressed no further. :(
<br />
<br />
I haven't tried method 2 as i wanted to share the outcome thus far. Any other ideas greatly welcome, but it appears we might finally be getting somewhere.
<br />
<br />
Thank you so much<br />

            I'd just like to add I have almost exactly the same problem. 



Worked fine a few days ago, then I wanted to use Skype today but the Skype icon on the start menu just showed a blue box (no Skype logo). 



Tried to open Skype, didn't work. 



Decided to uninstall then reinstall Skype. 



Skype reaches a certain point then tells me it had an error. 



Casually tried to install Facebook app just for the **** of it. It gives me the same error. 



I've followed al the advice in here, and from the other pages. No luck at all. 



And. Well I'll just say it. I hate Windows 8 more and more every day :)

            I have been having the same problem and nothing fixes it. The only lead I have is that if I create a new local account, Store will open up fine on that account, just not on my main one. I'm not sure if there's an easy way to transfer everything from my
 current (MS account-associated) account to a new one so that I can get the Store working again that way, but I am a little peeved. I only just fixed the problem I had with Mail, People, and Calendar not opening, and now the Store won't open. UUGH.

            Check your network connection, if you have google DNS server try remove it or put your gateway IP. I had this problem before but after I removed google DNS server (8.8.8.8) and I changed it to my router IP it fix the problem and windows store started

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sometimes reseating the video cabling will resolve this problem. If it's a desktop unit, you may also try shutting down and reseating the video card.</p>
<p>To detect whether the problem is with the monitor or the video card, try plugging in a different monitor. If the problem is still present, it's the card. If not, then the monitor needs to be replaced.</p>

            Hi Kelly.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Let's look at other Display driver options:
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Compare the Clean Install you did with the gold standard Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />For example if you didn't clean the hard drive before install by deleting all partitions down to Unallocated Space, it's not clean at all.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks. I see a couple of things:
<br />
<br />
<br />Video card driver is failing.\
<br /><code>Display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered.</code>
<br />A full dump was saved recently:
<br />A dump was saved in: C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP
<br />
<br />Your disk is failing as well
<br /><pre><code>The driver has detected that device \Device\Harddisk1\DR1 has predicted that it will fail. Immediately back up your data and replace your hard disk drive. A failure may be imminent.</code></pre>
<br />
<br />Let us proceed one by one.
<br />Let us first check the disk.
<br />
<br />Download and run HDTune .
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.hdtune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hdtune.com/</a>
<br />
<br />Select the Disk where OS is installed.
<br />
<br />Make screenshots of the following
<br />the health
<br />the error scan
<br />the benchmark
<br />Post back the screenshots.
<br />
<br />Second
<br />Completely remove everything of Graphics driver using DDU and install the newest copy of the driver available.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />You can head to either the card manufacturer or device manufacturer to get the newest driver.
<br />Let us know how that goes.

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have removed the graphics driver using DDU. Currently my laptop is operating using Microsoft Basic Display Adapter and this has resolved the BSOD issue.</p>
<p>I will download the latest driver once you review the logs from HD Tune Pro: https://1drv.ms/f/s!Aq7VQQdNxj3WkGJVcQCfCB0yRnE-
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached the screenshots as requested. You will see that Benchmark failed, and also the Error Scan stalled at 73gb, 3 times in a row. So i have attached a copy of the quick scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, i was unable to locate the MEMORY.DMP file/folder?... the minidump folder is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            The corrupt disk is the reason why there are no memory dumps. First, please replace the disk which would probably resolve almost all of the problems, if updating display driver throws BSOD again.

<p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these methods mentioned below and check if it helps.<br />
<b><span>Method 1: Disable Anti-virus software</span></b></p>
<span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Disable-antivirus-software</a></span></span></span>
<br />
<span>Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it
 as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Start the Windows Installer service<br />
a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Services.msc</strong> and press {ENTER}
<br />
b. Double-click <strong>Windows Installer <br />
</strong>c. Set the Startup type of Windows Installer to <strong>Manual</strong> <br />
d. Click <strong>Start </strong>to start the service. Note down the error message if any.
<br />
e. Click <strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Unregister</strong> and re-register the Windows Installer to do that follow the steps provided below.<br />
a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, click Run, type <strong>MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs.<br />
b. Click Start, click Run, type <strong>MSIEXEC /REGSERVER</strong>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. Even if you do this correctly, it may look like nothing occurs, or you may briefly see an hourglass. After you run this command, the operation is complete.<br />
c. Try your Windows Installer-based application again. </p>

            Hi Amy,<br />
a quick question. You said that your system has been recently restored?<br />
Was that system ever on a network? What drive shows in that error message?<br />
The reason I asked is that usually that message occurs on a networked machine when the drive has been moved or deleted. So the software goes to look for that drive and it is no longer there.<br />

    <title>The extended attributes are inconsistent - Need urgent help - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            The extended attributes are inconsistent - Need urgent help please&#33;</h2>
                    Hello Microsoft Forum,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would like to keep this short, as I have some serious problems now.</div>
<div>I have Windows 8 Pro, with every update installed.</div>
<div>I was browsing the net casually, whilst messaging with a friend.</div>
<div>My friend was designing a logo, which he sent through Skype in a .png format.</div>
<div>When I double clicked the logo, the problems began. Everything became extremely slow.</div>
<div>The picture didn't open, and only after 5 minutes of waiting Windows Picture Viewer started showing up.</div>
<div>The strange thing is, Windows Picture Viewer opened up a .wav file of my music folder stored elsewhere, not on my desktop (the picture was the only thing present on my desktop).</div>
<div>Picture viewer of course failed opening the music file.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then I decided to open Task Manager, but the error described in the title, &nbsp;"Taskmgr.exe - The extended attributes are inconsistent" error came up, not letting me to open the Manager.</div>
<div>This also happens with most of my programs. I get the same error with Regedit, MSconfig and some other config utilities, and also some programs don't start up, like Mumble (the Murmur server can, however).</div>
<div>Actually, every system tool and, more generally, everything which need Admin privilege is not working. Some of those programs give the error message, some just do nothing at all.</div>
<div>I am the admin user, and UAC is set to the lowest (no notifications).</div>
<div>In Safe mode, everything is normal. Also, disabling antivirus (ESET Smart Security 6) does not solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I followed up some articles which I have found, describing the fix as of setting my theme sound to None or Windows Default.</div>
<div>I, however, never changed anything with my theme, the sound was on default.</div>
<div>Setting the sound theme to "None" did nothing, just as setting theme options.</div>
<div>Opening up anything with sound (even once left-clicking on the taskbar icon to bring up the little volume control) takes literally ages.</div>
<div>Opening up rightclick on sound in taskbar then Sounds to edit the theme sound takes forever as well.</div>
<div>With forever I mean, I see labels and buttons coming up with 5 second delay between each.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a high end machine with a i7-3770K and a Corsair ForceGS SSD, 16 GB @ 1600 MHz RAM and a GTX 670 GPU, so normally everything happens at instant.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The sound is the only affected part of the slowness, opening Chrome, Explorer, and some programs which do work, are the same instant.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am now while writing this getting messages of "Program not responding" and "Sending crash information" of some programs, actually utilities, built into Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd like to have help urgently, as this is my main work computer. I'm missing some serious working hours because of this bug which was released into a "stable" version of Windows.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 1: I forgot to mention I already tried in CMD as Admin "sfc /scannow" option in Safe Mode (both with and without network, cmd does nothing when opened as admin without safe mode, does not even show up), and in Advanced Restart utilities</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 2: I did not install any new hardware or software when this happened, in the same condition everything worked.</div>
<div>I really don't want to install everything again, I hope there is a solution to this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 3: One of the programs, which shut down frequently (I just got a "(Program) stopped working" message from it) is Console Window Host.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 4: I disabled all the codecs at boot in safe mode, nothing changed (an article described installing some Audacity codecs caused the very same problem).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 5: Now after a second attempt of safe mode, cmd as admin, command "sfc /scannow" reported an error that problems were found, but could not be repaired.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 6: I also tried (Cmd as admin in safemode with networking) DISM repair, could not complete because of an error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Edit 7: Tomorrow, if I still cannot find any solution, I am going to take drastic measures, like restoring to a previous safe point, using some recovery options, and if necessary, even refresh/powerwash/reinstall everything. However, I hope that those
 measures are not necessary, as they are time consuming.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I hope my question is understandable. Excuse me of my arrogant urge to the answer, I normally do not urge people in forums, but this made my working computer unusable, resulting in some (financial) problems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Richard</div>

<h2>            Skype for Business - user stuck at pending</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've seen this on other threads, but it never appears to have been properly answered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a skype for biz account (onmicrosoft.com) and a standard skype account.</p>
<p>I appear to be unable to send messages from the biz account to others, so have been trying to send to my skype account whilst I troubleshoot.</p>
<p>When I add my skype user in the skype for biz, it remains at Pending-Skype.&nbsp; No emails or skype requests are sent.</p>
<p>When I attempt to message the skype for biz account from my skype account, it says Sent, but no notification is received in the skype biz side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone onto the Office365 site and checked that external comms are enabled (on except for blocked domains), no domains are blocked, and the "<span> "</span><span> option is checked.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've switched external comms off, waited an hour, turned back on, then retried after &gt; 24 hours, but same situation.</span></p>
<p><span>I've also tried an online test for my SIP settings, and that reported all ok.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Could someone please offer any advice on this?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>
<p><span>Gordon</span></p>

<p>Hi Iry,</p>
<p>I contacted support, and it appears that the advice in the documentation to "wait 24 hours" until the External Change takes effect is too short - support are advising waiting up to 3 days.</p>
<p>In my case, 2 days after changing the flag to allow external communications, everything started to work fine.</p>
<p>Many thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>Gordon.</p>

            It was not in 1803. And also reading through 1809 features, there is no feature which supports without Miracast if you want to display wirelessly. Only option is go into wired mode or buy a Miracast dongle.

<p>That's not that bad. When I read the title of the thread, I thought they were pushing it back to 2012. Normally, I'm all for developers taking the extra time to make sure a game has all the kinks worked out before release. But they've had more than enough
 time to complete this game.</p>

            KB4088776 has since been succeeded by March 22, 2018—KB4089848 (OS Build 16299.334)
<br />
<br />I would try installing the update manually:
<br /><a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=KB4089848" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Sea...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the following:
<br /> 	2018-03 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4089848) 
<br />
<br />
<br />Follow instructions to install manually:

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<p>It looks like you like Tennis. You would be best off asking the developers of the games, if they have any plans to bring the games to backward compatibility.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In these cases you would need to contact 2K Sports/Indie Built, EA Games, Namco &amp; Sega/Sumo Digital. Bear in mind, if any of these publishers/developers are no longer available, then the game(s) cannot be made compatible.</p>

<p>Thanks for make me put off any hope.<br />
Unfortunately tennis isn't a sport loved by the gamers like soccers or basket so I must keep playing that games on xbox 360.<br />
We just only think that after 7 years of lack of tennis videogames, two new tennis games have been created for Xbox one: "Tennis World Tour" and "AO International tennis" anche both of them aren't good at all!</p>
<p>That's why I asked the retrocompatibily for the old tennis games. Because they are better!<br />
Bye bye!</p>

<p>As far as I can see all of those games you mentioned have been delisted for digital sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games that have been delisted can not be made BC, reason being that their associated licenses have expired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Licences are major part of sports games, containing multiple licence agreements.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Licences could include: </p>
<p>
</p><p>The players. </p>
<p>The venues (yes, really).</p>
<p>In-game branded clothing.</p>
<p>Licenced music tracks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If just one licensed part of a game expires said game can no longer be sold as a digital game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice there are very few, if any, Xbox 360 sports games available for BC - check the BC list - this is the reason why.</p>

            Finally somebody tells the truth!<br />
Don't worry man! I keep playing all those tennis games on xbox 360.<br />
<br />
The only complaint is that console like Xbox one ( I have the X ) and PS4 ( I have the Pro ) haven't tennis games and the only ones are Tennis World Tour and AO International Tennis ( I have both for Xbox and PS4 ).<br />
Games of 6,5 GB and 15 GB with updates.<br />
In the era where many videogames are of 60, 70 and even 100 GB, it is a scandal that, for example, Tennis World Tour is smaller than Top Spin 4 which was of 8,5 GB!<br />
They are good games but people fond of tennis sport expected a great games!<br />
<br />
Bye and keep playing Fifa or Pes because only in that way you can earn money!

<h2>            Email address and password mismatch</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Surface Pro 3 some time ago and have not used it for a while (I have another pc that I use regularly).&nbsp; The Surface Pro was setup using my (at that time) email username and password.&nbsp; I have since changed internet providers and cannot log into
 the Surface Pro without using the old email account and password (which is not compatible with my Microsoft password).&nbsp;&nbsp; How can I log into the Surface without the correct user name and password?</p>

            I don't understand your problem. The ISP username and password should not prohibit you from logging on to your SP3. If you can log on, create a new administrative user with the correct username and password. Set up your email accordingly. Don't use your
 ISP username and password. If you don't have a Microsoft Account, set up a new one. You can always add your ISP email address to the Mail App.

    <title>Error &#34;We couldn&#39;t update the System Reserved Partition&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tahngarthor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error &#34;We couldn&#39;t update the System Reserved Partition&#34; when upgrading from windows 10 to the Anniversary Uprgrade</h2>
                    Windows told me there was a problem installing updates. I told it to try again and a box comes up about upgrading windows, and it gives the "We couldn't update the System Reserved Partition" error. I had a MS support rep tell me to try an in place upgrade,
 but this didn't work and gave the same error after downloading the media creaiton tool and having it try to upgrade my system.<br />
<br />
The virtual agent linked me to a series of steps to reallocate more space to the System Reserved patition. Should I do this? I know that modifying partitions can be risky. Will this solve the issue? Is there any other step I can take to install the update without
 doing a clean reinstall?<br />
<br />
To clarify, I am currently running windows 10 and it is the anniversary upgrade that is giving this error. A quick check in DIsk Management indicates the System Reserved partition is of MBR type, and is 100 MB in size. Should I go through the process of increasing
 it? should I put it to 350MB? The system drive is a 128 GB SSD and it is fairly full, I'd like not to have more unusable space than necessary.<br />
<br />
Microsoft alleges that some security software can write to th is partition, but I can' find any way to view the data contained on the partition. Is there no way to delete any unnecessary data from it?

<h2>            Cannot type in PIN for sign in</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Surface Pro 3. Recently, I have been unable to sign in using my PIN. I type but nothing appears in the sign in box. When I switch to signing in with the Microsoft password it works normally.
</p>
<p>This behaviour seems to only happen when waking from sleep. When I restart the computer, I am able to sign in with the PIN.
</p>
<p>I do not think it is a keyboard problem because the password can be typed in and the PIN does not work under the onscreen keyboard either.</p>
<p>I have not applied any updates other than through Windows Update. I have tried a health check of the registry and am told that all files are there.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt or missing Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following&nbsp;methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Remove the pin and add a new pin.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Remove the pin</strong>. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>and click <strong>control panel.</strong><br />
b. Click "<strong>User accounts and family safety</strong>" and then click "<strong>User accounts</strong>".<br />
c. Click "<strong>Make changes to my account in PC settings</strong>".<br />
d. Click "<strong>Sign-in options</strong>" and under "<strong>PIN</strong>", click "<strong>Remove PIN</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Add a new pin</strong>. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press <strong>Windows + X keys </strong>and click <strong>control panel.</strong><br />
b. Click "<strong>User accounts and family safety</strong>" and then click "<strong>User accounts</strong>".<br />
c. Click "<strong>Make changes to my account in PC settings</strong>".<br />
d. Click "<strong>Sign-in options</strong>", under "<strong>PIN</strong>", click "<strong>Add</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions".</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run system file checker(SFC) to fix corrupt or missing Windows files.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files
</strong><br />
<a href="https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>

</p>
<p>I will keep an eye on it and post if it begins to reoccur.</p>

            Hi, Mitchell,
<br />
<br />This indicates that a critical system process died. A critical process is one that forces the system to bug check if it terminates. This can happen when the state of the process is corrupted or otherwise is damaged. When this happens, as these processes are critical to the operation of Windows, a system bug check occurs as the operating system integrity is in question.
<br />Built in Windows critical system services include csrss.exe, wininit.exe, logonui.exe, smss.exe, services.exe, conhost.exe, and winlogon.exe.
<br />
<br />Troubleshooting:
<br />
<br />If you recently added hardware to the system, try removing or replacing it. Or check with the manufacturer to see if any patches are available.
<br />
<br />If new device drivers or system services have been added recently, try removing or updating them. Try to determine what changed in the system that caused the new bug check code to appear.
<br />
<br />Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. For more information, see Open Event Viewer. Look for critical errors in the system log that occurred in the same time window as the blue screen.
<br />
<br />Check with the manufacturer to see if an updated system BIOS or firmware is available.
<br />
<br />You can try running the hardware diagnostics supplied by the system manufacturer.
<br />Confirm that any new hardware that is installed is compatible with the installed version of Windows. For example, you can get information about required hardware at Windows 10 Specifications.
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Run a virus detection program. Viruses can infect all types of hard disks formatted for Windows, and resulting disk corruption can generate system bug check codes. Make sure the virus detection program checks the Master Boot Record for infections.
<br />
<br />Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. The System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Use the following command to run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe).
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />Look in Device Manager to see if any devices are marked with the exclamation point (!). Review the events log displayed in driver properties for any faulting driver. Try updating the related driver.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please follow the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Boot into the BIOS on the host computer and confirm that hardware virtualization is still enabled. If it is enabled, then you need to disable it and restart your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After restarting again you need to Boot into the Bios and this time you need to enable the virtualization and check if the issue gets fixed.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><u><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer
 from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Rename
</span></b><span>*.vsv file and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This issue occurs when the hibernation file for your virtual machine gets corrupted. For Windows Virtual PC (the version that comes with Windows
 7), the default action for close is Hibernate. Hiberfil.sys is a snap-shot of the state of your computer that is taken by windows when it becomes inactive. However, virtual machines don't store their hibernation files in hiberfil.sys like a physical Windows
 system does. The hibernation file for a virtual machine is referred as the storage of the current state of the virtual machine. So the hibernation file for Windows Virtual Machine is stored in the following location which has a file extension*.vsv</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To rename the file *.vsv, follow the steps provided below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. <span>Click on Start and click on computer.</span>
</p>
<p><span>b. Go to the following location:</span>
</p>
<p><b><span>C:\Users\ (Username)\ AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Virtual PC\Virtual Machines directory</span></b></p>
<p><span>c. You’ll find a .VSV file in the Virtual Machines Directory.</span>
</p>
<p><span>d. Rename the file.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>e. Close all the windows and restart Virtual Machine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if it helps!</span></p>

<p><span>It was very clever for Activision to incorporate the 1337 3 in there. I’m ready to buy the new iteration of Modern Warfare. [/sarcasm]</span></p>
<p><span><span>How about a trailer that reads:

<p><span>Then I might consider buying a game that has the reputation of being the doormat for hackers year after year.</span></p>

<p><span>It’s a tease. I know. The point of these things is to get the fans excited for the game.</span></p>
<p><span>If they really wanted to get the fans excited, they would acknowledge that they screwed up big time with MW2 and are doing right by their fans and community.
 A beta would be a start in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span>After COD4, picking up any subsequent MW title at launch was a no brainer. Now, I’m seriously considering not getting this game after MW2 (MP) was such a huge
 disappointment for me along with a considerable amount of fans.</span></p>

                    <p>I upgraded my HP ProBook 640 G2 laptop from windows 7 to windows 10 and lost the option of scrolling with one single finger on touchpad.&nbsp;</p>
I tried installing the latest synaptics driver but the configuration option with one finger does not appear any more. Only the two-finger scroll option appears, which is super uncomfortable and furthemore it works very bad. Please solve this, I can not understand
 how you can disable the most useful scroll option that has worked for years on all the touchpads&nbsp;of all laptops.
<p>Please, give me a solution, it is impossible to get used to working with two fingers scrolling, it is very uncomfortable.</p>

            They killed it off unfortunately, a read about 17 threads of different people upset about the one finger scroll being taken away. It apparently happen mid windows 8.1 .  One person said if you run an older driver in compatibility it gives you the function back but it doesn't work to well.  From what I read it was a conflict between synaptic/hp and Microsoft.  <br /><br />Hopefully in the coming updates they'll bring it back,<br /> Sorry to be the bearer of bad new,<br />Yomi Thomas

<p>Hi Lacrumb,&nbsp;<br />
thaks for your reply but it does´t work in my laptop.&nbsp;<br />
If I go to to Additional Settings the TouchPad tab in Mouse Properties is opened, and there are not configuration options there like before, there are just a button which redirects to Windows TouchPad Settings.</p>

<p>Thanks Yomi! I can believe it, I have been working this way for more than 10 years, many hours per day and now I must to change to a worst way. If this started with Windows 8.1 and they have not fixed it yet, they will not ever fix it, this can only happen
 in Microsoft</p>
<p>Unfortunately I cannot use another operating system, or go back to windows 7 because it is my work computer, provided by a corporation. It is very frustrating have to work in this way.</p>

            I’m so sorry, but if we are lucky it may come back. Microsoft usually tries to intergrate things many customers ask/complain about. I saw a lot of people reviving old threads saying bring back one finger scroll!!<br />So just keep your fingers crossed and we may see it back or they’ll give us a work around that works
