<h2>            module kernelbase.dll, asset offset 00013F62 error While installing WIndows 7 Service Pack 1.</h2>
                    <p><strong><u><em>Original title: module kernelbase.dll, asset offset 00013F62 </em>
</u></strong></p>
<p>I have some errors after the instalation of Windows 7 Professional Service Pack 1. All refer to ""Windows explorer encountered a validation error", and then follows stuff like process name iexplorer. exe, module kernelbase.dll, asset offset 00013F62, or
 module mshtml.dll, asset offset 008BE823, or shlwapi.dll, 0061281. Anyone knows what the problem may be?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you facing this issue with other updates as well?</p>
<p>Try the Methods provided below and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Try to install the service pack 1 in clean boot state and check if that helps.</p>
<p>Performing clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer
 for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows
 7:</p>

<p><b>Note</b>:
</p>
<p>After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 from the above KB article.</p>

    <title>Intellipoint Mouse NOT listed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guinness6969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intellipoint Mouse NOT listed</h2>
                    Wireless Mobile Mouse 1000 is NOT listed in (Control Panel) "Mouse Properties" - "Connected Device" drop-down.<br />
I am using option Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500 as this is the nearest device with identical button compliment.<br />
Intellipoint does not auto-select this device but autoselects a 5 button device which causes hang-ups in use.<br />
Why is Microsoft Wireless Mouse 1000 not listed as an option? - Thank you.<br />

            <p>Syed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>The Windows XP software was downloaded directly from the link you gave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following your steps a, b &amp; c did not solve the issue – the same fault window as previously described still occurred.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I then followed the “how to configure … in “clean boot” link - I opted for method #2 – manual;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steps 1, 2 &amp; 3 were followed – but they failed to put the machine into clean boot…</p>
<p>Step 4 (optional) was applied – this caused deactivation of Genuine Windows certification which then required telephone reactivation...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On installing IntelliPoint now produces fault window “Microsoft IntelliPoint 8.2 Setup”: -</p>
<p>Setup could not install a required component: Microsoft Application Error Reporting.</p>
<p>Restart your computer and try running Setup again….. (Error code 1601).<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I tried the “Guided Help” – all this does is produce a fault window “Guided Help” which states
</p>
<p>Guided Help cannot be downloaded right now…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This has gone way beyond a joke – I have now spent a good few hours on this problem…</p>

<p>A section that might be&nbsp;pertinent follows:</p>
<b>
<hr />
<p>When you install the software, the "unable to install a required component" message appears
</p>
</b>
<p>When you install the IntelliPoint software, you may receive a message saying that Setup was unable to install a required component. If Setup is unable to install the following components, follow the relevant instructions:
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;MSXML. On the installation CD, go to the Prereq\MSXML folder, open the folder for your processor type (32-bit or 64-bit), and then run the MSI file.
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The MSXML update patch. On the installation CD, go to the Prereq\MSXML folder, open the folder for your processor type (32-bit or 64-bit), and then run the EXE file.
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Windows Application Error Reporting. On the installation CD, go to the Prereq\Watson folder, open the folder for your processor type (32-bit or 64-bit), and then run the MSI file.
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Windows Installer. On the installation CD, open the Prereq\WindowsInstaller3.1v2\x86 folder, and then run the EXE file.
</p>
<p>If you still receive an error, you may have a problem with the component itself that you must resolve before you can install your device software. For more information, see
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com</a>.</p>
<hr />
<p>What they're saying is that MSXML 6&nbsp;and the MSXML update patches must be installed on your machine.&nbsp; Also, you should be running at
<strong>least</strong> version 3.1v2 of the Windows Installer.</p>
<p>If one downloads InteliPoint 8.2 x86 (en-US) -&gt;<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/9/F/8/9F8E26F4-06EC-446B-A0A4-615E18F2EE57/IPx86_1033_8.20.468.0.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&lt;-, one can extract the files referenced above by running
<strong>IPx86_1033_8.20.468.0.exe -x</strong>. (It will ask where to extract the files (the directory must exist).)&nbsp; Look for the above&nbsp;files in the&nbsp;<strong><em>prereq</em></strong> folder.</p>
<p>Alternatively, one can download Microsoft Core XML Services (MSXML) 6.0 -&gt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=3988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&lt;-.&nbsp; There are &nbsp;updates.&nbsp; Get Microsoft Core XML Services (MSXML) 6.0 Service
 Pack 1 -&gt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=6276" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&lt;- and&nbsp;MSXML Core Services 6.0 Service Pack 2 -&gt;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&lt;-.&nbsp; (Or run Microsoft
 Windows Update after installing the base package.)</p>
<p>Additionally, to install the MSXML6.msi (and IPx86 8.2), one must have at least Windows Install 3.1v2.&nbsp; One may get the Microsoft® Windows® Installer 4.5 Redistributable download -&gt;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=8483" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&lt;-.&nbsp;
<strong><em>Do this first!</em></strong></p>
<p>Lastly, Windows Application Error Reporting (<em>a.k.a.</em> Dr. Watson Client 2.0) is available everywhere but I haven't found an
<em><strong>offical</strong></em> Microsoft download site for it.&nbsp; (Which is not to say there isn't one...).&nbsp; Get it by extraction from the IPx86_1033_8.20.468.0.exe download (as above).&nbsp; There's an XP&nbsp;64-bit version of dw20share.msi but it's not in InteliPoint.
 (Time stamp on this file is 1 Aug 2011.&nbsp; Same old dw20shared.msi from 2007 but it has an updated security certificate.&nbsp; BTW, the 64-bit dw20shared.msi can be found in the 64-bit&nbsp;Microsoft Security Essentials distribution.)</p>
<p>Please note that Windows XP 64-bit&nbsp;does <em><strong>not</strong></em> support the Microsoft Mobile Wireless Mouse 1000!&nbsp; (See the Technical Data Sheet -&gt;<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/A/F/1AF799F4-184B-4069-9276-418C1E5924FF/TDS_WirelessMobileMouse1000.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&lt;-.)</p>
<p>Get these prerequisites out of the way and your other problems may just disappear...Good luck!</p>

<h3> csripps  say:</h3>
<h2>            cursor not working at bottom of screen &#40;ANSWER FAST&#41;</h2>
                    When I try to move my cursor to the bottom of the screen with the time, date, and windows icon, my cursor turns into a circle with a diagonal line through it. It happened when i opened the start menu and tried to drag a file from there to a folder on the
 desktop. While I was dragging, there was a .exe file in the middle opened in the middle of the desktop. The icon of the file i was dragging froze when i scrolled across the .exe file. Then when I tried to shut down, the cursor turned to the circle with line
 through it. Now the file I was dragging's icon is froze on the screen and the .exe file that i had open is frozen and I can't close it! I would try to shut my computer down, but I can't reach the start menu because it is at the bottom of the screen. PLEASE
 HELP SOON!

            Go to Task Manager and cancel out the file that you were trying to copy. <br />
Then go back to date and time and see if you still get the cursor with the circle going around.

                    <p>Hello,</p><p><br /></p><p>I subcribed to xbox live gold 3 months ago because there was a an interresting promotion, it was the first time i did since i got an xbox one, and i did only because it was reallly cheap a the time, as a student it was the only way i could afford such a long time of gold membership.</p><p><br /></p><p>But as i should have guessed&nbsp;there was an automatic renewal of my subscription at the cost of 20euros just yesterday, and as i mentionned it is a financially difficult for me to lose such an amount of money. i did not use it and do not intend to and so i'd like to know if i could get a refund ?</p><p><br /></p><p>PS: i am not a native english speaker and i do not really know how to end this message politely in this language but i thank you in advance for forgiving my mystakes and for your help.</p>

    <title>Kernel Event ID 41 Error on ASUS CM6870 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rachellepeterson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kernel Event ID 41 Error on ASUS CM6870</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, my ASUS CM6870 computer has been restarting randomly. This started two days ago. I was using the computer, when a blue screen of death occurred. A message appeared on the blue screen, saying system service exception. After reading up on the blue
 screen, I updated my graphics card driver, and this seemed to fix the issue. After that, while my son was playing a game on the computer, it began to restart itself randomly. It did this multiple times while he used the computer. He figured out that the restart
 issue was a Kernel event ID 41, and after following some instructions on <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2028504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this</a>&nbsp;guide, figured out that the BugcheckCode was 0x0000003b.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We haven't used the computer since then (this question was written on a different computer). We would appreciate help on solving this issue. We are willing to use the computer with the restart problem to find extra information on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help,</p>
<p>Rachelle</p>

<h2>            Keyboard lights not working</h2>
                    Hopefully, there's a simple fix for this. &nbsp;My new Microsoft Comfort 5000 Keyboard has no lights. &nbsp;There are certain keys that should light when pressed, i.e. Caps Lock, Num Lock, and many more. &nbsp;Any thoughts?

<p>I have troubleshooted, checked the&nbsp;forum, perused the support pages . . . but can find nothing regarding keyboard lights.&nbsp; The only light I have seen on this keyboard is the battery light, which appeared after removing the batteries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there no light or notification for when the Caps Lock key is on?&nbsp; Would be really helpful when typing in passwords!</p>

<h3> chronofox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fake Activated Windows 10. What Action will be taken&#63;</h2>
                    Just minutes after the release of Windows 10 on July 29 2015, Students on my campus decided to get iso copies of it from sites such as getintopc.com and onhax.com; Some students were successful into downloading and installing windows 10 without being caught
 of their cracked/non-genuine windows 7 and 8.1. And the rest were able to get a product key through google search, install it and get an "Activate Windows" on their screen; they managed to activated it using on of the activators for a windows 10 insider preiview
 provided through google searching. I'm wondering now what Microsoft will do in this situation.

<p>Hey Brewer6Pack!</p>
<p>1) It could be something as simple as resetting your power supply.</p>
<p>To do this please follow this <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-power-supply-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&gt;link&lt;</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) If you have an original Xbox One the power supply pack may have gone bad or could be over heating. If this is the case, replacing the power supply pack should fix your problems.</p>

<p>What exactly are you looking at?&nbsp; E.g. in Quick Access I have <strong>Recent files (20)</strong> but I don't know if that is something that I put there or something that is always there.&nbsp; Similar but I don't think related is Related items under a right-click
 of a Taskbar shortcut.&nbsp; It looks like it has a different number.&nbsp; I'm pretty sure I have seen a registry hack about that one and doubt it would have the same effect on the list I'm seeing via Quick Access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I have just discovered that it is a bad idea to assume that there is any idea of general usability with this feature.&nbsp; For example, what would you expect to see if you used right-click Create shortcut or Send to Desktop (Create shortcut) with that "folder"
 name?&nbsp; Another way to open the Quick Access folder from the Desktop perhaps?&nbsp; Me too.&nbsp; In fact, what it does is creates a Desktop shortcut
 make this mistake, though (another usability defect) there is no Undo command available for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK.&nbsp; I just found what we can have on the Desktop instead which would let you see more "items".</p>
<p><strong>%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent</strong></p>
<p>So, open that, sort it by Date Modified and you will see something with better functionality than that misbegotten option I unwittingly encountered.&nbsp; If you want you can use right-click New Shortcut on the Desktop with it.</p>
<p>

<p>I don't know of any setting or registry trick to accomplish this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you might the info you want from creating a Search for files modified within a given time period. Several presets are offered when you click 'Date Modified' on the Search Tools ribbon.</p>

<h2>            Unable to create USB recovery drive in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I am trying to create a USB recovery drive under Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I have followed the MS Help page on this subject and started by creating a refresh image on my C: drive since machine did not already have one. &nbsp;The refresh image was created successfully in
 a folder c:\refreshimage but when I started the Recovery Drive tool the 'Copy the recovery partition from the PC to the recovery drive' checkbox was greyed out and I was unable to continue with the task. &nbsp;I did restart the computer after creating the refresh
 image but this did not solve the problem.

            Just follow steps to resolve.<br />
<br />
1 Locate the&nbsp;CustomRefresh.wim&nbsp;file Rename it to INSTALL.wim.<br />
<br />
2 Right-click on this file and select Copy from the pop-up menu.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
3 Use File Explorer to navigate to the C: drive on your PC. Create a new folder inside the root folder of your C: drive named C:\Win8-Recovery.
<div><br />
4 Use File Explorer to navigate into the new C:\Win8-Recovery folder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5 Right-click inside the folder window and select Paste from the pop-up menu to copy the INSTALL.wim file from the RefreshImage folder to this new folder location.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
6 Press window + X key and select Command Prompt (Admin) to open a new elevated Command Prompt window.<br />
<br />
7 Inside the Command Prompt window, run the following command line to register the copied INSTALL.WIM file as the Recovery Image on your PC:&nbsp;<b>REAGENTC /SetOSImage /Path C:\Win8-Recovery\INSTALL.WIM /Index 1 .&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>The recovery partition checkbox in Recovery should now be available .<br />

 India, who took over my computer. When he finished, about one hour later, I had Norton working, but no fingerprint access. I tried Signin options, but now it says that Windows Hello is preventing some options from being shown and that apparently my computer
 cannot have that option. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            file location after windows 10 installation</h2>
                    About 2 weeks ago I installed windows 10. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Excel and Word simply couldn't find my old files. &nbsp;I located them, and one by one re-opened them, so Excel "knew" where they were. &nbsp;It worked. &nbsp;Two days ago we had a power outage, and I had to re-boot;
 for some reason windows 10 decided to re-install. &nbsp;Now, I can't find my excel and word files - at all! &nbsp;HELP please!

            <p><span>Hi Mary,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community. Let me assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Provide us with the below details for better clarity on the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Did you perform a clean installation of Windows 10?</span></li><li><span>Did you try searching the files from “Search” bar?</span></li><li><span>What exactly happened when you rebooted the computer?</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;Did it install updates or Automatic repair? Provide us the message which was displayed when you rebooted computer.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows installation needs an installation media. It can only be updated through Windows update without the user being involved. In case you tried installing with a bootable media and performed a clean installed,
 all the files and data would be deleted. Performing a reset with the option, <strong>
“keep files”</strong> will not delete your files and folders. I suggest you to type the file name on
<strong>“Search bar”</strong> located on the taskbar beside the <strong>Start </strong>
icon and check if you can find the files. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check the recycle bin for deleted files, restore them if you find any. Also check for windows.old folder in&nbsp;the drive where the OS is installed. Go to the location
<strong>C:/windows.old/&lt;user name&gt;</strong> and check if files are present </span>

            I used a file recovery program and was able to locate most of my files... However, quite a few of them were unable to be read by their programs (access or excel), so they are not usable. &nbsp;The most upsetting part was that my extensive (over 4500) embroidery
 files, which were in various folders and sub-folders, are all in one place - without their folders - so they are basically lost to me as I can't go through all of the files to try to locate the one I want!&nbsp;

<h2>            Getting rid of &#34;read only&#34; on Windows 10</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;Now every folder in my documents is read only, every new folder I create is read only. &nbsp;I go to properties and it will not allow it to be deleted. &nbsp;Now I can save a changed document anywhere. &nbsp;Message says I need to have administrator
 approval. &nbsp;I am signed in as administrator. &nbsp;Never had this problem before. &nbsp;What is going on. &nbsp;I am in a real mess, can't save any document I create. &nbsp;HELP! &nbsp;What has microsoft done to me.

            Thanks, I ran the checker, didn't find anything. &nbsp;I clicked on local user but it came up with adding "another" user, I have an account, I think. &nbsp;None of the prompts after the first two could be followed i.e. not find how to proceed. &nbsp;If I have a user
 account do I need another local user account? &nbsp;Not clear.

<li><span>Open the properties of the main <strong>User Profile </strong>folder where the files are located (such as Documents, Pictures, etc). You can open the properties of a particular folder by

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sounds to me like the NTFS permissions on your computer's C:\ drive are completely messed up.&nbsp; As this could be very hard to manually fix, it may be worth doing a disk check first to see if it could help:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click <strong>Start</strong> and click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command and press [Enter]: <strong>chkdsk C: /f /v /x</strong></li><li>It should say something about needing to schedule a disk check.&nbsp; Press [Y], and then press [Enter] to schedule the disk check.<br />
</li><li>Reboot your computer.&nbsp; During reboot, you should see messages on the splash screen to the effect that a disk check is underway.&nbsp; I expect the disk check to take 3 to 10 minutes, after which your computer will reboot again (this time fully).&nbsp; Hopefully things
 will work better afterwards too.<br />

            <p>You can tell it to switch permissions, you can tell it to turn off read-only, and NOTHING changes. You close the dialog box, immediately reopen it, and it's read-only again. I've messed around with all the different accounts, given everything full access,
 it does not matter. Read only.</p>

<h2>            Windows will not load, system recovery does not work</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba Satellite L455-S5975 laptop.&nbsp; It has Windows 7 Home, 32 bit &amp; is less than 2 yrs old......shortly after downloading several of the recommended windows updates, my computer crashed. Windows will not load..the Toshiba page comes up, then
 a page full of writing with computer info &amp; patent numbers &amp; PXE-E61: Media test failure, check cable.......PXE-MOF: Exiting PXE ROM.&nbsp; I wrote down error code: 10-FC12-0002...not sure when I got this.&nbsp; I managed to get system recovery started, but it would
 not finish.&nbsp; I tried using&nbsp;the recovery disks I made...thought it was working when it asked for second disk...then it stopped &amp; gave me another error code&nbsp; F3-F100-003 &amp; told to me click OK to shut down.&nbsp; Can my laptop be repaired or is it history?&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp;
 I am no computer expert, just a Grandma who loves her laptop &amp; Farmville....so keep it simple please. Thank you for your help.&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheryl

<div><br />
<div>Do not follow any of the suggestions of Imran. He is sending you in a wild goose chase. From the symptoms you're describing, it looks to me that your hard drive has failed. Some computers follow a sequence to try to find an operating system. The last option
 is to find it on a network through PXE (don't worry about those big words). Your computer is going through all the possible options and devices and cannot find one that has an operating system. Then when you tried the recovery, it found a bad section on your
 hard drive and that's why it cannot continue with the recovery process.</div>
<div><br />
<div>For all that I explained, your only option is to buy a brand new hard drive and replace the bad one. I will strongly suggest to find a reputable computer shop and asked to find the same brand brand and model of the one that you now have. Sorry I couldn't
 be of much help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm having second thoughts about my last paragraph. It might be possible that formatting again your hard drive, it could be fixed. Many times, formatting will do the trick as long as the damage on the hard drive is not extensive. However, formatting the
 hard drive with your recovery disks is quite a challenge for a beginner. Anyway, before formatting or replacing the hard drive, you can check if your computer can detect it. I found this at the Toshiba web site to access the place where you can find out if
 your computer detects your hard drive or not (BIOS):</div>
<div><span><strong>F2 key method</strong>: Turn the computer on. If you see an invitation to press the F2 key to enter Setup, do so. The Setup screen
 will appear.</span></div>
<div><span><strong>Esc key method</strong>: Turn the computer on. If you do not see a prompt to press the F2 key, then immediately press and hold the
 Esc key for three seconds, and then release it. When prompted to, press the F1 key. The Setup screen will appear.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>When you are in BIOS, look around for an entry label Hard drive, HD, HDD# and see if there are any and that there's a description (for example
 HDD1 &nbsp; &nbsp;Toshiba mk12345abcd). If you find one then, there's a 90% chance that reformatting the hard drive will make it work. Please, let me know if you were able to find an entry for your hard drive on BIOS and if you're willing to try to reformat it.</span></div>

    <title>The pain of having a microsoft account as a Belgian citizen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aroush  say:</h3>
<h2>            The pain of having a microsoft account as a Belgian citizen</h2>
                    <p>This is driving me nuts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem is so widespread (and so <strong>OLD</strong>) that I don't even know under which category to post it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem affects my billing information, Xbox music, zune, etc.</p>
<p>I live in Belgium, a country with multiple official languages, most important ones being dutch and french.</p>
<p>Microsoft boasts about needing "only one" microsoft account to access all services.&nbsp; Great.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My microsoft account is old.&nbsp; So whatever answer is being posted to my problem: do
<em>not</em> advice me to create a new one (as I've seen on other threads on here) as I have no desire to start everything over from scratch and I certainly don't want to lose my 25gb skydrive storage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess you already know what my problem is.&nbsp; It would be extra terrible if you don't, seeing as how a gazillion threads about this exact problem exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, half the services presented to me are in french and the other half are in dutch.&nbsp; I see no pattern here at all btw.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years ago, I bought a Lumia 800.&nbsp; The market place was in french for some weird reasons that I still don't get.&nbsp; Anyway, after going to some obscure form on&nbsp;an Xbox site&nbsp;(wtf btw... I don't even own an xbox), I finally found a combobox where I could
 choose a language.&nbsp; It was defaulted to french so switched it to dutch.&nbsp; A few hours later, half the market place was in dutch.&nbsp; Yes, half.</p>
<p>Then, after a few more hours of surfing, I got directed to some Zune service where I could do the same.&nbsp; This solved it.&nbsp; Well, sort of.&nbsp; It totally broke all apps on my phone an had to reset to factory settings.&nbsp; If I would have bought apps on the market
 before changing the language, I would have lost them all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I own&nbsp; surface pro.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm an IT professional, so I prefer my windows in english.&nbsp; For some reason, the windows store took over that setting.&nbsp; Great (although I don't get why it doesn't use the same settings as the phone market!!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My apps were also in english.&nbsp; Great.</p>
<p>If I log into live.com and access my account settings, then the page comes up in dutch.&nbsp; Makes sense, I guess.</p>
<p>But if under account settings I choose for "billing", I suddenly get redirected to a french page.&nbsp; WTF?</p>
<p>I have NO IDEA where I can change this.&nbsp; NOWHERE under account settings can I choose a language.</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to search the interwebs for another few hours once more to find yet another obscure form that wants my information (for what exactly?) where I can find some other dropdownlist where I can put it in dutch once again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It doesn't stop there.&nbsp; I just turned on my surface and saw 7 updates.&nbsp; Cool.&nbsp; Among them most of the build in apps (calendar, skydrive, people, music, video).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the xbox music and xbox video apps are in french.&nbsp; Well, the online parts are - the rest is in english</p>
<p>Store is in english</p>
<p>Skydrive is a mixture of english and dutch</p>
<p>Calendar is english</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>This is driving me insane.&nbsp; As a software engineer myself, I think this is unacceptable.&nbsp; It's insane.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>WHY can't I just have a SINGLE combobox under my microsoft accountsettings where I can choose my preferred language (regardless of my region!!) and have that language propagate to ALL microsoft services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not using "one account" for everything.&nbsp; If it truelly was "one account" for everything... well, it would use the settings of that "one account" for everything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, next to a question, this is also a rant.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This bears repeating:&nbsp; <strong>This is unacceptable</strong>.&nbsp; Especially since I'm finding threads here as far back as
<strong>2007</strong> with exactly this problem on Zune and xbox, none of wich offer sensical solutions.</p>
<p>Please get your act together on this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not something to laugh about.&nbsp; People are invested in their account.&nbsp; They buy stuff with it.&nbsp; If they lose the account, they lose their purchases.&nbsp; How do you expect to build a successfull eco system of "3 screens and a cloud" if you can't even
 get something as fudging basic as UI language synced accross all services that are used with
<strong>a single account</strong>??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry, but at this point, I'm just extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, please, spare me the effort and frustration of searching for all the places where I need to set the correct language.</p>
<p>Just provide me with links to all those pages so I can be done with it once and for all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And <strong>please</strong> remove all that fragmentation and just add a single preferred language combo on the "personal settings" page under account settings, regardless of region.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks and sorry for ranting.&nbsp; </p>

            Hi Aroush,<br />
<br />
I understand that you use 3 languages in the Windows 8 Computer and Surface Pro that is English, French and Dutch. Now when you select the English language, you want all the Apps and other files (including in Skydrive) to be shown in English language only.
 Similarly you would want the same thing to happen when you select French or Dutch language. Is my understanding of this issue correct?
<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I understand that you would want a Combo language of the 3 languages wherein you wouldn't want to select each language every time.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>First, sorry for venting my frustration like this.&nbsp; It was getting late and it's the 3rd time I'm confronted with this.&nbsp; I kind of cracked.&nbsp; :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess my main problem is that I don't get which language setting is used in which place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I get that if my windows language is configured differently from my online microsoft account that I will be confronted with a mix of both at times.&nbsp; What I don't get is the logic behind it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, <em>nowhere</em> did I <em>ever</em> configure anything to be french.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what I would expect to see is that all things local on my machine will be english (as my windows is in english).&nbsp; While all things online concerning microsoft services that require logging in (skydrive, market places, billing forms, etc) would be in
 dutch.&nbsp; Eventhough I would prefer those to be english as well - but none of the online account settings offer me that option.&nbsp; Probably because it's an account attached to Belgium.&nbsp; I only get the choice between french and dutch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation now is as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The configuration:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows 8 on my surface is installed with an english UI</p>
<p>- My microsoft account is set to dutch in every place I could find where I could set a language</p>
<p>- <em>Nowhere</em> did I <em>ever</em> configure anything in french.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>The result:</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- <strong>windows phone market place is dutch</strong> (=used to be french as well until I&nbsp; managed to change my account language on several forms to dutch - and this
<em>broke all installed apps on my phone and forced me to do a factory reset&nbsp;- why?&nbsp; it's just a language, not a region - thankfully I hadn't actually paid for any of those apps</em>)</p>
<p>- <strong>windows 8&nbsp;store is english</strong>&nbsp;(because windows is in english?&nbsp; I'ld expect it to be dutch, just like the phone market)</p>
<p>- <strong>xbox music app is a mixture of english and french</strong> (english is probably the local UI stuff linked to my installed windows language I guess,&nbsp;while the french parts are the online things like trailers and such - no clue why it's in french
 and not dutch)</p>
<p>- <strong>xbox video app is the same as the music app</strong></p>
<p><strong>- windows live account settings on the web are dutch </strong>(as I would expect based on account settings)</p>
<p><strong>- windows live account "billing" sub page turns up french </strong>(again, no clue why that is)</p>
<p>- <strong>everything on the website of xbox is dutch once I log in, including billing</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My main question is where&nbsp;do these&nbsp;french parts come from and how do I prevent that from happening?</p>
<p>I can live with a mixture of dutch and english.&nbsp; As said, I realise that that is bound to happen if my online profile is set to dutch while my windows is configured to an english UI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My side question, which will not solve my problem&nbsp;- it's just curiosity, is why is this is so obscure/hard/complicated?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really don't understand why the account settings page&nbsp; (<a href="https://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com/</a>) doesn't simply offer an option to set a language for your profile, which then propagates to all services.&nbsp; It makes no
 sense that I need to go change language settings on the xbox spin-off / connected account to see seemingly unrelated services (like winphone market) in a specific language.&nbsp; It makes even less sense that while I set it to dutch there, that the xbox music app
 for example still serves me in french.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's hoping that microsoft simply is still in the processes of unifying all these accounts and that in the future, we don't need to maintain a "single" account in 3-4 places, while we should be able to do it only once.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, I'll be happy with a solution that&nbsp;makes sure I'm never confronted with french again after logging in.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main reason why windows is installed in english is primarily for professional reasons - I tend to get lost and confused as I'm used to english output, menu's and whatnot.&nbsp; It doesn't bother me if some things turn up dutch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I just don't want to see
 anything in french.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a billion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So it's been about 2 weeks now and I'm still having this issue...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've just upgraded my surface pro to windows 8.1 and much to my horror, I noticed that the language french now also has invaded some parts of the windows store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And again not everywhere...&nbsp; Only in the first section of the home screen (where it has some slideshow about new apps and "must have apps" etc) as well as the description of the section "surface picks".</p>
<p>Strangely enough, on the homescreen, it says "surface picks", while the title&nbsp;says "Sélection par Surface" once I open that section.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Again, I have <em>never</em> selected "french" <em>anywhere</em>.&nbsp; For some reason, some online parts of apps and microsoft account powered sites just assume that I speak french because I have a Belgian account (while it's configured to be dutch everywhere
 I could configure it as such).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please, PLEASE someone tell how to get rid of this french stuff.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Seriously, it can't be this hard.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Clearly it assumes this localisation from <em>somewhere</em>.&nbsp; The question is
<strong>from where?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Pretty please?</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I never selected French anywhere, but still Microsoft shows me French in different places. For my Windows Phone, this was indeed solved by switching French (again, why is this the default for Belgium? Most people speak Dutch, not French) to Dutch on the
 Xbox billing profile page.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Today, I ordered more space for my SkyDrive. The ordering page starts in French (why?), but I can switch the display language to Dutch, which results in a partly Dutch/French page. After ordering, I get a confirmation by email, totally in French, unbelievable!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please let us know where we need to switch the setting to Dutch, because this is very annoying and I can imagine this drives a lot of (Dutch speaking) Belgians away from buying anything on the Microsoft store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Btw, I own a Dutch Windows 8 desktop (now 8.1) and a Surface RT (also on 8.1 now, also&nbsp;in Dutch).</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<p>As I mentioned before, my problems (on my surface) go away when I put the windows display language in Dutch.&nbsp; I only see french if the display language is anything other then Dutch.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From my tests, this seems to be the logic behind this:</p>
<p>- If display language of windows and "preferred language" of the account matches, put everything in that language</p>
<p>- if they don't match, use the default language for the country the account belongs to</p>
<p>- on the internet, use the preferred language of the account, except for the billing pages - use the default of the country of the account there.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And as you pointed out, the default for belgium seems to be french according to the softies in Redmond.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a software engineer who's been in the roles of functional analyst, tester and quality control, I have a hard time grasping how such inconsistent behaviour could come out of what people refer to as the "biggest software company on the planet".&nbsp; Especially
 since this problem exists <strong>ever since xboxlive and zune were born, almost a decade ago!</strong></p>
<p>It's also not a bug that just affects belgian people.&nbsp; It seems as if EVERY country with more then 1 official language suffers from the exact same issue.</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>The only thing left for us dutch belgian folks is to use dutch windows (ugh!) and switch the language of the billing page every single time we visit it.&nbsp; And just swallow the confirmation mails as they will always be in french no matter what (apparantly).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It seems as if they just don't care.</p>
<p>I found one thread of microsoft live support where the "tech" guy LITERALLY asked the customer to notify him if he finds a work-around so they&nbsp;could share this "solution" with other customers.</p>
<p>I think that says enough.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Don't expect this issue to be fixed any time soon.&nbsp; Or at all.&nbsp; Ever.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And yes, it's kind of hard to convince dutch speaking belgian folks into the msft "modern ui" eco-system&nbsp;if they have to deal with bullocks like this.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Question for you though: is your microsoft account an old one?&nbsp; From the pre-windows phone days?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I wonder if the same issue arises with brand new accounts.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't feel like factory resetting my phone just to find out.</p>

            <p>Yes, I also have an older account, so I,don't know if that makes a difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the functionality can't be changed easily, maybe the default setting for Belgium can be&nbsp;changed to Dutch, so at least the majority of Belgium receives the correct language. C'mon Microsoft, it is not that difficult to look this up for each country with
 multiple languages and correct it.</p>

            Hi to all above.... i am joining the discussion after a few desperate days trying to solve this myself. Also living in Belgium, also IT professional and trying to make sense of it all.
<div>My account is from about 3 yrs ago and i actually started using it a month ago when i got hold of win 8 device. I hope this was not a mistake and the issue can be solved somehow. i stumbled across this when i decided to enjoy the video app and buy video
 content.... much to my surprise, billing information from &nbsp;my so called "live" account was not available.... Ok, did some research, and i was told to change location of my xbox profile (!&amp;#$*).. i was naively hoping i had 1 profile only... Ok so far so good.
 changed location from US to BE and billing method appeared OK... but.... content offered was very limited and in FRENCH! (aaarrrg). so decided to abandon the idea using video app but much to my surprise app store have switched to FRENCH too!!! at the same
 time, you can change xbox location only once every 3 months.. so i can really change it back to us and check if i can get my app store language back to English...</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is surreal.... cant believe it really.. but as one of you mentioned already.. you cant build an ecosystem while leaving so many inhibitors in it .......</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hoping an enthusiastic Microsoft employee will read this and try to help&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you changed your location of the xbox profile, did all win8 apps continue to work?</p>
<p>Because back in the days when I did that to get my winphone market in dutch, it broke all apps installed.&nbsp; I had to redownload them all, because I suddenly found myself in a different "market" and none of the installed apps, that were linked to that previous
 "market", could authenticate or whatever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said above, the only "fix" I know about is to set your windows device in the same language as your online profile "prefered language".&nbsp; This "prefered language" can not be set in your account settings at home.live.com as you would expect though.&nbsp; No,
 no... you need to go to some account settings page on live.xbox.com&nbsp; There, burried somewhere between the options, you can get to a form for contact information of the "billing person".&nbsp; Here, you'll be able to set your prefered language.&nbsp; Only choices are
 french and dutch if your account is linked to belgium by the way.&nbsp; Hurray. (/s)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... a dutch windows 8 installation, coupled with an account linked to belgium on home.live.com AND prefered language set to "dutch" under "billing" on live.xbox.com...&nbsp; will get rid of all french coming from online services inside apps on your windows
 8 system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing else works.&nbsp; Believe me, I tried.&nbsp; Relentlessly.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventhough this "works" for me to get rid of the french... it's still completely unacceptable.&nbsp; First, it's far to complex and secondly I don't want a dutch pc.&nbsp; I want an english pc.&nbsp; Apparantly, according to microsoft, it is forbidden to have everything
 in english on your machine when you live in belgium (or any other non-english-speaking country).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my theory on what happened...</p>
<p>Before the "microsoft account", all those things were seperate systems (hotmail, zune, xbox,..)</p>
<p>The problem first shows up in Xbox, at the very beginning of the introduction of xbox live accounts.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Users complain that in multiple-language countries, it defaults to the wrong language.&nbsp; To "solve" this, a drop down "prefered language" is added to billing contact form.</p>
<p>The same problem surfaces in Zune (legacy code ported over?&nbsp; service using the same authentication? team simply made the same mistake?)</p>
<p>Then the microsoft account is introduced.&nbsp; But instead of being a single profile useable everywhere, it rather seems to be another one built on top of all the others, taking over settings from the various accounts - including the broken logic of language.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why you can't change your language on home.live.com and why you need to go to xbox instead.</p>
<p>This is why eventhough it's being sold as "one account", you still need to go an maintain information on multiple profiles.&nbsp; This would be "fine" (sort of) if they still were seperate subsystems.&nbsp; But they aren't.&nbsp; Xbox music uses xbox settings and invades
 windows 8 and windows phone systems, taking its settings with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't see any other explanation although I would love to hear one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But considering all this, it's not surprising that such a spaghetti makes it extra hard to fix this.&nbsp; Which is why it hasn't been fixed for
<strong>years</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi again</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Just checked... no issue with previously purchased apps. (only 3 not sure if representative ).
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also changed display language to Dutch and this seems to be the only way to get rid of French.... but same as you .. i want English PC!!!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is digital discrimination and my next move will be filing a complaint with the European court of justice! 😁</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the serious note, i agree with your theory.... now wandering if there is a way to get rid of xbox profile and "decouple" from main Microsoft account...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We need to join forces with all the folks out there having similar issues - Canada, Switzerland, and all expats around the world.... according to Microsoft, if you are English speaking American and move to Belgium or any other non English speaking country
 ..&nbsp;and you want to use xbox services, you need to learn a new language!😌</p>
<p>Spaghetti pot&nbsp;cooking nicely on the stove..... but I still really like windows 8 and enjoy my device....</p>

<h2>            Red Alert2 compatibility issues with windows 7</h2>
                    Ive tried to run it on windows 7 with or without compatibility mode and when I hit the install button it quits out in a manner that i can only assume is crashing i was wondering if anyone has problems with this game and had any tips.

            You can use a Virtual Machine, but XP MODE that is available for Win7 Pro and Ultimate is not suitable for games as it does not do 3D. XP MODE is designed<br />
for legacy business application.<br />

Red Alert 2 was released in 2000. This makes it&nbsp; a borderline game re compatibility with Win 7, especially 64bit.<br />
<br />
But there is still hope -<br />
1) There may be a fan site with a fix for the installer that will make it compatible.<br />
I've found fixes for a couple of older games this way.<br />
The Compatibility Center is deeply flawed. Many games listed may need workarounds but are basically compatible with Win7 64bit.
<br />
<br />
2) I never install games to the default location Program Files (x86).<br />
This mainly&nbsp; avoids permissions issues that started with Vista, but I have found it can avoid other problems.
<br />
I tried an experiment with Doom 3 a while back. There was a post on these forums from someone&nbsp; having a problem installing, so I decided to blow the dust off and install.<br />
I tried the default location and my machine locked up with a black screen, requiring a re-boot. I tried installing several times, and finally tried installing on my game HDD. No problem, and no compatibility mode required.<br />
&nbsp;It was a bit of coincidence that this particular game had issues with the default location, but validates not installing&nbsp; to the default location.&nbsp; I've always used a separate Partition or HDD.<br />
If you can't do this just making a new folder in the C:\ may help with your game.<br />
<br />
3) If compatibility mode is going to work (rarely does, but rarely required) <br />
it is best installing using it.<br />
To install in compatibility mode&nbsp; close the install/setup screen after the CD autorun.<br />
Then&nbsp; go to - <span style="font-style: italic">Start/Compute</span>r&nbsp; then R/click on the DVD drive. Now, click
setup.exe&nbsp;</span> (or whatever the installer is called. It will be an .exe ) - then properties ,&nbsp; and set compatibility to&nbsp; XP sp2&nbsp; in this case .&nbsp; Tick run as administrator as well, just for luck.
<br />
Now start the install directly from the <span style="font-style: italic">setup.exe .</span><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Failing all of the above. if you are really keen on this game you may find a <br />
re-release version on Steam for as little as $10.<br />

            If you have only one Partition try making a new folder in you C:\ drive and try<br />
installing the game in a sub-folder there first (if you make a sub-folder then you can install more games to this new 'Game' folder later).
<br />
Program Files (x86) is integrated into Windows, and is a 'secure' folder, so<br />
making a new folder should&nbsp; have the same effect as a separate partition.<br />
Excerpt from Wiki - <span style="font-style: italic">"Some application installers reject spaces within the install path location"</span>
<br />
This may be why Doom 3, and some other games won't install to the default location ( Just a guess. All I really know is there can be problems).<br />
<br />
No guarantee it will work with your game. Games don't all respond the same.<br />
What size Hard Drive do you have, and how much data is on your HDD&nbsp; ?<br />
Go to Start &gt; Computer&nbsp; and look at the amount of available space on the HDD ( C:\) .
<br />
I've not made a new partition on a disk with data on a single partition already. <br />
Partitions can be made via Windows. -<br />
If you do decide to try and make a new Partition -<br />
Go to - Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Managment<br />
and find the&nbsp; Storage &gt; Disk Management tabs.<br />
Partitions can be created here. If there is unallocated space it is easy to<br />
create a new partition in that space, but I've not tried shrinking an existing<br />
single partitioned HDD. This is a bit more complex than when starting with a<br />
blank HDD as you have to worry about possible data loss.<br />
You can get instruction by clicking on the <span style="font-style: italic">Help</span> tab at the top of the Window.<br />
Go to Help Topics, click&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">Search</span>&nbsp; and the Window will show -&nbsp;
List Topics</span>, and read on.<br />
You may also&nbsp; want do do a search for some articles.<br />
<br />
There are also third party softwares made for partition managing, but to get<br />
one that has all features enabled you usually have to pay for the program.<br />
<br />
btw - Steam does not have RA2....<br />

            When you install games they give an option for 'custom' install (or similar term)<br />
you can then Browse to the folder of your choice wherever that may be, and install there.
<br />
Some game make a folder to install to but, I generally make a folder for the<br />
game before installing and then browse to that when I install just in case the<br />
game does not give that option. Things can get a bit messy if several games <br />
install&nbsp; without making their own&nbsp; folder as the files for different games get mixed&nbsp; in with one another.<br />
When the game starts to install if it says something like&nbsp; 'there is already a folder' just tell it to go ahead and install.<br />
<br />
If you make a new partition and don't want to keep it you can delete it&nbsp; and add<br />
that unallocated space back to the original Partition or merge it into the original.<br />
The instructions are there in the help and there are more<br />
articles on the i-net that detail the methods of partitioning a HDD.<br />
There's no harm in having another Partition especially with HDD's of 500GB or more.&nbsp; I have several partitions. It makes keeping things organised easier.<br />
It can take a while to work out the optimal Partition sizing for your needs, but<br />
having more than one huge partition can be handy.<br />
