            Hi KINGSMAN471
<br />
<br />BSOD's are generally caused by a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .       
        </p>

<h2>            Microsoft Windows 10 Updates - most inopportune timing</h2>
                    <p>When someone has to work, and make one's own repair tools for your unstable BCD and file system, the last thing they need to do is wait for you to&nbsp; Restart and then Update or Shut down and update.&nbsp; You don't give people the option to turn off the update
 mechanism until they need it.&nbsp; Push updates are a horrible idea.&nbsp; Please remove them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow people to separate the update and restart process and the update and shut down process.&nbsp;&nbsp; Allow people to choose when they apply updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, because certain firmware is not always applied by all manufacturers at the same time, forcing the update before one is ready means they get into a boot loop upon applying an update to Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a frequent problem.&nbsp; Updates should
 only be applied when someone is good and ready to update.&nbsp;&nbsp; People use their machines for mission critical functions, and they can't always update at your whim Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hello Abraham,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />You can use Group Policy to block automatic updates. This ensures updates are downloaded/installed only when you want them: 
<br />
<br />1. Open GPO snap-in by running gpedit.msc command.
<br />
<br />2. Go to Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Windows Update.
<br />
<br />3. Double click Configure Automatic Updates policy setting, select Enabled. Then under 'Configure automatic updating' section, choose 2 - Notify for download and notify for install.
<br />
<br />4. Click Apply, followed by OK. 
<br />
<br />Multiple reboots will finally disable auto updates.

            Thank you. &nbsp;I will definitely check this out. &nbsp; Oh by the way, &nbsp;a customer of mine with an HP did not apply the BIOS update for their machine, and then their digital signature failed on startup. &nbsp; We had to run a bcd edit command to reconnect to their
 computer. &nbsp; &nbsp; MIcrosoft needs to consult with every PC manufacturer, and make sure they share with it the BIOS updates that are created, so they can test for the BIOS update being present before applying updates. &nbsp;This will avoid issues with customers needing
 to bring in their machine to repair by a.person who understands the BCD.

<h3> 0p2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Beeping noises</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; This is a problem that has been bothering me ever since I have updated from Windows 8.1 64-bit to Windows 10 64-bit. Ever since I have updated, my computer always had sound and audio problems. For example, when I want to want to stream music I set the
 volume somewhat &nbsp;high and I always seem to hear a constant small buzzing sound and the sound lags whenever I switch between tabs. It is very annoying because even if I set the volume low I still hear the buzzing so I think whether I set the volume high or
 low doesn't matter. I tried seeing if &nbsp;my audio drivers needed updating in the Device Manager but they said I had the lastest version already; this is why I went to my system manufacturer's website (Toshiba) to see which audio driver I needed to install due
 to the fact that I may think my hardware is causing the problem. When I tried to be specific by using my serial number they didn't have the drivers I needed for my version of Windows. So, I went back and used the basic options and when I installed the driver
 I found it didn't work and I still heard the beeping noise. I recently went to my audio provider's website (Realtek) to find an update for my speakers: Realtek High Definition Audio. I still hear the buzzing! Even though I got a driver that was 64-bit and
 was Windows 10 compatible! I tried using 3 browsers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google Chrome 44.0.2403.155</p>
<p>Microsoft Edge</p>
<p>Firefox</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>For playing videos and music I used Youtube, Vimeo, and Dailymotion and they all consisted of the buzzing noise and the audio lag. I tried disable and re-enabling by speakers and my microphone and later I tried to uninstall and reinstall them along with
 my sound. That didn't help either :/ Is it a problem with my computer? Which correct drivers should I install? Thank you!</p>

            There are 2 places for Optional Features in Windows 10. I am not sure which one you are talking about.
<br />
<br />1. Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; Turn Windows features on or off &gt; Here you can remove by unchecking the concerned optional features
<br />
<br />2. Windows Key+I &gt; Apps &gt; Manage optional features &gt; Click the relevant optional feature and uninstall

            Hi
<br />
<br />Use the command line. There is no way to uninstall the packages using the user interface
<br />
<br />Try the following to obtain a list of all the optional functions installed:
<br />
<br />Dism / Online / Get-Packages       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Next, delete all packages in-gb in the reverse order of the dependency. In my case, I eliminated the following:
<br />
<br />
<br />Dism / Online / Remove-Package /PackageName:Microsoft-Windows-LanguageFeatures-OCR-en-gb-Package~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.16299.15

            Hi Michael, the built in apps in Windows 10 can be hard to remove . . .
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that will provide a list of those apps, then you can click Uninstall them using that utility

    <title>Driver Power State Failure &#43; ntoskrnl.exe &#40;Windows 8.1&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raybearz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver Power State Failure &#43; ntoskrnl.exe &#40;Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the&nbsp;past month,&nbsp;my laptop has been plagued with&nbsp;a&nbsp;problem. After&nbsp;doing much research online, I could not find a good solution, and so&nbsp;I have decided to&nbsp;explain the problem here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day, my laptop went from taking around 20 seconds to boot to taking over 5 minutes to boot. I do not remember if any&nbsp;specific event occurred&nbsp;before this happened. I definitely did not drop my laptop or do anything physical to the machine. Now, every
 boot takes over 5 minutes. Sometimes, the laptop will successfully boot, but many times, it will result in a blue screen that states: DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE. After the blue screen, the laptop will reboot, and will successfully boot in a much shorter time
 (around a minute).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time as the increased boot time, my laptop started having difficulties entering sleep mode when the lid was shut. Whenever I would shut the lid,&nbsp;not only would the laptop stay&nbsp;powered on, the fan would start running really fast and the laptop
 would become really hot until the battery was completely drained of power and the machine would shut off. There were many times when I was also not able to shut down the computer; the laptop would stay running with the screen dark&nbsp; for 5-10 minutes after I
 had&nbsp;selected the shut down function,&nbsp;so I would have to force power it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior seems to differ depending on whether I have the laptop charger connected or not. Without the charger connected, with the laptop running on battery power, the blue screens on boot and the inability to shut down the laptop seems to occur at a
 100% rate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minidump viewed with BlueScreenViewer&nbsp;shows that the blue screens are caused by something called ntoskrnl.exe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are the solutions I have tried so far, to no avail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Malwarebytes and AVG showed that there were no viruses on my&nbsp;laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I updated my laptop's drivers with Driver&nbsp;Booster, which did not fix the problem. There were 17 outdated drivers dating back to 2013-2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;I&nbsp;ran an sfc /scannow which said that there were corrupted files. I tried repairing them with System&nbsp;File Checker&nbsp;or something, but it could not repair the files. The corruption, which I have lost the exact details to, was something along the lines of
 amd64-something-something.&nbsp;I found a tool which claimed to have repaired the corruption, but the blue screens and long booting time persisted after the corruption was "fixed".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Without many other options, since I'm a computer novice, I decided to completely&nbsp;reinstall my OS using the reset function of Windows 8.1, in an attempt to reset all drivers to their original version, which would hopefully cause the problematic driver
 to revert to an older, working version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am, sitting in front of a brand new, completely blank Windows 8.1 laptop, and the laptop crashes on the first boot.&nbsp;I have booted the&nbsp;laptop twice without the charger, and it has blue screened twice, at the end of a&nbsp;5 minute boot time.&nbsp;The problem
 is still here on a blank operating system that was completely reset to its factory settings. I have an Asus UX32V laptop.&nbsp;Without any further options, I&nbsp;am hoping the wonderful community here can help me with this problem!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here&nbsp;are the two&nbsp;minidumps from BlueScreenView, after the factory reset of the laptop:</p>

            <p>I was able to install the Nvidia Graphics Driver and the Intel Rapid Storage Technology Driver. However, when I tried installing the Intel HD Graphics 4000 Driver from the link download, I got a message saying "This computer does not meet the minimum requirements
 for installing the software". I also ran into a similar problem when trying to download OneDrive from the Microsoft store. It said that "This app does not work on your device", and the download button was greyed out.

    <title>Store Apps Download Error 0x80070005 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Store Apps Download Error 0x80070005</h2>
                    <p>NOTHING Microsoft has posted works with the current Windows 10 to solve the problem of APPS NOT DOWNLOADING OR UPDATING from the Windows Store. After running several anti-malware and anti-virus apps from Microsoft and others, and after trying all of the
 suggestions from Microsoft, now NONE of the APPS on my ASUS G551JM notebook work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is outrageous and should be a major embarrassment to Microsoft, or it should be made to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should it be made to be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Microsoft for your prompt attention to this issue (first introduced days after Windows 10 was released, what, two years ago now?)</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Silvio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience and we understand the frustration when things don't go the way they supposed to. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To be able to assist you better, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you receive any relevant error messages?
</span><span>Also, are you using a Microsoft Account or a Local User account?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you check if the same issue occurs when you log in to Windows using a different Local Administrator user account?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you check if the date and time settings on your PC is set correct?&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check for the latest updates in Windows 10 which helps the PC&nbsp;to make optimal&nbsp;use of Windows 10 capabilities
 as well as fixing&nbsp;any missing&nbsp;links in performance of the operating system.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">To check for updates now, go to
<strong><span>Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update,</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Check for updates.</span></strong> If Windows Update says that your PC is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;follow the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A
<strong><span>clean boot</span></strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Disclaimer:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> Please go through the section: How to reset
 the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also,&nbsp;verify that you have disabled any other&nbsp;third party real-time antimalware products that were installed on your PC, to check if any how incoming/outgoing
 connections to the PC are affected by the firewall.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software
 can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done.
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to check if the status of the Windows Store Services&nbsp;is started and set as automatic.</p>
<p>1. Tab on <strong>Win+R, </strong>to open Run Command.</p>
<p>2. In the dialog box, type <strong>services.msc</strong></p>
<p>3. Here locate <strong>Windows Store Services</strong>, double click to open it.</p>
<p>4. Once&nbsp; done, click on the <strong>Start</strong> button and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, refer to the below link to&nbsp;run the <span><span><strong>Troubleshooter for Windows 10 apps</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, run the Microsoft Account troubleshooter from the below which automatically resolves sync issues in Windows.</p>

<h2>            Skype Immediately Hangs UP</h2>
                    <p>When making Skype to Skype calls it immediately hangs up after ringing for one second or so. I tried making a Skype to phone number call and that connected, but it's really a video Skype to Skype call that I need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like a few other people have had this problem recently as well and I've tried all the steps listed under those questions but nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a Surface Book with Windows 10. Windows and Skype are both up to date. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

 at the Cannon website that you can install for the Windows 7. You can download the drivers from the Cannon website. Follow the below link to download the drivers:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Hello ahven,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microsoft does not provide the drivers for any devices , the devices manufacturers’ are responsible for providing the drivers. However,
 if it’s a USB device, most of the drivers are install automatically. Like the camera, should be recognized when you install the software.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you connect the camera to a different computer and check if it is detected. Also try to reinstall the software for
 camera.</span></span></p>

            DCP CONNECT is a Canon factory service mode.&nbsp; Only Canon and place a camera in and remove a camera from this mode.&nbsp; Contact them and they should provide you with a pre-paid shipping label to send it to them.

            To Irfan and Ahven : got the same problem, drivers downloaded from Canon's website don't work. Sent Canon a mail decribing the problem. They probably got shaken up by the recent quake. Awaiting details. Anybody ??<br />

            You can't downgrade to Windows 7 without a legit key. Your hardware may not even have drivers for Windows 7. You'll have to find a place to purchase Windows 7.

            You said you got it off another computer. You also said that the error messages said "key already used". The error message makes it quite clear you have to get another key, the one you have isn't transferable.

<h2>            Using a third-party virus&#47;malware app with windows defender.</h2>
                    Does anyone know if there is a way to use a third-party virus/malware protection like Bytefence in conjunction with Windows Defender WITHOUT turning off similar features in Windows Defender? The problem is that Windows Defender shows that "actions are
 needed", and displays a red x on the taskbar. I want to make sure that I'm not leaving myself open to problems.

            Hi Colin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you install another anti-virus it will shut off Defender.  Most others will also cause issues with performance so I would not recommend any other than Malwarebytes on-demand scanner for a second opinion.  
<br />
<br />See here for handling ghost Defender notifications:

<br />My name is Alex. I am an - Independent Consultant.
<br />It is an honor to respond to your participation in the Microsoft community!
<br />
<br />Here you can see what happen if you install a third party virus/malware app with windows defender

<br />
<br />"actions are needed" is a notification from Windows defender to do an action, so is important to see this notification.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this does not work or if you've tried this already. 
<br />

<p>You should never have more than one anti-virus program running at once. Doing so can slow down your computer and also potentially cause problems as they interfere with each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can and should add MalwareBytes AntiMalware to your arsenal.</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />IMO, two security programs (AVs) with same feature would conflict each other. If you want to continue with other AV program, you can disable real-time protection in Windows Defender/Security. 
<br />
<br />To disable real-time protection in Windows Defender/Security, try these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Open Registry Editor by running regedit command.
<br />
<br />2. Go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Real-Time Protection.
<br />
<br />3. Set DisableRealtimeMonitoring registry DWORD to 1.
<br />
<br />4. Close Registry Editor and restart your system.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<p>As has been said, when you install a 3rd party Anti-Virus Windows should automatically disable Defender to prevent conflicts between</p>
<p>it and the program you install. </p>
<p>Running two Anti-Virus software concurrently has always had potential to cause problems, but you can run manual scans with</p>
<p>a second AV\Malware program as a cross check if you feel something is infected.
</p>
<p>It's said that Malware scanners such as Malwarebytes check for different code that AV's do, but the distinction has been blurred
</p>
<p>a bit in the past few years with AV's also doing checks for malware and ransomeware.</p>
<p>Similarly there are Spyware\Addware programs that focus more on those pests than do AV\Malware programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use 3rd party security do some research and decide for yourself which you want to use. They are all pretty close in</p>
<p>their capability, but Bitdefender does&nbsp; tend to come out on top with many tests\reviews.</p>
<p>People will advise against pretty much every non-MS AV, but Windows Defender is&nbsp; just another AV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tread your own path.&nbsp; I've used Avast since around 2005 with no issues other than occasional false positives.
</p>
<p>I have never had a malware\virus. Partly&nbsp; because I run an AV full time and keep it up to date, and also because I am very cautious
</p>
<p>with email and don't use torrent download sites.&nbsp; Vigilance is still the best defence regardless of which AV you use.<br />

                    <p>so now i have to manually set 5.1 for movies etc and stereo for youtube etc. i've tried uninstalling the receiver from device manager (its a home theater system) but that didn't work, i don't have any restore points either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i try "test" when set to 5.1 in playback devices i get the "failed to play test tone" error, the speakers still work on 5.1 signal but not on stereo. if i set to stereo everything works but of course no 5.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so there we have it, i broke something when i changed configuration and i don't know how to fix it. i'd really appreciate some help with this.</p>

            hey thanks for the reply, what I did was factory reset bot the receiver and the tv which didn't work at first but leaving the receiver of seemed to do the trick as the issue seems to be fixed after I turned it back on after a long break.

</p><p><strong>Trade-In Alternative - <em>Results May Vary</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Another alternative is to contact support with this issue, link this thread, and request a replacement trade-in. The precedent is unit for unit straight across, you will have to purchase your own keyboard, power, and stylus outside of the trade-over. For
 me, the trade was straight across one Surface RT 64gb for a Surface 3 (standard) with 64gb hdd. I had to pay for my own power supply. In order to do this you must make contact with your nearest Microsoft Store, specify what has already been done, reference
 this thread and/or Microsoft Request number 1370470353. Your Surface RT MUST BE FUNCTIONAL! They are not going to give you a trade for a non-functional device, so please don't waste their time trying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also entirely possible that they were merely pitying me for having spent five weeks trying to resolve issue, and only right after I had arranged my trade was Wayhem's post made, so I did not have the opportunity to test it.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: Perform Clean boot.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Check this issue in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot state.</a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Disable security software temporarily.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The third party firewalls from the security software may&nbsp;hinder the installation. So, we would suggest you to temporarily disable the security software and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            <p>There are no non-microsoft services running on this machine. </p>
<p>This is a clean installation of 8.1 RT from the onboard image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no startup items running on this machine either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every boot is a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Store said "There is an update available" then said No updates available after I clicked update. This is running stock image plus whatever updates run automatically afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last update check ran for 20 hours without ever deciding that there were no new udpates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most recent check for updates is marked as: Never</p>
<p>Updates were installed is marked as: Never</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates&nbsp;<em>have</em> run. Windows update appears to be the problem here, tied to whatever is up with the MS Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>I have attempted to stop/start the wuauserv and net bits.</p>
<p>This does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>Is there a way to use powershell to force the 8.1 RT Update 3?</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2808380</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be the problem. Unfortunately, Windows Update doesn't work to let me install this update to let windows update work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can this update be downloaded to a USB drive and manually done?<br />
edit<br />
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/storage-files-and-folders/create-a-recovery-drive?os=windows-8.1-rt-update-3&amp;=undefined</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently you can build a recovery 8.1 usb thumbdrive with update 3.</p>
<p>But only on the device that cant download anything because the updates are broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>Ok. So I managed to create a recovery drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing. Nothing happens. I get into startup, choose recovery from USB. It reboots back to the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>Is there an image that I can download that is Windows RT 8.1 Update 3 that I can slap onto a thumbdrive and load?</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>Mysteriously, status is now 'Installs - Windows RT 8.1 'Pending...'</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit</p>
<p>Going on 20 minutes on 'Pending'&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Wondering if there's ever to be an additional response from you Microsoft folks on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After putting the newest image (SurfaceRT_BMR_10.8.17.0) on via USB, I am at the exact same point I was at last Saturday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Store: "Your purchase couldn't be completed</p>
<p>
</p><p>This app can't be purchased because your Internet connection is slow. Please try again using a different connection."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is yet another FRESH image with all of the updates that come in automatically.<br />
Same issue all over again. My have 60+mbps internet. I just finished downloading 5 gb (ish) worth of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now store wants to tell me my internet is slow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all of the updates that have finally been run, I am also not seeing "Windows RT 8.1 Update 3" like I would see on any other windows machine (EG Windows 7 Service Pack 1).</p>

<p>It forces me to update even the weather app, then the store just sits and spins and spins and spins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you guys need from me and this machine to diagnose what is going on? There is nothing amiss in device manager. There are no errors popping up. Event viewer shows nothing but information. There is no sign of a hardware issue anywhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an OS issue. An OS issue that apparently cannot be resolved even by a full wipe.&nbsp;This thing loads fine. Is fast. Is clean. Is in nearly perfect condition in that I had to pull a screw from a corner to fix the stand (one of the screws fell out), and
 the only problem is your OS that won't function, and how it ties together with the Store application and inability to update outside of the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you guys are not going to support this, or cannot support this, then please send us a replacement surface that you can/will support.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Marshall MXL 990 USB Microphone Crashes Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lynnbird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Marshall MXL 990 USB Microphone Crashes Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an MXL 990 USB mic for desktop recording.</p>
<p>The package encouraged the user to download software</p>
<p>based pre-amp and recording applications. Here are the links</p>
<p>to the downloads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Soft pre-amp: <a href="http://www.mxlmics.com/products/900_series/990_USB/990_USB.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mxlmics.com/products/900_series/990_USB/990_USB.html</a></p>
<p>Recorder software: <a href="http://www.mxlmics.com/products/USB/software.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mxlmics.com/products/USB/software.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only installed these apps because Windows 7 failed to install a driver for the mic;</p>
<p>so I thought the manufacturer's apps would solve the driver problem.&nbsp; Instead, not</p>
<p>only did the installation attempt crash my system, but Windows now crashes every</p>
<p>time I connect the mic to the USB port.&nbsp; I've uninstalled both apps and the crash still</p>
<p>occurs on connection. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>I have found an extremely strange workaround for this problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I plugged in a USB Audio device (an Internet Telephone) which</strong></p>
<p><strong>was recognized and installed by Windows 7.&nbsp; While that device</strong></p>
<p><strong>was plugged in, I plugged in the MXL 990, which was then suddenly</strong></p>
<p><strong>recognized as a USB Microphone.&nbsp; I then disabled the USB Telephone</strong></p>
<p><strong>without unplugging it.&nbsp; The microphone was able to record only as</strong></p>
<p><strong>long as the telephone was also plugged in; plus the telephone disabled</strong></p>
<p><strong>the analog speakers.&nbsp; This inability to hear through speakers did not</strong></p>
<p><strong>occur when the mic was plugged into the Vista Retail machine.&nbsp; In the</strong></p>
<p><strong>morning, I will disable the Internet Telephone as a listening device to</strong></p>
<p><strong>see if that will allow the analog speakers to re-activate.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>If anyone can come up with a better solution, please post to this thread,</strong></p>
<p><strong>which I am now marking as having had an answer proposed.<br />

<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Welcome to my unofficial Xbox 360 Networking Guide. This guide started as a summary of frequently asked questions that appeared on the Australian Xbox
 Live forums, and over the years has developed with the assistance of community members asking questions that were not in the original guide. This has led to a much, much, longer and more detailed guide. With the release of the new Xbox forums, I have updated
 it yet again to include pictures and revised several sections with more in-depth tutorials.</span></span>
<p><span><span>As always, if you have any questions that are not answered, or there are any errors, please post on the thread or contact me directly via PM or
 via Xbox Live. Your feedback helps to develop more informative documentation which will hopefully help others in the future.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When writing this guide, I aimed at providing assistance for people with a diverse range of technical skills. As a result there are sections which
 are fairly basic and written to provide an introduction to networking, which leads to some more advanced troubleshooting techniques, and most sections will reference others for clarification.
<br />
<br />
This will hopefully assist in developing a wider awareness of networking and troubleshooting techniques. As the old saying goes: "'Give a man a fish and he'll eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he'll eat for a lifetime".&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is a network?</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><br />
</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A&nbsp;'Network'&nbsp;is a term commonly used to describe two or more computing devices linked together to share information.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are a lot of networking types, including Local Area Networks (LAN), Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN), and Wide Area Networks (WAN). This guide
 only covers LANs, using wired Ethernet and Wireless. A LAN is generally a network used in a home or small/medium business scenario.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Networking is governed by protocols, or 'rules'. These rules ensure that a standard 'language' is achieved so different devices can talk to one another and understand what each is saying. The most common LAN protocol is TCP/IP, which is the one we will cover.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Although you don't need to know how TCP/IP works, it may be handy to know that it takes data and breaks it down into small chunks called packets (or datagrams). These packets contain information such as the destination, size and the data itself, which are sent
 to the destination device over the network. The packet has a maximum size, but can be altered by setting the&nbsp;MTU&nbsp;(see Q11).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are Wireless Local Area Networks (WiFi)?</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><br />
</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>WiFi once stood for Wireless Fidelity, and referred to Wireless b standard networks. It has now been adopted as a general terminology for all Wireless
 Ethernet LANs, and is no longer considered to be an acronym.&nbsp;Wireless LANs are networks which operate on Wireless Radio Frequencies (similar to walkie-talkies or CB-Radios).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A base-station (or access-point) is connected to a wired network, and is used to send and receive data between the wired network and the wireless devices.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
There are a variety of wireless standards a/b/g/n, although we only cover g and n standards:<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Has a reported indoor range of 35-38 meters, not taking into account interference from walls, electrical devices etc.&nbsp;</span></span></span>
</li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Reported transfer speed for Wireless G is 54Mbps</span></span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">&nbsp;Wireless N:<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Uses MIMO (multiple in, multiple out). It uses multiple antennae to broadcast and receive signals.</span></span></span>
</li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Has a reported range of up to 70m indoors with Channel Bonding Enabled (35-38 without), not taking into account environmental interference.&nbsp;</span></span></span>
</li><li><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Reported transfer speed of 300Mbps, although speeds around 190Mbps are more common.&nbsp;</span></span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<br />
Wireless networks are baseband, which means that only one signal can be sent at a time. The network's bandwidth is divided among the number of devices connected to the network (eg 3 devices connected to 190Mbps Wireless Network would result in 63.3Mbps connection
 speeds per device).&nbsp;The more devices connected to a wireless network, the longer each device has to wait to send data, which results in congestion and slower performance.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
WiFi uses CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access&nbsp;Collision Avoidance) to prevent collision of data packets being sent across the network by only allowing one device to send data at a time. It's easiest to think of WiFi as a 'talking stick' as other devices
 must wait for the talking stick before they can send data.&nbsp;</span></span> </p>

<p><span><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>What are Wired Networks?</b></span></p>
<p><span><b><br />
</b></span></p>
<p><span>Wired Networks are devices connected together via a cable. There are a few standards available, the most common being a&nbsp;10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet connection. The newest standard in home networking is
 100/1000mbps Ethernet (or Gigabit Ethernet), which is not supported by the Xbox 360, although 100/1000mbps is backwards compatible and will throttle the speed to match the device.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Wired networks use CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access&nbsp;Collision Detection). This basically means that multiple devices can talk at once (no talking stick!). If packets of data 'collide' on the
 network a jamming signal is sent. All devices stop transmitting before resuming normal operation.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Wired 10/100Mbps has an optimal transfer speed of 100Mbps. Unlike wireless, all devices maintain the highest internal network speed, with the internet bandwidth being the main cause for internet latency, if another device is sharing the same network connection.</span></p>

<p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </b><b>What is the difference between a modem, router, switch and hub?</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p><span><span>A&nbsp;<b><span style="color: rgba(50, 205, 50, 1)">wired modem&nbsp;</span></b>is a device that is used to connect a device to the internet. Older dialup modems were inbuilt
 into some computers, and are not recommended for Xbox Live. Many DSL/ADSL modems incorporate a switch, allowing multiple devices to share the internet connection and are referred to as a modem/router.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A<span style="color: rgba(50, 205, 50, 1)">&nbsp;<b>switch</b></span>&nbsp;is a device which allows multiple users to connect to a network. The network may or may not be connected to the internet. A switch is generally viewed as superior to a hub, as any packets of data that it receives
 are sent only to the device it was addressed to. This also increases security.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(50, 205, 50, 1)"><b>h</b><b>ub</b></span>&nbsp;is a device similar to a switch, allowing multiple devices to connect to a network. The hub may or may not be connected to the internet. The main issue with hubs is they create unnecessary congestion, by
 broadcasting packets to all devices connected, decreasing security.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A
<b><span style="color: rgba(50, 205, 50, 1)">router</span></b> is the basic building block of the internet. Routers are a special-purpose device designed to interconnect networks, passing data from its source network to the destination network. Each router maintains a 'routing
 table', which is essentially an address book, containing information on network locations. A router will examine each packet of data, and compare the destination address with the routing table. If the router knows where to send the packet, it will forward
 on the data. If there is no information in the routing table for the destination, the router will drop the packet. Today, routers are generally built into many home DSL modems.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have a modem, which has only a single Ethernet port, you can expand the amount of ports by purchasing a separate switch or wireless router. The internet connection can then be shared between multiple devices on the wired or wireless network.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>5. What are the differences between Cat5, Cat5e, Cat6, Straight through and Crossover Cables?</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Microsoft commonly refers to RJ-45 Cat-5 cable, simply as "network cable", which can be confusing when people go out and purchase the cables.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Network cables come in all sorts, such as Coaxial, RJ-45 STP/UTP, Fibre Optic etc. The Xbox 360 uses RJ-45 Cat5/5e/6 cable, so you don't have to worry about the other cabling types. The cables come in a range of colours and lengths- so to save confusion they
 can generally be identified by the writing on the cable jacket.</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi755.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx194%2fOrbytel%2fnetwork%2520guide%2fcat5e.jpg" /></span></p>
<p><span><span>To rule out any misunderstandings regarding the different category RJ-45 cables, Category 5 (Cat-5) cable is used for 10/100mbps networks, and Cat5e/6
 was developed for newer 100/1000mbps networks. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Xbox 360 Ethernet adaptor is 10/100mbps, but can use all cable types as Cat5e/6 cable is backwards compatible.&nbsp;A Cat5/5e/6 cable can be connected
 directly into the Ethernet port on the Xbox 360. The other end is typically plugged into a switch, hub or modem/router.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
Straight through (standard patch) cables are just as they sound. A cable which has two identical plugs on both ends, and is suitable for all purposes, with the exception of system-linking original Xbox consoles, two computers etc. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi755.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx194%2fOrbytel%2fnetwork%2520guide%2fstraightthrough.jpg" /></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Cro</span>ssover cables have wiring which is ordered differently each end, and allows for two devices (such as two original Xbox consoles or computers) to be directly connected to one another without the use of a switching device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi755.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx194%2fOrbytel%2fnetwork%2520guide%2fcrossover.jpg" /></p>
<p>The Xbox 360 is an exception to the above rule, as it uses autosensing crossover detectors. This allows you to use either a Straight through or Crossover cable to system-link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When purchasing a network cable for your Xbox 360 console, there is no sense in purchasing the more expensive Cat-6 cables, as you will achieve the same performance with the cheaper Cat5/5e cables and, depending on the length,
 there can be a significant price difference.</p>

<p><b>6. Which are better, Wired or Wireless networks?</b><br />
<br />
<span><span>Wired networks have always been viewed as superior to wireless networks, as they are considered faster and more reliable.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
The introduction of&nbsp;Wireless N&nbsp;has increased the range and speed of wireless technologies, theoretically shortening the gap between the two standards, but is still restricted to the 'talking stick' method (See
 Q2<b>)</b>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a result, the more devices connected to your wireless network, the more congested your network will become. Wireless is also highly susceptible to interference from electrical devices such as microwaves, cordless phones, as well as walls, furniture etc.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are only able to use wireless for your Xbox 360 networking- there are a few things you can do to improve performance:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Try and restrict the number of walls, doors and furniture between your Xbox 360 and the Access Point.</span></span></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Disconnect devices which do not need to be connected to your wireless network (including mobile phones, laptops etc).&nbsp;</span></span></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Try not to download or transfer large files across your network on other devices while playing on Xbox Live or streaming media.</span></span></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>If using a Wireless N adaptor, enable Channel Bonding.</span></span></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Turn off, or try not to use electrical devices, such as microwaves, clothes dryers etc. that may interfere with your wireless signal while playing
 on Xbox Live or streaming media (microwave the popcorn BEFORE watching the movie!).</span></span></span>

&nbsp;<br />
There are a few alternate options available to you, including Wireless G gateways and print servers. These devices plug into your Ethernet port on the Xbox 360, and act as an 'interpreter' between your wireless network and the Xbox 360. These devices are not
 supported by Microsoft.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Third party adaptors were once an appealing alternative to some people, who were not comfortable purchasing an official Wireless G Adaptor for AU$149.95.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Today, the official Wireless G adaptors can be purchased for less than most of the 3rd party adaptors, and the official&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-AU/Xbox360/Accessories/CablesNetworking/Xbox360WirelessNNetworkingAdapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>Wireless N adaptors</b></a>&nbsp;offer

<p><span><span><b>9. How do I test my Xbox Live Connection?</b>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Testing your Xbox Live connection is an excellent tool for troubleshooting, as it will not only identify where a problem may be occurring, but will
 also alert you to connection issues such as NAT restrictions. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can perform an Xbox Live Connection Test by following these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Test Xbox Live Connection:
</b></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Turn on your console, press the
<b>Guide</b> button on your controller and browse to the far right tab. </span></span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Select
<b>System Settings</b></span></span></span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Select
<b>Network Settings</b></span></span></span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Select either the
<b>Wired Network</b> or <b>Wireless Network</b> you are connecting to</span></span></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span>Select
<b>Test Xbox Live Connection</b></span></span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>You will be prompted to sign out of Xbox Live while the test is performed. If there are any issues during the test, you will receive an error message.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span><span><b>10. What is NAT, and why is mine strict (or moderate)?</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are: experiencing severe latency while playing online games; having trouble joining games or other players chat is silent or garbled, you may be experiencing a NAT problem. You can check this by using the
Xbox 360's connection test utility (Q9<b>)</b>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b><span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)">NAT</span></b> (Network Address Translation) was developed in response to the lacking number of IP addresses available on the internet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All servers for mail, websites, file servers etc. have an IP address- (e.g. 192.167.0.1) but the addresses have started running out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
As a quick fix, NAT was introduced, to allow multiple users to share the one IP address. The idea is that a packet is sent to an address, and when it arrives is redirected to its actual address (and vice versa).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Xbox Live doesn't like NAT, as it causes numerous issues. To fix the issue, there are a few steps you can take. If you are experiencing problems with your network, you should always try the simplest solution first. This includes power cycling and checking for
 conflicting devices on your network. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><b>Power-cycling/ Checking for conflicting devices:</b></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Turn off all your networking hardware, and any devices connected to it (including your PC etc).&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Wait 2-3 minutes, and then turn your modem/router back on.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Turn on your Xbox 360, while leaving all other devices on the network turned off.
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Perform the
Xbox Live Connection Test.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>If the connection test is successful, continue to 6. If you are still experiencing issues
please see <b>Q13.
<br />
</b></span></span></li><li><span><span>Progressively turn on all your devices that utilise the network connection, waiting approximately 1-2 minutes between each device. This gives the network devices a chance
 to talk to one another and establish a connection.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Perform the
Xbox Live Connection Test again&nbsp;</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>If you are still experiencing issues, your issue may be caused by blocked ports. A solution for this issue can be found at

<p><span><span><b>11. What is MTU, and why is it stopping me from connecting to Xbox Live?&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
MTU is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 0, 1)">M</span><span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 0, 1)">aximum Transmission Unit</span></span>, and refers to the maximum size of the datagram or 'packet' being sent over the network. All routers or devices will have
 an MTU set (including your Xbox 360). The largest size of a packet for TCP/IP is&nbsp;1500.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Each time a datagram passes through a router, it must be smaller or equal to its MTU.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you set the MTU too high, it will have to be fragmented, which will eventually result in congestion and/or dropped (lost) packets, resulting in a bad connection. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Alternatively, if you set the MTU too low, you will be sending an unnecessary amount of packets, resulting in congestion and a bad connection.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you are receiving errors when attempting to connect to Xbox Live, first check to make sure your MTU on your Xbox 360 is set around 1460. Personally, I
&nbsp;<br />
If you still receive errors, check your router's settings, and make sure that the Xbox 360's settings and your routers settings both have matching MTU. This will prevent any unnecessary fragmentation.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you are having issues trying to find the settings in your modem/router, post here with your model number and we can try and help you out.&nbsp;</span><span><br />

<p><span><span><b>12. What is an IP Address, and what's the difference between Static and Dynamic (DHCP)?</b><br />
<br />
An IP address is an&nbsp;</span> </span><span><span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)">Internet Protocol Address</span>, and is similar to your house address. It is used in conjunction with the physical MAC address of a device to
 determine where a data packet should be sent.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)">Static IP Address</span>&nbsp;is an address that is reserved for a particular device. This is set both on the device, and on the router. Static IP addresses are handy if you want to open ports for a certain device, but not for others.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)">Dynamic IP Address</span>&nbsp;is assigned when a device connects to the network. This is useful if you have multiple devices connecting to your network, which do not require any in-depth configuration.&nbsp;</span><br />

<p><span><span><b>13. What is a firewall, and how to I open the ports needed for an Xbox Live Connection?</b>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The easiest way to define a firewall is as a hardware device or software program designed to inspect network traffic and either allow traffic to pass through or deny and block
 according to a set of rules. This is similar to the door on your house- which keeps out any unwanted guests. The purpose for a firewall is very simple- protect the network or computer from outside access.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi755.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx194%2fOrbytel%2fnetwork%2520guide%2ffirewalldoor.jpg" /></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Firewalls can be standalone, but are more commonly incorporated into home modem/routers. For a firewall to be effective, it must be configured properly,
 and unfortunately most home users are unaware of the firewall settings built into their devices, relying on the default settings.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While the default settings are generally setup for basic protection, this can pose an issue for services such as Xbox Live, which utilises several
 ports usually blocked by firewalls. This can result in a reported strict or moderate NAT (see Q8), poor network performance, inability to connect to online games, and
 quiet or garbled voice chat.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To fix these issues, it is as simple as opening the ports:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)"><b>TCP 80<br />
UDP 88<br />
UDP 3074<br />
TCP 3074<br />
UDP 53<br />
TCP 52 </b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)"><b><br />
</b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This can be done through your modem/router web interface, by following these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On your Windows PC, hit the Start/Windows button, and type in
<b>cmd </b>in the text box. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Make a note of the
<b>Default Gateway</b> address, which can be used to access the web interface of your modem/router.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the address into your web browser address bar, and login using the username and password provided with your hardware (either on the bottom
 of the modem/router or in the documentation provided). The default username and password are both generally
<b>admin</b>, although this differs with some manufacturers. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><b>15. Can I use my laptop's wireless LAN/ Internet connection to connect to Xbox Live?</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Yes!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can use your Windows PC and Internet Connection Sharing (ICS) to enable your Xbox 360 to connect to Xbox Live using your PC's Internet connection.&nbsp;Before starting, make sure that your Xbox 360 console is not yet connected to your computer.
</span></span></p>

<p><b>1<span><span>7. Media Sharing from your Windows PC.&nbsp;</span></span></b><span><span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate and Windows 7 operating systems include a&nbsp;program called Windows Media Centre.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The idea of&nbsp;Windows Media Center, is that it acts as a server for all of your media, sharing your libraries with your Xbox 360 as an 'extender'. Windows Media Center&nbsp;also allows you to stream Live TV, as well as pause, rewind and record Live TV directly to
 your computer from the comfort of your couch. Please note that in order to use the Live TV feature, your computer will require a TV Capture Card. These cards can be purchased as add-ons, and allow you to plug an aerial cable from into your computer to receive
 an analogue or digital TV signal (depending on what services are available to your area). &nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;There are often a lot of questions regarding setup of Windows Media Center, so after you have followed the following, free to post and ask away.</span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On your Windows PC, click the
<b>Start/Windows</b> button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on
<b>All Programs </b>and then select <b>Windows Media Center</b>. On Windows XP, select
<b>All Programs&gt; Accessories&gt;Media Center. </b>Alternatively, you can just type <i>
Windows Media Center<b> </b></i>into the search bar on the Start menu. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is your first time using Windows Media Center, you have the choice of either selecting
<b>Express setup</b> or <b>Custom setup.</b> If you have already setup Windows Media Center, go to Q4.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>*Express setup will automatically add your media libraries to Windows Media Center, and (if a TV Capture Card is installed) will download the information
 for your Live TV service. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>*Custom setup will check for networking/ internet connections and will give you the options to setup additional features. These include choosing
 optimal display, speakers, media libraries and TV tuners if one is installed. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you initially choose Custom setup, you can always customise your settings within Windows Media Center by selecting
<b>Tasks&gt;Settings.</b> If you wish to run the entire setup process again, you can select
<b>Tasks&gt;Settings&gt;General&gt;Windows Media Center Setup&gt; Run Setup Again</b></span></span>
</p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once your Windows Media Center has been setup, go to
<b>Tasks&gt;add extender. </b>Click <b>Next</b>, and when prompted to enter an 8-digit setup key head over to your Xbox 360 console.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn on your Xbox 360 console, and press the
<b>Guide </b>button on your controller.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi755.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fxx194%2fOrbytel%2fnetwork%2520guide%2fguidebutton.jpg" /><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scroll right to the
<b>Media Tab</b> and then choose <b>Windows Media Center.</b></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select
<b>Continue</b> and you will be prompted with an 8-digit number. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go back to your PC, and continue setup by entering in the number given above. Click
<b>Next </b>&nbsp;and follow the on-screen prompts to complete the setup process. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If your Xbox 360 console has previously been setup with another computer to user Windows Media Center, or to remove an Xbox 360 console or other extender from your Windows

<b>18. How does Xbox Live affect my Download Speeds and Cap/Quota?</b></span><span><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is like asking how long a piece of string is. Your usage is entirely&nbsp;dependent on what your Xbox Live activities involve.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Obviously if you download demos, DLC, stream Zune HD etc. your usage will exceed someone who only plays the occasional multiplayer game.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Most Internet Service Providers provide a toolbox with a usage meter. Next time you're online, make a note of your usage before and after your gaming session.&nbsp; Be sure to check that no other devices are&nbsp;sharing your internet connection, or your readings will
 be incorrect.&nbsp;</span></span></span> <span><span><span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you notice that you are eating through your monthly cap rather quickly, you may want to consider an ISP which doesn't monitor your Xbox Live usage. iiNet is an Australian ISP who include a Freezone in their plans. This Freezone excludes most of your Xbox
 Live usage from your cap. Be careful though, as some things such as Zune HD and Foxtel are not included in the Freezone</span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span><span><b><span>19.</span> How does Foxtel on Xbox 360 work?&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
<span><i>Foxtel on Xbox 360</i></span></span><span>
<span>&nbsp;is a service that allows many Australian users to view Foxtel on their Xbox 360 console. Currently there are 30 Live TV Channels available, with several packages. More information on pricing and packaged
 can be viewed&nbsp;<a href="http://www.foxtel.com.au/xbox/packages/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>here.</b></a><br />
<br />
This service requires a minimum 1.5mbps Internet connection, Xbox Live for Foxtel on Demand and/or an Xbox Live Gold subscription for Channel Packages.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
The approximate data usage for viewing one hour of Live TV is:&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
<br />
Medium Quality: 540MB*</b><b><br />
<br />
Low Quality: 360MB*</b></span></span><span><br />
<br />
For Catch Up TV and Foxtel On Demand data, the information is displayed on-screen prior to downloading the content.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
At present, some users are reporting that Telstra Bigpond users are experiencing unmetered usage from Foxtel on Xbox 360. This is yet to be officially confirmed by Telstra, and not all users are reporting unmetered usage.&nbsp;</span><span><br />

<p><span><span><b>20. What is the difference between a Mb and a MB?</b><br />
<br />
This might sound like an unusual question, but it is often the source for confusion regarding download speeds and quotas.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
A&nbsp;Mb is a Megabit, and is commonly used when describing internet and network transfer speeds.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
A&nbsp;MB is a Megabyte, which is used to describe file sizes etc.&nbsp;</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;There are 8 bits to 1 byte. A theoretical example would be a network speed of 100mbps(Megabits), which would transfer 12.5MB/ps (Megabytes).<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="color: rgba(102, 204, 51, 1)"><b>100/ 8 = 12.5</b></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
ISP connection speeds for example, advertise ADSL2+ plans with a 25Mb download speed. People expect to receive a 25 Megabyte download speed, where in fact they should expect a maximum of 3.124Megabytes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;Please keep in mind that those speeds are completely theoretical, and I am yet to meet a person who actually achieves those speeds, as it is dependent on your location, grade and quality of wiring
 etc</span></span> </p>

<h2>            Installing Adobe 8 Professional on Windows 10 is asking for vista.dll files.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Adobe 8 Professional work with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running Adobe 8 Professional on Windows XP &amp; 7. </p>
<p>I bought a new computer with Windows 8 and tried installing my Adobe 8 Professional and it keeps asking to install the vista.dll.&nbsp; So I recently upgraded to Windows 10 thinking it may be more like Windows 7 and the Adobe 8 Professional would work and it
 still doesn't.&nbsp; It continue to ask me to browse my system to find the vista.dll. Can anyone help?</p>
