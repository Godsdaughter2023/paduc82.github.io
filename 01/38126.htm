            <p>First check whether settings just need adjusting. Second try updating or reinstalling the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) At "<strong>START, Settings, Devices, Mouse &amp; touchpad</strong>", click "<strong>Additional mouse settings</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mouse Properties opens - but it also has Touchpad controls.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98501d27-a995-45de-b4fc-ea1f9fd69675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/98501d27-a995-45de-b4fc-ea1f9fd69675" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Click the Touchpad tab, then click the "<strong>Click to change touchpad settings</strong>" button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your HP touchpad/mouse interface should open. Ensure Gestures are ON.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcb5fd71-22c5-453b-9b56-1f2c6df79938" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcb5fd71-22c5-453b-9b56-1f2c6df79938" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) If that fails to be a cure, type "Hardware &amp; devices" into the search box for its troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(4) If that fails to be a cure, the Hardware tab of the Mouse Properties, will allow you to update the touchpad driver. Or it can be done in Device Manager...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) R-Clk START, &amp; select "Device Manager".</p>
<p>(b) Open the "Mice &amp; other pointing devices" branch,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &amp; double-click the Touchpad under it for its Properties.</p>
<p>(c) Click the "Update Driver" button, &amp; then click "search automatically..."</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece677ad-0358-4341-b77d-9fbc75d05d1f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece677ad-0358-4341-b77d-9fbc75d05d1f" /></a></p>

<p>(5) If that fails to be a fix, try reinstalling the Touchpad...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Right-click the Touchpad in Device Manager, &amp; select "Uninstall".</p>
<p>(b) Reboot, &amp; it will reinstall automatically.</p>

<h2>            Citrix Receiver - Incompatible with Connected Standby and reduces battery life</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface battery life seemed to be diminishing. Running Powercfg was throwing ENERGY&nbsp;errors and the Sleepstudy was looking abysmal.
</p>
<p>I reset my Surface Pro and reinstalled my trusted apps, left if for a few days of use and ALL the errors had gone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a System Restore Point and installed Citrix Receiver 4.2 (latest). The errors returned. Notably the Marvell Network Card was unable to enter selective suspend state.
</p>
<p>Once I had reverted to the System Restore Point the error messages went. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I started this process because the USB Hub was also on 100% during sleep. I suspect Citrix makes some changes there as well but I didn't try as it seemed immaterial
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have put the app store version on my machine but this doesn't show the apps that I want to access - I will need to ask the Ops guys if they know why.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a social way to connect Citrix whilst retaining InstantGo / Connected standby and maintaining battery life? ps I couldn't download the HTML5 version of the receiver so I don't know if this will help.
</p>
<p>

                    I have Family Tree Maker 2008. My computer has Windows 7. FTM says it is not connected to the internet no matter what I do. Is that due to Windows 7?

            Hi suhisuhaas1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I am assuming you are able to get into your computer. If not, do let me know.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

    <title>Madden 15 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spiit rhymes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Madden 15</h2>
                    
<p>I told myself I wouldn't buy another Madden after the absolute joke of a game called Madden 25. Gameplay was horribly unrealistic, filled with bugs and what not. Graphics were horrible for a next gen game. Controls were terrible, just overall god awful game.
 Now Madden 15 is close to releasing, and EA has said they have fixed numerous things, specifically on the defensive side of the ball. Some fixes/updates to the game include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Player Sense 2.0, players are smarter in gameplay when plays unfold </li><li>War in the Trenches 2.0, more realistic blocking and block shedding </li><li>Improved tackling mechanics, making it much easier to perform open field tackles
</li><li>Improved head tracking on defenders, defenders no longer stare into the ground and then 360 for interception
</li><li>Better zone and man coverage (part of player sense 2.0) </li><li>More realistic QB pass accuracy, if QB is being heavily rushed or moved around in pocket, throws will be affected accordingly
</li></ul>
<p>On top of all this, the graphics have been greatly improved and the game looks 10000x better than last year's game from a graphics standpoint. I'm considering preordering, what are you guys thinking?</p>

<p>Never had any issue what so ever with Madden 25....and of course the graphics are going to look bad. It wasn't a next gen game.</p>
<p>All I care about for Madden 15 is if the contract system gets reworked. Have been *** over so many times the past few years due to not being able to extend or restructure players contracts.</p>

<p>There's no way you can say you didn't have a problem with Madden 25 unless you simply don't know much about football or what to expect. Db's dropped way too many interceptions, RB's have to stop completely to change directions and then run into offensive
 line and fall down, defensive line sheds block literally every time an offensive player runs by, etc. I could go on with the list forever.</p>

<p>It's a game. &nbsp;I don't expect it to be real. &nbsp;To be honest I thought the momentum was closer to real life. &nbsp;Players can't cut on a dime and keep their speed/momentum. &nbsp;It's annoying, but I feel it was more realistic. &nbsp;The dropped db ints were a bit much.</p>

<p>Yes, I always try to play it and get way too frustrated with all the bs that happens in the game and I end up giving up on it. And in reply to your "it's a game" comment, have you played NBA 2k14? Or any other NBA 2k game? They play great &nbsp;.. very realistic
 and smooth gameplay, similar to real life. Madden really doesn't come close to it.</p>

<p>Madden has been the epitome of inconsistency since Madden 06. &nbsp;EA needs competition to bring the best out in them. &nbsp;2K needs to be able to make a flippin football game. &nbsp;The character models all look the same. &nbsp;Not every offensive lineman and linebacker
 should have the same arms. &nbsp;NBA 2K, seems to understand that each human has a different body type. &nbsp;Still no tattoos. &nbsp;I am sure 2K, would make sure the football players would have their respective tattoos. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Game Play also has been suffering, though it has been getting better (after the ridiculous engine change). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, I look forward to Madden 15. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I just wish SOMEBODY would step in and do away with that stupid ea sports/NFL monopoly, (I thought monopoly's were illegal??), so 2K can make a football game again! It is a disgrace that we as football fans no longer have a choice as to the game we WANT
 to buy with our own money. IMO madden has been garbage ever since 2003, which makes sense as to why they ran to make this "contract" with the NFL, who also had their part in taking away our ability to choose. To me, if you want to be the only game in town,
 make the BEST game and force the others to quit like NBA 2K did to NBA live.</p>

<p>I agree with needing more competition to go up against EA/NFL, but contracts that EA has secured prevent other companies from using the NFL's likeness. In order to even make a football game outside of EA nowadays, you'd have to use fictional teams, and what's
 the point in that (I'm personally waiting on Mutant League Football to make a comeback)?</p>
<p>As for the Madden series, I've never been a fan, and unlike those of you who will be getting it day 1, I will never purchase a game from this series.</p>

<h2>            How to get volume control back , when device manager says &#34;&#34; no audio device &#34;&#34;</h2>
                    I have been using MSE &nbsp;for a very long time , and also IOBIT &nbsp; ,, they seem to work together with no conflicts . &nbsp;Iobit offered a free driver booster to update drivers , and I messed up and clicked on it thinking it would improve the overall performance
 of my computer . &nbsp;It resulted in "" No Sounds &nbsp;"" , volume control in system tray disappeared , and no sounds when playing a video. &nbsp;Overall performance of computer seems to be working , until I click &nbsp;microsoft updates , it will temporary shut down MSE ,
 then turn back on , but &nbsp;Microsoft Security client &nbsp;will pop up saying &nbsp;"" the feature your trying to use is on a network &nbsp;resource that is &nbsp;unavailable "" &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All this happened right after installing &nbsp;this driver booster ,, became discouraged and used uninstall
 to remove it . &nbsp; How can I get this sounds back??? &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do a System Restore to before the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Go to your Computer or Sound Card Manufacturer's website &gt; Key in your Computer or Sound Card Model Number &gt; your Operating System &gt; locate Audio Drivers &gt; download and install them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. You do not give us much to work with for "the feature your trying to use is on a network..."</p>
<p>That may be a problem with HP software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p>The MSE issue is&nbsp;totally unrelated&nbsp;to your IOBIT issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were two&nbsp;Windows Updates in recent months which could give the error "epp.msi" not found when trying to update Microsoft Security&nbsp;Essentials. The error occurs when the update tries to remove the existing version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will get&nbsp;better replies if you re-post in the Windows Update forum stating your version of Windows (whatever that is?) and show the full error message.</p>
<p>Please post the KB number of the update and the version of your current MSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will probably have to remove MSE and then re-install it.</p>

<h2>            Collection of issues</h2>
                    <div>Hello @all,<br />
<br />
I have some issues with my i5 no dGPU Surface Book and wonder whether they are normal and if they will ever be solved. By doing so I also want to give some feedback to MS.<br />
<br />
<strong>So, I would like to hear from you how I could solve these "unknown" issues, I haven't found online?</strong><br />
- Sometimes Bluetooth devices are stuttering (Microsoft mouse and Audio unusable)<br />
- While charging annoying electro static (electric charge)&nbsp;feeling when resting with the palms on the keyboard unit
<br />
- Sometimes it unlocks just by clicking any button, without the need for a password (e.g. when it says "To many wrong tries with windows hello, type pin")<br />
- Tablet units rear surface is very pressure sensitive&nbsp; (pressure marks)&nbsp;(with this weight it should be much sturdier)<br />
<br />
Known issues:<br />
- Chrome crashes <br />
- Sometimes Lock Screen can't be removed<br />
- Sometimes after sleep it stays black<br />
- Very rarely the screen freezes and it does not react at all<br />
- Sometimes is does not detach<br />
<br />
Further critic:<br />
- Battery charges very slow (5hours)<br />
-&nbsp;very heavy and bulky (Fulcrum hinge was a bad idea, and keyboard unit shouldn't be so heavy, since it only contains a battery)<br />
-&nbsp;very limited display tilt angle<br />
- pen is always in the way when holding it and easily falls down, which is why I already destroyed a tip (why wasn't it integrated like in all other devices)<br />
<br />
Well, I will think whether I keep it or give it back.<br />
Perhaps I'll be so lucky and receive some updates during the next week.</div>

            <p><strong>So, I would like to hear from you how I could solve these "unknown" issues, I haven't found online?<br />
</strong>- Sometimes Bluetooth devices are stuttering (Microsoft mouse and Audio unusable</p>
<p><em>I use a Microsoft Bluetooth Arc Touch Surface Version mouse and do not experience any problems.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- While charging annoying electro static (electric charge)&nbsp;feeling when resting with the palms on the keyboard unit</p>
<p><em>Never experienced this.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Sometimes it unlocks just by clicking any button, without the need for a password (e.g. when it says "To many wrong tries with windows hello, type pin")</p>
<p><em>Never had this happen.&nbsp; I use Windows Hello Face Recognition and love it.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Tablet units rear surface is very pressure sensitive&nbsp; (pressure marks)&nbsp;(with this weight it should be much sturdier)<br />
<em>I'm not experiencing any build problems when using as a clipboard.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Known issues:<br />
- Chrome crashes</p>
<p><em>Known issue with Chrome not limited to Surface Book.&nbsp; I just got an update this morning and I hope it is more stable.&nbsp; Make sure you are running the 64-bit version.</em></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>- Sometimes Lock Screen can't be removed</p>
<p><em>Not experienced this.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Sometimes after sleep it stays black</p>
<p><em>I've not had this happen after the past few updates.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Very rarely the screen freezes and it does not react at all</p>
<p><em>I've not had this happen after the past few updates, but it has happened a few times in the past.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Sometimes it does not detach</p>
<p><em>Not had this happen.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Further critic:<br />
- Battery charges very slow (5hours)</p>
<p><em>Since I charge while back at my desk while&nbsp;working, I've never paid attention to charge time.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;very heavy and bulky (Fulcrum hinge was a bad idea, and keyboard unit shouldn't be so heavy, since it only contains a battery)</p>
<p><em>Personally I really like the hinge and think it is cool and it is definitely very functional.&nbsp; The weight is almost exactly the same as the extremely popular Apple MacBook of the same screen&nbsp;size.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;very limited display tilt angle</p>
<p><em>No problem here, but then I'm only 5'10".</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- pen is always in the way when holding it and easily falls down, which is why I already destroyed a tip (why wasn't it integrated like in all other devices)</p>
<p><em>There is only one place on the left side where the magnetic attraction is very strong.&nbsp; I keep my pen there and have yet to lose it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I like it and for me it is an ideal solution. &nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I was an early adopter and purchased on the day it was released.&nbsp; I've certainly suffered through the early problems, and there definitely were some very&nbsp;irritating issues in the beginning.&nbsp; For me everything is working the way it should have on day
 one and I'm now quite pleased.&nbsp; I have the i7/16GB/512GB and really do&nbsp;love it.</em></p>

</p><blockquote>
<div>- Sometimes Bluetooth devices are stuttering (Microsoft mouse and Audio unusable)<br />
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>I can concur with the Microsoft Bluetooth mouse stuttering, though on a surface pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got a Microsoft Sculpt Comfort mouse and when streaming audio to a Bluetooth hi-fi at the same time, the mouse is unusable for productive work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio streams fine, and must surely&nbsp;be transmitting a much higher amount of data than a simple mouse needs to transmit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact the audio streams fine - at a good range as well - yet the mouse stutters positioned&nbsp;just centimeters away from the surface pro 4 unit, leads me to think it's perhaps a problem with the Bluetooth protocol itself, or windows scheduling between multiple
 connected devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or perhaps Microsoft have taken power saving too far in their&nbsp;mice. I'd happily live with shorter battery life in the mouse if that would make it more responsive. I don't know if that's something they'd be able to do with a mouse driver/mouse firmware update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, I offer this post mainly as feedback to&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;though also to say you're not alone having problems with a Microsoft Bluetooth mouse on a Microsoft device running Microsoft windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also on the off chance that there may be an easy fix :^)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the Surface Pro series only having 1&nbsp;USB port, connecting peripherals via Bluetooth is no longer&nbsp;a luxury, it's now a necessity to connect multiple devices at&nbsp;the same&nbsp;time.</p>

            The only Bluetooth devices I have connected are my Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse, Surface Edition and of course the Bluetooth portion of my Microsoft Pen. That apparently would explain why I'm not seeing stuttering issues and you are.

            Your replies are most welcome! And @Gary thanks for the comprehensive reply, it gave me some hope&nbsp;(Y)<br />
Good to hear, that there are really users with a functional Surface Book.<br />
<br />
And @<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/de49a57f-9540-4917-9304-90f8f6e68ce6" title="Arrrggghh"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Arrrggghh</span></a>&nbsp;is also right saying that connecting multiple Bluetooth devices
 at once is a necessity. I have a Microsoft Designer Mouse connected, the Surface Book Pen, a Nexus 4 for smart locking and a Jabra Revo Headset or an Aukey BR-C1 Audio Receiver.
<br />
<br />
<strong>P.S.:</strong> I can add a new problem which caused me headache. Connecting an external Monitor over miniDP leads to flickering on the SB and a constant black screen on the external monitor. I&nbsp;disable HyperV, but the monitor is still black.

<p>Finally I can give feedback concerning the general user experience:<br />
- It <strong>easily falls </strong>over when standing on you lap, because of the&nbsp;uneven weight distribution, and it
<strong>slips down </strong>easily because of the magnesium casing. So especially in this situation it feels uncomfortable to use.<br />
- The top right corner is not the appropriate place for <strong>audio jack, </strong>
it's irritating and <strong>not handy</strong><br />
- The <strong>keyboard unit</strong> without dGPU is <strong>ice cold </strong>which also feels uncomfortable
<br />
- The<strong> screen angle </strong>is very <strong>limited </strong>compared to other devices, in some situation it's just not enough (e.g. when typing on your lap or being taller)<br />
- The <strong>Windows Hello </strong>recognition is <strong>not working </strong>
outdoors when the sun is shining (use Fingerprint next time pls)<br />
- <strong>Touchpad surface </strong>feels <strong>sticky </strong>after some time<br />
- While charging annoying <strong>electro static</strong><strong> charge</strong>&nbsp;<strong>feeling
</strong>when resting with the palms on the keyboard unit <br />
- <strong>Battery charges </strong>very <strong>slow </strong>(5hours)<br />
-&nbsp;Heavy and <strong>bulky </strong>(Lenovo Yogas's hinge is overall better than <strong>
Fulcrum hinge</strong>)<br />
- While holding the book the <strong>p</strong><strong>en </strong>is <strong>disturbing
</strong>and easily falls off, integrating it like Lenovo is more practical<br />
<br />
The Surface Book is a cool product, but it has some annoying UX flaws. <br />
And sorry for posting my feedback here, but I don't see the appropriate space&nbsp;and I expect Microsoft&nbsp;already received enough feedback for the Surface Book.<br />

    <title>Unable to send or receive messages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eriklawson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to send or receive messages</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot send messages on Xbox Live on console, Windows 10, or the Android app. This has been happening for about a month. I returned to Xbox Live after not using my account for over a year, although I maintained a gold subscription throughout that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Something went wrong. Message didn't send."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly, the Xbox social website allows me to view, send, and receive messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Checked my reputation, it says perfect record. No suspension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Reset my console, including a factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Signed out and signed back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Allowed Gold to expire, then re-subscribed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) My security information is correct and up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) I changed my password, thinking it may trigger some kind of change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>How are you mainly sending these messages Xbox One, Xbox 360, or via the Xbox App</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for you not being able to send messages may because your wifi isnt strong enough at this time i have this problem alot so you could try using an ethernet cable.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. I can safely rule out any connection issues. I have two different WiFi connections, 2.5Ghz and 5Ghz connections, it doesn't work on either one and my console is in the same room as my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But to be thorough, I have also tested with Ethernet and I have the same issue. Internet speed is 200 Mb download, 25Mb upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the messaging on the Android app doesn't work on my 4G data connection either.</p>

<br />
You shouldn't have to hold down anything except the left mouse key. Are these icons pinned to the Taskbar? You could unpin them and then re-pin in the order you want them.

<h2>            Skype Version 7.59</h2>
                    <p>You need to let us go back to version&nbsp;7.59 on Skype. Your new version is a night mare and you all know it as if you are looking at your sites, people are compalining.</p>
<p>Why are you not listening to us. &nbsp;I do not want to see my friends friends on my skype. That is violating their privacy in a way.</p>
<p>Apple did a update today and now my version&nbsp;7.59 does not work. That is a shame.</p>
<p>Skype just keeps getting more stupid and complicated to use. My 97 year old Auntie can not use it anymore , she is lost on the new version and I am also.</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP MY 97 Year old Auntie and give us back version&nbsp;7.59 to use.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Suggested or mutual contact is a new and integrated feature of Skype. It makes easier to add the right people on Skype, and it doesn’t really step on your privacy. Unfortunately, there is still no way to know who these mutual contacts are and
 option to remove or disable this feature is currently not possible. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I have taken note of this and will let the Skype team knows about, the experience you had on this feature. You can still use the classic version of Skype by downloading it using this

<p>You are going to need a hdmi to dvi cord. You can use a hdmi cord with a dvi adapter but thats costly and skimpy. For sound, if you have a headset with an optical cable, use it. If not, get an audio adapter for sound. If you get the adapter, remember to
 get the splitter cable also</p>

<p>My touchscreen just randomly stopped working. Usually I go to the HDI settings on my laptop disable the touchscreen and then enable again and that fixes it. However, this time the HDI touchscreen drive is no longer on my computer. How do I get it back?</p>

<p>I recently purchased Halo: Combat Evolved on Xbox Live. &nbsp;This is not the free version for Gold members because I do not have a gold membership. &nbsp;This was purchased yesterday for 800 points (or $9.99). &nbsp;When I try to play this game I receive an error which
 simply states, "The game couldn't start. Try downloading the game again."</p>
<p>I have attempted to search for resolution, but the only offered solutions are as follows;</p>
<p>&nbsp; (1) Xbox Live Connection Issues:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/connectivity-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/connectivity-solutions</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; (2) Can't Play or Use Previously Downloaded Content:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/cant-play-downloaded-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/cant-play-downloaded-content</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game has now been deleted and re-downloaded multiple times and still will not load. &nbsp;I am logged in on the same account I purchased the game through. &nbsp;My internet connection is fine and I am experiencing no other issues with my XBox 360.</p>
<p>I've tried everything these articles have to offer and after searching for other topics to assist me both in the forums and support database I am unable to resolve this issue by myself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Please assist me in resolving this issue. &nbsp;If it cannot be resolved, I would appreciate a refund of the 800 points to my account used to purchase this product. &nbsp;I understand the product states "no refunds," but when it will not load a refund should be issued.
 &nbsp;The product simply does not appear to work.</p>
<p>Thank you for any advice in attempting to resolve this error in advance!</p>

<p>@Raptor2401: I'm not participating in a beta. &nbsp;Not sure which beta you might be referring to either. &nbsp;Sorry!</p>
<p>@Smwutches: I'm using the Xbox 360 slim with a Microsoft 250 Gb hard drive. &nbsp;This is not the issue either. &nbsp;I don't buy knock off after market stuff. &nbsp;I have had no issues with my hard drive.</p>
<p>@StuartATrueRed: Halo is listed on the list of compatible games and it claims to be compatible on the Xbox live store. &nbsp;(yes, it is an Xbox original)</p>
<p>@StuartATrueRed: My Xbox 360 is always connected, so it is already up to date with all system updates. &nbsp;</p>
<p>@StuartATrueRed: I've deleted the game (again), cleared the system cache, restarted, and re-downloaded Halo and it still does not work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>@StuartATrueRed: I attempted to uninstall Xbox system updates to reinstall them, but the instructions are either too vague or no longer work as described here:

<p>I know you say you don't buy knock off stuff, but just to double check that it isn't a hard drive issue, did the hard drive come with the console or was it purchased separately? If you purchased separately, was it purchased brand new from a retailer or used
 or from a third party seller?</p>

<p>@Smwutches It was purchased with the XBox 360 Slim in a bundle and it reads "Microsoft" next to the hard drive in the console settings. &nbsp;The bundle was purchased brand new and has been registered with (and certified by) Microsoft. &nbsp;I also don't purchase
 used products because you never know what the original user(s) may have done to the product before selling it. &nbsp;I'm telling ya, the hard drive is not a knock off. &nbsp;Hell, I don't even purchase from ebay because of so many scam artists out there. &nbsp;Only reliable
 vendors like Amazon, Gamestop, and Newegg.</p>
<p>As far as other XBox Originals, this is the only one I've attempted to purchase and download. &nbsp;After this experience I am not likely to try again with a different title or recommend it to anyone.</p>
<p>I have plenty content addons for other games which work just fine from my hard drive. &nbsp;No issues with any other product, of many, which are downloaded to my hard drive. &nbsp;It is not corrupt either.</p>

<p>While your hard drive might be a new Official Xbox Hard drive, they have been known to not play the originals like they are supposed too. The hard drive has the emulator needed to run the originals. Working DLC are not a sign that the emulator is working.
 I understand it is not a knock off or anything like that, but uninstalling the system update and re installing it has helped a lot of people with a similar problem. so follow StuartATrueRed instructions. &nbsp;If that does not work, post back and let us know.</p>

<p>Have done all of the above and the game still does not work. Downloaded halo combat evolved from the store. Xbox 360 slim with a Microsoft certified 250g hard drive (from gamestop) This is the only game I've ever had that didn't play. Does not give error
 code just says The game couldn't start. Try downloading the game again." Any other things I can try?

<h3> ericmason_it  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell Optiplex 3020 - Screen goes black after dell logo &#40;happened after windows updates froze midway and systems were restarted&#41;</h2>
                    <p>We had windows updates run on all our windows 7 systems in our medical center. &nbsp;13 or so of our Optiplex 3020s froze for about 8 hours in a state of "installing updates 1 of 24". &nbsp;I powered all of them off and restarted the units. &nbsp;Once the units were restarted,
 they gave the option to safe boot or start windows normally. &nbsp;Those that had the option to "start normally" selected would show the dell logo at startup, then go to a completely black screen (all peripherals still power on and the monitors register an active
 signal even though no image comes up). &nbsp; Those started in safe mode w/o networking, loaded into safe mode. &nbsp;I restarted the safe mode machines and they all booted into windows with no issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For those systems that go completely black after the dell logo. &nbsp;I am able to F2 into BIOS, i can run BIOS diagnostics and I can F12 into boot options, but I cannot F8 or shift+F8 into safe mode nor does launching in safe mode show up under advance boot
 options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone happen to know a way to launch an optiplex 3020 system into safe mode without the use of F8, shift + F8, going through msconfig or remoting into the registry (because I can't remote into the system over the network)? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I can put the hard drive in a dock and alter the registry that way? &nbsp;But can i alter the control set to force safe boot? or would it be possible to do a bcdedit to it as an external drive, install it back into it's machine and force it to safe boot
 the next time it is powered on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas or suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hello Giovanni,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>

 if any one of the following conditions is true:</span></span></p>

<p><span>1.&nbsp;Click Start, type services. MSc in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></p>

<p><span>5. Start the software installation.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer in a clean boot state and check if the computer freezes. Booting the computer in a clean boot state can
 reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue. </span>

<p>Thanks Mr.Harish .</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I tried method 1 as suggested but it has not worked</p>
<p>1) the Windows installer could be started only in manual mode , which I have done</p>
<p>2) I made some attempts setting the files properties of setup- game- chessmaster 10th Ed which only accepted this possibility to Windows 98/ME compatibility<br />
and then launched the setup</p>
<p>
</p><p>After few minuts of stop with the disinstalling bar it gives again the same error:</p>
<p>feature transfer error</p>
<p>Error 1603</p>
<p>Fatal error during installalation.</p>
<p>consult msi.chm or MSDN for more info (which I could not find)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyway.</p>

<h2>            Animated cursors and RAM</h2>
                    Our IT Security person at work is concerned that the animated cursors -- built in to Windows XP -- use more processor resources and RAM than regular cursors. Am talking about handwait.ani and stopwatch.ani -- which come with Windows.<br />
<br />
Is this true?&nbsp; I use handwait.ani for Working in Background and stopwatch.ani for Busy.

            Those cursors don't use any more "power" then the Wait and Busy cursors in the standard cursor set. If your IT person is nitpicking on that level something else is going on and you should clear the air. You didn't mention how much RAM your computer has
 but if you have only 256MB, have your IT person buy another stick for your machine. In most cases 512MB is good for XP (although it will certainly run with 256MB) and 1GB is usually more than sufficient.

<h2>            how do i remove a flag on my IP address that was created when a visitor&#39;s kid was using an XBox on my wifi&#63;</h2>
                    My internet service provider - Cox Cable - says my inability to use Microsoft Edge to access the internet on their Ethernet and wifi is because Microsoft put a flag on it due to abusive Xbox behavior.&nbsp; They came to this conclusion because I can access
 the internet using non-Microsoft products (Firefox, for example).&nbsp; Can anyone tell me if this makes sense and give advice on how to get the "flag" removed?

<br />Could you provide a screenshot on what you see when you attempt to access Microsoft Edge, send it to Imgur (<a href="http://imgur.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com</a>) or your preferable image sharing site, and send me the link so I can see what's going on?

 wrong. But the microphone still doesn't work and when I plug it in the only thing that happens is it asks if I plugged in a speaker or headphones.

<h2>            My Display Properties screen is missing the Screensaver tab&#63;</h2>
                    I recently installed XP on a new hard drive and now when I go to Display Properties screen by right clicking on the Desktop, there is no Screensaver tab that allows the selection of a screensaver. What can I do to correct this?
