<br />
Do you have multiple CD/DVD drives?<br />
If you try and launch the game from the CD/DVD, what happens?<br />
<br />
Do you have any Virtual Drive software?<br />
<br />
Let us know,<br />

Thanks!

            <p>Dude, what is wrong with you. Such a long passage? Really? Anyways, I am having the same issue. "We could not install the update. Undoing changes." Then it restarts. Them comes a message, "Configuring Windows". The cycle repeats indefinitely just like earth
 revolves around the sun indefinitely. The system has crashed. The problem is that while updating, the system goes into sleep mode. Any help to restore my pc wil be highly appreciated. Plus these automatic updates makes our system unusable for hours. Who is
 responsible for it?</p>

            Satish, yours is a different issue , not this same as prem26 is having. He has the same issue I have with is about the update tool not having the correct authorisation, yours is an issue around the reboots and going into sleep mode. You'd be better starting
 you own thread so they can deal with that one for you else you might not get the answer you need

            <p>I found a fix that worked for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 160px; color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">
<strong>Step 1.</strong>&nbsp;Click inside the Cortana search box and type regedit. When "Regedit / Run command" appears at the top of the list, press Enter. (Or you can click or tap.)</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">
<strong>Step 2.</strong>&nbsp;Inside regedit, on the left, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">
<strong>Step 3.&nbsp;</strong>Important! Back up the registry key. With ProfileList highlighted, click File, Export. Choose a location (like your desktop) and type in a name (like ProfileListBeforeIBrokeIt) and press Save.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">
<strong>Step 4.</strong>&nbsp;On the left, you'll see a list of profile IDs, most likely including S-1-5-18, S-1-5-19, S-1-5-20, and several more with much longer names. Chances are good one of them represents a bad profile that should've been deleted.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">
<strong>Step 5.</strong>&nbsp;Click on each of the long-name profiles in turn, and look on the right for ProfileImagePath. If any of the entries in ProfileList point to a ProfileImagePath that doesn't make sense, right-click on the profile ID and choose Delete.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 160px; color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">
S<strong>tep 6.</strong><span style="color: rgba(78, 66, 66, 1)">&nbsp;"X"
 out of regedit. Reboot your machine. If something goes horribly wrong, double-click on the file you created in Step 3 to restore the Registry. (You can try the whole process over again, but choose a different ProfileList.) If all is well, click Start, Settings,
 Update &amp; Security. KB 3081424 should be there, and will most likely start installing again while you're watching.</span></p>

<p>I would suggest you to search the Internet for the correct application which would automatically tag mp3 files.</p>

            No automatic tagger is 100% effective.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The best way, unfortunately is the manual route. I recently did 1 000 + songs with mp3Tag v2.5 Took me 3 days but every detail including album art is correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The data bases used by MS or Apple are not too up to date and do contain erroneous details. Its a PITA but if you want everything as it should be, then manually.</div>

            There's a handful of free tools that embed cover artwork into mp3 tags more or less automatically. They all have their pros and cons. E.g., Mediamonkey can get art accuratelty, but is complicated and offers too much functionality; Tagscanner can auto find
 art only on an album-by-album basis; taghycardia speedily embeds art finding it both locally and online, but is not very flexible; and bliss requires java, which turned out to be ridden with insecurities of late. I'd recommend using a combination of the above,
 like taghycardia for automation with Tagscanner for manual adding finishing touches.

<p>Here's the Address Book and more.</p>
<p>Transferring data from Outlook Express to Windows Live Mail:</p>
<p>For Messages:</p>
<p>Copy the *ENTIRE* OE message store folder to a flash drive. (Folders.dbx must be included). Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail. Open WLMail and: File | Import | Messages | Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and point to where
 you saved it.</p>
<p>OE Message Store Location:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Addresses:</p>
<p>Open the Address Book in OE and File | Export | Address Book (wab) and save it to the Desktop. Copy to a flash drive. Place this on the Desktop or other location on the machine using WLMail.</p>
<p>Open the Contacts list in WLMail, (Go | Contacts on the Menu Bar), and File | Import | Windows Address Book (wab) and point to where you saved it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: If you use a CD or DVD instead of a flash drive, after placing on the new machine you must remove the Read Only attribute in Properties before you import.</p>
<p>For Account Settings:</p>
<p>In OE: Tools | Accounts, select the account and export it to the Desktop. This will be a .iaf file. Copy it to the new machine's Desktop and in WLMail: Tools | Accounts and import the settings from the location you saved them.</p>

                    Yes 3 evils fight each other it seems, I thought if Defender was a anti-virus perhaps that would cause conflicts but as far as I know I have Spyroot w/antivirus. Malwarebytes is like adware software and Windows defender which came install on Vista.<br />
Could they be running interferance with each other? I have been having a few issues which most seem are the lack of communication. I was and still am haveing a time keeping the time true and It was okay until today maybe because I reinstalling the Spyroots?
 before I got an answer here and had to reset my time-zone as well as my BIOS clock.<br />
I hoped to get some of these issue fixed(there are more !) before installing Windows 7 which is on the way Ive heard.<br />
I have a ASUS CM5570- 64 bit 6 gb ram, 600 gb hd.<br />
Ive also seen my CPU go up to 56% with 120 processes (normal 6o process) with no visible programs&nbsp; I was using, on !
<br />
I did get a scan turn up with a trojan and one other bad 'thing" last week but now I cant find it even in Quarenteine..?<br />
<br />
They said"lots of details so here more detail..to get more helpful advice.: )<br />
<br />
Hardware conflicts ie: puter goe to Restart if I put it in Sleep mode.<br />
<br />
Could this be that I plugged a flash drive 8 gig after I read it could help performance(even with all&nbsp; the resources! )<br />
and have a usb Ex.harddrv. and usb Incompatible printer MADE compatible<br />
plus 2 usb wireless sticks. One for mouse, one for home wireless network.<br />
<br />
Do I have TOO much things hooked on? <br />
would you believe I still have 2 empty usb 2.0 ports ?<br />
<br />
I have wrote alot for one question, next time i will break it down.<br />
Thanks to anyone who has the time to think this through &amp; give a experienced answer.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend :
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have thrown at them.<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials has also proven to be very reliable and compatible.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom right of IE)</p>
<p>Avast - Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and Network running.<br />
(Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields - Terminate those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security programs. This is
<br />
a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp</span></a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download<br />
</p>
<p>PCmag - Prevx - Editor'a Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a></p>
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that would be unsual with<br />
Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie (no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner. I have many scanners and they never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Local print spooler service is not running. Spooler error 1813 - Failed to read description</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Home Premium. I have installed two different PDF printing programs that are compatible with Win 7. However, when I select "Add Printer" I get the error message "Windows can't open Add Printer. Local print spooler service is not running.
 Please restart the spooler or restart the machine." I have done many restarts of the laptop, but it hasn't fixed it.<br />
<br />
When I look in Services.msc under Spooler, the description is "Failed to Read Description: Error code 1813". It is on automatic and Local System. There is not a Print Spooler, just Spooler, in the services menu.<br />
<br />
I have tried to find a solution in previous posts, but nothing has worked. I have also gone back to factory settings, but this did not resolve the issue. I have called Dell and ran a check on hardware, but there were no issues.<br />
<br />
HELP!

<p>Hm.&nbsp; Kinda sounds like you have some wallpaper management software in place that's interfering here.&nbsp; OK, open up a CMD prompt and run exactly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg query "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\control panel\desktop" /v wallpaper</p>
<p>
</p><p>reg query HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Themes /v CurrentTheme</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the results of those queries?</p>

    <title>After Win 10 upgrade BSOD error and restart loop, VIDEO MEMORY - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giggungaggap  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Win 10 upgrade BSOD error and restart loop, VIDEO MEMORY MANAGEMENT INTERNALERROR</h2>
                    My problem starts with the same BSOD, however it goes differently from there,&nbsp;let me explainas briefly and detailed as possile:
<div>1) ASUS All-in-one PC, 27 inch, multi-touch panel, originally bought with Windows 8 in 2013</div>
<div>2) Upgraded to Win 8.1 as upgrade rolled.</div>
<div>3)Had been trying to upgrade to Windows 10 since around december 2015, without success, install would stall and revert to WIn 8.1 after 72% completion of install (I believe it was error 000417 or something like that)</div>
<div>4) Somedate around March 15th, after countless tries and reading many solutions online, I disconencted from Wi-fi after upgrade&nbsp;download finished, then upgrade went through and I was able to access my PC in Windows 10 after the initial reboot.</div>
<div>5) That first time was the last.I logged in, but noticed the resolution was out ouf whack, since the screen looked like it had been zoomed in quite a lot.</div>
<div>6) I checked settings but that was the highest resolution and size available.</div>
<div>7) At the same time, Windows informed me that display drivers had been updated and a re-start was needed.</div>
<div>8) At the same time again, Nvidia Notfication appear to install update to the Graphics display driver.</div>
<div>9) So I put the re-start on hold, I proceeded to update NVIDIA as well.</div>
<div>10) After NVIDIA update finished I proceeded to re-start PC.</div>
<div>11) Restart led me to BSOD, with VIDEO MEMORY MANAGEMENT INTERNAL error message, and a loop of restarts and same BSOD.</div>
<div>12) I was able to access teh troubleshooting options and started in Safe Mode with Network</div>
<div>13) I was in panic, so I uninstalled NVIDIA Grapich Display and another NVIDIA software (I was in fear I should have waited until after the WIndows display drivers update restar, toupdate NVIDIA, so I uninstalled it).</div>
<div>14) I restarted PC.</div>
<div>15) I got the same BSOD, and restar loop. I went to bed.</div>
<div>16) Next day, I turn on PC, I got NO BSOD, but I immediately got a BIOS WARNING, something like I could't boot from the cirrent device. GAve some troubleshooting steps.</div>
<div>17) Tried to follw them and some other online solutio.</div>
<div>18) Somehow got the same BSOD again, withthe restart loop, and still able to enter Safe Mode with Network.</div>
<div>19) However, even though is Safe MOde WITH Network, it gives me no connection.</div>
<div>20) I connected the PC via LAN cable and I am able to use Internet Explrorer to browsehe internet, however, NEtwork conenction says NOT CONNECTED to a network.</div>
<div>21) Widnows Update won't run.</div>
<div>22) Tryin to update drivers online says"No connection detected" and for NVIDIA it says "Cannot intall in Safe MOde".</div>
<div>23) During some of these problems I conatct Microsoft support by chat or phone, inall cases it is "call this number, not his one", "let me tranfer you", or something like that, but not a single thing to help.</div>
<div>24) I give up and decide to turn PC back to Factory settings.</div>
<div>25) Access troubleshooting options, and select return PC to original state (or soemthing like that)</div>
<div>26) PC goes though the process, hoever after restart I get same BSOD, troubleshoot again, go to Safe MOde</div>
<div>27) And I get Safe MOde in WIndows 10!</div>
<div>28) From here I don't know what to do next. PC is barely usle like this, MIcrosoft Office 365 programs won't open, with message saying Cannot open from Built in administration account, and thens ome other runtime error.</div>
<div>29) Edge has the same Buil in administration error.</div>
<div>I want to fix this quickly, if it is better(easier and quicker)&nbsp;to go back to Win 8, then fine.</div>
<div>I'll let Win 10 alone, so be it.</div>
<div>Can you help me, please.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hello Giggungaggap,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, I have the exact same PC and exact same issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I don't have a fix yet either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, heat is not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr. Jones is correct that heat can cause all sorts of problems. &nbsp;I feel our problem comes from Win 10 installing the wrong drivers. &nbsp;I've reinstalled windows 3 times. &nbsp;Each time the PC boots up normal and runs great. &nbsp;It runs for hours. &nbsp;I can install apps,
 watch videos, do anything. &nbsp;Once I reboot, the BSOD starts. &nbsp;Nothing fixes it. &nbsp;Well, reinstalling Windows does. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've watched carefully and I've noticed that Windows automatically installs an Intel graphics driver. &nbsp;After that the resolution is corrected. &nbsp;Then a little while later, it makes another comments about installing or updating graphics drivers and will need
 to reboot. &nbsp;I did the same thing you did by downloading and installing the Nvidia graphcs driver. Unfortunately, the system had already installed the Intel drivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded the nvidia drivers and put them on a flashdrive. &nbsp;Tonight 6/13/16, I'm going to reinstall windows (full drive wipe) and turn off wifi when the PC starts. &nbsp;Hopefully no driver will install. &nbsp;Then I'll load up the nvidia driver and reboot.
 &nbsp;Wish me luck.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Here are my notes as I performed the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><span>reloaded windows - with wifi off, I could reboot all I wanted with no issues - device
 manager showing 2x microsoft basic display adapters - when I tried to install nvidia 368.39 it failed during install - I got the bsod with video error, same as always. the computer restarted by itself and actually booted into windows. - still shows same two
 generic drivers.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Then i tried to download nvidia drivers from jan 2016. Exact same thing happened</span><br />
<br />
<span>Now I'm trying drivers from the Asus website but they only have drivers for Win 8 64 bit. - version 305.46 - Asus
 website has both a nvidia driver and an Intel driver. I tried the nvidia driver first. Interesting - the install program for 305.46 says I must install an Intel driver first.</span><br />
<br />
<span>So then I tried the Intel drivers. These drivers would not install from the main "setup" file given. I had to go
 into the folder and find the actual setup file and run it (inside the 64 bit folder). The intel drivers installed and then rebooted the PC. Now my screen looks good and the system rebooted just fine.</span></p>
 for the past few days. I still have not run a Windows Update. I did not have time. Bottom line, Download Win 8 drivers for the video. Install the Intel driver first. Good luck.</span></p>

<h2>            windows  media player cannot load skins__</h2>
                    
<p>windows media player encounter a problem with the skin file.&nbsp; The skin file may not be valid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's the message I get when I try to load skins.&nbsp; I went to MP's skin page and said to find more skin.&nbsp; Got taken to http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/player/skins.aspx?locale=409&amp;geoid=f4&amp;version=12.0.7600.16415&amp;userlocale=409</p>
<p>There, have tried several skins and get the same message.&nbsp; Why wouldn't any of MS's skins be valid on MS Media player?&nbsp; It doesn't make sense!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Um anyone seen this and have an idea of what might be broken?&nbsp; Using WMP 12.0.7600.16415.&nbsp; Is it that none of the skins that WMP12 is pointing to are for WMP12?&nbsp; That would just be too lame...?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The skins on the page are compatible with Windows 7. I tried them with my Windows media Player 12.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Remove all the skin files. Download the file to desktop and then Open Windows Media Player and try to load the skin.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.<br />
If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button&nbsp; in the upper-right corner of the Player.<br />
2. Click the View menu, and then click Skin Chooser.<br />
If the View menu isn't visible, you'll need to show the menu bar by clicking Organize, pointing to Layout, and then selecting Show menu bar.<br />
3. In the left pane, click the skin that you want to apply. A preview of the skin appears in the right pane.<br />
4. Click Apply Skin.</span></span></p>

Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If&nbsp;these steps don't work,&nbsp;try reinstalling the driver:&nbsp;Open <strong>
<span>Device Manager</span></strong>, right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the name of the device, and select
<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi, Simonowens,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make and Model of printer, please</p>
<p>Visit the Manufacturer's website; download and install the latest drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Check for the dependencies of Print Spooler service and verify whether they’re running.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click Start and type <strong>services.msc </strong>in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Locate <strong>Print Spooler</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the <strong>Dependencies </strong>tab. </span></p>
<p><span>Look for the “Dependencies” under “Print Spooler” and make sure all the dependency services are running and set to “Manual” or “Automatic”.</span></p>
<p><span>Run the printer troubleshooter and check if it can fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer is having problems printing, try using the Printer troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that a printer is connected to your computer, and it checks for common issues such as whether the printer has enough paper and toner
 to complete printing your document. </span></p>
<p><span>Open the Printer troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Under Hardware and Sound, click Use a printer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Open the Printer troubleshooter</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</strong></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>A print spooler is software that temporarily stores print jobs on the computer hard disk or in memory until the printer is ready to print them.</span></p>
<p><span>If you've been waiting an unusually long time for a document to print, or if you see an error message about the print spooler, you might need to restart the print spooler on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest way to restart the spooler is to save your work and restart the computer. You can also try these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article that has solutions to some common problems with printing:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Why can't I print?</strong></span></p>

Presumably you still have the iso file you downloaded?</p>

Bing isn't my friend today because that link you sent me only for windows 8 not 8.1
<div><br />
<div>I don't know if you notice but they remove repair disc from windows 8.1 "They only have the recovery as far as I know USB" but, may work with the install CD/ISO for the disc &nbsp;but ,my ISO doesn't work. when I said my ISO doesn't work meaning, The repair
 disc Utility only. &nbsp;Windows 8.1 is install and working but again...</div>

            Hi StevenAngelucci,
<div><br />
<div>currently, the only way to repair your computer is only one out of the three ways:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1)Use the recovery partition on your Desktop PC</div>
<div>2)Use the Recovery Media/DVD brought from somewhere to repair your computer, OR create a system repair disc.</div>
<div>3)Use the USB to create a system repair drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, since your Desktop PC <u>cannot</u>&nbsp;support USB boot, Option three is out.</div>
<div>I am not sure if you have the recovery partition on your Desktop PC, but as what Gordon B-P said,&nbsp;</div>
<div>Bing is your friend.</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/131907/how-to-create-and-use-a-recovery-drive-or-system-repair-disc-in-windows-8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/131907/how-to-create-and-use-a-recovery-drive-or-system-repair-disc-in-windows-8/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Although the title says Windows 8, it is also useful for Windows 8.1 as Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 are similar in many ways.</div>

yes windows 8 and 8.1 are similar but it's sad to say they took away recdisc&nbsp;&nbsp;Utility to create the cd/dvd media. as I mention from the start the this thread many times on top of that. You need to look into windows 8.1 know about this.

<h2>            How can I undo an update install for AMD Radeon that has caused my Windows 10 system to crash&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My system has been upgraded from Win7 to Win10. &nbsp;I recently was prompted to install an update/upgrade for AMD Radeon and after completion, a restart was required. &nbsp;When I restarted my computer, I got the :( bsod and can now only boot up in safe mode. &nbsp;I
 would normally do a system restore, as that has solved many similar problems in the past,&nbsp;but I just found out that, lo and behold, that feature was automatically disabled by the Windows 10 (extremely bad move by Microsoft if you ask me) and there are no restore
 points. &nbsp;By the way, I have noticed tons of people in help forums with similar problems who also tried to use system restore to their disappointment. Microsoft, please take this into consideration! Sorry for the rant. After this, I tried the chat help on this
 site, and was recommended to uninstall the display drivers and then restart. &nbsp;I did, but no change. &nbsp;So now I am looking for a way to "undo" the update without resetting my OS.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Updates will enhance and provide security to the computer. It is best not to remove an update unless you're certain that it is causing a problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to any of the third party software installed in your PC conflicting with the operating system. Performing clean boot will help you in identifying which of the third party software is causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Before performing <strong>Clean boot</strong> run
<strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter by following the steps below and check for the status of the computer behavior. System freezes and other irregular behaviors is mostly caused due to the unwanted/unused files retained in the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running the troubleshooter will help in detecting and identifying the cause of the issue and in certain cases will fix to enhance the performance of the system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Maintenance</span></strong><span> troubleshooter will find and clean up unused files and shortcuts present on the system and perform maintenance tasks which will enhance the performance of the PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>View all </strong>from the left side panel of the window.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>System Maintenance</strong> from the listed options, click on
<strong>Advanced </strong>option and check <strong>Apply repairs automatically </strong>
option.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the troubleshooting to complete.</span></li><li><span>After the troubleshooting is completed, check the status for any missing system components on the computer.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if&nbsp;the issue&nbsp;is resolved&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><strong><span>If the issue persists, boot the computer in
</span></strong><strong><span>Clean boot</span></strong><span> state by following the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in <strong><span>Clean Boot</span></strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can open the system configuration window in Windows 10:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Boss,</p>
<p>I just read something about using DDU somewhere else today as well. &nbsp;I may try this before my next move. &nbsp;I have a couple of questions about uninstalling the graphics drivers though: Will my pc be able to boot without them if windows doesn't automatically
 reinstall? How will my display work without the display drivers? It seems like I wouldn't be able to install the new drivers if I have no display when the system boots back up or not be able to boot up at all.? &nbsp;This is Darwin's black box to me. &nbsp;I'm sure
 I'm missing something here but don't know what. &nbsp;Your advice sounds like good solid advice. I'm just trying to decide if it something I should try to tackle especially since I am working completely in safe mode now. I have spent most of my day backing up my
 files, profiles, bookmarks etc. &nbsp;I'm thinking of just doing a reset and getting a clean start. Between the two options, what do you think would be best? Oh yeah, I decided to wait until I get the system running properly again to configure system restore again.
 &nbsp;It doesn't seem to be an option in safe mode anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>dc</p>

            <p><em>"Will my pc be able to boot without them if windows doesn't automatically reinstall? "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Windows has always had a generic VGA driver that allows the desktop to function when no graphics drivers</p>
<p>for your gpu are installed. It will often default to a very low res after rebooting, but you can generally set it up</p>
<p>to 1920x1080 these days.</p>
<p>When the dedicated graphics drivers are not installed the gpu does not function, but the VGA signal can</p>
<p>still pass through the PCIe slot and the graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- You need to reboot after uninstalling graphics drivers to finish the process. If you don't the next driver</p>
<p>you install can be corrupted by leftover registry keys or driver files. </p>
<p>Rebooting is important with many types of software installs, as well as general Windows functions.
</p>
<p>A machine that is left on 24/7 still needs to be rebooted occasionally so Windows can sort out system changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I did forget about you having to run in Safe Mode, but once the current possibly corrupt graphics driver</p>
<p>is uninstalled you should be able to boot into Windows normally&nbsp; to reinstall the AMD drivers.</p>
<p>If not, see if running System File Checker finds and fixes something.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/1538-sfc-scannow-command-system-file-checker.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SFC /SCANNOW Command - System File Checker - Windows 7 Forums</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp; If SFC does not fix the issue a repair reinstall may be the next option.</p>
<p>If you don't have much installed a reformat and clean reinstall of Windows is the fail safe option,
</p>
<p>but a repair is well worth trying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I've done a repair reinstall on my Win7 from the installation disk, which is much like DISM repair below,</p>
<p>and while you do still have to stuff around with a few things like drivers and settings it's much easier,
</p>
<p>particularly if like me, you have&nbsp; a stack&nbsp; of games and software installed. </p>
<p>This same six year old Win7 is what I have upgraded to Win10 from, and it run my games as well as a
</p>
<p>clean install would (Well, that's an educated guess. They may run one or two fps under a clean install . )</p>
<p>- Having said that, I made sure my Win7 was well tuned and organised before doing the upgrade. If</p>
<p>your Win7 had any issues before doing the upgrade the upgrade could make things worse.</p>

<h2>            Win10 File Explorer r-click file properties &#34;not responding&#34;</h2>
                    One year old laptop upgraded to Win10 several months ago was working fine until about a week ago. Right click for file properties in file explorer results in "not responding" that never returns. Right clicking on either a file or folder result with the
 same problem. Right click can't copy, move or check properties with the mouse, because the context menu never shows. Left click and drag works OK to move files. Otherwise PC seems to work fine. Virus protection is current. Any suggestions?

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I will try the Clean Boot suggestion and try to report results tomorrow. In answer to your question, anti-virus is McAfee in the version supplied by my ISP, Time Warner Cable. The only thing I have done to my PC in the last three
 weeks is to add about 3000 photos, about 30 gb,&nbsp;from a recent vacation. Hard disk has over 50% free of 1 Tb total volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File copy, move and properties are available from File Explorer's home tab and work fine. Only right-clicking on a file or folder results in "not responding".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two other things I have noticed in about he same time frame, my PC is very slow to find Wi-Fi connections. The list of SSIDs takes 30 seconds or so&nbsp;to populate. I've never seen this&nbsp;slow performance&nbsp;before. About the same time this started I noticed my Wi-Fi
 icon had moved from the visible system tray to the pop-up portion of the system tray. The other thing happened last night after rebooting, I use a Microsoft account when I log on, the message was something like... no internet connection is available... please
 use&nbsp;your&nbsp;previous password to log on. This occurred before the Windows desktop was shown but the log on screen appeared normal in every other way.</p>

            <p>Last night I was going to try your suggestions but I discovered the problems no longer existed. After living with this issue for around 2 weeks, both wifi and context menu have resolved themselves. I checked Windows Update history and saw a lot of "patches"
 installed April 16 but nothing since. I have rebooted many times during this time and connected many different wifi networks. I guess we may never discover what the problem was. I'm attaching a shapshot of the context menu for a jpg file. I don't recall what
 is normally in the list. Most items look familiar however I do not recall seeing "Cast to Device", "CRC SHA", "Web Albums"&nbsp;or the two CyberLink items previously. I believe I can identify all the others. Does anyone have a list from Win 10 Home as installed
 out-of-the-box?</p>

            After about two weeks of Explorer file property problems the problem has resolved itself. I was prepared to set aside some time&nbsp;try&nbsp;the suggestions and when I was ready to begin I discovered Explorer was working fine again. It was probably caused by some
 Windows Update since that would have been the only thing making changes to my system during this time. The issue is closed.

            Hi DaveMartinez2
<br />
<br />To transfer photos and videos from your phone to PC, connect your phone to the PC with a USB cable. Make sure the phone is on and unlocked, and that you're using a working cable, then:
<br />
<br />On your PC, select the Start  button and then select Photos to open the Photos app.
<br />Select Import &gt; From a USB device, then follow the instructions. You can pick the items you want to import and select where to save them.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you're using having trouble with an Android device or iPhone, see the below notes:
<br />
<br />On Android devices: You might need to change the USB setting to allow you to transfer media or photos and not just charge the phone. Go to Notification Center and choose Transfer files or File transfer.
