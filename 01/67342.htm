            Sometimes that section of msinfo32 just gets messed up and I am not sure why.&nbsp; Sometimes it is just full of stuff that doesn't seem to make sense.<br />
<br />
I imagine if people that have never looked there before check theirs, they would find it a mess too.<br />
<br />
The good news is you can fix it.<br />
<br />
Here's my usual spiel:<br />
<br />
When you see a big list like you describe, the information gathering process has gone haywire somewhere along the way, but doesn't seem to present any other issues (beside it looks peculiar).&nbsp; Most folks never even look at that section, so there are probably
 a lot of systems that have the issue and it is not even noticed.&nbsp; It most certainly should work correctly though.<br />
<br />
I forget the reason why it gets that way, but you can fix it so it makes more sense and is less scary with a little VB Script from Ramesh's site.&nbsp; You can save and read the script if you care to figure out what it does and how it works.&nbsp; You could do all the
 operations yourself by hand, but the script is easier.<br />
<br />
The script will make some registry changes, so if you choose to run the script, backup your registry first.
<br />
<br />
Here is a popular free registry backup tool:<br />

<br />
Here is a link with more information and also you can download the script from Ramesh to clean up the Startup Programs list.<br />

<p>
</p><p>1) Doe this issue occur with other folders which are saved on the desktop or other photos folder in the local drive?</p>

            <p>I copied the folder to my desktop and it seems to be indexing the pictures from there. This is odd as there are other folders on the NAS at the same folder level that get catalogued fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any limit on the number of pictures in a folder? I ask because that one has 542 photos, more than any of my other folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly the NAS folder no longer gives the message "No readable photos, videos or folders found." It just doesn't show any photos.</p>

            <p>I created sub folders and split the pictures into sub folders&nbsp; .. and that worked
<em>for a while</em>. It displayed the folder and the pictures in the sub folders in the folders view. But then after a couple of days the sub folders displayed as empty again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's something fundamentally borked with the photos app and that folder. It seemed to catalogue them and then forget them again.</p>

<p>- What is the make and model of your laptop? <br />
- How old is the battery/laptop?<br />
- Have you updated display and other relevant drivers from mftr's website? <br />
- Have you installed all the latest Windows updates? <br />
- Has the problem been there ever since you bought the laptop/installed Windows 7?</p>
<p>I am not really sure about the question you are trying to ask.</p>
<p>Use powercfg command and check what's causing the issuie:</p>

<h2>            Hearthfire freezing glitch</h2>
                    
<p>My game likes to freeze when I'm in my Hearthfire house. Sometimes it does it as soon as I walk in the door. And when I load the autosave it freezes again. I noticed it happens more frequently after a bandit or wolf attack so I've just been fast traveling
 away and back to clear the bodies. But lately its been freezing after having been in my house for a few minutes. The sound cuts out and I can't even get the ding sound from the dashboard button.</p>

<p>I have yet to have a <em><strong>Hearthfire</strong></em> freeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the game installed on the hard drive? </li><li>When was the last time you cleared the system cache?&nbsp; (System, Storage, select the hard drive, Press Y and Clear System Cache)
</li><li>Which DLCs do you have installed? Just <strong><em>Hearthfire</em></strong> or
<strong><em>Dawnguard</em></strong> too? </li><li>Have you tried to delete the DLC and reinstall after clearing the cache?&nbsp; (see #2)
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these and hopefully it will clear up the problem!</p>

<p>I don't think I've ever messed with my system cache. So I guess I'll start with that. I have both DLCs and I haven't installed the game.
</p>
<p>How much does installing the game really help though? I installed GTAIV years ago and didn't notice any improvements to loading times.

<p>With a game as graphic intensive as Skyrim - it will help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever possible, always install your games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will help with any overheating issues the console may have and also keep the disk drive from always having to access the disk.</p>

<p>This has happened to me too. For the Lakeshore Manor. I had completed building, brought in a steward, and the game started freezing as soon as I entered the house, The only option was to reboot the xbox. I am glad I am not the only one this is happening
 to. I searched the internet, but it was only mentioned on a Gamespot forum. I started to build at Harlmarchen (sp) no problems so far, I am building all the furniture myself though. I have cleared the game cache and the game is installed. The only other option
 is to delete the dlc and reinstall it, but I am afraid that may make things worse.</p>

<p>Same exact house I was having problems in. I started useing the side doors that helped a little. Also, several of the crashes happened when Serana was following me. I think its just that there's so much content that the XBox has a stroke when loading DLC
 or something. </p>

<p>Lakeshore manor was the last house I built. Never having any problems with freezing before that.
</p>
<p>I hired Rayya to be my steward. I built a greenhouse, trophy room, and armory. No freezing. Then I had her furnish the place.. It started freezing every time i came into the house. I read through some boards that its only a glitch with lakeshore, but it
 froze again while in the cellar in the Pale. </p>
<p>I took advise to move family out. So i moved them to solitude, then have steward follow and wait outside. (Not very practicle)</p>
<p>I used my forge outside at lakeshore while Rayya was outside and it froze up. There were no opening of any doors and it still froze. Frustrated, I decided to kill Rayya. And i havent had a problem since. I havent hired a new steward either.. Maybe thats
 the glitch.. ?</p>

<p>If you've been affected by a glitch like this, no patch will fix the existing save file.</p>
<p>Once a file is glitched, it's glitched. A patch will correct the problem in the game system, but you would need to start fresh.</p>

    <title>windows system folder is empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lightft  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows system folder is empty</h2>
                    <p>in fact, almost ALL the folders on the system are empty except for the user tree.&nbsp; No files, no sub-folders.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Background:&nbsp;&nbsp; the drive is from an HP&nbsp;laptop with dead video.&nbsp;Hardware is not worth saving.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I took the drive out to see if there might be savable files - and looked at this Vista 32 drive using a usb patch to a Win 7-32 system.</p>
<p>Win 7 finds the drive OK, and says that 216 GB of the 250 total&nbsp;is in use.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems about right.&nbsp; when go into explorer, you see the normal file tree off the root, but only in Users do you find any files.&nbsp;&nbsp; when you expand "Properties" you see file size,
 etc. but if you open, say a .ini or a .txt file, you get a message that the file is no longer there and cannot be opened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;when you click on "program files" explorer return "no files" and the properties box for the folder says 0 bytes.</p>
<p>same for Windows, and virtually every other folder.</p>
<p>pagefile and hiberfile.sys show up, but again if you try to do anything with them, even delete, windows says the file is no longer there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>chkdsk and defrag from windows open and close immediately on this drive, but work fine on other drives.</p>
<p>Chkdsk when run from an elevated command prompt says the drive is in RAW condition and needs to be formatted.&nbsp; this sounds odd when I can still actually open and read a very few files, even if they are oddballs and I am using Notepad as a text editor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am wondering if SpinRite or some other utility can give a reliable idea if the files are recoverable without spending too much.&nbsp; Since I can use windows to select files for evaluation, and then am told that there is nothing there, I am not sure what to
 do. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing has been written to the drive, so little should be overwritten unless windows itself has tried to do some repairs.&nbsp; everything i have tried so far has given no error messages other than to say the file I am looking at in explorer is not there.&nbsp; (
 understandably, file preview comes up with nothing either ).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any suggestions other than doorstop service?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>As you are not able to access the files it does seem that the hard drive has gone corrupt. I would suggest you
 to backup any data if possible. You may have to format the hard drive after performing the backup. You can even contact a local tech support shop for assistance on the issue.

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

<h2>            Skype update went wrong</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a great old skype account with money, names, telephone numbers and account details like photo etc. But the version was old and today I updated to the new one. However, I was caused to sign in ten times with new and new password and providing my telephone
 number to get access codes as if someone is spying on me and getting all private info from me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more, my old skype account with all my data is gone, now i am caused to make it from the scratch.</p>
<p>Also I had 3eur plus on my account....</p>
<p>How come that this data is deleted and I am not allowed to use it any more?</p>
<p>Or may be it is not gone yet.</p>
<p>Please help as I am very much upset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is a possibility you are signed in to a different account if you are not seeing your Skype Credit and your contacts in Skype. You may try signing out and signing in using your old log in credentials (Skype name and password).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have forgotten your password, but can remember your Skype name or email address associated with your account, you can do password reset.

                    <p>On a Windows 7 x64 notebook I've been using CutePDF sucessfully for many years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently when I run the program I get the Save As dialog box and when I select "Save" the file does not actually save anywhere as a PDF.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've reinstalled the program and still to no avail.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-069 – Critical<br />
<br />
I Installed this update and now COD4: MW 2 blue screens after a few minutes of gameplay. This PC has never blue screened before and now I can't play my favorite game. I tried to use system restore to go back to yesterday, but AVG in all its wisdom keeps blocking
 restore from working after restart, saying no files were changed because of antivirus. I tried to turn it off, ____ keeps doing it. maybe i should completely uninstall it. I might just say F it and reformat now. Useless updates. DO NOT INSTALL "Microsoft Security
 Bulletin MS08-069 – Critical" (955218). My beef with microsoft now is, why can't I uninstall the update? It isn't located on the uninstall section, you can only review your update history. why can't I uninstall the security update? What's the point?? I felt
 like I bought a car with no wheels and a printer with no USB cable (HP printers; nice joke)<br />

</p><p>The strange thing is the timing:&nbsp; exactly 60 mins from boot comes the failure and a reboot.&nbsp; The message states that it is collecting data about the failure.&nbsp; where is it and what am I looking for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; thanks,</p>

<h2>            Wireless Card Problems</h2>
                    Hello, I've been have Issues with My Wifi card for a while now and I don't know what to do.
<div>A little Info about my Laptop:</div>
<div>Dell Inspiron 14r N4010 Laptop&nbsp;</div>
<div>had for two years now.</div>
<div>I have Windows 7 (64bit)</div>
<div>Wireless provider: &nbsp;Verizon</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've been having issues with my laptop for the pass year now. When I first got the laptop it was running perfectly fine with no problems. It wasn't until around last year in May that the issues with my wifi card started. &nbsp;At first the card would be on
 and running&nbsp;perfectly&nbsp;fine but at random it would just shut off the wireless card but then come back on a&nbsp;couple&nbsp;of&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;later. A&nbsp;couple&nbsp;of months down the line the wireless card just stopped coming on and it wasn't even appearing in my&nbsp;computer, also all
 my usb ports and speakers stopped working and I kept on getting a message saying that the GFXUI wasn't working either. I sent it off to get fixed being under warranty and the company fixed it. Everything was working for a while and I wasn't getting the messages
 but then 2-3 months later all the same issues started to come back, (wireless card, USB ports, speakers all not working plus GFXUI message&nbsp;appeared&nbsp;again plus others) I even had two instances where my computer would just freeze and then go to blue screen saying
 that it was dumping my memory. &nbsp;I managed to shut the computer off before it could, when I turned the computer back on the system was working fine and all my stuff was still on it. &nbsp;After that I sent it back off to the same company that I still had a warranty
 under to fix it again. Now this time the company wiped my entire hard drive clean &nbsp;and fixed up USB ports and speakers. &nbsp;the Wireless card works too but now it won't connect to any wireless networks at all.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked my entire system, updated all the drivers, made sure I have the right drivers,&nbsp;re-installed&nbsp;them twice &nbsp;and made sure the card was on by pressing the F2 button. Each and every time resulted in the same thing wireless card is on but it's not finding
 any wireless routers. Only when I'm connected to it router through my ethernet wire can I go on the internet. &nbsp;At this point I'm really fed up with the computer and considering&nbsp;getting&nbsp;a new one but I am unable to so at the time and really want to keep this
 laptop if I can. Thanks for looking.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>It is a hardware issue with the wireless card and not the operating system if replacing the card helps. I would suggest you to

<h2>            The Device manager not working properly - can&#39;t select &#34;Action&#34; tab - no drop-down menu</h2>
                    <p>Lost Audio, sound, bluetooth, camera, and microphone icons in the device manager after the 1709 upgrade. can't upgrade with drivers i there's nothing to select to update, de-, or re-install. One next step that was suggested was to select the "Action" tab
 in the device manager, and select "scan for hardware changes" from the drop-down menu.&nbsp; Tried; there is no action when i click action. No drop-down menu. Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously something went wrong with the upgrade - my laptop worked great before it. I have reset and done two new clean installs with same result, it boots up with a red X next to the speaker symbol, and when i go in to the device manager all those features
 are missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help i can get,</p>
<p>

<p>ok... I'm new to this. I have downloaded a new driver package from the manufacturer, but how do I install them if there are now symbols, i.e. the speaker / sound symbol in the device manager? Also, i had to unzip the files and there are now .exe files. I
 think I know how to install manually, but what do i select before i direct the pc to load new drivers from the desktop?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, shoudnn't the action tab in the device manager work?</p>

<h2>            Problem in accessing Shared Printers on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Old title: Windows 10 and Devices &amp; Printers</p>
<p>I upgraded two computers from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Both are in the same workgroup and the same Homegroup.&nbsp; When I click on "Devices and Printers" of each computer and select the "Add Printer" option, neither computer shows any printers available
 to add, even though each computer has an attached printer which is shared.&nbsp; How do I get Windows 10 to recognized the shared printers of the other computer and to add them?</p>

            <p>Hello Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to see the Computers through HomeGroup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below mentioned steps and see if they help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Click <strong>Start</strong>,</p>
<p>* Type <strong>Device and Printers </strong>into the search space and select the same from the list.</p>
<p>* Click <strong>Add a Printer, </strong></p>
<p>* Then windows will start searching for printers throughout your entire network. Usually, it finds the printer you want. Sometimes it doesn’t. The wizard should show you a list of found printers.
</p>
<p>* If you see the printer listed there, then select the printer, click the <strong>
Next </strong>button and follow the on-screen instructions to add the printer.</p>
<p>* If not, then click <strong>The printer that I want isn't listed, </strong>then use the appropriate options and follow the on-screen instructions to add the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the wizard doesn’t display the printer you want to install, you can install it by typing its name into the Printer text box under the
<strong>Select a Shared Printer by Name </strong>option. The name should be in the form
<span>\\host\printer. </span>Substitute for
<span>host</span> the name of the printer’s host computer. Substitute for
<span>printer</span> the share name of the shared printer (look on the host computer’s Printers list). The completed name should look something like this:
<span>\\Computer\Pri1</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.&nbsp; Each computer sees the other as a member of the Homegroup.&nbsp; But neither printer will find any printers when using the Add a Printer wizard, not even printers which are attached to the computer by USB or LPT1.&nbsp; This makes no sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, in the effort to get the computer to recognize a printer that is attached, I ended up with four copies of the printer driver.&nbsp; I cannot delete the extra copies, even when the I delete the printer in Devices &amp; Printers and then use the printui utility.&nbsp;
 Even though the printer is deleted after clearing all documents sent to it, the printui utility will not let me delete the printer by saying that it is in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can browse other Homegroup computers and set up printers that way, but it seems that Windows 10 is not as advanced as Windows 7 in adding and deleting printers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I delete the extra copies of the printer drivers?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Apology for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find all installed drivers under <strong>Programs and Features </strong>
in <strong>Control Panel</strong>.&nbsp;From there you can be able to remove the Printer Drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press <strong>Windows Key</strong>, type <strong>
Control Panel </strong>and select the same from the list.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Locate the printer driver which you want to remove, then click

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. Restart your computer after you uninstall the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But make sure to keep the driver which made the printer working.</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply, but it doesn't address the problem.&nbsp; None of the printers have drivers which show up in Programs.&nbsp; Apparently, I have 3 copies of the HP LaserJet 6 driver installed.&nbsp; One only shows up in Devices and Printers, but three show up on
 a Homegroup computer.&nbsp; Is there no way to delete the extra copies of these drivers?<br />

            <p>I have the same problem KennethBush. &nbsp;Under the NETWORK folder I see three extra printers none of which I can delete. &nbsp;I can open one of these to see what is printing but two give me the same error as I get when trying to install the printer of same name
 that is located on my home network. &nbsp;I get the idea that my computer is using that driver or whatever we may call it to connect to the network printer but since its contaminated it fails. &nbsp;You can UNHIDE hidden drivers within the device manager but even doing
 that does not show these. &nbsp;It only shows printers that you installed at some point but that device is currently not connected. &nbsp;Once connected those are no longer hidden.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to unhide ...</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/315539</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone knows how to remove these so I can get a fresh start that would be awesome.</p>

            <p>KennethBush,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to find a means of deleting the erroneous HOMEGROUP drivers however, I was able to resolve my issue. &nbsp;I simply changed the name of the shared PRINTER and rebooted my desktop. &nbsp;My laptop immediately recognized the new shared printer and loaded
 the driver. &nbsp;I didn't have to touch a thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an attempt to remove the old conflicting driver of same name, I removed the laptop from the network and then rejoined. &nbsp;Unfortunately that did not eliminate the driver being shown in the NETWORK folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In closure, MS should offer a tool to flush the homegroup devices / drivers and allow them to be reconstituted upon joining.</p>

<h2>            Windows License Expiring</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(80, 0, 80, 1)">I woke up this morning to my computer having a notification saying my windows license is expiring. last I checked a license doesn't just expire,
 though I may be wrong. the issue may have come up because I bought the computer used, and the previous owner set the computer up with an organization that i don't know of. I'm not sure what to do about it as so far everything I've read online or tried has
 been unsuccessful, both for trying to remove myself from whatever organization and trying to fix my expiration issue. At this point any kind of help would be appreciated as I put a lot of money into this computer, and i don't have any for another one.</span>

            Hi Nicron10 
<br />
<br />You are correct, genuine Windows 10 does not expire
<br />
<br />I am sorry, but the previous owner has installed the volume licence version of Windows 10 Pro and that was activated with an illegal KMS Emulator, this is all too common with purchasing used devices . . .
<br />
<br />The volume licence needs to be re-armed on a regular basis by a companies Key Management Server - that is the organisation being referred to on the activation page . . 
<br />
<br />You are not going to be able to activate that version of Windows 10 installed on that PC
<br />
<br />Is there a Windows sticker on the casing of that PC and if so, what exactly is printed on that sticker?       
        </p>

            Hi Nicron.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The error normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.
<br />
<br />Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated for free Upgrade and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.
<br />
<br />If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install. Then we'll see if it activates:
<br />
<br />1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.
<br />
<br />2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk
<br />
<br />3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for WIndows 10 Pro from here: <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-</a>...
<br />
<br />This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:
<br />
<br />What Windows Operating System came on that exact model PC originally - you can google it's make and model to read the specs to find out? If it says Windows 7, 8 or 8.1 Home version then that is a clue you need to reinstall Home instead of Pro to try to activate. We might even be able to still activate it fresh with a Windows 8/8.1 Product Key read from the BIOS or on the Windows 7 COA sticker on the PC, or any of those retail keys.
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to reinstall the licensed Windows edition that came with that PC, or buy a copy of retail Windows 10 to reinstall (if necessary) and activate it. I would buy only from a major retailer who backs their sales or Microsoft here: <a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US</a>...
<br />
<br />If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it.  You can report this to Microsoft here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>.  In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the seller and let him/her know you are taking these actions and that to avoid prosecution for felony theft and piracy they need to make the activation good.
<br />
<br />I hope having all possible options helps.
<br />
<br />  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Thanks for the help, unfortunately i cant seem to report the person who sold it to me as i don't have much information on him since this was a while back. at the moment all i really have on him is his name. ill probably just stop by BestBuy tomorrow and
 pick up a new copy and reinstall everything, as frankly i want to wipe any trace of him from my computer at this point.

<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            i didnt end up doing what i said, as i didnt want to screw up my computer any more than i had, or the last owner had, already. So instead i handed my computer over to the GeekSquad at BestBuy for a week after explaining my issue, and technically they did
 fix it, but not in the way i had hoped for. Basically they found that the computer originally had windows 10 on it with a working activation code, the issue was he connected it to his "organization" and used it to get windows 10 pro, which meant once i was
 disconnected from the server the original activation code didn't work because it was meant for base windows 10, not pro. What the GeekSquad did was just gave me a new windows 10 pro code, but my computer is still telling me its connected to the
<em>organization</em>,<em> and they didn't fix any of the other issues i explained.&nbsp;</em>what i want to do now is reset my computer completely, but i'm worried when i do that it will either 1:lose the new code meaning i need to pay for another one, or 2: i
 reset back to basic windows 10 and the new code wont work along with the original code not working either.

<p>The Black Ops map packs are region restricted. This means that you can only download them in the region of your account. So if you have a US account you must download them while physically living in the US. If you try to download them from anywhere else
 you will get errors and not be able to get them. </p>
