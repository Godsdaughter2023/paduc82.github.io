            The quota is being exceeded on your email server.<br />
Do you need the emails left on the server?<br />
If the answer is no, open WLMail, right click on the account name in the folder pane, Properties, Advanced tab, uncheck Leave a copy........., OK.

            Hi <span>Rfields947,<br />
<br />
We would like to confirm if you also have emails in your deleted folder as this also consumes total available quota in your mailbox. You may delete this if there's any.<br />
<br />
If you do not wish to leave emails on the server, kindly follow MVP Ron Sommer's instructions.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

Disk Cleanup also should remove it:&nbsp; Start &gt; Run &gt; cleanmgr.exe &gt; OK<br />

<p>I haven't tried to delete the drwtsn32.log file, knowing that it won't fit into the Recycle bin.</p>
<p>Thanks for the command for Disk Cleanup. I'll use it in a few minutes.</p>
<p>I just unchecked the "Append to existing log file" checkbox, on the advice of another forum member.</p>
<p>As to your last question, I have limited disk space available, so I have put off downloading SP3. Yesterday, I downloaded a trial version of Diskeeper, which runs as a Windows service. Already, Diskeeper has unfragmented what free space I have left (about
 25%). So, once I run Disk Cleanup, and I allow at least another 24 hours for Diskeeper to continue to defrag my hard disk, I will feel comfortable in downloading the long-overdue SP3 and other updates.</p>
<p>Thanks for your great advice.</p>

</blockquote>
<br />
FYI, if you delete a file that's too big to fit into the Recycle Bin, it deletes anyway.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Or if you press the Shift key together with the Delete key, the selected file(s) just delete without going to the Recycle Bin regardless of file size.<br />

<br />
<br />
You can limit the size used by the Recycle Bin.&nbsp; By default, XP sets the Recycle Bin to 10% of the partition.&nbsp; In your case, that would be around 2 GB.&nbsp; If you right click on the Recycle Bin and select Properties, you can adjust the size allocation.&nbsp; This,
 of course, reduces the maximum size of a file that can be saved in the Recycle Bin when deleted.&nbsp; If you adjust the size of your Recycle Bin to, e.g., 1 GB, then when you delete any file over 1 GB it will just permanently delete with no warning.&nbsp; In general

            Hi MD.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Find the IDE/ATA driver in Device manager,  Open and choose the Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Automatically. Next  Right click to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.  If that fails to help then choose Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick and try all previous drivers queued there. 
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

            Hi Greg, magicdragon1 again. I have reset and refreashed my O.S. I deleted RW drive and drivers one by one and restarted it every time. I tried the hide update tool. it did it's thing for about 2 hours but never fixed anything. but you were saying something
 about this 1809 update and I checked and bingo that is in my updates. But I'm striking out so far. I think it my be that the values in the PCI &amp; SCSI may be wrong?&nbsp; oh and those things are what shows up in the events for the RW DRIVE.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            The Hide Updates tool doesn't fix anything, it only searches for and finds available Updates so you can catch and hide them so they won't install.  
<br />
<br />Did you identify an Update that caused your problem and are attempting to hide it?  Was Verison 1809 previously installed and you rolled it back due to problems it caused?
<br />
<br />If not since you say Version 1809 is listed now to install, What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can use another PC to create the bootable media or download the ISO to transfer  back to the problem PC and open the media or click to mount the iSO file, right click Setup to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />If further problems then following these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />These special steps lead up to if necessary choosing to save nothing when running the media which almost always works, and is close but not as good as a Clean Install which is also offered as an option.  Your files should always be backed up if you value them at all. 
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then immediately after it fails try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean Installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Greg Magicdragon1 (Steven) I think I tried everything you have mentioned but I ran the media creation tool and I myself was thinking that was going to work but no. Still have the same issue. I was checking out the ISCSI properties and there isn't any
 really. only 2 places it said anything. Target portal 3260 default and there is an Initiator name. and when I try to do a recovery and I make a date. IT will never go to that date. it always goes to the same day I'm doing it. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>This is my computer. I was the only administrator on it. I stopped using it for about 5 years. Now I'm using it again. I had administrator privileges originally. Now Belarc says they have been disabled. I suspect that explains why updates won't install.
 Whether that's true or not, I want to re-enable admin privileges. Neither of the things already mentioned worked for me. Now what?</p>

<h2>            Faulty Xbox damaged in transit, labeled as &#38;quot&#59;Tampered&#38;quot&#59;, &#36;70 extended warranty voided</h2>
                    
<p>Hey anyone and everyone, I am having serious issues with my Xbox One experience.</p>
<p>I recently decided to trade my Xbox 360 Slim in for a brand new Limited Edition Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare Xbox One on the November 3rd Day Zero release.&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/IvAbbCb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">It was beautiful</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a little bit, I noticed that COD:AW kept on crashing to dashboard. After some fruitless troubleshooting with Xbox Support, I had the good idea to factory reset, download some free games, and then download COD:AW. Turns out, this worked, which indicates
 a bad sector of memory.</p>
<p>Soon after, I tried to play a BluRay disk, and the optical drive just clicked repeatedly and did not read the disk. The same occurred with DVDs, so I sent my Xbox One in for repair.</p>
<p>A little over a week later my package arrived in at the Microsoft repair facility. After obsessively checking the Xbox MyService website for a week and a half, it finally showed that my Xbox One was on its way back. I was so excited! I did notice that my
 warranty showed 1 Jan 1900, which was concerning since I had purchased the extra two years, but I decided not to worry about it until my Xbox came in.</p>
<p><strong>Another week and a half later,</strong>&nbsp;my prized console came back. I opened it up and noticed that the&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/ZgEfzrr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">console was warped and had lots of damage</a>. You can't really tell from that one picture, but the corners
 are warped and shattered, there is major damage to the venting (almost half were sheared at the bottom). I also noticed that the anti-tampering sticker had not be re-affixed properly and there was a letter included that said my expensive warranty had been
 voided due to tampering. I knew this was probably due to the damage incurred from shipping, so I called Xbox Customer Support again to get it sorted out. They told me that I could never get my extended warranty back, and that I would have to pay for out of
 warranty repairs, which could be up to $150. I explained to them the situation, but they would not budge: the console has been listed as "Tampered" and would never get an extended warranty again, even though it was only the external anti-tamper that was damaged,
 and not the internal one (I had to press them a little bit to get this information).</p>
<p>After calling back the next day, when the higher-ups were there (I asked for an escalation), I was informed that nothing had changed and that I would have to contact FedEx and file a claim, even though the shipping was paid for through contract with Microsoft.
 They would not work with FedEx for me. So I contacted FedEx, who asked me to fill out a claim form and include receipts, pictures of the damage, and the damaged shipping box. I called Microsoft back and asked them for any documentation, pictures of the console
 or shipping box, or the box it was shipped in. Unfortunately for me, the warehouse workers do not do any of these things, and the burden of proof was on me.</p>
<p>Has anyone encountered this and had the situation resolved?</p>

<p>On Day 39 with no resolution. I filed a claim with FedEx per Microsoft's direction, after they refused to file a claim for me. A week later, I received a letter stating that my claim had been denied as Microsoft's contract with FedEx specifies that only
 the shipper may file a claim. After contacting Microsoft support, they still refuse to work with FedEx even after giving them the letter. Neither company is taking responsibility for the issue.</p>
<p>I have spent $80 on packing, shipping, and gas in order to get this fixed. I have spent 9 hours and 4 minutes working with Microsoft and FedEx on this issue and my $560 COD:AW Xbox One with voided extended warranty is still not fixed.</p>

<p>The same thing happened to me. I got a thermal shutdown error. I called in for repair, shipped the xbox one the same day. As above I got feedback that my xbox was on the way back same time frame and I got the news the same way by looking at my account and
 seeing warranty void. I have a few scratches from traveling on the console. Some idiot labeled my xbox as tampered with which the sticker is still in tact. Why would I purchase a warranty and open my xbox thats just stupid. I'm just about done with xbox. Thanks
 for losing an unvalued customer.</p>

<p>Did either of you get a resolution? &nbsp;Microsoft support still won't honor my warranty and are claiming that no shipping box damage was noted at McAllen or the Mexico repair facility.
</p>
<p>You should file a report with IGN, &nbsp;they have this thing called "IGN Has Your Back".</p>
<p>This issue is starting to look like a trend, and I think IGN will help resolve it if we all report it to them.</p>

<p>Supriseingly yes. I received a email from "global escalatetions" today with a apology and a code for a free 12 month. Never seen them own up to somthing but I have to give credit when it's due. Haven't tried the code yet but it's official mail so I assume
 it's valid. I don't know if they saw my post here and looked into or if it was the chat I had with them or the email I sent but someone listened to my side and investigated</p>

<p>Did they reverse the tampering tag on your Xbox as well? How long did it take before they fixed the issue?</p>
<p>They are trying to get me to pay $150 to fix my Xbox out of warranty, which is a complete sham considering I paid $70 for the extended warranty. &nbsp;Even if i did pay to have it fixed, &nbsp;my extended warranty would be gone forever.</p>
<p>They offered me $60 of free xbox live, which is stupid because my Xbox is still broken.</p>
<p>At this point, I just want a refund. This has been an awful experience...</p>

<p>For mine they did send me a new Xbox so idk why would they send a new one if my old was was tamperd? I just think on mine someone made a mistake. Yours does sound like more of a mess I always wondered what happens if somthing was damaged in shipping surprise
 the shipping company won't pay for it who would have thought? The box my Xbox came in was also damaged but not the contents thank god.</p>

<h2>            Wireless Adapter keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire One D257-1497 (running Windows7 starter) which had a recent virus problem with Dos/rovnix.gg.&nbsp; With help from&nbsp; (D09r) dinesh this problem was resolved.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I seem to have developed an additional problem.&nbsp; Everything worked
 fine until two days ago.&nbsp; Windows OneDrive started loading automatically and I got the message that the virus pws:win32/zbot had been discovered and removed.&nbsp; It also said that since this virus collects passwords; I should change my passwords immediately.&nbsp;
 I have changed my passwords; but ever since this problem popped up, I have been unable to connect to the internet with my wireless adapter.&nbsp; It sometimes will connect; but drops the connection immediately when it tries to access my hope page. I've removed
 OneDrive from startup, since I never use it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've done a full scan using Microsoft Secruity Essentials and have not found any viruses.&nbsp; I contacted Acer and reinstalled the wireless adapter.&nbsp; I checked to be sure all the router settings were correct.&nbsp; I'm
 still unable to connect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not sure where to go from here.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; It seems odd that the problem started with the last Windows update that downloaded OneDrive.&nbsp; I'm not sure there's a connection with that update or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any help will be
 appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you. </p>

            Hi Emmanuel.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Everything else possible to get WIndows 10 to start is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then you can do the automated Reset here <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-reset-your-pc-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-re...</a> or if you want the very best install  follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Emmanuel, since that reset operation is not completing (probably due to lack of space) your best option is to clean install Windows 10, which will also repair your Recovery Image . .. 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Please Note on a HP Stream, you should install the 32bit version of Windows 10, which will give you a lot more space on your drive . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<div>In these instances it is impossible to bring the active window to the front with e.g. Alt-Tab. The only way to get the active window to display is to minimise the window that is "blocking the view".</div>

            <p>Hi Per,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. How long have you been facing this issue?<br />
2. Did you make any recent hardware or software changes on your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><strong>Method 1: Check if the issue persists in safe mode (Step 1). If the issue does not persist in safe mode then, perform clean boot (Step 2) on your computer.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong></div>
<div>a. Restart the computer<br />
b. Start tapping F8 key<br />
c. You will get advanced boot option window<br />
d. Select the option “Safe mode”</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>Starting your computer by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. This kind of startup is known as a "Clean boot."<br />
<div><strong>Follow the steps provide in the below article to perform clean boot.
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> Check if the issue persist in new user account.<br />
<div><strong>Create a user account</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows7/Create-a-user-account</font></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it works in a new user account then you need to fix the corrupt user profile. You may visit this link for the steps:<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Also please have a look at the below article which might help you.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</strong></div>

This is a brand new computer (Dell Precisioin M6700) and I am only in the process of installing the relevant programs. In other words, it is not filled with "old junk".
<br />
<br />
1.<br />
I have noticed the issue for a few days. It is somewhat difficult to check if the error persists in safe mode since the error is not persistent. It only appears "sometimes". So it would mean working continuously in safe mode, which is not a good option.<br />
<br />
2. <br />
Lots of software changes since I am in the process of installing all the applications and drivers that need to be on the system: Office, printers, browsers etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
I will try your suggestions.<br />

It seems something entirely different is the cause of this problem:<br />
<br />
There is a screen management program on the computer that is called Dell PremierColor. It has a function called "display splitter" that seems to be what is causing the problem with the windows. If I disable "display splitter" the problem disappears.<br />
<br />
I happened to find that solution reading this thread on another support forum:<br />
<a href="http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3519/t/19440023.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3519/t/19440023.aspx</a><br />
<br />
Towards the end of the thread you see that solution proposed by a tech person from Portrait Displays Inc (perhaps they are the company behind PremierColor?).<br />

I have run the System File Checker and it gave no error.<br />
<br />
For the other two suggestions:<br />
<br />
The computer only have one (administration) user account and I don't want to create accounts for no compelling reason.<br />
<br />
Since the issue appeared on a brand new clean computer I find it hard to believe that it would be a corrupt user account or that it would be a corrupt driver or interfering application (except the "display splitter").<br />
<br />
I have tried a few times to turn Display Splitter on and off and each time the behaviour has been consistent.<br />

<p>Killed explorer and reinstalled</p>
<p>Downloaded registry file to enable thumbnail view for all users.</p>
<p>System restore is out because this happened probably 2 years ago, but lived with this issue but want to fix it now</p>
<p>
</p><p>Need help been trying to fix this for the past several months no luck, the pic below will show what's on my desktop when I open my my pictures folder. I have pictures on my desktop that will show partially but something is blocking the images, pics do not
 show in my pictures folder, &nbsp;on the app bar at the bottom of the screen photos do not show there either.</p>

</p><p>Lawrence,</p>
<p>I had done this before (sfc/ scannnow) as I tried to resolve this issue with pictures not showing as thumbnails in my pictures and on my desktop but I ran it again as you suggested. No issues found. Screenshot below but issue is still not resolved. I also
 checked restore defaults on my pictures program before. Still not getting thumbnails to show, refer to prior pictures posted of my pictures &amp; desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the next step?</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the system file checker tool didn't find any error when you ran the scan, we recommend that you manually delete the icon cache by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Command Prompt, </strong>right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> on the search results and select <strong>Run as Administrator<br />
<br />
</strong></li><li>Type the following command to navigate to the icon cache database location and press Enter:
<strong><br />
cd %homepath%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer <br />
<br />
</strong></li><li>Type the following command to verify the icon cache database files are at the location and press Enter:
<strong><br />
dir iconcache*<br />
<br />
Note:</strong> The output of the dir command should list these database files:<br />
concache_1280.db<br />
iconcache_16.db<br />
iconcache_1920.db<br />
iconcache_256.db<br />
iconcache_2560.db<br />
iconcache_32.db<br />
iconcache_48.db<br />
iconcache_768.db<br />
iconcache_96.db<br />
iconcache_custom_stream.db<br />
iconcache_exif.db<br />
iconcache_idx.db<br />
iconcache_sr.db<br />
iconcache_wide.db<br />
iconcache_wide_alternate.db <strong><br />
<br />
</strong></li><li>Type the following command to stop File Explorer and press Enter: <strong>taskkill /f /im explorer.exe<br />
</strong><strong><br />
Important:</strong> Once you terminate File Explorer, your desktop background and taskbar will disappear, leaving a black screen — but it's OK, it's only temporarily. You need to close File Explorer to be able to delete the icon cache files. Otherwise, you
 won't be able to do it<br />
<br />
</li><li>Type the following command to delete the iconcache files and press Enter: <strong>
del iconcache*<br />
</strong><strong><br />
Note:</strong> If you get access denied trying to remove the files, you're probably not running Command Prompt with as an administrator. Repeat these steps, but making sure Command Prompt starts with administrative privileges<br />
<br />
</li><li>Type the following command to verify that you successfully deleted the icon cache files and press Enter:
<br />
<strong>dir iconcache*<br />
<br />
</strong><strong>Note:</strong> If you still see some iconcache files, then it's likely that some apps are still running, which will prevent you from deleting the database files. Make sure to close all open programs on the taskbar and repeat the steps again.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Type the following command to start File Explorer and press Enter: <strong>explorer.exe</strong><br />
<br />
</li><li>Restart your computer and check if the issue persists<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Keep us updated with the results of the solution above.</p>

<p>I had done something like this before your instructions are a little different but I will follow. But the question I have is when I do this don't I have to reinstall explorer or this only effects iconcache only?</p>

<p>You don't need to reinstall the explorer.exe, just enable the explorer.exe after step number 6. This should take care of the icons and thumbnails as well.</p>

    <title>Blurry Text in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blurry Text in Windows 8</h2>
                    I did a clean install of Windows 8 RTM when it became available.<br />
<br />
The blurry font rendering that plagued the Preview versions has remained.<br />
<br />
It is particularly bad in IE10 and Office 2013.<br />
<br />
No amount of adjustment with Clear Type tuner helps much. <br />
I have tried all the fixes recommended like ticking "use Software rendering instead of GPU rendering" in IE10 and in Options in Office 2013.<br />
It makes absolutely no difference. <br />
<br />
I installed Windows 8 on completely different hardware to check if it was a graphics card issue. The poor font rendering was still there.
<br />
<br />
I am currently dual booting Windows 7 and 8 on the same PC. Fonts in Windows 7 remain perfectly clear. In windows 8 they are so bad, the OS is basically unusable.<br />
<br />
How do I get readable fonts in Windows 8?<br />
<br />
Hardware: ASUS P8Z77-V PRO, Intel Core i7 3770K, ASUS Radeon HD7770 graphics, Samsung Syncmaster 2443BW 24 inch monitor.<br />

<h2>            How to disable &#34;pick up where you left off&#34; when Cortana is disabled in your country&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This new "pick up where you left off" feature is driving me and the family absolutely nuts.</p>
<p>Frankly, it's so ******* annoying (like browser with Youtube going ham before you even finished logging into windows, waking up your kids), and I can't even find any way to get rid of it. All suggestions for how to turn off this complete piece of **** assumes
 you have Cortana. Which we don't in Sweden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone really didn't think this one through, releasing a "feature" that you can't even disable in most countries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now you have to really think about what you're doing when you Shut Down your computer. Which is absolute insanity. You should just be able to Shut Down and move on with your life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And on top of all this, the "feature" is completely unnecessary since it was already available but in a way that made sense: Sleep and Hibernate. THAT is "pick up where you left off" done right. "Shut down" means power off, and a fresh start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand what you were thinking and how "seamless" it would be, but from an actual user perspective, this is complete garbage. It's not what the user wants. It's counter intuitive. It messes with your process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I disable it? I assume there are registry settings for this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Pick up where I left off </strong>feature&nbsp;will display quick links in the Action Center so you can quickly jump back into your Microsoft Edge session and SharePoint documents after switching PCs.<span>
</span></span>If Cortana is not available on your country/region, we suggest that you change it to United States for a while and follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Cortana icon</strong>. Click on the <strong>notebook </strong>

<p>Ok, so the above proposed solution has nothing to do with this issue. It's not related to "Pick up where i left off".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a new "feature" in Windows that adds a registry key in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce"&nbsp;for each open application which will cause them to restart when the computer boots up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I've found so far is to create a script that runs on logoff which removes all these registry entries. It is described in TWO posts by user "Clickbangdead" here:&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_perf-insiderplat_pc/programs-autostart-after-boot-in-windows-10-fall/09dd8d3e-7b36-45d1-9181-6587dd5d53ab?messageId=552051d1-b7e5-4709-826a-cce7d243086a</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for sharing with us the steps that worked for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, the behavior you described will happen if the <strong>Pick up where I left off</strong> option is enabled. Have you tried to turn it off to see if it'll make a difference? Have you tried following the steps provided by
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c92f7f39-0bc8-49e6-bbcf-ee63635ff2d4" title="Janeane Cru">
Janeane Cru</a>? Once disabled, none of the apps you were using will start automatically the next time you restart the PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a try and let us know how it turns out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            network64.msi missing in hp printer windows 10 installation</h2>
                    I'm running Windows 10 and had my HP C4580 wireless printer running with 2 PCs on a network. One PC got its printer screwed up so I totally uninstalled all HP stuff shut down, started again and re-installed the printer. Now it can't complete the install
 because it says it can't find a path to network64.msi. All references to this file are older than Windows 10.

<h3> capnshizzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Critical Stucture Error &#40;Blue Screen&#41;</h2>
                    Every 15-20 minutes, my computer restarts. I just built my computer, and am stumped as to how to fix this, since I have all my drivers updated. I checked the event logs, and the cause of it seems to be:<br />
<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
The EventSystem sub system is suppressing duplicate event log entries for a duration of 86400 seconds.&nbsp; The suppression timeout can be controlled by a REG_DWORD value named SuppressDuplicateDuration under the following registry key: HKLM\Software\Microsoft\EventSystem\EventLog.<br />
Event Xml:<br />
&lt;Event xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/win/2004/08/events/event"&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;System&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Provider Name="Microsoft-Windows-EventSystem" Guid="{899daace-4868-4295-afcd-9eb8fb497561}" EventSourceName="EventSystem" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;EventID Qualifiers="16384"&gt;4625&lt;/EventID&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Version&gt;0&lt;/Version&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Level&gt;4&lt;/Level&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Task&gt;0&lt;/Task&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Opcode&gt;0&lt;/Opcode&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Keywords&gt;0x80000000000000&lt;/Keywords&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;TimeCreated SystemTime="2013-12-01T05:10:14.000000000Z" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;EventRecordID&gt;3062&lt;/EventRecordID&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Correlation /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Execution ProcessID="0" ThreadID="0" /&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Channel&gt;Application&lt;/Channel&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Computer&gt;PECK-PC&lt;/Computer&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Security /&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;/System&gt;<br />
&nbsp; &lt;EventData&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Data Name="param1"&gt;86400&lt;/Data&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;Data Name="param2"&gt;SuppressDuplicateDuration&lt;/Data&gt;<br />

&nbsp; &lt;/EventData&gt;<br />
&lt;/Event&gt;<br />

This is from the most recent, which happened which seemed to be a couple hours since the last reboot.<br />

<p>Means exactly what it says, the vulnerability has been publically exposed, so the world knows about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are confusing this with "actively exploited" or some other measure of the likelihood that an exploit might be created now or in the future.</p>

            1. Go to the Settings in your phone, locate Skype and reset Skype.
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work 
<br />a. Uninstall the Skype app by pressing and holding the Skype app icon. Tap the 'X' in the corner and then accept the confirmation message to delete it.
<br />
<br />b. Perform a “soft reset” by pressing and holding both the Sleep/Wake and Home buttons simultaneously for at least 10 seconds until you see the Apple logo. You can let go of both buttons after the Apple logo appears.
<br />
<br />c. Reinstall the Skype app from the App Store.

            Its likely a bug, I recommend you file a bug report. 
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">We are sorry to be the bearer of the bad news, the option to retain the all notification of Skype without opening it is not yet incorporated on the new Skype.
 However, if you are using Windows 10 operating system, all notification can be seen on the action center located at the lower right corner of your system tray. I would also like to take this time to thank you for notifying us about this particular limitation
 you have experienced firsthand. The new Skype version is still a work in a progress but we are continuously studying through everyone's feedback and input about this new version. Definitely, we acknowledge that there are quite a few features and functionalities
 we have to constantly work on and fix in the upcoming updates. In addition, I would appreciate if you can formally submit/vote this feedback to our website where we get all your inputs and about our software design and limitation. Here is the link:<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong><em>https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas</em></strong>. Again, we would like to thank you for your utmost understanding and patience regarding this matter and we really are grateful for your feedback.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Know that we are listening to you as we make the improvements along the way!</span></p>
