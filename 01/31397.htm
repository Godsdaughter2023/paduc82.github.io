<h2>            I have a metered connection. How will I deal with this in Windows 10 Home&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My allowance doesn't have much leeway as it is. Being able to select the option to Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them is extremely important to me. I would like to upgrade to Win. 10, but quite simply I do not know how
 I'll be able to deal with automatic updates, even if they were small ones, because it would affect my allowance. Any assistance would be appreciated in making this decision. Thank you!</p>

</p><p>The only solution is to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro if you want to avoid this or wait a little while until you are on a better Internet connection. You have one year to update.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how this concerns you, let me help you to resolve this issue. Are you logged in as the administrator when you download applications? Are the other accounts standard accounts?</p>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>Usually when an administrator downloads and installs the app, it might be shared with standard users if he has given permission when installing the application. in other scenarios, an application can be installed on 5 different computers, however if there
 are multiple users on the same computer, the administrator has to log in and download and install the application on the other users.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please feel free to contact us, if you face any issues with Windows.<br />

Thank you.</div>

</p><p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>In our company we also have this problem. Many of our users (not all) complain that the audio device changes from headphones to speakers only lot of times at week.&nbsp;The version of Skype for Business we have is 2016 MSO (16.0.10325.20082).<br />

Thank you very much, </p>

<p>Hello José Manuel Valle Gómez, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that the issue happens to many users since the update. Based on my tests in the latest version of Skype for Business Version 1808 (Build 10730.20102), I cannot reproduce the same issue. So it is suggested to update to the latest version to see
 if it can help to fix the issue. Meanwhile, from the description it seems that the Skype for Business will revert the settings after you re-open it. You can also try to use the
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-US/Article/Repair-an-Office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Online repair</a> to see if it can help. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue persists, please capture a screenshot of the Audio Device settings and let me know if the unaffected users have the same version of Skype for Business client.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rick</p>

            Its back and happening to me again - switches to "speakers only" after a reboot. I'll check if I have the latest version, although I should because I have automatic updates turned on.

<h2>            What is ubcore</h2>
                    now i was going through my sisters laptop as i am familiar with most things until i came across a programme called ubcore by unibrain, does anyone know what it is and what it does and is it 100% okay to uninstall without messing anything up i did a quick
 research on it but hardly got any results.<br />
<br />
oh my sisters laptop is a Dell Inspiron 6400, win XP sp3, 1GbRAM, 150GbHDD 1.83GHz intel celeron processor i have told her repeatedly to get a new one but making her part with the laptop is trying to part the red sea<br />

            <p>Hi Aimee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would&nbsp;inform that&nbsp;when a picture is set as the&nbsp;User Account profile picture, the system will automatically check the dimensions&nbsp;to check the size and it will check the center of the image and set it as the display&nbsp;picture for the User Account. It is by
 design.&nbsp;The image cannot be positioned or moved to the desired&nbsp;dimension for the&nbsp;image display. I suggest you to use the Feedback Hub App to provide any feedback/suggestion regarding the issue&nbsp;which&nbsp;will be looked into by the developers and the required changes
 will be&nbsp;made in the release of future windows 10 builds/updates.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Just upgraded from 32-bit to 64-bit but hard-drive shows the same &#37; used</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>I've recently purchased your Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 64-Bit - OEM (GFC-00599)&nbsp; to upgrade my previous Windows 7 32-Bit. I had 6GB of ram and only 3 were being used.</p>
<p>After doing the upgrade/install my hardrive has stayed the same as it was before the upgrade. (about 3/4 full), however the files which were originally there e.g. programs; aren't anymore yet the space has still been used.</p>
<p>Do you no what may be causing this and how I can remove everything so I can do it all scratch. Doing the upgrade I was hoping to have it as a fresh install with everything gone. I didn't choose Advanced i.e. the one where it keeps your files I had to choose
 the second option during install (see image below)</p>

<p>1 - Upgrade<br />
Upgrade to a newer version of Windows and keep your files, settings,and programs. The option to upgrade is only available when an existing version of Windows is running. We recommend backing up your files before you proceed.</p>
<p>2 - Custom (Advanced) - <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">THE CHOICE I MADE -- to highlight</span></strong><br />
Install a new copy of Windows. This option does not keep your files, settings, and programs. The option to make changes to disks and partitions is evaluable when you start your computer using the installation disc. We recommend backing up your files before
 you proceed.</p>
<p>I chose option 2 as mentioned above yet still have the files inside my hard-drive.. Just not accessible? Most likely hidden, how can I wipe my hardrive clean and start a fresh.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance<br />

<p>I've never done an 'upgrade' so I don't know what happened to your files, but when you install Windows you will be offered an option to&nbsp; reformat and partition the HDD. This wipes&nbsp; the HDD and makes for the most stable Windows installation. A fresh install
 is more trouble but doing an 'upgrade' (as in installing over the old)&nbsp; is not the best option as you are building on an old foundation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing an upgrade that changes the "bitness" of Windows (from 32-bit to<br />
64-bit, or vice-versa) is <strong>not</strong> possible. A clean installation is the<br />
only way to get from one to the other.</p>
<p>However, regarding upgrading versus clean installing in general,<br />
although many people will tell you that formatting and installing<br />
cleanly is the best way to go, I disagree. Unlike with previous<br />
versions of Windows, when doing an upgrade was often a mistake, an<br />
upgrade to Windows XP or later replaces almost everything, and usually<br />
works very well. The only real exception is when you are having<br />
problems; in that situation, an upgrade often worsens problems, rather<br />
than solving them.</p>
<p>My recommendation is to at least try the upgrade, since it's much<br />
easier than a clean installation. You can always change your mind and<br />
reinstall cleanly if problems develop.</p>
<p>However, don't assume that doing an upgrade relieves you of the need<br />
to backup your data, etc. before beginning. Before starting to<br />
upgrade, it's always prudent to recognize that things like a sudden<br />
power loss can occur in the middle of it and cause the loss of<br />
everything. For that reason you should make sure you have backups and<br />
anything else you need to reinstall if the worst happens. </p>

<p>﻿Hi, Matthew.</p>
<p>You made the right choice, Custom.&nbsp; But you apparently chose to NOT reformat the partition where you installed Win7 x64.&nbsp; A reformat is not strictly necessary for a Custom install, but it is almost always a very good idea.</p>
<p>A reformat would have wiped out 32-bit Win7, along with ALL your program and data files on that partition.&nbsp; Since ALL your applications will need to be re-installed in 64-bit Win7 anyhow, so that their Setup processes can write their entries into the 64-bit
 Win7 Registry, it is pointless to keep their files.&nbsp; Just be sure that you have their CDs or other media to re-install them.</p>
<p>In 32-bit Windows, all applications are normally installed into C:\Program Files.&nbsp; But 64-bit Windows uses that folder only for 64-bit applications! It puts all 32-bit apps into a new folder called C:\Program Files (x86); the (x86) refers to the x86 family
 of CPUs from Intel - 8086, 80286, 80486, etc. Windows x64 uses this system to associate 32-bit and 64-bit apps with the proper dlls, drivers and other support files.</p>
<p>Your preserved data files can still be used after the apps are re-installed; you'll just have to run the apps and browse to the locations of the data. But all the reinstallations will have scrambled the disk locations, making it less efficient.&nbsp; It's much
 better to use WET (Windows Easy Transfer - included with every Windows package) to save your tweaks and data to a safe location (USB flash drive, external hard disk, separate partition, etc.), then let WET restore them after your new installation is up and
 running.</p>
<p>At this stage, Matthew, I would save all the data in a location that will be accessible later, then re-install Win7 x64 from scratch, INCLUDING REFORMATTING of the partition.</p>

            Hi Dave,
<br />
<br />Thank you very much for that information, it is really helpful. 
<br />
<br />Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults.
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />If setup is successful after performing these tasks, you can reinstall each removed component. 
<br />
<br />I also recommend you go over the following steps again:

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try a Send/Receive now. If this doesn't resolve the issue, the download is 
not completing. One message is probably too large or corrupt. Note the last 
message downloaded and the problem message is likely right behind it. Logon to 
your server's Webmail site and see if you can find it and delete it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>E-mail scanning can also play a role in this. Turn off e-mail scanning in 
your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up 
CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such 
as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for loss of 
messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

            <p>You may be interested in this, posted earlier today by an AT&amp;T user:<br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote>The issue is a communication issue between Yahoo and Microsoft (Outlook and Windows Live Mail). I've been told [by an AT&amp;T tech] that they are working directly with Microsoft and when the resolution has been identified, it will be distributed to
 everyone automatically.
<p><br />
In the meantime, I've been able to get in by first logging into Windows Live Mail. If it doesn't work, go to my AT&amp;T/Yahoo home page and click on Member Center. Log in with my email and password. Once logged in, go back to Windows Live Mail and try to retrieve
 my mail again</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may or may not be true; a user in England with another provider 'powered by Yahoo' was told that Yahoo had recently upgraded their servers, and this is what was causing problems with POP3/SMTP access. However, it should be possible to get a confirmation
 or denial of <em>they are working directly with Microsoft, </em>so I'll see if I can.</p>

<h2>            someone is attempting to hack &#40;log into&#41; one of my PCs windows 7 ultimate</h2>
                    <p>Hi - can anyone help me understand? i noticed something weird going on - i personalized my one PC to power off after 10 minutes and have a pass to log back in and, as a rule, simply need to move my mouse or tap a key on my keyboard to power up my monitor
 and see windows and log back in ..but lately ive noticed someone is trying to log in and time after time arent able to figure out my pass..so that part is safe, for now, and are not able to log in..but continually see the message "the user name or password
 is incorrect" and my monitor wont power off as it should based on my settings and it (monitor) stays powered on and can see attempts to log in every so often - luckily my windows 7 remains locked</p>
<p>
</p><p>question is, - if i log in with my pass will that hacker then be able to see / access my pc once logged in? and if so, once i log in what application (s/w) can i use to see if there is a hacker and/or secure my pc even more to prevent this hacker to access
 my pc? not sure if these questions are clear, but all i know is, that pc connects to the internet via a wifi device so im wondering how can they try hacking when i disconnected my device?? makes no sense to me..plus, i checked my router wireless activity and
 doesnt appear like anyone suspicious is connected&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit; </p>
<p>okay, so far my only troubleshooting, is, &nbsp;hard boot my pc and allow it to start in normal mode - the only difference now, the windows page shows my name and my cursor is flashing on my pass field, per usual...the only word i dont see, is, "locked" underneath
 my name, which is normal since its not powered down by power saver settings - okay, just noticed so far, based on my power saving settings, 10 mins later, my monitor shuts down , which means im back to normal as far as that goes</p>
<p>
</p><p>so, now, </p>
<p>can i safely log in without that hacker having access or should i reboot again, and start in safe mode and look for trojans and/or run a scan with (Im using only b/c its free) Microsoft Windows Defender (not sure if thats any better than any other security
 s/w) and so, will it detect whoever this suspicious hacker is and if hiding in some folder? (if that makes any sense)? b/c my thinking is, what if he/she has already accessed my pc when previously logged in? without my knowledge? and without he/she having
 to log in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>another thought? could this be a security glitch (breech) by not installing windows 7 latest security updates? and somehow this is the reason why someone can attack my PC? and is all i have to do is log back in and immediately and safely install the latest
 updates right away? which i should do anyways.. but i need to know if, NOW is safe to log in and run the install all the while the suspected hacker is lurking and waiting to pounce?</p>
<p>
</p><p>also, i had just upgraded windows defender a few days ago and by coincidence the attempts to log in seamed to have started AFTER the latest "Microsoft windows defender upgrade" - &nbsp;yet, my other pc running windows 10 hasnt alerted me to upgrade that version
 (defender) , yet - just an observation b/c it doesnt appear anyone is trying to hack into that machine as opposed to my windows 7 machine - hope im not over thinking this... but it is curious</p>
<p>
</p><p>pls if anyone can help me? i would gladly pay a fee, serious. would appreciate it - cuz im now afraid to log back in to that PC</p>

            <p>are you for real? did you not read my post...most of your questions are already answered and a couple cannot be answered cuz they are pointless, redundant questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>am seeking out advice from a PRO , someone who has/had already experienced this similar matter..not interested in running around in circles..it should be very easy to understand what i posted</p>
<p>
</p><p>all i want to know, is, is it safe to log in now that i hard booted my machine and there is NO sign of a hacker trying to log in...THAT is the bottom line - if you cant answer that, after reading my post?? smh</p>
<p>
</p><p>ill be happy to fill out that survey now, sheesh thanks though for appeasing me, i think</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>edit;</p>
<p>i think it has to do with windows critical updates that was the cause...so thread may be closed, am handling the issue - sorry for the bother</p>

            <p>There are several issues you have brought up, so I'll deal with the most obvious ones first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked the <strong>Event Viewer</strong>? </p>
<p>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools\Event Viewer</p>
<p>First off, do not remove any entry from the event viewer and second, don't get scared if you see a lot of errors. Seriously, don't worry about errors. You are
<strong>looking for login attempts and successful logins.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you suspect someone is actually attempting to gain access, then it begs the question of whether or not you are behind a router, and if so, is NAT enabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If waking the computer from sleep (or from the blank screen) is showing attempts to login, the information from the Event Viewer will be very important. Don't think of hackers as just script kiddies (although it might be one), mainly because there is the
 chance the hacker is, in fact, very intelligent and has logged in successfully and then logged out and then made it look like an unsuccessful attempt. Having said that, I won't presuppose anything, but if they have as much access as I've described just now,
 then it is possible the hacker has your Windows password. Fear not, we can solve that problem, sometimes in easy ways, sometimes in slightly more painful ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really should stay current on your updates. I can't stress this enough. Only under very special circumstances can you avoid doing so, and those circumstances are indeed rare enough I doubt you qualify for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not say whether Windows Defender is the best choice in your circumstance. Only you can make that decision. There are other antivirus programs that are available, and some are good, some bad, some middle of the road. If you've got the time to do the
 research on it, the task should only take you about 20 minutes or so, and if you decide to go with a different vendor, installation of a different antivirus should be able to be completed in an additional ten minutes, totaling half an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You should consider giving more effort to providing complete answers to Ma Lau because the information may be extremely helpful in determining if your problem is with something I have not addressed.</strong></p>

<p>Windows Defender in Vista/windows 7 is an Anti-Spyware Program, not an Anti-Virus Program.</p>
<p>You should have an Anti-Virus installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using <strong>Norton, AVG, Avira, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, etc</strong> the default action is for&nbsp;Windows Defender to be disabled, as those AntiVirus Programs have their own Antispyware Applications.</p>

            <p>@bill smithers - firstly, tvm for your reply - a few days ago, (april 10th) i replaced my PC wifi with hard wired to connect to router - also, i installed Norton s/w and did a full scan and nothing of major concern was found as far as trojans but a few spyware
 were detected but the low risk (8 that were found) were removed </p>
<p>
</p><p>- i then , uninstalled Norton (trial version) and then went back and restored my machine to a previous version (as far back as i could 4-5 days or so) just to be sure - quite a few of my latest updates though failed to install &nbsp;before and after restore -
 I was concerned that my updates were a fail as a result of OS 7 ultimate maybe losing support or something weird like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive noticed that my PC shuts down per my settings and have not seen any further attempts and/or opening of any folder...it seamed to me that the access to my files and folders on my desktop were only succesfull when i was logged in, b/c as I stated, there
 were numerous attempts after i logged out to log in my pc as i was able to see the failed attempts several times that one day BUT so far after my changes i have noticed ZERO attempts..so NO i do NOT think the intruder had my logon pass</p>
<p>
</p><p>per, your instructions, i DO have the event viewer open but hard for me to decipher the different type logins and log outs specified in the Task Category - and read as follows;</p>
<p>
</p><p>under windows log security</p>
<p>- Logon</p>
<p>- special log on</p>
<p>- authentication policy change</p>
<p>- user acct management</p>
<p>- other system events</p>
<p>
</p><p>of curiosity</p>

            A lot of what you see in Event Viewer you can copy and paste into the search engine of your choice and get some, if not enough, information to make sense out of whether or not it is relevant to the events you've described occurring. As I stated previously,
 the key question here is <strong>logon events</strong>, and you may for a while have to actually write down the time when you log into the computer to check that time against the logs. You should also be aware you can scroll down to view a lot more information
 about logon events such as which process, which account, etc. Make certain you <strong>
scroll down in the text box in the lower pane of the screen</strong> and view the relevant information. You should be able to omit a lot of logon events from the list of ones you may be concerned about.
<p>
</p><p>It's good news that you are behind a router and that NAT is enabled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If the actual contents of the computer drive are easily reproduced (such as personal files you have backed up somewhere else, things you can download again, etc) then it's going to be worthwhile to keep an eye on the logons, and if you actually spot something
 you know is not you and is not a background task, then at that point it may be time to take action to nip the problem in the bud by the most effective, yet least destructive method. That will vary, depending on what the cause of the problem really is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had 8 spyware programs then I'm going to have to ask you about that, considering you said the computer is not connected to the internet very often. I'm also going to suggest you re-evaluate your idea of safe computing and would like for you to review
<a href="https://ist.mit.edu/security/tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ist.mit.edu/security/tips</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also concerned that you've stated some updates failed after using System Restore. Please be aware that some viruses have been suspected of hiding there and re-infecting systems that were otherwise clean.
</p>
<p>
At this point in time, I'd like for you to give special consideration to the questions asked by Ma Lau, and to provide concise answers so the correct solution can be found to your problem.</p>

<p>a friend gave us a flash drive that has photos on it. i plugged it in and it lights up but i don't get anything on my screen thast tells me it's downloading or anything. how do i get my pics once they're downloaded?</p>

            <div>They don't download automatically. In some versions of Windows, when you insert any kind of removable drive (flash drive, CD, DVD, etc.) you'll get a dialog asking what you want to do with the contents. I actually find this rather annoying, but in this
 case it would be helpful, as you could then choose among various possibilities that may include whatever software you have for viewing photos.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since this has not happened, press <strong>Windows Key + E</strong> to open Windows Explorer, click
<strong>Folders </strong>on the menu to display the Folders pane, and then click on the drive that represents the flash drive. You should see (depending on your display options) a list or icons or thumbnails of the photos. Try double-clicking on one to see
 if some sort of viewer opens (for example, if you have a recent version of Office installed and they are JPEGs, they'll probably open in Microsoft Office Picture Manager). If not, right-click on one and choose Open With. You may have some viable options listed;
 if not, click on Choose Program... and select a likely one from the list in the dialog that opens.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that this just permits you to view the photos; they are still on the flash drive. To copy them to your hard drive, you will need to drag them from the flash drive to a suitable folder on your HD.</div>

<h3> viktor sch  say:</h3>
<h2>            unaccessible boot device &#47; windows insider build ran into a problem</h2>
                    <p>Wondering if anyone came across following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>on day 1, after having used my PC as usual the day before, it came up with following error at time of booting:</p>
<p>"your windows insider build ran into a problem and needs to restart. We will restart for you"</p>
<p>a) I never enrolled for windows insider</p>
<p>b) it did not restart within 90 minutes</p>
<p>so I had to use the hard power off.</p>
<p>After restarting it tried to repair which was not successful and then offered the various recovery options.</p>
<p>Luckily I had a number or restore points. Using the latest one did not resolve the problem but the 2nd did.</p>
<p>Although, after restore finished, with a final result that it could not restore, the PC booted up to logon.</p>
<p>Of course I was very happy and thought that was it for whatever reason. Created some 2 restore points ....&nbsp;</p>
<p>before I restarted the PC twice without any problem - on day 1.</p>
<p>on day 2, the very same error occurred again - latest restore from day 1 did not do the trick but the next one did.</p>
<p>After creating a restore point again and looking around on what could be the problem without any success,</p>
<p>I restarted the PC twice again (creating restore points in between) and finally shut off the PC completely.</p>
<p>And to my surprise a consecutive normal started completed without error. </p>
<p>Now on day 3, again with no error, I am writing this hoping anyone has some idea what this could be all about.</p>
<p>(The shock when it happened first, was not very pleasant the more I had no real backup - which I did now in between :-) )</p>
<p>One thing I have to mention in addition. Starting some 1 week ago the BIOS start up changed randomly. Once</p>
<p>with blinking cursor at the top left corner for a while before continuing with windows start up.</p>
<p>Since day 1 this is so constantly resulting in a (little) longer overall boot time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight most welcome&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Viktor</p>

<h2>            Why does Windows 10 create boot files on another partition&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real problem for me.... </p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Windows 10 create separate boot file on another partition?</p>
<p>E.G. I setup to install on SSD on drive C: and afterwards I see that boot files have been created on partition D: which is on a separate hard drive!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the logic....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I want to reimage my OS if it fails, now i have to reimage 2 partitions... which means that now a partition is not reliable to store data
</p>
any more...
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>How can I move all boot files on the same partition and configure the O.S. to boot form it afterwards?</p>
<p>
</p><p>and last but not least...&nbsp; Why does it do this? What's the logic? Why can't it just dump all its file where I told it to, on just one partition?</p>
                </div>

            NDIS 6.0 means, you have installed the Vista driver. Go to the Realtek site and download the Windows 7 (NDIS 6.2) driver!

<h2>            NXOE dashboard is terrible</h2>
                    
<p>i was just forced to update to the awful and barf looking NXOE i want my old dashboard back you guys should of accomidated to xbox users with disabilities to be able to go back to the original dashboard i find this new one to be not user friendly and i have
 even noticed a delay since &nbsp;you guys updated to the awful dashboard after seeing this NXOE it makes me want to power up my xbox 360 since the old dash board had a similar feel the the xbox 360 version i was part of the preview program but after seeing the
 new dashboard before it was released to everyone i opted out from the xbox preview program to avoid this dashboard but now its being forced on everyone even those who DIDN'T want it&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Yeah unfortunately there is no way to permanently opt out of an update, unless you want to remain offline :(</p>
<p>The only thing I can say is that if you have any suggestions on how you think it can be improved, to head over to the xbox feedback site, and post it up there:
<a href="http://xbox.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://xbox.uservoice.com/</a></p>
<p>If the ideas are good, people will vote for them, and you might just find them implemented later down the track :)</p>

<p>Yeah mate, can totally understand where you are coming from. Thing is that these updates will usually contain important security updates as well as the different features that they've implemented, and unfortunateyl those security updates are the ones that
 require us to download them. </p>
<p>If you need a hand finding anything, or figuring out the new dash, feel free to shoot me any questions you have, as I'm more then happy to help you through :)</p>
<p>The feedback definitely isn't ignored, but there is just so much feedback that is posted, that its hard for them to implement it all :(</p>
<p>Anyways, let me know if you need anything more mate :)</p>

<p>Thats the menu button :)</p>
<p>You can now get to the settings through the side menu, so if you're at the dashboard, go to the left, which will bring up the side menu, then scroll down to the second to last option, and you'll find your settings there :)</p>
<p>If the idea has already been added to the feedback site, then make sure you vote for it too :)</p>

<p>I'm in total agreement with the original post. &nbsp;I hate NXOE. &nbsp;It's ugly, poorly designed, ruins everything, I mean EVERYTHING my wife and I bought the Xbox One for. &nbsp;Especially gestures. &nbsp;I only play games on a PC (an infinitely SUPERIOR experience) and
 hate consoles and stupid controllers. &nbsp;The one reason we broke down and wasted our money on a console was because we felt it would allow us to have a media center where we could use a combination of voice AND gestures. &nbsp;The idea was to NOT have to touch this
 stupid controller. &nbsp;The layout and performance how we used it were perfect. &nbsp;And then Microsoft decided to screw us by forcing us to install this horrid update. &nbsp;What kind of update REMOVES FEATURES? &nbsp;Oh, that's right, Microsoft's kind. &nbsp;So, now we have a
 Kinect that's half unusable and an interface we can't stand to use, that pukes all sorts of things on our screen that we never want to see! &nbsp;We've basically wasted $500. &nbsp;At this point, unless MS brings back gestures and allows a way to customize the screen
 to GET RID of 90% of that crap, we're going throw away this piece of junk and go back to just the TV and satellite box.</p>

            <p>You have to get the updated drivers from HP for Win8:<br />&lt;<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=al-109013-2&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=5298986&amp;sw_lang=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=al-109013-2&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=5298986&amp;sw_lang=</a>&gt;</p><p>As with all HP printers, the software has to be installed first before connecting the printer. The installation will prompt you when to connect it via USB. If you have any previous versions installed, uninstall them first.</p><p>I have this same AIO, and the new full-feature drivers work great.</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

<h2>            Getting an error &#34;not enough memory&#34; while trying to backup on network drive</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Memory Leak&nbsp; Win7 Backup and Restore locks up during backup to Network Drive
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have been backing up two computers to a netwrk drive for almost a year using Win7 Backup and restore</p>
<p>Some months ago one computer started to locking up. This occurs only&nbsp;during a backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted all backups and tried to start again and found the same problem. The RAM memory keeps going up into the 90%&nbsp; until the computer locks up and sends an error message not enough memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a 2TB network hardrive. 700GB free.</p>
<p>My backups are 250GB system image and 150GB user folder. Each time i try to backup the memory just increases until it runs out.</p>
<p>Is this related to a recent Window 7&nbsp;update?</p>
<p>Please help. I'm&nbsp;3 months without a backup on this computer.</p>

            <p>MEMORY LEAK SOLVED!!!!</p>
<p>After weeks of monitoring the memory resource screen and searching other forums I found the culprit.</p>
<p><u><strong>McAfee AnitVirus software</strong></u> Once I uninstalled the program, everything worked. The computer&nbsp;is operating much much faster, SVCHOST.exe, explorer.exe, sidebar etc&nbsp;uses much much less memory.</p>
<p>Obviously this software has an issue with copying files to a <u>network hard drive</u>. I could not&nbsp;copy 50Gbyte across to the network drive but now Win7 Back/Restore,&nbsp;does this very&nbsp;easiliy and in good time, backing up my 50Gbyte of users files plus 256GByte
 system image with ease and llow use of RAM. Total RAM use now sits at 40% throughout the whole process.</p>
<p>It also explains why my other computers never had a problem becuase they run TrendMicro. I have a licence for 2 McAfee packages&nbsp;but was always wary using the second one becuase of continous issues&nbsp;with using McAfee over the years.&nbsp;This last problem has led
 me to the conclusion not to use them.&nbsp;</p>
