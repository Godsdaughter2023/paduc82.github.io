    <title>Does Homegroup Sharing override Workgroup Sharing &#38; Understanding - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> getseven  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Homegroup Sharing override Workgroup Sharing &#38; Understanding Credential Manager and it&#39;s Vault</h2>
                    I am trying to manage user accounts in a home network (Win 7 Home Prem) that allow certain users (MOM &amp; DAD) RW access to various folders on a system data drive.&nbsp; This is a secondary drive located on my Tower computer.&nbsp; I can access it and rights all work
 correctly while homegroup is not in existance.&nbsp; I presume this is Workgroup level sharing.&nbsp; User Accts and PW are same on both machines.&nbsp; And, most of the time Windows credential is empty.&nbsp; More on that in part two of post.<br />
<br />
As soon as a Homegroup is created (@ Tower) and joined (by Laptop), users can no longer access folders with their prior sharing security levels.&nbsp; Why this is important is, that by and large, I want to use Homegroup\Library sharing.&nbsp; This is such a cool and
 simple feature once you get your brain around it.&nbsp; The problem is that its an Everyone or Noone&nbsp;situation.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I want certain folders to have full access by MOM and DAD from any PC.&nbsp; And no access by any other acct.&nbsp; I also want MOM &amp; DAD to have full acces to certain "Family Data" folders but KID1 &amp; KID2 to have Read Only.&nbsp; I had hoped to accomplish the higher level
 access via workgroup shares because I can select individual user accounts and privledges.&nbsp; But I also wanted to allow Homegroup for all the non-exception sharing on the PCs.<br />
<br />
I know of the setting in advanced sharing to turn off "Windows management of homegroup connections"&nbsp;but I'd rather not do this unless it's the only solution.<br />
<br />
PART 2:&nbsp; Managing Network Passwords and Credential Manager / Vaults<br />
I have tracked down that upon Homegroup create (Tower PC) and join (Laptop), the Windows credential is changed to Username:&nbsp; HomeGroupUser$&nbsp; on all acounts.&nbsp; This seems to be the culprit.&nbsp;
<br />
Can multiple Windows credentials be stored&nbsp; to same network address?<br />
<br />
Would like a basic understanding of credential manager and vaults if anyone can direct me to KB or other resources.&nbsp; Thanks<br />
<br />
Looking forward to any suggestions.<br />

            Thank you, Thahaseena.&nbsp; I already have been through all those sites and have been studying them.&nbsp; I think I just stumbled across a way to accomplish what I've been struggling with.&nbsp; I will jot it down here so others can benefit.<br />
<br />
Basically I found that I could do "old" style sharing or advanced networking as some have called it so long as
<strong>ALL</strong> users had login accounts at all machines they were going to access
<strong>AND</strong> Homegroup could not be on / set-up.&nbsp; When that is the case, individuals can log into a different peer and they get what ever rights are assigned to them at that peer and account name.&nbsp; Under this method I could set access security to files
 and folders by user and mix user rights i.e. some users with READ some users with READ/Write etc.&nbsp; I really didn't want to do this but with homegroup running, it over-rode the Windows credential with Username: HomeGroupUsers$ at all machines and all accounts
 and effectively ignored any sharing schemes I had set up.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I really like home group sharing concept and wanted to use it for the bulk of my families file sharing.&nbsp; It is exceptionally easy to use BUT it does not let you customize the User access by user; only Everyone Read, Everyone Read/Write or Nobody.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
What I have wanted to do is have specific directories shared only between certain users within the house (think MOM &amp; DAD).&nbsp; I wanted to restrict the kids from having read access to certain other folders but MOM*&amp; DAD have both Read/Write.&nbsp; For the most part
 there are only a few cases that require this,&nbsp; For everything else I wanted to use Homegroup.<br />
<br />
Well, tonight after about 3 days of trial and error and hours of testing and frustration I stumbled accross the way to accomplish what I needed!!!!!!<br />
<br />
The work around is "Linking on-line IDs with my user account".&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Whats-the-benefit-of-linking-my-online-accounts-with-my-Windows-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Whats-the-benefit-of-linking-my-online-accounts-with-my-Windows-user-account</a><br />
<br />
When you have linked IDs for each user account, those linked ID's show up as users when you pick<strong> Share With</strong>,
<strong>Specific users</strong>.&nbsp; Now, I can have homegroups active and still assign specific user access to those special case folders / files.&nbsp; I haven't fully tested this out, only on a select folder that was not in my shared Documents Library.&nbsp; But it worked.&nbsp;
 I will further test tomorrow to validate behavior when you share a folder or file via Homegroup (say Everyone Read access) AND share the same item with a specific Online ID with say Read/Write privledges.... which will win?&nbsp; Or if Homegroup share is R/W and
 specific Online ID is restricted to Read.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It's late here and I'll tackle this in the morning!&nbsp; Will update this with my findings.<br />

emachine T3882&nbsp; Model # T3882. <br />
I had an error at the start up say " (Windows\systems32\c_1252.nls missing or currupt" "put in start up CD and press R for repair." Well a systems recovery page came up. Two options:<br />
1) Full System&nbsp; Restore (Destructive)&nbsp;&nbsp; I do not want this. <br />
2) Full System Restore (with Back up) I want this. <br />
My question is, using the second option, will I still be able to retreive my pictures?&nbsp; I believe I will, but I want to make sure.</p>

<h2>            unable to perform repair on files installed by KB3133977</h2>
                    <p>i recently started getting some errors returned from SFC and DISM (using the SURT shim). after doing some looking in the logs and a little research, it appears to only affect a couple of files related to&nbsp;KB3133977. according to SFC, there is a hash mismatch.
 I have tried uninstalling the KB, then letting windows update reinstall it, as well as manually downloading the update and installing it, but the error persists. the commands i have run, in the order i typed them at the dos prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk c:&nbsp; (results: no disk errors)</p>
<p>sfc /scannow (results: see partial log below.)</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth (same as ... /cleanup-image /restorehealth under win10)</p>
<p>sfc /scannow (same results as before)</p>

            I had been hesitant to do a repair install, as the digital river copy of the windows 7 Ultimate .iso had, in my experience, taken some cajoleing and chicanery in order for windows setup to accept my install and do a repair install. This is probably due
 to the version of windows 7 ultimate that the OEM installed at the factory, idk. However, having used the HEIDOC.net .ISO downloader to download windows 10 .iso's in the past, I knew it was also able to download windowds 7 .iso's. among the versions availiblefor
 download from micorosoft, this version was listed: Win7_Ult_SP1_English_COEM_x64.iso. this version required no trickery beforehand to get windows setup to run or do a repair install. It also did not mess up my OEM installed tools that i had previosusly seen
 get messed up by a attempted repair install using other offical windows ultimate iso's. setup took forever, but it finished with out any errors. I still could not do activation online, and had to call in to MS to activate, but my produ

            Hi there Oliver! This has to be done during your exe4j configuration. In the fourth step of Exe4j wizard which is Executable Info select&gt; Advanced options select 32-bit or 64-bit. 
<br />Or you can install both JDK tool-kits x64 and x32 in your machine.

            Thanks for the info Vijay. Unfortunately this doesn't work. I can't find all the categories you mentioned. They don't seem to be available . Starting with path. There is no path option even shown. In my program files I don't have jre8 , I have 2 files
 , jdk-10.0.2 , and jre-10.0.2 and when I open either of these files there's no path listed anywhere to click on. So I'm blocked from that point to continue on with what you suggested.

Thanks for your time. The installation wizard I've had isn't Exe4j . I don't remember the name . But those options that you outlined weren't available.during the set up wizard. Perhaps it's because I downloaded the platform from filehippo and not the oracle
 website. If you think that might be the problem , I can uninstall it again ( for the 5th or 6th time lol ), and download the program from oracle. Also I thought the problem was I was downloading the JRE platform instead of the JDK platform which , according
 to the info on filehippo , also has JRE included. I have both installed but it still won't launch , and the error message no JVM could be found is still the problem.

<p>I think I'll uninstall the 2 java programs I still have on my computer after the virus scan is done , and wait for more information from you guys. After , when I try again , I'll only download from Oracle because it's probably the safest place to do so.</p>

    <title>System Reserve Partition Size Problem During Windows 10 Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> petedolan  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Reserve Partition Size Problem During Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I am on Windows 7 Professional x64 trying to install my reserved copy of Windows 10 Professional which keeps failing with the message
<strong>Windows 10 couldn't be installed</strong> with the reason <strong>We couldn't update the system reserved partition.</strong>&nbsp; When I looked at the problem I could see it only has 100BM allocated so I started following the instructions to unallocated
 some of my C: drive so I could then extend that partition.&nbsp; However, when I get to the part about running diskmgmt.msc, do a right-click on the partition and then choose "Extend volume", that is where I run into problems as that option is greyed out.&nbsp; The
 image is of that Disk Management screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44d246a2-7134-4b1c-806f-3c6e52dd6ccf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44d246a2-7134-4b1c-806f-3c6e52dd6ccf" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I'm really kind of stuck.&nbsp; The hard drive is a replacement for the original drive that came with it.&nbsp; I traded out my 500GB Seagate for this Samsung 1TB SSD and used their utility to clone my old drive to the new one.&nbsp; I don't know if it matters
 or not but&nbsp; one other thing I noticed is that 100 MB partition does not indicate it is the
<em>System Reserved</em> partition but&nbsp;since I didn't get the message that it couldn't find the System Reserved partition (only that it can't update it)&nbsp;I'm not&nbsp;convinced that is the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point, I'm not really sure what to do next.&nbsp; What would happen if I did make that unallocated space&nbsp;a System Reserved partition but then left everything else as it currently is?&nbsp; According to a few posts I read I can't copy the contents of the
 100MB partition to the new one so I'm not sure what good designating it as the System Reserved partition would do.&nbsp; Or would Windows 10 then populate it with everything it needs.&nbsp; I put the unallocated space to 370MB originally thinking that since Windows
 10 needs at least 350MB for the install (I've seen values up to 450 for that partition), when I extended the original 100MB for the upgrade I would wind up with a total space of 470MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp; I have to be extra careful than the normal careful because in addition to all of this I get an error when I try to create a System Repair disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.</p>

 me extend it. &nbsp;What isn't in my post is the EaseUS screen showing that it can't be expanded (which could be due to the fact that my system thinks it's a physical drive and not logical (that is purely a guess on my part but I don't have an answer as to why

            <p>For what it's worth at this point in time. I just stumbled on this thread while doing some research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've very recently had an experience with this issue while helping someone with the WAU v.1607&nbsp;update/upgrade on a previously upgraded machine running v.1511 and was failing&nbsp;with the same message. Long story short:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After backing up all files and making a programs to reinstall list, a clean install with format completed successfully.</p>
<p>Then while&nbsp;taking a look in disc management it appeared that the real problem is with&nbsp;a nonconformity of terminology.</p>
<p>The previously 285MB partition labeled Recovery partition was now 500MB wile the partition labeled System, Active, Primary partition was still at100MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I got home I then checked&nbsp;Disc Management in a Workstation that I had upgraded from a clean install of Win 7&nbsp;Pro 64bit&nbsp;on a new HDD to Win 10 Pro 64bit v.1511 and then again&nbsp;to the WAU without issue. Here is&nbsp;an expanded snapshot, cropped for the size
 constraints here,&nbsp;created on&nbsp;10/02/16.</p>

            <p>I recently had a Widows 10&nbsp; Insiders Preview update fail with&nbsp;<strong>We couldn't update the system reserved partition.&nbsp;
</strong>This was the first time after many successful updates. It was hard to find a clear cut solution to the problem. In my case, there was no partition named "System Reserved Partition", so I kept looking for ways to create/recreate this partition. It was
 a red herring, the system reserved partition on my PC is "EFI System Partition".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many web searches and a review of anything that might have changed on my PC I identified the problem. It turned out that there was insufficient free space in the system reserved partition to allow Windows to perform the update. Since the allocated
 size of the partition was the default 100mb and hadn't been modified, I checked to see what files and directories the partition contained.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out that in addition to the expected "EFI" directory, there was an additional directory named "echoboot"&nbsp; that was apparently installed by the cloning software I used to move to a larger hard drive. This extra directory used up enough space in
 the reserved partition to cause the update failure. I tried removing the cloning software, but it didn't delete the partition. So I had to remove it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the steps I used to correct the problem and are only applicable if a user installed disk utility (i.e. cloning, partitioning, backup software) created additional items in the system reserved partition. Before proceeding, try uninstalling any disk
 utilities you may have added, reboot the PC, and retry the failed update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>This procedure may leave your computer in an unbootable state, proceed with caution</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1</p>
<p>Open a command window as administrator. In Cortana search box enter the text "command prompt", right-click on the result "Command Prompt Desktop app" and select "Run as administrator" from the context menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2</p>
<p>Use the <strong>mountvol</strong> command to mount the system reserved partition so you can work with it. The syntax is '<strong>mountvol</strong>
<em>unused drive letter</em><strong>: /S</strong>, where <em>unused drive letter&nbsp;</em>is any drive letter not currently in use. For example, if the drive letter Q is available (unused) you would enter
<strong>mountvol Q: /S</strong> in the command window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3</p>
<p>Use the <strong>dir</strong> command to see what directories exist in the system reserved partition.&nbsp; Using the drive letter you assigned in the previous step, enter
<strong>dir Q:\&nbsp;</strong>and examine the directory listing that appears. Look for a directory that is related to a user installed disk utility (in my case, echoboot added by the NTI Echo 3 disk cloning utility).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove the directory identified in the previous step using the <strong>rmdir</strong> command. The syntax is
<strong>rmdir</strong> <em>assigned drive letter</em><strong>:\</strong><em>directory</em>
<strong>/s, </strong>where&nbsp;<em>assigned drive letter </em>is the drive letter assigned in Step 2 and
<em>directory</em> is the name of the directory related to the user installed disk utility identified in Step 3. Executing this command will remove the directory and its contents. The command, in my case, was
<strong>rmdir Q:\echoboot /s&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 5</p>
<p>Dismount the System Reserved Volume using the <strong>mountvol</strong> command. The syntax is<strong> mountvol</strong>&nbsp;<em>assigned drive letter</em><strong>: /D
</strong>where&nbsp;<em>assigned drive letter</em>is the drive letter assigned in Step 2. Again, if Q was the drive letter assigned in Step2, the command would be&nbsp;
<strong>mountvol Q: /D</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            I had been dealing with the problem for more than a year. In my case it was avast antivirus's fault. I tried every workaround I found on the internet, even complicated 15-steps procedures, but nothing worked. This did the job in 2 minutes! Thank you, I'd

<h2>            System Hibernation Failure, &#39;Terminal Server Keyboard Driver&#39;</h2>
                    In Vista, SP2, when coming out of hibernation, I get an error message: "the device driver for 'Terminal Server Keyboard Driver' is preventing the machine from entering hibernation... If the problem persists, you may need to update this driver."<br />
<br />
In Control Panel in device manager, I try updating the conventional (HID) keyboard device driver and find it is up to date. I also tried updating my display adapter (ATI Radeon HD 4350). That too is up to date.

Stumped here and would appreciate&nbsp;some help. Thanks!

<p><span><span><span>Hi Wally,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This behavior can occur if a program installs a kernel-mode driver that attaches itself to the standard keyboard driver
 (I8042prt.sys) and does not support Plug and Play I/O request packets (IRPs). Examples of programs that exhibit this behavior include:
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Pgpdisk version 6.02 and 6.5 (installs Pgpmemlock.sys and Pgpdisk.sys drivers)
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Adobe Type Manager version 4.0 (installs the Atmhelpr.sys driver)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>So, if you have the above applications installed on your computer you may try to update the drivers available for the respective applications or uninstall
 and reinstall it.</span></span></span></p>

            Hi  Kumashi, there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10. Microsoft are aware of this issue and hopefully are working on a patch . . . 
<br />
<br />For the moment, please try this workaround to set your preferred input language:
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC

            It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />Check if there any available updates for your motherboard.

<h2>            Frequently Sound stop working while watching videos or listening to musinc</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: <strong>Sound won't play</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometime this week my sound stopped working. Sometimes it does work but after a few seconds or minutes without doing anything having to do with sound (watching a video, listening to music, etc.) it stops working again. I usually restart the computer when
 it happens but I'm really concerned. I went into the speaker settings and went to the Advanced tab and clicked the test button. Each time it says "The device is being used by another application. Please close any devices that are playing audio to this device
 and then try again." I don't know what's open. I looked through the Task Manager and didn't see anything out of the ordinary and the same with looking through my files. Anybody know what's wrong?

            Hello Louis,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please help me with the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. When do you get this error message?</div>
<div>2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;Is this issue specific while playing any application such as Windows media player, or any 3rd party applications?</div>
<div>4. What is the make and model of the computer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and then check if the issue re occurs.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue persists in clean boot try the following steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press windows key + X key both together on the keyboard.</p>
<p>2. Select Control panel.</p>
<p>3. <span>Click&nbsp;on Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. </span></span><span>Double click on Speakers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5. </span></span><span>Under advanced tab check the option "Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device". Click OK.</span></p>
<p>6. IIRC it is enabled by default; disabling it and rebooting should resolve your issue.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>If the issues still persists, Run the Audio Troubleshooter</div>
<div>
<p>This troubleshooter is an automated Windows 8 inbuilt tool which finds and fixes the common issues with the audio settings of the computer. Perform these steps to run this tool and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>1. Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</div>
<div>2.&nbsp;Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</div>
<div>3.&nbsp;In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</div>
<div>4.&nbsp;Click on “Playing Audio”.</div>
<div>5.&nbsp;Click on “Advanced” and then click on “Run as Administrator”.</div>
<div>6.&nbsp;Click “Next” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process. Once this is done, you may restart the computer and check the audio status.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Additional information:</div>

<h2>            Please help- Microsoft Windows Updates for Windows 7 64 Bit</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my copy of Windows 7 64 bit oem. It didn't come with my machine. I upgraded. I am having an awful time with getting updates, It wasn't always this way but has been this way for a long time.Please help. Updates are set to Get Updates Automatically.
 Sometimes when I shut down my computer it says it is retrieving and executing the updates. When I come back later on and look at the update page It says I have 23 updates not completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have tried</p>
<p>
</p><p>

1.System Update Readiness Tool for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems&nbsp;
</p><p>
</p><p>2.Windows6.1-KB947821-v34-x64 &nbsp;(Microsoft Update Standalone Package)</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these work There is always an error. It's almost always the same ones:</p>
<p>

0x80073712 (KB2943357)
</p><p>
</p><p>The hotfix (2) does go through but it seems to make no difference at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have good strong tools to protect me from viruses,keep my registry clean,keep me clean from spyware and malware. &nbsp;None of this stuff fixes this. I've tried using my Windows 7 64 Bit DVD &nbsp; I can't make a full update from that cause I don't have enough room
 on the drive but I did use repair function. That did not work either. Please help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for helping me.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Please restart your computer and go back and try the procedure again. If you can not install KB3172605, it is pointless to proceed further.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have to conclude that Windows Update is messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the next step should be to reset Windows Update.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here are the Windows update reset instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a bit technical, but if you can follow it, I think it will work for you.&nbsp; I work on a lot of computers and this works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>I must emphasize that this will work between now and September 12, 2016.&nbsp; I do not know if it will work after that.&nbsp; Also this is for Windows 7.</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;emphasize that for this to work, you must follow exactly as this describes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two main types of Windows 7 installations: <strong><em>32 bit or 64 bit</em></strong>.&nbsp; You need to know what is installed in your computer.&nbsp; Click the Start globe, type system in the box.&nbsp;Choose System information in the list. &nbsp;The techie shorthand
 for 32 bit is x86 and for 64 bit is x64</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start Windows Update and change the Setting to <strong><em>Never check for updates</em></strong>.&nbsp; Restart.&nbsp; When you do leave the setting at NEVER, Windows Update will no longer be automatic.&nbsp; From this point onwards, you are responsible for starting and
 installing updates.&nbsp; We recommend you do that a few days following the 2nd Tuesday each month.</li><li>The process starts by ensuring that there is nothing running that will prevent the update from working properly.&nbsp; Click on the Start globe and type
<strong><em>services </em></strong>into the text box.&nbsp; Click on Services in the list that pops up.&nbsp; In the window that then pops up (its alphabetic), find Windows Update.&nbsp;
<strong><em>Right-click </em></strong>on it&nbsp;(left-click if your mouse is set for left-handers) and choose
<strong><em>Stop</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Now, you are going to reset Windows Update components:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start, All Programs, Accessories, Right-click on Command prompt, Choose Run as administrator, OK.&nbsp; Type the following in the black box:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong></li><li><strong>net stop bits</strong></li><li><strong>net stop msiserver</strong></li><li><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></li><li><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</strong></li><li><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong></li><li><strong>net start bits</strong></li><li><strong>net start msiserver</strong></li><li><strong>pause</strong></li><li><strong>Exit</strong></li></ol>
<p>You are now going to download and install either one or two updates manually.&nbsp; In most cases only the first (KB3172605)&nbsp;of these is needed.&nbsp; If that produces a result that says the update is not appropriate for you computer, you need to first install the
 2nd of these (KB3020369), then install the first (KB3172605).&nbsp; Choose the one that is for your machine — 32 bit (X86) or 64 bit (X64).</p>

<p>
</p><p>After restarting your computer, wait about 10 minutes until Windows Update completes its tasks.&nbsp; Do not use the computer for any other purpose during this wait period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Windows Update.&nbsp; It will take only a few minutes to come up with a list and download the updates you select.&nbsp; The process is quite normal as it always was from this point onward.</p>
<p>If your computer has not been updated for a long time, it may take longer.</p>

    <title>Disable dwm for one user - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> doveman2009  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable dwm for one user</h2>
                    <p>I have a dual-user system, where it auto logs in as user1 which runs Mediaportal (which requires Aero) and user2 only connects via RDP. RDP doesn't play nice with Aero and Java apps and Video Playback don't work unless it's disabled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can get round this by killing dwm.exe for user2 (which I&nbsp;might be able to&nbsp;do with a logon script), but I'd rather find a way to prevent it loading at all. I can't do this by disabling the service Desktop Window Manager Session Manager as that disables
 it for both users. I don't really understand how this service loads dwm.exe as the path to executable is shown as "C:\Windows\System32\svchost.exe -k LocalSystemNetworkRestricted" but that's by the by.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there perhaps a way to disable this service and then start&nbsp;dwm.exe for user1 some other way?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Scrub that. It seems dwm.exe has to not be running for user1 as well for video playback and java apps to work for user2, so I'm not sure there's a way to fix this.</p>

    <title>Screen output size - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darknightbegins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen output size</h2>
                    <p>I've just recently got a new goodmans 4k tv and now since putting the Xbox one through it I seem to be missing some of the edge of the homepage. On games such as fallout shelter it's not showing everything it should, it's missing the edge. It's the same if I go onto the store, it's not showing everything. Is there a way to readjust the aspect ratio on the Xbox? I've tried on the TV to 16:9 and I'm still having the same thing happen. The Xbox is through hdmi. I have a 360 and that shows everything on screen and that's through hdmi also</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Xbox One S Update Error 0x80070570 0x00000000 0x90000005</h2>
                    <pre>Xbox One S update error:

Update (416mb) start's to download. When it get's to 15% (354mb) there is error

Source OS: 10.0.18362.3055

Target OS: 10.0.18362.4055

ERROR CODE : 0x80070570 0x00000000 0x90000005

When try to make Offline Update (OSU1) this give error:

OFFLINE UPDATE ERROR: E101 90000005 80070570

I already tryied factory reset and trying to update again but still getting same error.

I GUESS isn't problem in HD. Because before Microsoft release this bad update i bought and downloaded games normally, example: GTA V and more...

Maybe Microsoft released corrupted update, or update isn't compatible with some Xbox One S region versions. Because some users had this same error.

This means Xbox One S is bricked, because can't use without update.</pre>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for updating us with your replies. As you've indicated you are not enrolled in the Preview Program as an Xbox Insider and have exhausted all troubleshooting available, then your option at this point is to get your console serviced.
 Since you've purchased it in the last 3 months, it would be a good idea to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contact Xbox Support</a> to see if your console is still within warranty and set up that repair as recommended previously by my fellow XBF member. If it was purchased brand new, then it should be as all new consoles come with a standard 1 year warranty.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope that this helps a bit more.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Help with VPN &#40;do I need an incoming or outgoing connection for my purposes&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>I am newer to posting my questions online, but I have used these forums many times to help me with various computer issues in the past &amp; I must say I have been so very grateful to those who take the time to help &amp; reply; it's wonderful of you computer gurus
 to help those of us out who are so confused with this kind of stuff like me, LOL... ;o}</p>
<p>I am a relatively decent computer user, but when it comes to networking, PPTP/port forwarding &amp; even with the IP addresses I get oh so confused, especially with all the lingo that I don't understand (a tutorial online was showing that I should set my VPN
 server up using my 10.0.0.4 address but isn't that a standard address that a lot of people have within their router &amp; if so, how can a computer possibly find the proper pc to connect to using that type of IP since it is utilized by so many?)... Essentially
 what I would like to do is utilize a VPN connection to be able to access files on another user's computer (with their permission of course) &amp; be able to edit those files with certain programs I have on my computer without having to actually copy the files
 over to my pc. I am trying to start a small business &amp; it would be imperative to my clients that they know I am not "stealing" or keeping any of their files, just temporarily accessing their files to make the requested changes utilizing those certain programs
 on my pc. Is this even possible over a VPN connection?</p>
<p>If this is possible, I know I probably sound like an idiot, but would I want to set up an incoming or outgoing VPN connection on my end to give me that sort of access (clients' computers ideally would be allowed temporarily &amp; removed after I have done what
 I needed to do)? I would want the setup for us to get connected on the clients' end to be as simple as possible without affecting what I need to accomplish.</p>
<p>Everything I am reading online states that for VPN to function, PPTP service needs to be enabled &amp; that you may need your ISP to set it up/allow it. So I called my ISP (Comcast) &amp; they told me that I do not need to worry about PPTP/port forwarding because
 I am hard-wired to my network as opposed to being on wireless. Is that information correct? Does PPTP/port forwarding need to be enabled for the client then (if they're on wireless) if not for me? I tried to enable it anyways (going off of the same aforementioned
 tutorial, but I'm not sure if I did it right...) since I also have a laptop that is connected to my network wirelessly.</p>
<p>I also have PeerBlock on my pc &amp; I'm wondering if I need to switch any settings on it or if it is potentially blocking my attempts to connect? I have tried setting up both types of connections on both my pc &amp; laptop. Obviously the whole purpose of VPN is
 being able to easily connect to someone who is not on your network, so I disconnected my laptop from my home network &amp; connected it to my apartment complex's network instead for testing purposes, but I still have not been able to make the connection work.
 One of the times when it was trying to connect, it created a "RAS (Dial In) Interface" network that I do not want &amp; I can't seem to figure out how to delete it? Again, I'm sure I sound like an idiot to all you guys probably, LOL!!! ;o}</p>
<p>Another thing is that when I have been prompted for a user name &amp; password for VPN connection, I'm not sure which user name &amp; password I am supposed to be using. I looked at the properties in my "incoming connections" &amp; all of the users currently set up
 to be allowed access have a password that is more digits than I would normally use &amp; I am unable to figure out what the user name(s) (should it be the computer name, the IP (&amp; if it should be the IP, should it be the "IPv4 Address" under "Ethernet adapter
 Local Area Connection 2" (which is what I connect to the internet with) or the "Wireless LAN adapter Wireless Network Connection" which is currently disabled, or do I need to go to whatismyip.com &amp; use that IP address???) &amp; password should be or where it is
 coming from... If I wanted to change my user name &amp;/or password for this, where would I go to do so? Yet again, I probably sound like an idiot to you guys, but I must admit I am SO confused right now, LOL... The instructions I've read online seem like this
 should all be pretty simple, but it is not working no matter what I do...! I have received errors 720 &amp; 800 when I try to connect.</p>
<p>My pc is running on Windows 7 Ultimate &amp; my laptop has Windows XP. I'm not sure if I am supposed to post my system requirements or any other additional information here or not for these types of questions.</p>
<p>Any sort of assistance in this matter would be greatly appreciated!!! I know most of you all know that tech-speak language, but I must admit that layman's terms would be much more easily understood on my end if at all possible... ;o} Consider this a VPN
 for dummies lesson if you'd like, LOL...</p>
<p>Thanks so much!!!<br />

            <p>From your description this is what your wanting to do, ie. use one of your computers (desktop or laptop) as a VPN client to temporarily access a customers VPN server computer so you can manipulate files on the server.</p>

<p>With that said...</p>
<p>Your customer would need to setup a <strong><u>VPN server</u> on their&nbsp;network</strong> and you would setup a
<strong><u>VPN client</u> on your computer</strong>. Depending on who your customers are they may already have a VPN server active and you would simply need permission from their network administrators to get access. Otherwise they would need to setup and configure
 a VPN server. Is that latter case possible?</p>

<p>If they will not setup a VPN server then another possibility is to use a service like Sky Drive where both you and your customer have access to the shared files. Both could download/upload the files.
<u>As an example</u> your customer would place a file in one of&nbsp;your Sky Drive folders, you download the file, manipulate it on your computer&nbsp;then upload the file back to Sky Drive and the customer could then download the changed file.</p>
<p>Further help with Sky Drive...</p>

<p>If you really really really really want to setup a PPTP VPN server on your PC then see these...</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Set-up-an-incoming-VPN-or-dial-up-connection" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Set-up-an-incoming-VPN-or-dial-up-connection</a></p>

<p>Note that in order to access your PPTP VPN server from a remote location you need
<strong>TCP Port 1723</strong> forwarded/open on any router or firewall the PPTP VPN server is behind. You also need the router or firewall to pass
<strong>GRE Protocol 47</strong> traffic. This is sometimes called <strong>PPTP Pass Through</strong> or
<strong>VPN Pass Through</strong> or is allowed automatically when TCP Port 1723 is forwarded/opened. This includes software firewalls like the native Windows Firewall. You can test this using the PPTP Ping and VPN Traffic sections on this page.</p>

<p>You can download <a href="http://www.petri.co.il/download_free_reskit_tools.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (see the <strong>PPTP Ping</strong> tool) or if you have a XP SP2 CD. To extract the programs on a Windows 7 PC open the CD and select
<strong>Open folder to view files</strong> from the <strong>AutoPlay</strong> window or go to the download folder where you saved the downloaded tools file and extract the files.</p>
<p>Note that some consumer grade routers do not do pass GRE Protocol 47 traffic.</p>
<p>I suggest testing this over your local LAN first to make sure the basic data link can be established...</p>

<p>Lastly you also might consider purchasing a Windows Home Server. Both my brother (he currrently runs WHS 2011) and I (I ran the original version of WHS) use/used one. Many small businesses use them also. In our case we built our own from existing hardware
 but you might consider purchasing a turn key system.</p>

<p><span>Hi knives_1771,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/games/pc/freelancer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Freelancer</span></a> website it appears that the game is only compatible with the following legacy operating systems:

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am Charlie's dad and have been helping him in trying to find a solution to the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a Dell Inspiron N5010 and has recently come out of storage. It had Windows 7 installed and as that did not play the discs, Charlie updated to Windows 10 but without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At your suggestion, I also checked the status of the graphic driver software which I was told was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's where things stand as I type this...</p>

                    <span>
<p>Hi, if anyone could help me with this it would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old external hard drive seemed to be failing (I could read from it but couldn't save File History to it) so I bought a new one.</p>
<p>Fresh from the box, Windows recognizes it without any problems but File History stop after about 30 seconds and just saves the Configuration and Data folders, the latter being empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Data folder "AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Data" on the PCs hard drive is also&nbsp;empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;File History backup&nbsp;log is full of event ID error&nbsp;201:</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>

</p><p>"Unable to scan user libraries for changes and perform backup of modified files for configuration C:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config"</p>
<p>
</p><p>And warnings 202:</p>
<p>
<span>
<span>
</span></p><p>"Unusual condition was encountered during scanning user libraries for changes and performing backup of modified files for configuration C:\Users\bob\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config"</p>
</span><span>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I have set the offline cache space to 20% of disk space and still nothing is being "file historyed" anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As your hard drive shows no files in file history data. We may have to back up your files. You can select an externally connected drive, such as a USB drive, or you can save to a drive on a network.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>File History regularly backs up versions of your files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders,</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Please refer to the below link to <strong>set up a drive for File History</strong>,</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/set-drive-file-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/set-drive-file-history</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If something goes wrong in File History, you'll see a message in the desktop that appears in the notification area on the taskbar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer to the below link if <strong>something goes wrong in File History,</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for replying. I apologize for the delay in response. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Which is the antivirus program that you are using?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am sorry to know that the hotfix was not much of help. As your file history back is not working let’s try to turn the File History off then turn it on back and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer to the below article posted by <strong>John_NL replied on February 14, 2013</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
</span><span>The issue might have also caused if the firewall is blocking the content that you are trying to&nbsp;back up and also&nbsp;if the user account is corrupted. So I would suggest you to disable the firewall and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong></span>You shouldn’t turn off Windows Firewall unless you have another firewall turned on. Turning off Windows Firewall might make your PC (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note: </strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it
 to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If all the above steps fail, may be the issue is because some windows files are corrupted. So please refer to the below article to Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files.</span></p>

<p>Your last answer has provided no use whatsoever - simply turn it off and on and again....please!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use AVG Antivirus and I don't have a firewall activated. So they are not the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not trying to save copies of any music files whatsoever, so that's not the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nor do any of the other potential solutions offered in that thread work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History is part of Windows 8, as it doesn't work it means Windows 8 doesn't work! Ergo,&nbsp;Windows 8 is a bad, faulty product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And online support only tries to sell me Online Support - no way I'm a stupid enough to pay twice for a faulty product I'd prefer to a buy a Mac!!!</p>

<h2>            Viewing PDF files in Edge</h2>
                    Unable to view pdf files that open up in a Microsoft Edge tab. I clicked on a pdf link and when it open it gave me a message "For the best experience, open this PDF portfolio in Acrobat X or Adobe Reader X, or later." Does Edge not&nbsp;allow you to view PDF
 files within the browser? Do I&nbsp;really have to go to Google Chrome&nbsp;and just so I can utilize their Adobe Reader function?<br />

            View them? Yes. Jump to a new page: Yes, when there's a highlighted and underlined identification. Full controls such as page list down the left side and control bar at screen bottom: No. Save your IExplorer and switch to it if you want to actually find
 and read something.

<p>Same here, with a variant: when I click on any link to a pdf file in any website I get a new tab with blank pages. One blank for each page in the document. Google Chrome and Mozilla work fine.</p>
<p>When this issue will be fixed, my next question will be: how do I save this document (the good old "Save target as" has vanished from the right mouse click options).</p>

            <p>Microsoft in Edge as of yet (10/8/15) does not support Browser Plug-Ins/Add-Ins. It does have a built in document reader that opens pdf links in a very basic format, and not in the OS file extension associated app (eg Adobe Acrobat, or Adobe Reader). Many
 basic functions are missing in the Edge pdf viewer. Note that one can Zoom the screen in Edge by holding CTRL and scrolling the center mouse button, or by holding CTRL and pressing the + or - keys.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It us unbelievable that Microsoft would introduce a new Browser that does not allow one to elect to open links in the native application.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Adobe users, please make a feature request at: http://www.adobe.com/products/wishform.html
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found Adobe to be much more responsive than Microsoft. </p>

            A PDF Portfolio is a group of documents (a bit like a zip file containing several PDF documents) these are not supported by some PDF viewers and the one used by Edge would seem to be one of those.

            Just to make sure we are talking about the same thing here: I have this problem with a pdf file, not a PDF portfolio and so do all users who have posted there comments here. The word "portfolio" slipped in&nbsp;in this thread only because of the&nbsp;message that
 pops up when this&nbsp;problem occurs <em>"For the best experience, open this PDF portfolio...".&nbsp;</em>

<p>Don't know what it means or how to fix it, only happens when I try to update Xbox live, I've had this problem since around november, a support ambassador said it was because the lizard squad attacks but now that they've stopped its still happening. I really
 do not want to pay money for a service I am not able to use, so someone please help me resolve this before I switch over to psn.</p>

<p>MS has developed a new movie maker that is part of the Windows Live Essentials family.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Live Movie Maker 2011<br />
</strong><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker?os=other</a></p>
<p>However, if you prefer the movie maker that came with XP, (I do!), this classic version will run on Windows 7.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Movie Maker 2.6<br />
