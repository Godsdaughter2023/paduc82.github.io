<p>I have had a lot of trouble trying to install the 64 bit version of windows 7 Home Premium on my 64 bit vista and my question is multi-part. If it is relevant, this is my 2nd copy of windows 7 that I have tried. At first, I had the problem of not being able
 to run the installation on either copies with the error "'autorun.dll' could not be found or is corrupt. Error code is [0x7E]." However, I managed to get into the installation with my 2nd copy after rebooting my computer. Once in the setup, I got another error
 that stopped the installation which said "windows was unable to create a required installation folder. Error code is 0x80070017." I again rebooted my computer and started the installation again, this time the installation was a decent way through but stopped
 when I got the error "Windows cannot copy files required for installation. The files may be corrupt or missing. Error code is 0x80070241." I then backed up &nbsp;and rebooted&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;and then attempted to use the custom install option but then got the error
 "E:\sources\autorun.dll is either not designed to run on windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original media or contact your system administrator." coupled with the error "the file 'autorun.dll' could not be loaded or
 is corrupt. Error code is 0xC1" I again rebooted and tried the custom option but got the error "Windows could not load required file WinSetup.dll. The file may be corrupt. To install windows, restart the installation. Error code is 0x3E6." I rebooted my computer
 and tried the custom option three times more and consistently got the error "Windows cannot copy files required for installation. The files may be corrupt or missing. Error code is 0x80070241."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that my problem is very complex but it seems to revolve around a missing or corrupt file. Thanks if you can tell what's wrong or what to do.</p>

            Troubleshooting Tips To Solve Common Problems When Windows 7 Does Not Install<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation and fix them.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Disable all security software including anti-virus and firewall programs.<br />
3. Make sure your computer has the most recent BIOS and drivers.<br />
4. Disconnect all external devices except keyboard and mouse before installing.<br />
5. If your computer/motherboard has integrated video use that and remove the dedicated video card.<br />
6. If you have a large amount of RAM (memory), try reducing the amount of installed RAM. 1GB if installing 32bit, 2GB for 64bit, then replace RAM if the upgrade is successful.<br />
7. If you downloaded Windows 7 and burned it to a DVD try burning it again at the slowest speed possible. It's also possible the download may have errors, you could try downloading it again.<br />
<br />
8. Check your RAM (memory) for errors. This may take awhile.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A) Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) Boot from the Windows 7 DVD.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Choose your language, then click Next.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click on "Repair your computer" then select the operating system to repair.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click the Memory Diagnostics link on the System Recovery menu.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) The computer will restart and your memory checked for any errors. <br />
<br />
9. Disable Startup Programs:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A). Click Start, type MSCONFIG in the Start Search box, and then press Enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK User Account Control permission and enter password if any<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If using XP: Click Start, click Run, then type: MSCONFIG and click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; B) On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; C) Right below Selective Startup, uncheck the "Load Startup Items" check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; D) Click the Services tab, click the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box, then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; E) Click OK, then restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; F) Attempt the upgrade again.<br />
<br />
(NOTE: if the upgrade doesn't work and you continue to use XP/Vista turn your security software back on, then also return to MSCONFIG and on the General tab, click "Normal Startup" then click OK to exit.)<br />

<h2>            Cannot access Xbox &#40;Beta&#41; PC store</h2>
                    When I try to go on the store tab it just says "Sorry, Partner! looks like you are stuck in no man's land! try restarting the app to fix it" I have tried this to no avail as well as restarting my PC and reinstalled it. I changed my gamertag this morning
 before using the app as I haven't used xbox live in about 6 years could this change be why I can't log into the store perhaps?

<p>I was having this problem as well, however I have managed to resolve it either by connecting via a VPN (which is a bit of a fuss), or by changing my DNS settings to 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 (the Google DNS settings).</p>

            Hello SEHarker,<br />
<br />
Thank you for visiting the Micrsoft Answers Community.<br />
<br />
Are you using the password from your email at the bottom that says next password?<br />
<br />
Download the Hotfix again and make sure that you use the password directly under the download link beside password, not next password.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/hotfix/KBHotfix.aspx?kbnum=843617&amp;kbln=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here is the direct link to the Hotfix</a>.<br />

Hope this helps

            Chris,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your response.&nbsp; You were right.&nbsp; Appears I goofed.&nbsp; Found the correct Password, used it, unpacked two ".exe" files to "C:/", then stumbled on the problem that the&nbsp;first of the two files "WindowsXP-KB843617-ia64-enu.exe" when opened generates the
 error message "update/update.exe is not a valid Win32 Application".&nbsp; The second file, "WindowsXP-KB843617-ia64-enu-Symbols.exe" runs normally.<br />
<br />
The "ia64" in both file names suggests they are for 64 bit processors, only, but I find it difficult to believe a Hotfix would be provided only for that processor type.&nbsp; The fact it is the only "English" Hotfix in the Download Language selection led me to believe
 it was Processor independant.<br />
<br />
If you have any thoughts re: this situation would appreciate your sharing same.&nbsp; The fundamental problem still exists.<br />

            Hello SEHarker,<br />
<br />
You had not mentioned whether you were using x86 ot x64 and since the hotfix was only x64 figured you were using x64.<br />
<br />
The issue itself sounds like a video driver. Have you tried performing a safe boot to determine is the issue is still happening?<br />
&nbsp;
<p>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs do not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed. Safe mode
 is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly, or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. If a problem does not reappear when you start in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic
 device drivers as possible causes. If a recently installed program, device, or driver prevents Windows from running correctly, you can start your computer in safe mode and then remove the program that is causing the problem.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.
</span></li></ul>
<p>
Click the <span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span> button, click the arrow next to the
Restart</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Do one of the following:
</span>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to
 press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start
 in safe mode, and then press F8.</span> </li></ul>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>On the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Boot Options</span><span>
 screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></a><span>.</span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<span>Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words
<p><br />
Hope this helps</p>

            Hello (again) Chris,<br />
<br />
Went into Safe Mode, but found no change in the "Problem".&nbsp; A couple of thoughts;&nbsp; First, I think it dispicable MS did not produce a x86 Platform version of the Hotfix. &nbsp;Second, I'm in your camp re: the "Problem".&nbsp;I became suspicious of the Video Driver almost
 immediately.&nbsp; To clear the Video driver (ATI Mobility X300), I did a total de-install and clean up for the installed ATI driver and rolled back to the MS Generic, then installed the last verion of the ATI Mobility X300 Driver offered through Dell.&nbsp; Shut down,
 restarted and... no difference.&nbsp; Loaded and ran the "Dell Driver Reset Tool" - No problems found with any installed Driver.<br />
<br />
For the record, we're talking about my SO's Dell Latitude D810 (32 Bit) Machine, running a fresh install of Windows XP Professional w/SP3 just loaded this past Sept.&nbsp; The fresh "Install" was done by the "Boys" down at her Office (that alone scares the dickens
 outa me) - presumably all technically skilled, just before the "Problem" cropped up.<br />
<br />
At this point I'm inclined towards a hardware issue (video card?), but am not satisifed we've cleared all the potential Software causes that might have arisen from the installation, or other circumstances.&nbsp; To focus in on the symptom(s): On Power up, the POST
 Screen will flash for about half a second, followed moments later by the Microsoft startup page for a second, then the Windows "Accounts/Password" Page for&nbsp;between one and&nbsp;two seconds, then blackness....&nbsp; All of this is repeatable, of course.<br />
<br />
Any more thoughts?&nbsp; They are all deeply appreciated, I can assure you.<br />

            Hello SEHarker,<br />
<br />
When you boot to safemode, if you are having the same issue, then it is not the driver.<br />
<br />
When does the Black screen occur? meaning is it just occasionally or everytime?<br />
You are able to get past the screen in order to use Windows though?<br />
Have you checked your Event Viewer to determine is and error logs exist?<br />
<br />
Also, since this is happening when Windows is starting, try performing a clean boot to determine if any service or application on startup is causing the issue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<p>To perform a clean boot on a computer that is running Windows XP, follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>,
 and then click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Run</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">msconfig</span><span>
 in the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span><span>
 box, and then click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>On the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">General</span><span>
 tab, click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Selective Startup</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>Under
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Selective Startup</span><span>,
 click to clear the following check boxes:</span> </li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
</li></ul>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 tab, click to select the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Hide All Microsoft Services</span><span>
 check box, and then click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Disable All</span><span>.
</span></li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>When you are prompted, click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Restart</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>After the computer starts, start the game
 or program and check whether the problem is resolved.</span> </li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem does not return while your computer is in clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing interference. You can try to determine which background program is causing
 the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To try to determine which background program is causing the problem, start by turning off all drivers, third-party programs or services, and startup items that load with Windows. Then, if
 the problem is resolved, turn back on half of these services to try to isolate the interfering service. If the problem is not resolved at this point, you will repeat this process until you have isolated the interfering service. Finally, if you are able to
 determine which specific program or service is causing the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether there is a solution. You can also disable the program or service to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1: Start the System Configuration Utility</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Start</span><span>,

</span></li><li>

 in the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Open</span><span>
 box, and then click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2: Enable half of the Services items</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this step, you are trying to isolate which background service is causing the interference program. Start by turning half of the services on and turning half off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 tab, and then click to select the</span><span style="font-weight: bold"> Hide All Microsoft Services</span><span>
 check box. </span></li><li><span>Click to select half of the check boxes
 in the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 list, leaving the other half unchecked. </span></li><li><span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>.
</span></li><li><span>When you are prompted, click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Restart</span><span>.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3: Determine whether the problem is resolved</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program works after you restart your computer, then you know that the interfering service is not among those services that were turned on. Therefore, it must be among those services
 that were turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the program does not work after you restart the computer, then you know the interfering service may be among the services that were turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that you have eliminated some services as the cause of the problem, you can use a process of elimination to try to determine which service might be causing the problem. You can keep
 selectively turning services off or on until you isolate a service that might be causing the interference. To do this, follow these steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Start the program and check whether the
 problem is resolved. </span></li><li><span>If the problem returns, follow these steps:
</span></li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Start the System Configuration Utility. Go to "Step 1: Start the System Configuration Utility" for instructions on how to
 do this. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 tab, and then click to select the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Hide All Microsoft Services</span><span>
 check box. </span></li><li>
<span>Click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 list. </span></li><li>
<span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>,
 and when you are prompted, click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Restart</span><span>.
</span></li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Start the game or program and check whether the problem is resolved. If the problem returns, one of the services that is turned
 on may be causing interference. Continue to repeat steps a through d, turning off services to try to isolate a service that is causing interference. If you cannot isolate any one service as the cause of the problem, then these services are likely not causing
 the interference.</span> </li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the problem does not return, then one of the services cleared in step 2 is an interfering service. To isolate that service, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Start the System Configuration Utility. Go to "Step 1: Start the System Configuration Utility" for instructions on how to
 do this. </span></li><li>
<span>Click the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 tab, and then click to select the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Hide All Microsoft Services</span><span>
 check box. </span></li><li>
<span>Click to select half of the check boxes that you originally cleared in the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Services</span><span>
 list. </span></li><li>
<span>Click
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">OK</span><span>,
 and when you are prompted, click </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Restart</span><span>.
</span></li><li>
<span>Start the program and check whether the problem is resolved. If the problem returns, one of the services that you selected
 in step c is an interfering service. Continue to repeat steps a through d, turning off services until you to isolate the service that is causing interference.</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this has not changed anything, disable the other half of the services and continue through this same process until the culprit has been identified.<br />

<p>(Whew!) Chris, thank you, but give me a day or so with this.&nbsp; I'm a Stroke survivor with only one (1) useful hand.&nbsp; A few quick answers, though.&nbsp; The problem occurs on every startup.&nbsp; Once the Black screen occurs at the Account/Password screen it is a steady
 state situation.&nbsp; In other words, we can't get to normal operation but can get the screen image, itself,&nbsp;via linkage to&nbsp;a CRT.&nbsp; I looked at the Event Logs early on and saw nothing of importance, but will check again to be sure.<br />
<br />
Will be back, shortly.<br />

            Hello SEHarker,<br />
<br />
Ok, this may be a bit simpler than I thought. Since you are able to see via CRT, I believe that your system is trying to use the external display. When you get to the black screen, simply try using the fn+f6 to switch the display mode.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

            Hello Chris,<br />
<br />
On the Dell Latitude you can switch between Laptop and CRT using FN+F8.&nbsp; We've been using this capability as a temporary measure until the Laptop Problem is resolved.&nbsp; Trying to switch back from CRT to the Laptop screen has no effect on the BSOD, but I have
 a sneaking feeling there may be a connection with this function.<br />
<br />
To update: First, I went back and&nbsp;double checked the Event Logs and found only two consistant warnings showing up on eash startup.&nbsp; In the Applications Log a Event ID 1517, and in the System Log a Event ID 4.&nbsp; I suspect&nbsp;my SO's&nbsp;AVG Antivirus Application is
 the source of the first, and the latter is a known networking issue.&nbsp; Neither is a suspect re: the "Problem"; and,<br />
<br />
Second, following your direction I ran MSCONFIG and, on looking at&nbsp;it's selections, decided to speed things up using the more drastic "Diagnostic" startup mode, leaving only DCOM Server Process Launcher, Remote Procedure Call, and Remote Procedure Call Locator
 Services running.&nbsp; On restart (with high hopes), I was crushed&nbsp;to note&nbsp;the Problem continued unabated.&nbsp; This would seem to eliminate Services and Drivers as culprits.&nbsp; Since no third party applications are running at Startup in Diagnostic Mode, those are&nbsp;no
 longer&nbsp;under consideration either.<br />
<br />
Thoughts: Since the BSOD will also occur&nbsp;when attempting to F2 into&nbsp;the Latitude's BIOS at initial startup, the possibility of a&nbsp;bad BIOS setting can't be ruled out, but I can't bring the BIOS Screens up on our CRT to check the SO's Laptop BIOS against my own
 (also a Latitude D810, and functioning normally).&nbsp; Will try to find a way to reset her BIOS to factory defaults while under Windows so we can rule that out.<br />

I still think that your external monitor has something to do with this. What happens if you disconnect your external and set the default to your lcd?<br />
<br />
Will the screen come up as expected?

<br />
Sorry for&nbsp;the delay in responding (Family).&nbsp; The ext. CRT was brought in after the problem arose, so I now doubt the connection.&nbsp; I coulld be wrong but the fact (as we've discovered) the Problem occurs even when F2'ing into the Latitude's BIOS - before Windows
 loads - would now suggest a problem with the BIOS, itself, or a possible equipment problem.<br />

<h3> sk&#35;3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows has taken up so much space I cannot even pull up an internet browser.</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2n1 with an attached hard drive. Windows has taken up so much space i cannot use it for my writing, I cannot even pull up an internet browser, I request that the portable hard drive be used, but it is not. I have deleted programs, defragged the
 computer, had temporary files deleted daily. I have changed 'where new apps are saved' (every available option) to the D:Passport HD, on the 'Free up space' screen I have requested it to update to the HD..&nbsp; What more can I do? My dad got it for me as a gift
 before he died, so getting rid of it is not an option. In the next 4 months I will get one with more memory and keep this one for portability. what do I do until then? I have MS Office for the Word program. I use the 2n1 like a laptop and Windows uploads considers
 it as such apparently. it works fine without so many updates..Please help.</p>

<p>Three points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Defragging does not save any space. It just rearranges the used space to make access to files more efficient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Deleting files doesn't save any space. It just moves the files to the recycle bin. To regain the space used by the deleted files, you need to empty the recycle bin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How big is the hard drive? There are various things you can do to save some space, but they are all temporary, and the problem will recur quickly. I suspect that if you are very short, it's primarily because the drive is too small. The only real solution
 to the problem is replacing the drive with a bigger one. I recommend nothing smaller than 500GB, and 1TB&nbsp; or even more is even better&nbsp; for most people.</p>

            Hi SK#3, does that device have a 32GB (29.1GB Usable) internal storage?
<br />
<br />If so, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            One problem that the so called windows expert coders in Redmond need to address is how they take up so much space on the hard drive. Every time windows does a Feature Upgrade, you end&nbsp; up with a new Partition on the Hard Drive. Windows should keep the
 Original "as shipped" Recovery Partition and the one from the most Current Installation .. any other ones should be deleted. Now I know you can go into Diskpart and other Partition Managers and do this manually, but some people are not too well versed in how
 or what to do. I for one, would be wary of maybe deleting the wrong one. It would be nice if Diskpart or other Partition Managers would show when a Partition was created, as this would help in determining which can go and which should stay.<br />

<p>You commented: "<span>I have changed 'where new apps are saved' (every available option) to the D:Passport HD". So are you saying that Windows will not let you move the page file to the Passport external drive?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"<span> I do not see where that would really help". Well if your page file and swap file are using 4 gig of space, by moving it to the D: drive would give you 4 gig of free space on the C: drive.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>I replied to the original post asking about Windows cleanup and moving the page file. You replied to me saying that you didn't have an external drive. My focus was on the original post. Perhaps you should start a separate thread about partitions so that
 folks don't confuse the topics.&nbsp;</p>

 out how to do that. I know it can zoom out because one day it kept zooming in and out on me while I was in my online class. Please help

<p>
</p><p>One definitely would be able to zoom in and out using the Surface Laptop camera hardware, but the control of the zoom function would be specific to the program or software using the camera at that time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is being used to perform these online class connections? If this is through a web browser, have different web browsers been tried?</p>

            <p><br /></p><p>First perform the basic checks: <br />a) Check if your headset is properly connected to your controller and your controller to your console. If you are not sure, try reconnecting your headset to your controller (plug the headset connector firmly to the port on your controller) and reconnect or resync your controller to your console.<br />b) Make sure your headset is not muted. Check the mute button on your headset control or the audio settings on your Xbox One. You may also need to adjust the audio settings to increase the microphone volume (this can enable your voice to be clearer and louder).<br />c) Check your devices and cables carefully and see if there is anything wrong you can see from outside. Also, you can test with another headset or controller, or even a different console to verify where the problem is located. If you find any hardware issue, you may need to get your accessory replaced</p><p>Secondly check your account settings: <br />Your microphone on Xbox One may be m

            I had this problem as well and it took me hours of troubleshooting to figure out what was going on. I switched out the consul and still had the problem. It turned out to be the controller. I just happened to have a second controller and when switching
 out so many parts and diving into the audio settings didn't work, I switched out the controller and halalua! Suddenly, everything worked perfectly.&nbsp;

<p>I called Microsoft yesterday because Edge would not work. &nbsp;It kept saying they had a problem and it would be resolved .Retry or Cancel. &nbsp;So I tried to delete Edge and reinstall but it said I was not the administrator but of course I am. &nbsp;Then I
 realized maybe I could not connect to the Internet using any Microsoft Product ..and that proved to be true. &nbsp;I could not get sticky notes.. or my outlook ..or anything related to Microsoft Products.. &nbsp;The woman was very nice and said I had to sign up for
 service but I was furious since I just had my daughter buy my husband a Surface and now realized I could not get support. &nbsp;She was understanding and sent me to a link. &nbsp;I followed it exactly and then lost all my documents , photos , grant application, Cad
 programs all saved .. So I called my daughter and asked her for a tech guy knowing her ofice was running Microsoft. &nbsp;She told me she had a contract with Microsoft for service but they kept telling her it expired when in fact she is an attorney and had to threaten
 to sue because her office contract for all their machines was just started. Ugh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I called and complained and again got a nice lady who restored my files by moving them to TEST..when she went to change the user - when we went to sign into a Microsoft Account again is said "SOMETHING WENT WRONG</p>
<p>TRY AGAIN OR SELECT CANCEL TO SET UP DEVICE LATER" &nbsp;We tried and tried but to no avail.. and then she disconnect and never called back and I never go who she was on the call. &nbsp;Now I can only get TEST and I cannot even secure my</p>
<p>desktop..Alas as in my daughter office case I guess I will pay a premium and go to Apple because even if they are not really Geniuses ..they are available to help. &nbsp;The airline forgot customer service so has Microsoft</p>

    <title>XBOX ONE MEMORY LEAK&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> addictedtokaos  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX ONE MEMORY LEAK&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have to say my xbox one has been working flaweless (minus Kinect Voice commands) since Day one.</p>
<p>Yesterday after saying Xbox On. I noticed navigating the menu, tiles, visually appeared to be very laggy/choppy and not fast and fluent like the previous day.</p>
<p>I tried turning the xbox off and on with the controller and still experienced the same sluggish frame rate.&nbsp; It wasnt until I shutdown and unplugged the xbox for a minute that the performance restored to normal.&nbsp; If I recall game performance wasnt impacted
 which was good.</p>
<p>My guess is a memory leak in the OS code (non game partition).&nbsp; The longer the system operates without a complete power off the worse the performance gets.</p>
<p>ANyone else experience this?</p>

<p>I have experienced this as well, probably not as bad of an experience as you did. Every time I get notifications while playing a game, it would pop up extremely slow from start to finsh. It has been 2 weeks without me ever turning off completely(low power
 state when not in use). All I did was hold power button completely for 10 seconds to shut off completely and it restarts. The system wasn't sluggish after that. It is disappointing though that I had to do that and don't want to do this process often.

<p>I came to this forum looking for a fix for this exact issue. My console has gotten a lot choppier on the OS after every day, to the point today where I thought maybe something was wrong with my system. Fully powering down and restarting the system did the
 trick. This seems like a big problem MS needs to address.</p>

<p>Very well possible memory leak....</p>
<p>Out of the "three operating systems", they are for sure NOT talking with each other correctly.... Or one has gone rogue with some bugs....</p>
<p>My bet, is to either turn off "instant On", or get rid of the Kinect sensor....</p>
<p>It may also be in my head, but I have seemed to have a better experience by turning off "install updates automatically"....</p>
<p>But that is just skepticism, in that while sleeping, the XBone is/could have network issues...</p>

<p>Same thing is happening to me. I will be playing a game, then the audio will start getting choppy. Then the game, then the whole system stops responding. A full power down reboot fixes the issue, but the issue should not be happening.</p>

<p>It's a computer - all computers have residual gradual memory leak of some kind if you leave them running continuously, and if you have it set to Instant On, it is technically still running and keeping everything in memory. Personally, I don't think there
 is a need to use Instant On and have found if you remove this option the box is just fine each time you use it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you expect a continuously running system to never have memory leaks then you are in some type of fantasy land. It's basically running 3 blades under one roof and even blade servers are rebooted pretty much weekly to keep resource degradation to a minimum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>They may be able to reduce the amount of leak over time, but they'll never get rid of it all.</p>

            <p>As the Recovery Partition is a hidden partition are you 100% sure that it is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it still showing in Disk Management, or if you use the Diskpart command from an Elevated Command prompt?&nbsp; For example the command&nbsp; "list volume" might be interesting.&nbsp; See this example for the syntax.</p>

</p><p>Hopefully your recovery disks will take your machine back to the time they were created.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instructions for restoring from them are probably in any manual received, or they are on the OEM's web site for your make and model.&nbsp; You will have to check there
 to see what is going to be restored.&nbsp; At a guess I would say that the whole hard drive will be as it was at the time they were created.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Using the recovery disks may mean the end of any Windows 7 install so save your valuable data.</p>

            <p>Hello Rosey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is of Toshiba and you are getting updates of Samsung Electronics which might not be so much important if you are not using any Samsung device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is true you may hide that update from Windows update list so that it will not appear in the update list again. For hiding an update you may refer to the steps provided below.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Window key + X.</strong></li><li>Select <strong>Control Panel </strong>from the list.</li><li>Under <strong>view by </strong>option select <strong>large icons</strong>.</li><li>And then click either <strong>Windows Update</strong> or <strong>Microsoft Update</strong>.</li><li>Now click on <strong>important updates available </strong>(recommended).</li><li>Click to <strong>clear</strong> the check box that is next to the update which you need to hide.</li><li>Expand the update that you want to hide, and then click the "<strong>Don't show this update again</strong>" check box.</li><li>Click <strong>Review</strong> and <strong>install</strong> updates.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t let me change my screensaver</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a windows 7 professional 64bit and I brought this computer recently. When I go to change my screen saver, I click "change screen saver" and it won't do anything. I thought it was the mouse so I clicked something else "change wallpaper" and
 it worked so the problem is changing the screen saver. I tried another way, on my desktop, I right clicked and went on "personalisation". I went to the bottom right corner and saw it had "screen saver none" so when I went to change that it also did nothing.
 What could be causing this. When I first got the computer everything was fine. I changed it and then a week later it just stopped. Could someone help me please.</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello, i tried them both and they did not work. For the first one when i click screensaver, it did nothing. For the second one i did try it and it said there were some corrupt files that it couldn't repair. So i just reset the computer to manufacture state.
 The screen saver is now currently working.</p>

    <title>Computer hibernates while in use - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer hibernates while in use</h2>
                    Hi there,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently encountered an issue with my laptop in that it will randomly go into what appears to be hibernation mode, even though it is in use. I can be doing anything - surfing the net, using Microsoft Office or Photoshop, watching a movie - and the
 screen will go black and go into sleep mode, after which I must hit the power button for Windows to resume. I can understand that it might power down if the computer hasn't been touched in a while, even if it is running programs in the background, but this
 happens while I'm physically using it. Needless to say, it's beginning to drive me a little batty, not least of all because there appears to be no pattern to it. Sometimes a week will pass between incidents, and at other times it will happen three times in
 an hour.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have searched for others who have experienced similar issues and attempted the fixes offered to them, but as yet nothing has worked. I have my power settings on 'Never' so, to my understanding, it shouldn't go into sleep mode at all, and have updated
 the drivers and BIOS, but no joy. Any help given will be gratefully received.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit on a HP G62 notebook. Please let me know if any further information is required (although I'm not exactly tech savvy, so you may have to help me out!)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Frankie_b,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When was the last the computer worked fine?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What are the exact troubleshooting steps that you have taken to correct the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the computer?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if you can disable hibernation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on Start</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the search tab, type CMD</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>From the list, Right click on CMD and select Run as Administrator</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Type <b>powercfg/hibernate off</b></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To enable</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Type powercfg/hibernate on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to download and install the latest drivers from the computer manufacturer and check. Update the display and chipset drivers.</p>

 quite well, and would like you to at least have some knowledge of redstone. You don't have to be good at building, but if you are that's a major plus! If you don't know if you are and have to ask yourself if you're good and don't know it immediately, you probably
 aren't. That's harsh but I need Talented people. This server is up almost all hours of the day. I am on most of the time as well. If you would like to get ahold of me...
