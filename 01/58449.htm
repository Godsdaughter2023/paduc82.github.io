<h2>            When playing specific games, receive error &#34;Hardware Acceleration disabled&#34; in Vista</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Ok, so recently I dug up and old "Toy Story 2: Action Game" by Disney Interactive, and after installing it on my Vista, I try to play it and I get an error that reads:</strong></p>
<p><strong>"Soft Abort- C:\projects\toy2\direct6.cpp Line 103</strong></p>
<p><strong>Unable to enumerate a suitable device."</strong></p>
<p><strong>After a little bit of searching, I had found that to fix this, I had to put my Hardware Acceleration at full. Once I had found these settings within my Control Panel, the option to change the acceleration was greyed out, and there was a message beneath
 it reading: "Your current display driver does not allow changes to be made to hardware acceleration settings."</strong></p>
<p><strong>Is there any way to either fix this or find some way around it?</strong></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>As the error message indicated Hardware Acceleration has to be supported by the Video Card<br />
and the drivers used. If neither of those do support it then you would have to change the Video<br />
Card out to one that does support it and has appropriate drivers.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
</p>
<p>Check with ATI and Nvidia (and other major card makers) Support and Forums.<br />

            <div>Troubleshoot problems with an app</div>
<div>Applies to Windows 8.1, Windows RT 8.1</div>
<div>In many cases, the Windows Store will automatically notify you if there’s a problem with an app and try to fix the problem. If you continue experiencing problems with an app, or if you're unable to open the Store, try running the Apps troubleshooter. This
 tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps and the Store. It's only available in English, but will work on PCs running any language.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If running the troubleshooter doesn't help, here are some things you can try to fix the app yourself.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Notes</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft doesn’t provide technical support for apps created by other companies. You’ll need to contact the publisher for technical support.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In some cases, an app might be removed from the Windows Store for violating the Terms of Use. When this happens, you'll receive an email notifying you that the app will no longer be available in the Store and the app will no longer work on your PC.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure your PC is up to date</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure the latest updates are installed on your PC and that your antivirus program isn't preventing the app from running. For more info on installing updates for your PC, see Windows Update: Frequently asked questions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure the app isn't blocked by Windows Firewall</div>
<div><br />
<div>By default, some apps are blocked by Windows Firewall to help make your PC more secure. To work properly, you might need to allow an app to receive info through the firewall. For more info, see the "Allow an app to receive info through the firewall" section
 of Windows Firewall from start to finish.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Check with your system admin</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your PC is part of a network at an organization, like a school, government agency, or business, your system admin might have turned off the use of certain apps using Group Policy. If you think that Group Policy is preventing you from using an app you
 need, contact your system administrator.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Make sure your apps are up to date</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keeping your app up to date is one way to help keep them working. You can do this by making sure that automatic app updates are turned on in the Windows Store. For more info, see Turn on automatic app updates.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sync app licenses</div>
<div><br />
<div>If a license for an app is out of sync with the license installed on your PC, the app might stop working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To sync your app licenses, follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the Start screen, tap or click Store to open the Windows Store.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.</div>
<div>(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click Settings.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tap or click App updates.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tap or click Sync licenses.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Reinstall the app</div>
<div><br />
<div>If your apps are up to date and the licenses are synced, you can reinstall the app to try to fix the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To reinstall an app, follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the Start screen, swipe down on or right-click the app you want to uninstall, tap or click Uninstall, and then tap or click Uninstall.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tap or click Store to open the Windows Store.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Swipe down from the top edge of the screen, and then tap Your apps. (If you're using a mouse, right-click, and then click Your apps.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Tap or click the app you want to install, and then tap or click Install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Contact the app publisher</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you’re still experiencing problems with an app, use the support info listed on the app’s description page to contact the app publisher for help.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To view the publisher’s app support info, follow these steps:</div>
<div><br />
<div>On the Start screen, tap or click Store to open the Windows Store.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Search or browse for the app, and then tap or click it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Scroll to the Details section of the app's description page, and then tap or click the support link for the app under Learn more. The link will open an email message for you to contact support or will take you to a support website.</div>
<div><br />

<b>Method 1:</b><br />
<p>I would suggest you to run the Windows update troubleshooter and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<b>Windows 8 or Windows 7</b>”</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2714434/en-us</a>
</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After you run the troubleshooter, make sure that you restart the computer by using hard reset using the power button and not using the shutdown option under power icon on the charms bar.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>Refer to the link to reset Windows Update components and check if it resolves the issue.
</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<b>Windows 8.1, Windows 8 and Windows 7</b>”</p>
<p>If the troubleshooter does not work, refer to the section “<b>Manually reset Windows Update components</b>” to reset Windows Update components manually from the link;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b>Note</b>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following steps to back the registry files on the computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <b>Windows and R </b>key to open the run box.</li><li>Type ‘<b>regedit</b>’ and press <b>Enter </b>from the keyboard.</li><li>Open the <b>file </b>option on the menu bar.</li><li>Click on <b>Export </b>and save the file with a name on the desktop.</li></ul>
<p>If you want to restore the file, you can do so by double clicking the file that you have saved on the desktop.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
For further troubleshooting, re-register Store app by referring to the link:<br />
<p>Refer to the link to re-register <b>Store</b>:</p>
<p>Refer to the this command “<span><b>powershell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $Env:SystemRoot\WinStore\AppxManifest.XML</b>"</span></p>

            Thanks for help, but it did not solve the problem. After a while there were another bugs with SkyDrive so I decided to do a Full System Recovery.
<div><br />
<div>After the recovery it was even worse. No metro app was able to start (just showed an error). I took it to the shop i bought it and they replaced the device with a brand new same device (Lenovo MIIX 2). This one works well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have no idea what the problem was. Maybe the system installation was somehow corrupted.</div>

&nbsp; Answer: Hi this is a response I found on VNUNET.Com from a Robert Clayton which worked for my situation which is similar to yours. I tried to access a printer on my XP Home machine in another room via a wLAN, from my Windows Vista desktop. Constantly had
 a "cannot access printer" message until I followed the instructions from Bob Clayton. Seems Windows Vista will only access a 'local printer' not a network one. From memory I needed to download the latest Windows Vista compatible driver for the printer attached
 to the XP machine, onto my Windows Vista machine before I took the steps below.</p>
<p>"Posted: 05-Aug-2007 19:09 Reply
</p>
<p>Been trying to connect my wife’s new Windows Vista laptop (yuk) to print out to my networked XP desktop's printers. I could see the files and printers on the XP machine from the laptop. Tried all the usual,
 firewalls, file and printer sharing turned on. Would not connect! </p>
<p>Apparently this is a problem that hasn't been solved.
</p>
<p>This "workaround" solved it for me.
</p>
<p>1.) Verify that File and print sharing is turned on and properly configured on the XP machine.
</p>
<p>2.) Locate and notate the Win XP computer name (i.e. "Desktop") (Found in System Properties in the Computer Name tab)
</p>
<p>3.) Locate and notate the printer share name on the XP computer (i.e. "Printer") (Found under the Sharing tab on the Printer Properties page)
</p>
<p>4.) On the Windows Vista machine launch the "Add a Printer" wizard
</p>
<p>5.) Choose "Add a local printer"
</p>
<p>6.) Select "Create a new port" radio button and choose "Local Port" from the drop down menu
</p>
<p>7.) Press Next </p>
<p>8.) In the "Enter Port Name:" box enter the following: \\Desktop\Printer where "Desktop" = the computer name from step 2 and "Printer" = the printer share name from step 3.
</p>
<p>9.) Select the Printer driver from the list provided or use the "Have Disk" button to install the correct Windows Vista driver if it is not in the built-in list.
</p>
<p>It is critical that the driver you use is Windows Vista compatible.
</p>
<p>10.) Press next </p>
<p>11.) Give the printer a distinct name and choose whether to set as the default.
</p>
<p>12.) Press Next </p>
<p>13.) Print a test page to verify functionality.
</p>
<p>14.) Press Finish <br />
Hope this helps someone else.&nbsp; Bob<br />

    <title>Access to Xbox Forums is DENIED&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Access to Xbox Forums is DENIED&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>

<p>I've been attempting to access these forums for the last few days, and keep getting the following error message:</p>


Access Denied for DAWy 2085
<hr />

The account you are attempting to login with could not be completely activated.
<p>Please contact your site administrator to activate the account or enable automatic account activation.</p>

<p>I have no clue what's going on, and have been attempting to access the forums to get in touch with the Microsoft Rewards Team, as the only way to reach them, apparently, is via the forum - which is clearly a problem (there should
 be MULTIPLE ways of contacting them, not just one). As per the advice of a Microsoft representative, I've created this "dummy" account so I can post on the forums and bring this issue to the attention of the forum administrators/moderators.</p>

<p>I'm attempting to contact the Rewards Team because I'm missing at least 30-60 Microsoft points, have 40 points currently pending - 20 of which have been pending for approximately a month - and am having issues participating in the
 current Kinect Sports Season I and II giveaway that's being run where you can win Microsoft points. Regarding the Kinect Sports giveaway: when I initially went to the giveaway page via an advertisement on my Xbox console (hasn't appeared since the first day),
 it said I could participate by downloading seasons I and II FREE. I went to both the first and second options - Season I and II, respectively - and both came up blank. I then proceeded to try the Downloads section - the fourth and final option (the third was
 the rules) - and received the error statuscode 8007000D, which isn't even listed in the error codes section of this site!</p>

<p>Eventually, these issues have led me here, as you can see. If something could be done to resolve these issues (the biggest one being my access to the forums, at present), I would greatly appreciate it!</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>-DAWy</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ahh, I see. Thank you for that bit of information. I'll keep that in mind for any future postings. I'll also attempt to keep in mind that there seems to be spacing issues (i.e. lack of proper paragraphs), so I'll need to work around that as best I can.</p>

<p>There is a way around the "spacing issues", I haven't quite figured it out yet myself but the answer is with 'rich formatting'. &nbsp;Should you hit 'Return' with the intention of having a space between your paragraphs, it won't leave a space at first, but if
 you access the same 'Edit' function after posting (be quick about it!) and hit 'Return' again in the exact same spot I believe that a space will appear in the edited post. &nbsp;My feeling is that they make it difficult for one to draft a "diatribe" for fear of
 "cluttering" up the forums, the tools are there however if you're so inclined...:-)</p>

<p>I have sent some feed back to Skype when uninstalling various times but it seems like the feed back comments have no meaning since no reaction from Skype. I am dead tired&nbsp; of this mess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Juan,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. Appreciated very much.</p>
<p>However, everything is ok now. When I closed the page with my message to the community another page appeared on the screen requesting me to register for my Skype account. I did and Skype works now as it is supposed to. A miracle after a long time ! Thank
 you again for paying interest in my problem.</p>
<p>Cheers, Steen Jelgren, Botswana</p>

    <title>Is Windows XP Media Center Edition a seperate version like - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is Windows XP Media Center Edition a seperate version like professional or home&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows XP support is over? doesn't seem that way. I'm trying to salvage my old media center desktop
</p>
<p>
</p><p>pc "<strong><em>HP Media Center m377n</em></strong>". I have wiped the harddrive and installed
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>Ubuntu Linux</em></span> to preform </p>
<p>
</p><p>hardware diagnostics. It is my hope to re-install a product "<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft Windows XP Media Center
</span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Edition 2004</span></em></strong>"that was bought and paid for from best buy when we bought the pc. Now I am willing to
</p>
<p>
</p><p>shell out a few bucks for an install disk but with so many available I'm a little weary. Here are the Install
</p>
<p>
</p><p>disks I am able to purchase from <strong>EBAY</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Windows XP Home</strong></em></span> with service package 1, 2, or 3<br />
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Windows XP Professional</strong></em></span> with service package 1, 2, or 3<br />
</p>
<p>and a french XP media center 2005 (This might be the one)<br />
</p>
<br />
<p>http://www.ebay.com/itm/WINDOWS-XP-MEDIA-CENTER-EDITION-2005-ANGLAIS-Neuf-emballage-scelle-/221393938558?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_23&amp;hash=item338c1b687e<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Now my more refined <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>question</strong>
</span>is which installation disk includes <strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Microsoft Windows XP Media</span></em></strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Center Edition 2004</span></em></strong>, furthermore, which installation diskshould I use?
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I feel as if my product needs to use an extremely specific disk for the proper re-installation.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>please answers and suggestions only no rants.<br />

            You can only get it from the manufacturer that built the computer.&nbsp; If they don't have it (or don't want to provide it), then your only other option is to buy it separately (maybe used on Ebay or similar sites, but be careful because people often sell
 fake/counterfeits that are infected with malware).

            Thanks for your information&nbsp;the disk&nbsp;wasn't included at purchase.&nbsp;When our family had problems we let a computer guy at our work "fix" it. XP home edition loaded onto it, we really didn't notice it. I recently began taking interest in the subject and its
 been a discouraging journey.&nbsp; Is it quite possible to&nbsp;compress&nbsp;the edition into an image from a computer with the Extracted OS with good intentions from&nbsp;a program like 7zip?

            <p>Are you saying that the BIOS recovery (F9 or something on start up)&nbsp;will not restore your machine to factory? I'm sure your using the drive too. Have you tried one of those data recovery progams. Don't quote me, but formatting allows the data to be overwritten
 it doesn't actually erase it. If you didn't not wipe or clean the drive it may be recoverable.&nbsp;The data you recover from the&nbsp;disk&nbsp;may be incomplete if you have began to use the drive after formatting.</p>

<h2>            Nvidia gtx 560m is not working after updating to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Asus laptop which I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. It has the Nvidia gtx 560m 2gb core i7 graphics card. Before the upgrade to Windows 10, my gaming went smoothly and my laptop ran normally. Now when I am gaming, the graphics look like
 something from minecraft and I have a lot of lagging. I have tried going to the Nvidia website and installing the updated driver from there, but it fails and says, "this version of windows is not supported." But I have windows 10 and I am updating to the Windows
 10 drivers for my laptop. <br />
<br />
If someone could please help me fix this issue I would appreciate it. <br />
<br />
Thank you. </p>

            <p>Lots of issues with recent NVIDIA driers for Windows 10 in addition to AMD driver for R9 series cards</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GeForce experience is not very good at finding suitable drivers but I suggest using it as they are constantly updating it&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>eventually better drivers will be released, windows 10 has changed a lot of stuff under the hood</p>
<p>
</p><p>DX12 is only one change, lots of other changes in the driver stack etc</p>

            <p>Nvidia have dropped the ball on the GTX 560M (Vendor/Device 10DE:1251). This model is in may notebooks installed as a secondary GPU behind and another (often Intel GPU) which is used for 2D/desktop rendering.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of Nvidias drivers can work with this card, but they do not list the vendor and device id in their drivers. This means&nbsp; Windows 10 will not install them. In older versions of windows it was possible to add the above IDs to the inf file which resulted
 in a working driver which was unsigned or incorrectly signed. Now that windows 10 has increased the security aroudn loading unsigned drivers I have found no way to install the drivers which were working in windows 7, or any current drivers which nvidia claims
 can support this card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nvidia appear to have no interest in supporting a several year old GPU, so I would not expect updates. Were on our own.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you get low quality/low frame rate graphics is because the Nvidia GPU will not be in use at all and there will be software or really slow hardware rendering on the Intel GPU.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you check device manager you will see something similar to my machine which lists and Intel 4000 as working AND a "Microsoft Basic Display". This second item is your 560M and you can verify this by looking under the device properties/details tab and check
 Hardware IDs. If you see VEN_10DE (Nvidia) DEV_1251 (560M) you can confirm. But we need a way to get older or hacked drivers to load on windows 10 to use it.</p>

<h2>            Windows are resized and moved to upper-left corner of screen when monitor wakes up from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell 24" 4k Monitor (3840x2160) connected to my NVIDIA GTX 970 via DisplayPort 1.2.&nbsp; Whenever the monitor enters sleep mode, upon wakeup, all my open windows have been resized (smaller) and placed in the upper-left corner of the screen.&nbsp; This only
 happens when connected to the DisplayPort output.&nbsp; If I connect to DVI or HDMI, the problem goes away.&nbsp; The problem, however, is&nbsp;those other outputs only allow 4K at 30Hz refresh rate instead of 60Hz&nbsp;which is not an option for gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a common issue scouring the web.</p>

            Are you running the latest Nvidia driver? I have the same video card using Windows 10 Pro with current drivers and I don't get this issue. I have 3 monitors connected - 1 each on HDMI, DVI, and DP.

            <p>I try to keep the latest driver installed.. Windows likes to keep downgrading my NVIDIA driver causing me to spend a lot of time fighting with Windows Update.&nbsp; That aside, yes I am running the latest driver.&nbsp; I also completely reformatted the computer and
 tried a fresh install of Windows since I felt like upgrading from Windows 8 to the insider preview, then to the final probably left a lot of junk around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: This problem also happens on Windows 8.&nbsp; I'm convinced it has something to do w/ 4k or what happens when some monitors enter a low power sleep state.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In short, search the windows registry for the entries</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PrimSurfSize.cx<br />
PrimSurfSize.cy</p>
<p>ActiveSize.cx<br />
ActiveSize.cy</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change the .cx entries to your monitors horizontal resolution and the .cy entries to the vertical resolution. &nbsp;For example, if your monitor is set to 1920x1080, then all occurrences of&nbsp;PrimSurfSize.cx and&nbsp;ActiveSize.cx should be updated to 1920, and the
 other two should be updated to 1080.</p>

            <p>It doesn't solve the issue if you have a 4k display set to 3840x2160, windows get moved to top left and extend to right and bottom in a polygon which corresponds to a resolution of 1600x1200, no matter what values you put in that registry key.</p>

<p>This resolves the issue with my HP 4k (2560 x 1440, display port) display unit.

<p>Anyway, Microsoft, this should be resolved in Windows by default, without users having to tamper with registry editor - not all users can do that!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 November Update - The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error INSTALL_DRIVERS operation</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I was offered the November update (1511 10586) via Windows Update and attempted to install it on two occasions. Both failed and the system was put back to my current built (10240). The update then disappeared
 from Windows Update, so I downloaded an ISO and attempted to install that way. </p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">The first time the installation just failed with no error message, but on the second attempt, I was told:</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">0xC1900101 - 0x20007</p>
<p class="contentStandard"><em>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error INSTALL_DRIVERS operation</em></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">As far as I can tell, this is a driver issue with a piece of hardware on my system, but there's no way to identify which piece of hardware! I get constant random freezes (and have to turn off and on the PC) using
 Windows 10, so I can only assume that whatever driver is failing to install during the update, it's also the one responsible for the freezes, but there's no information on the cause that I can find in any logs.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I have an oldish motherboard - GA-MA770T-UD3 but your system compatibility checker said there wouldn't be any issues with the upgrade from Windows 7; if it had, I wouldn't have risked it! Now I simply wish I hadn't
 upgraded to Windows 10 because my Windows 7 system was fast, stable and reliable. It's too late for me to rollback to 7 now!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I am wasting hours and hours on trying to troubleshoot these frustrating issues, instead of being able to just get on with work!</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from 7 to 10 then got this error&nbsp; windows should have rolled back to windows 7 auto&nbsp; for you</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you upgraded your windows 7 to windows 10 RTM and then upgraded to windows 10 1511 November upgrade&nbsp; it should have rolled you back to windows 10 RTM if it has and you want to go back to windows 7&nbsp; this is easy go to start menu select&nbsp; settings / update
 &amp; security / Recovery and select Reset This PC. this should take you back to the previous&nbsp; windows you had before upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>On another Note if you really want to be upgraded to the 1511 if you have had&nbsp; windows 10 installed in your system you can&nbsp; do a fresh install strait to build 1511&nbsp; by using the new updated Media Creation Tool found
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Here</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>before going this road&nbsp; I would backup any data you wish to keep before continuing</p>
<p>
</p><div>please note after you have downloaded this tool you will have to right click and open it with Administrator rights or it will not open.</div>
<div><br />
after opening you want to create new installation&nbsp; media for another pc </div>
<div><br />
If the next screen shows the wrong options for your language&nbsp; or anything please untick the box at the bottom that says&nbsp; Use the recommended options for this PC</div>
<div><br />
select your language ,&nbsp; edition , architecture </div>
<div><br />
As far as Edition Goes&nbsp; selecting windows 10 will give you the option on installation for&nbsp; Home and Pro Editions.</div>
<div><br />
please note if your going to select architecture&nbsp; as Both this makes the size of the&nbsp; file much bigger and there for you will need a 8 gig flash drive at least&nbsp; so your best just selecting either 64 bit or 32 bit. after you have selected all 3 options to what
 you need press Next.</div>
<div><br />
you will then be told by Microsoft to remember to pick the right edition of windows&nbsp; just press ok as the edition you've selected&nbsp; comes&nbsp; with Both Home and Pro&nbsp; anyway.</div>
<div><br />
the next screen you will be shown is to select the media type&nbsp; Flash drive or ISO&nbsp; I personally use flash drive but you can download the iso and after its finished it has a built in DVD burner to directly write the iso to a DVD but I personally think Flash
 drives are faster and more reliable.</div>
<div><br />
after you've selected what you want to use click next and the tool will continue to download the files you need. this can take some time depending on the options&nbsp; you choose&nbsp; above.</div>
<div><br />
and please remember on installation if you had a Home edition of windows 10 installed before&nbsp; install the same one again Don't choose&nbsp; Pro or you will be asked to provide a key for the&nbsp; new edition&nbsp; If you Choose&nbsp; the&nbsp; same edition as you where before on installation
 just select when asked for a key Not now or I don't have a key. don't worry as when you get to the stage of entering your desktop&nbsp; your computer should already be self activated. you can check this by going to Start Menu , Settings , Update and Security ,
 then selecting Activation from the menu on the left.</div>
<div><br />
I hope this helps</div>

            <p>Hi Trevor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply, but I think you've misunderstood the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm already running Windows 10 - build 10240 and I'm unable to install the November update 10586. Therefore the roll-back is only to the existing Windows 10 build. I cannot go back to Windows 7 because I installed Windows 10 months ago, so the option to
 revert back to 7 is long gone, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to install the update on my PC using both Windows Update AND the Media Creation Tool... it fails every time and the cause appears to be driver related but Microsoft have stated, in another support ticket, that driver issues during updates don't
 generate any logs, so it's impossible to find out which driver is causing the failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run sfc - no problems were detected. I've updated the drivers to the most recent available, removed all USB items, turned off the anti-virus etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an aside, I've also tried to install the update on my laptop (also running build 10240) and that repeatedly fails with a Kernel_Security_Check_Failure BSOD.</p>

            <p>I don't really want to attempt a clean installation and then have to reinstall all my programs (this is a work PC with dozens of programs installed). Especially as there's no guarantee that the new build will install anyway, if there's a hardware/driver
 issue.</p>

            <p>So, I have now tried uninstalling loads of programs, disabling loads of devices, disconnected all hard drives bar the system drive and have attempted to install the new build about NINE times.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">It fails every time, usually at around 16%, so I assume something is preventing files being written to the hard drive (SSD) as it's in the copying files part of the installation. I've had three different error
 messages and now back to <strong><em>The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error INSTALL_DRIVERS operation.</em></strong></p>

            <p>I've run a clean installation of the new build on a spare SSD &amp; it installs without any issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 10 failed attempts to get the new build to install, it appears the only way to get the new version on my system is to start over with a clean installation &amp; then reinstall all my programs &amp; files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What an absolute pain in the a**e! Does this mean I'll have to go through this procedure every time you release a new build? It also took 3 attempts to get the new build installed on my laptop and judging by the number of these same issues I've found on
 the net, going back to Windows 8, it would seem a distinct possibility! </p>

<h2>            In windows 10 my USB card reader stopped because &#39;driver already loaded-driver error. How to fix it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last week I suddenly cannot see the portable external card reader when I plug it in to any UB port. But it still works fine on our other (Windows 7) computer. diagnosing, device manager confirms an error with the driver, and I get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware because a previous instance of the device driver is still in memory. (Code 38)</p>
<p>The driver could not be loaded because a previous version of the driver is still in memory. I have uninstalled the driver and rebooted the computer, but the problem remains (I had hoped this would install one good driver and I would be set again.) driver
 is USBSTOR.sys in the Windows\system32\drivers folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get it working again?</p>

            <span><span>Hi Regricket,&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing currently. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow below steps and check if it works:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Run the Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with hardware and devices.
<br />
I suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your USB device. Refer these steps:<br />
1. Right click on <strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
2. Change the view by option on the top right to <strong>Large</strong> icons.<br />
3. Click on<strong> Troubleshooting </strong>and click on the <strong>view all </strong>
option on the left panel.<br />
4. Run the<strong> Hardware and devices </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Uninstall the USB controllers</strong></p>
<span>
<p>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated, similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers are not detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</p>
<p>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</p>
<p>1. Right click on Start and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Double click to expand "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>", right click on the Host Controller,click "<strong>Uninstall</strong>" and
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click "<strong>OK</strong>".</p>
<p><strong>(Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed)</strong><br />
3. <strong>Restart</strong> the system and Windows 10 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</p>
<p>If the issue sill persists, I would request you to check for chipset driver updates that you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Keep us posted on Windows related queries and we will be happy to assist you further.</p>

<h2>            UAC prompt has a background image instead of just being gray.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an unusual problem where the background of the User Account Control prompt has an
<em>image</em> instead of just being a solid color. I can't for the life of me figure out how it even happened in the first place. To make matters worse, it's a private image that's showing up, so would be embarrassing if someone else saw. I tried deleting
 the picture but it still shows up somehow. Unplugging the external hard drive (where the image lives) seemed to fix the problem, but it's a pain to have to unplug it all the time. Going into UAC settings and choosing the "notify me only when apps try to make
 changes to my computer (do not dim my desktop)" also works, but creates a security risk. I searched google every which way and couldn't find an answer. Anyways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            If your installation of Windows 10 is exhibiting strange behavior that doesn't seem to resolve through typical troubleshooting you may need to perform a "Repair Upgrade". This will reinstall windows over top of your existing installation and will preserve personal files and settings. Here is a detailed tutorial to follow<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<h2>            Why do I have a FAT32 partition and how do I find out what is on it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to free up space on my hard drive and I went to Disk Management and discovered that I have a FAT32 partition.&nbsp; This partition has a capacity of 2.9GB and is currently over 90% full.&nbsp; How do I find out what is stored here?&nbsp; Is there a reason
 this partition is necessary?&nbsp; I certainly did not set it up (at least, not on purpose).&nbsp;&nbsp; I use Windows XP.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The best thing to do would be to consult the documentation for your machine and see if there is information for the service partition.</p>
<p>You can look at the partition with disk editing tools like Acronis Disk Director or you can use a simple partition editing tool like Symantec's PtEdit32 to change the partition type and you will then be able to look at the partition with Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>Take note of the partition type before you change it so that you may then set it back as it was.&nbsp; The partition is most likely a hidden type 1C, if it is you want to change it to a type 0C to unhide it.&nbsp; A reboot is necessary for Windows to see and mount
 the partition so that it becomes available to Windows Explorer or the Disk Management tool.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>WARNING!!!</strong> </span></p>
<p>Slippy fingers or user errors when using disk or partition editing tools can lead to the loss of all the data on the disk!&nbsp; Using PtEdit32 is fairly easy and straightforward but it does require a bit of knowledge and understanding of (or a willingness to
 learn) how partitions are arranged and identified.&nbsp; You can download PtEdit32 from the Symantec FTP server, easy to find with a search on the net:&nbsp;<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0oG7mbsbOxMsWcBUlZXNyoA?p=ftp.symantec.com+ptedit32&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=yfp-t-501" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://search.yahoo.com/search;_ylt=A0oG7mbsbOxMsWcBUlZXNyoA?p=ftp.symantec.com+ptedit32&amp;fr2=sb-top&amp;fr=yfp-t-501</a></p>
<p>You can look but don't delete or change any files inside the service partition, if you do the restore process may fail when you need it most!</p>

            <p>Hello RebelSuperset16,</p><p><br /></p><p>It appears that your deposit has encountered an error which has caused the process to fail. What is occurring is that when our deposit process queries the Microsoft Account database containing your accounts to deposit into, the database does not direct our deposit to the specific account you have indicated that you would like the deposit into. Since our deposit process does not know where your accounts lead off to, it aborts your deposit rather than place your Credits into your account without being instructed to.</p><p><br /></p><p>We have escalated this issue to another team to resolve, since we do not have access to those databases. At the current time, we are still awaiting word of their estimate on when to expect this issue to be resolved. Apologies for the inconvenience.</p>

<p>Graphic drivers, such as the&nbsp;atikmdag.sys were involved in some of the crashes.</p>
<p>I would suggest to uninstall and reinstall&nbsp;the video drivers. If you have recently updated the&nbsp;video drivers install the previous version that worked without issue.</p>

<h2>            Video Transfer</h2>
                    I'm trying to transfer old family videos from miniDV to my computer for touching up and burning to dvd.&nbsp; It seems my camera has been deemed "extinct" being sony no longer has a driver to support it. Does anyone know of an effective and hopefully inexpensive
 way of transferring videos to windows 10?

<p>Hey Zachary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the link. I usually go this route with my photo camera, but my video camera is a relic from a former era. It's a Sony handycam DCR-HC52, it the last and most highend camera that still used tape cartridges (bought it about the time disk cameras
 were coming out). I use to hook it up to my old vista computer via "firewire"; but using a "firewire" to usb, windows 10 recognizes there's something there but can't communicate with the video camera. I've tried using a "RCA" to usb converter, but even that
 seems to be having issues. Is there something still out there that would allow my computer to recognize the camera?</p>

            I looked up your camcorder and it said that the drivers already come with the OS. So it may just be that Windows 10 does not support the camcorder.

<p>
</p><p>To uninstall an app on the Start screen<br />
<br />
1. On the Start screen, press and hold or right-click the app tile.<br />
<br />
2. Tap or click Uninstall.<br />
</p>
<p><span>3. If you'd rather not uninstall an app, but want to remove it from your Start screen, instead of tapping or clicking Uninstall, tap or click Unpin from Start.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Also when I click "uninstall" it takes me to a window to select programs to uninstall rather than uninstall the app's. Not all apps offer the "uninstall" option. Is there not just a way to wipe out the apps altogether from windows so that the app start screen
 is no longer on the computer?</p>

            Sorry , In general there is no official and supported way to disable or &nbsp;wipe out all the apps altogether and switch back to old start screen. For this reason all of methods and suggestion to do that are unofficial .

            Hi AndreiClenci
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Steps B &amp; C  (Restore and Reset) can also be performed from Media creation tool if they can't be done as above. You will have to cut Media creation tool on another computer.

            Hi Andrei,
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows
<br />If available, this would be the best option . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

            Hi,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />Let us try repairing the existing OS.
<br />
<br />On a working computer, create an Installation media of Windows 10 that allows you to repair existing Windows Installation.
<br />
<br />Create a USB Flash Drive
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot from the USB Flash drive-Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot in BIOS Settings.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />
<br />Then open Advanced Startup options after the computer boots from USB. Click Repair your computer at the first screen that says Install now.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-advanced-startup-options-windows-10-a.html#option6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-boot-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Select Startup repair, let it finish the job and see if the computer can boot afterward.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, consider doing a clean install after rescuing your files.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Issues with downloading the Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition may occur if you are logged in to a different account. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you check your purchase history on the
<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Billing page</a> if the Minecraft is on the list. You can also check it on the Windows Store if it is listed under
<strong>Games </strong>in <strong>My Library</strong>. If the game is on the list, you have to use your Microsoft account to sign in on the PC instead of the local account. To add your Microsoft Account, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Start </strong>and click on the <strong>Settings </strong>icon.</li><li>Go to <strong>Accounts</strong> and click <strong>Email &amp; App accounts</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Add an account</strong> and add the Microsoft Account that you used to purchase the game.</li><li>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After restarting your PC, reset the Windows Store to clear the Store cache. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> on your keyboard.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong>.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>wsreset.exe</strong>, and then hit Enter.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Launch the Windows Store and open the game library. If you see Minecraft on the list, look for the download icon&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f854e709-6c8e-476a-8bfb-788f91c34b17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f854e709-6c8e-476a-8bfb-788f91c34b17" /></a>at
 the right side of the page and click it to download the game.</p>

<p>Hi Gaulo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are willing to remove the hidden app on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Did you try installing the Samsung SCX-4500 Series app in Compatibility mode and check?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, follow the below steps to install the app in Compatibility mode and check if it works. Here's how:</p>
<p>A <strong>Compatibility mode </strong>is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Click on <strong>Start </strong>and select <strong>All apps</strong>, search for the app, right click on it and select
<strong>Open file location</strong>.<br />
<strong>2. </strong>If Open file location option is not found, locate the file location manually.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Right click on the setup file of the app and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".<br />
<strong>4. </strong>Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.<br />
<strong>5. </strong>Place a check mark next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select operating system from the&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; drop down list.<br />
<strong>6. </strong>Let the app install and then check the functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to uninstall the app, follow the below steps:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Right click on <strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Search for the app, right click on it and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>thanks for your answer. However it does not help me further because the main problem is that the app does not appear in the list so I cannot&nbsp;click on it to reinstall or remove it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the delayed response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to remove the app from the Windows registry and check if it resolves the issue. Here's how:</p>
<p><strong>1. Right click </strong>on the <strong>Start </strong>menu and select <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>, type the command <strong>regedit.exe </strong>and press
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Click on <strong>Edit </strong>on <strong>Registry Editor window</strong>, go to<strong> Find
</strong>and type the name of the <strong>app</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Once an item is found, read to make sure it is a link to that app.</p>
<p><strong>4. Right click </strong>on the link and select <strong>Delete</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Continue deleting items pertaining to the program, until all the links are gone.
</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Check if the issue is resolved, if not <strong>Restart </strong>
the system.</p>
<p>

            <p>I have cleared the register from any instance of the word Samsung. However I still get the same warning.</p>
<p>Do you have any other idea?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Can you please clarify what number are you trying to replace? Is it your own primary&nbsp;contact information? Are you getting any error message when replacing this information? What exactly is happening when doing the change?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will look forward to your reply.</p>
