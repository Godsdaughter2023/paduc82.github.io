<p>You probably need to switch the monitors around - primary/secondary. Go to Control Panel&gt;Display&gt;Settings tab. Click "Identify".</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 Midi Keyboard Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matt_rome  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Midi Keyboard Issue</h2>
                    <p>Windows Version: 8.1</p>
<p>Hardware: Novation Launchkey 25 MIDI Keyboard</p>
<p>Driver Version:&nbsp;6.3.9600.16490</p>
<p>Driver Files:</p>
<p>------------- drmk.sys</p>
<p>------------- ksthunk.sys</p>
<p>------------- prtcls.sys</p>
<p>------------- USBAUDIO.sys</p>
<p>------------- SysFxUI.dll</p>
<p>------------- WMALFXGFXDSP.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard, when plugged in, is quickly recognized by Windows. Device Manager indicates that the device is present and working properly. However, the device sends MIDI output for only a limited amount of time. While the time between plugging in the device
 and the cessation of functionality varies, the issue is reproducible 100% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Plug in the MIDI keyboard</p>
<p>2) Wait for the MIDI keyboard to be recognized</p>
<p>3) Launch MIDI-OX (a program for monitoring MIDI input)</p>
<p>4) Press keys on the keyboard and watch the MIDI input in the MIDI-OX monitor window</p>
<p>5) Continue pressing keys until no further input is recognized</p>
<p>6) Close MIDI-OX</p>
<p>7) Re-Open MIDI-OX and check for input -- There is none</p>
<p>8) Close MIDI-OX</p>
<p>9) Disable the keyboard in Device Manager</p>
<p>10) Re-Enable the keyboard in Device Manager</p>
<p>11) Re-Open MIDI-OX</p>
<p>12) Press keys on the keyboard and watch the MIDI input in the MIDI-OX monitor window</p>
<p>13) Continue pressing keys until no further input is recognized</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps 8 through 13 can be repeated indefinitely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actions already taken:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Contacted the manufacturer and was given a firmware update -- No change</p>
<p>b) Tested same process on Windows 7 machine -- Everything works as expected</p>
<p>c) Attempted to a registry edit recommended by users in various forums -- No change</p>
<p>d) Looked for a driver to install in "Compatibility Mode," but the Novation is a class compliant device and there is no executable to run in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced that this is a Windows issue -- Please provide a recommended fix.</p>
<p />

</p><p>We can run you through all sorts of windows diagnostics but frankly I suspect you would be wasting your time.&nbsp; I think you need to be persistent with the mfr.&nbsp; I would check the keyboard (and software) on another computer to eliminate the possibility of
 hardware problem.</p>

            <p>Ok -- After just a little bit of fooling around with the keyboard today with both Ableton and MIDI-OX set to run in compatibility mode, the symptoms came back. Functionality was there long enough for me to get optimistic, then the input from the keyboard
 "froze" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely someone has dealt with this? Lots of people use MIDI USB keyboards to make music at home.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 parent controls sucks</h2>
                    <p>I really need a local way to control the screen time.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1) Giving extra time is painful and usually does not work.&nbsp; The email sends me to the ms website and then it asks to temporarily give more screen time (well sometimes it does).&nbsp; After that, it random (except it usually doesn't work) as to when the child
 actually gets more screen time.</p>
<p>2) Internet will sometimes go down and my child has a report due.&nbsp; Oops, I guess you have to wake up a 3am and see if the Internet is back on.&nbsp;&nbsp; What a load of ****!&nbsp; This should be local function.</p>
<p>3) I'm so glad you collect all this information about our usage.&nbsp; Send me a check for $50/month for the use of this info.</p>
<p>4) Did I mention this is a painful and error prone process that will not work during a network outage.&nbsp; Send me a check for $50/month for my pain and suffering.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>I request you to set up the Family Safety again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>
<div>There are two ways to do this. The easiest way is to enter the complete file path:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the Start screen, type C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Parental Controls and press Enter.
<div>If you’d rather open each folder individually, follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search.<br />
&nbsp;(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)
<div>b. Make sure that Apps is selected, and then enter Computer in the Search box.</div>
<div>c. Tap or click to open the Computer app. Open C:, open the Program Data folder, open the Microsoft folder, open the Windows folder, and open the Parental Controls folder.
<div>3) Delete all contents of the Parental Controls folder. This will delete any corrupt files. Your settings will be downloaded again from familysafety.microsoft.com the next time you sign in.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that it’s possible for the files to become corrupted again. If you experience more problems with Family Safety time limits and PC activity reporting, just follow these steps again.</div>

            BSOD 1 returns a SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M. States that winlogon.exe could be the issue. Then goes on to say it is a memory corruption issue with 
<br />
<br />BSOD 2 is the same. memory corruption in Microsoftedge.exe
<br />
<br />3 is a SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION
<br />
<br />4 -- I could not get to open 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />These were probably caused by a driver. Do the following 2 tests to verify your memory and find the driver issue.

    <title>windows RT Driver issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> charliechesterps  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows RT Driver issues</h2>
                    <p>When is Microsoft going to get serious with windows RT driver issues and start taking it seriously ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My problem which is frustrating to the point of considering using the surface as a Frisbee is my RT has lost all drivers relating to battery management. I have no battery detected with a red cross, Then abruptly it gives me the plugged in sign saying not
 charging then I restart then it goes back to no battery detected, this just goes on repeatedly and it's getting so that I'm beginning to hate this surface. Done all the checks with the drivers in manager, uninstalled and rebooted and nothing works. even to
 the point of downloading a fresh recovery image from Microsoft and clean installing the O/S.</p>
<p>When I get to the driver update it says the best drivers are installed for your device. How can that be if my problem keeps coming back to haunt? What's even more enraging is the slightest knock of the charger switches off the tablet. causing me to lose
 important files/documents before I've finished compiling them causing me to start over.</p>
<p>How annoying is that ?? It's only by a small miracle I've not launched this out of the car window at speed.</p>
<p>Regardless as to whether this is in or out of warranty, this matter needs serious support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most annoyingly you can't even get support from 3rd party support centres like intel or anyone else when you try to download a utility tool to scan problems in drivers all you get is this app won't run on this device.</p>

<p>I can see how angry you are and I don't have good news for you. Microsoft has stopped development for the Surface RT and Surface 2 completely. If you've reimaged from a downloadable recovery image, and still have battery issues, then there really is no fix
 for this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to replace the device with something else if you want dependability.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have observed that there is a similar question about windows 7, but I didn't succeed trying those steps. I'm trying to install a software called MassLynx, used by chemicals, in windows 10. At the end of the installation, I receive the message:

            <p>Hi Julia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in installing the software on your device. Do not worry we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be an issues with the corrupted/ missing system files. Try the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1: </strong>I suggest you to run SFC scan and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>System File Checker</span></strong><span> is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
</span><strong><span>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</span></strong><span> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>CTRL+Shift+ESC</strong>, to open the
<strong>Task manager</strong>. </span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>File </strong>&gt; Run <strong>New Task</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside “<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong>”

<strong><span>Enter</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>After the scan, restart the computer and check for the issue.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: If you are not able to repair some files after performing SFC scan, I suggest you to refer to the point 3 “Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to
 fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log <var><span>%WinDir%</span></var>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log”. Under the section “Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)” to repair the corrupted files after performing SFC scan.</span></p>

<h2>            When scrolling in a window, the window jumps back to the top.</h2>
                    I have a folder open with lots (1000s) of files and I'm trying to quickly scroll down to get to the one I want.&nbsp; When I scroll down with my mouse's scroll wheel the window scrolls correctly, but when I stop scrolling it jumps back up to the top of the
 window.&nbsp; The second time I scroll it doesn't jump back up, but this is really irritating.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I have the files organized as icons, list, or details it always does it.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>1. Are you using a laptop or a desktop?</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>If you are using a laptop disable the touchpad and check if&nbsp; that resolves the issue.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
It's possibility that a third party application is causing the conflict. let us forst checkin safe mode if the issue exists.<br />
<strong>Step 1.</strong><br />
Please check whether you face the same issue while working in the safe mode.<br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.<br />
e. When Windows starts check if the issue still persists.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For additional information refer to the articles below.<br />
<strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2. <br />
</strong>If the issue does not exist in Safe Mode perform Clean Boot troubleshooting to find the root cause of the issue.<br />

<h2>            Iphone 5s not syncing with Windows 8.1</h2>
                    My phone will not show up in ITunes on 8.1. In file explorer it shows up as Apple IPhone not&nbsp;the devices&nbsp;actual name. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver to no affect. Everything is up to date as far as phone and iTunes versions. Please help
 if you can. All updates are installed. Anybody else have this issue? This started two weeks ago.

<h2>            keypad not working</h2>
                    I updated my laptop to the new windows 10 last night. After everything had finished and the updates had fully completed, I could not use the pad at all, not to click nor to swipe. I've shut it down and restarted it four times with no changes. I have yet
 to remove the power source, but I was wondering if anyone else was having similar problems? And if so, how have you fixed them?

    <title>October Update Bricked my ASUS Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orianh  say:</h3>
<h2>            October Update Bricked my ASUS Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I am going to TRY to avoid the obvious rant by just saying "Microsoft. Leave my damn computer ALONE!"<br />
<br />
System working fine on October 1. It is a WORKING system that I use to MAKE MY LIVING. Unfortunately, I was forced into a Windows system becuase the necessary software is only available for Windows. :-/<br />
<br />
My system gave me two options on shutdown last night. "update and restart" or "update and shut down". I had a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose update and shut down just before leaving the office.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning, October 2, 2018 - my system is destroyed. On boot, I get the blue screen that says something like "We have encountered a problem... " it then counts up to 100% and restarts the system... Only to repeat the same crud!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the "three forced shutdown" thing to no avail. It does nothing.</p>
<p>I have tried my "Recovery USB".... Of course, it does absolutely nothing except tell me it can't do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the errors tells me that a required device is not present. But, of course, that is Windows fault in every conceivable way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is a BUSINESS system. It is how I make a living. But, NONE of the safety measures that I have taken (recovery USB updated weekely, system backups on the second drive) NOTHING is accessible. And, NOTHING works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options?</p>

            Hi Orian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Then I'd save a System Image backup so if WIndows ever becomes irreparable you can restore it in 20 minutes from booted media and the stored image.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for your attempt to assist. It really is appreciated. But...<br />
<br />
The boot menu in BIOS has completely stopped recognizing my USB Recovery stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this, NONE of the recovery options were functional whatsoever. All of them just sent me back to the beginning or rebooted the system. Startup repair just reboots the system to the same conditions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only option in BIOS boot menu is the EFI boot partition which boots the corrupted windows installation. Booting with the USB recovery stick inserted now does not show up even in BIOS boot menu. (It did before. So, I don'T know why it stopped)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What good is a recovery system that doesn't allow you to recover anything? I thought I was protected by creating a 'recovery USB' every week. And, making backups to my secondary drive... which evidently is also no longer recognized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have another windows system. So, how can I create bootable media from the info provided? How can I recover my Windows PRO license? Why is this still so ridiculously difficult after 25 years of development.<br />
<br />
Completely lost - and honestly... freaking out here. I'm losing hundreds of dollars just today with no idea what I am going to do about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I see on the repeating boot error screen is "A required device is not connected or is inaccessible." I don't HAVE any devices that need to be connected in order for this laptop to boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My burning question now is... How do I get Windows 10 reinstalled on this system?</p>
<p>I purchased Windows 10 PRO from the Microsoft store. But, that does me no good since I cannot boot my system. Recovery is NOT working in any way whatsoever. And, it appears that Microsoft has SO screwed up my system that it cannot even locate the previous
 installation that worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that the BIOS has stored some kind of code that is supposed to allow me to reinstall Windows PRO again. But, how do I get to that point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am used to Apple recovery. And, I thought that Microsoft has tackled this problem... obviously not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Admittedly, I am not a windows user. So, this constant hassle with having to deal with 'mandatory', 'forced' updates that hose your system is an unacceptable business liability. I just want to get things back the way they were and find a way to keep Microsoft
 from damaging my system again.</p>

            After hours of ridiulous dead-end support 'ideas' and, a mind-numbing discussion with windows non-support (where I was treated like a complete idiot - OF COURSE I HAVE TRIED TO SHUT IT DOWN COMPLETELY AND REBOOT). I was forced to call in a professional
 IT expert.<br />
<br />
Three hours and $170 later, the qualified tech simply gave up. It required a complete reinstall to get this system back. The system was so trashed that no amount of safe-mode maintenance could bring it back. All of this because the idiots at Micro$loth think
 they should be in control of MY computer and FORCE me to accept updates that I don't WANT to accept on DAY-ONE. What idiot would given their horrendous track record?<br />
<br />
As part of the IT service, I was taught how to lock Micro$loth out of my system, forever if need be!<br />
<br />
This ridiculous policy of locking users out of their own system choices is cyber-fascism pure and simple.<br />
Micro$loth updates HAVE always been garbage on day one. And, the high cost of today's fiasco (lost business plus TECH fees) has proven that this policy needs to be prohibited as the cyber-criminal activity that it truly is.<br />
<br />
From now on, I will decide when to update. And, ONLY I will be responsible for any bad choices made,&nbsp;<br />
This is the way it SHOULD be. Stop it - with the cyber-nanny B$. Micro$loth is an unfit parent that will cost your company $$$$ if you trust them. Learn how to lock them out of your system. Cause one day (soon?) you will regret it just as I do.<br />
<br />
Hardware is only as good as the OS which makes it all work together. I will stick with Apple's inferior hardware and superior OS - as the lower cost of Winblows computers does not compensate for the headaches and ill-advised 'updates' that are being forced
 on us by a lazy and inept maintenance team. <br />
<br />
Problem resolved. No thanks to the stupidity and arrogance of a never-great American company.

            I just saw your reply and am sorry I wasn't able to guide you.  That's the reason I gave you the way to create bootable media because an older version or incorrectly formatted Recovery drive often will not work.  So we use another PC to create the bootable media, follow the steps I gave which work for  housands of others to recover from Update failures.   I could have guided you through this but was sleeping and getting to the airport for a cross country flight I'm now on, and would have guided you from here.  Knowing this I gave you everything you'd need to fix this if you'd stuck only with the steps I gave.
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.

            While I'm glad you got it fixed I would also compare the install the tech did with the install in this link which is better than money can buy and at least twice as good as any install a shop would do.  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />You can also manage Windows Updates better now following this guide:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>

            Thank you. <br />
<br />
The system was just too far gone.&nbsp; Micro$loth's ineptitude had done a real number on it.<br />
There was nothing any average user (like myself) could have done. The clean install was the only sane option remaining. Fortunately, I had the foresight to keep anything important on the secondary drive. And, once the OS was reinstalled, was able to restore
 my data. <br />
<br />
NEVER keep important files on a windows system drive. A lesson remembered from the dark days of Windows 98 and NT. Nothing much has changed since then - just multiple facelifts.<br />
<br />
There is a wealth of good information in your post. But, time was of the essence. And, going through it all would have taken days to read and understand. And, there is the problem where this is my only Windows system and, was therefore unable to create the
 media needed to restore it myself.<br />
A wise man knows when to call in for air support. I like to think that this time, I did the wisest thing possible under the circumstances.

            Yeah... <br />
<br />
I think what I am going to do is use the nVME drive to do this Clean Install you outlined in the other post.<br />
<br />
I took a look at the partitions after backup repeatedly failed (no room for shadow copy error). And, noticed that the correct partition structure was not defined. There is no system reserved 100MB partition. That's evidently not a good thing.<br />
<br />
So, I unchecked create system image and backed up just my existing user files.<br />
I will use these next two 'typhoon days' to reinstall from your guide. Just too many things not working quite right. But, at least I got my data out. So, there's that.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the guidance. It's nice to have someone who knows what they are doing on these community boards.<br />

<p>OrianH and Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know your post and original thread will be read by many. I experienced a similar issue with my Toshiba C55 - A 5300 laptop, as soon as it auto updated to Windows Version 1803. I have Googled the different issues, and been lead to many of Greg's different
 replies to people. At first, I thought it was a Toshiba specific issue. It appears all of these different Windows Update Keyboard Not Working issues are related to same 1803 auto update, Windows Update Bricked My Computer issues for Toshiba, Lenovo, ASUS,
 and some AMD hardware passing the Windows 10 update checker, and saying it was qualified, but then later, AMD saying it is not qualified.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, I used keywords and key phrases here to try and get more people to find this specific thread and post. The problem with the Windows forums is that too many threads get started for what originally appear to be unrelated issues, and it's hard to
 put the pieces together. OrianH, I had ALL the same experience as this:</p>
<p>"<span>My system gave me two options on shutdown last night. "update and restart" or "update and shut down". I had a really bad feeling in the pit of my stomach.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose update and shut down just before leaving the office.<br />
</p>
<p>This morning, October 2, 2018 - my system is destroyed. On boot, I get the blue screen that says something like "We have encountered a problem... " it then counts up to 100% and restarts the system... Only to repeat the same crud!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was finally able to force mine to finish the update. I do not remember how specifically I did it, but now it's on 1803, and the keyboard driver appears to have been messed up. This laptop is about 5 years old. Was working fine. Used to be my personally
 purchased BYOD work computer. About a year ago, my mother in law moved in with us. I deleted all old files and data from it, along with any unnecessary work programs. Basically, back to basics Win 10 low end laptop. Was working great!! Used it once every few
 months, then back in the box, on the closet shelf. Brought it out in maybe August 2018. Used it one day for something. Worked fine. Worked GREAT actually. Then, out of nowhere I get: My system gave me two options on shutdown. "update and restart" or "update
 and shut down". I had a REALLY BAD feeling in the pit of my stomach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose update and shut down.<br />
</p>
<p>The next morning - my system is destroyed. On boot, I get the blue screen that says something like "We have encountered a problem... " it then counts up to 100% and restarts the system... Only to repeat the same crud!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to make it past this issue somehow, with help from Google searches for my model number and Windows Update in the search. Got past it, but then the laptop was no longer recognizing the keyboard once on the "pre boot" Toshiba Leading Innovation
 screen to be able to enter Windows password, or Windows PIN CODE. Somehow figured out hitting some option like Alternate Login Method, and then Cancel, was able to force the OS into recognizing the keyboard and I could gain access to the laptop, because now
 I was able to enter the password or pin code. But, once in, with Windows booted, the keyboard was no longer recognized again. Even usb keyboard no longer recognized. On screen keyboard would work at this point. Somehow, found out hitting CTRL, ALT, DEL, then
 Cancel would force the laptop to recognized the keyboard. I thought it was a driver issue. Downloaded all the original drivers from Toshiba site. Used Device Manager to try and force update the keyboard driver. Googled and found ways to change Windows Update
 settings to make it as difficult as possible for Windows to auto update this laptop, or my newer dell workhorse I have. I agree with OrianH, there is NO EXCUSE for Microsoft to have FORCED AUTO UPDATES on everyone in the world using Windows 10, with no option
 to turn it off(easily). This is planned obsolescence, or even FORCED OBSOLESCENCE. Like OrianH, my laptop was working perfectly fine one day, then basically a brick the next day. The ONLY DIFFERENCE was Windows forced me to update to version 1803, with no
 recourse or free choice in the matter. Luckily, the only thing I lost was a $250 purchase price, and about 40-60 hours of my own "spare time" trying to find a way back to a previous version, or a situation, where it works perfectly again. Not sure if this
 was Meltdown and Spectre patches forcefully applied to my computer or what. Like OrianH, I have some computer knowledge, but am not a computer engineer or scientist. This is completely unforgivable and unacceptable. If i were billing my "spare time" at $100
 per hour, then Microsoft owes me over $6,250 for this incident. $250 for the laptop, and another $6,000 for my wasted time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, Greg, if I recall correctly, my Toshiba C55 - A5300 was working perfectly on the Windows version before 1803, which I believe was Windows Version 1709. I would love to roll back to that and see it if works. Version 1803, once forced upon me,
 and once I FORCED it to finish, removed the roll back feature. I tried to revert to an earlier version, but it was not able to. I found many of your posts. I created new media and did a Clean Boot from media for 1803. All same issues exist. My question to
 you is about this part of your post: "The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:&nbsp;<a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>&nbsp;"
 I did not feel completely safe trying to download from this site to create an older version of Windows. Something seemed to feel like it was sketchy, like created by cyber criminals and hackers to purposely insert bad code into a non official older version
 of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel completely ripped off by Microsoft in this situation. Like OrianH said, it feels like they physically came into my house and stole from me. I did not ask for this update. I did not need this update. It was forced on me, without my permission,
 or my free choice. Anyway, the more I Google, the more I think Microsoft really blew it lately, with the 1803 update, the Windows Insider situation where they are being deactivated from Windows Pro, or the other numerous issues in 2018. If I WERE THE BAD GUYS,
 I would specifically be targeting the Windows Updates to insert bad code into the distribution system a la CCleaner debacle, as it is an auto update by Windows, to probably 75% of the computers on the planet. Anyway, I digress. Just a rant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg, you are good guy, for trying to help people out here. OrianH, you are absolutely correct, that this is unacceptable. OrianH, please add as many search keywords, and key phrases you were Googling to find fixes or forums so others can find this
 particular thread between you and Greg. This needs more attention, as it crosses multiple manufacturers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to you both.</p>

    <title>Safely remove files no longer works in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> storage_man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Safely remove files no longer works in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Updated from win 8.1 to win 10.&nbsp; Since the upgrade, if I plug in a usb stick into one of the usb 3.0 ports on my HP laptop, they get recognized and access is granted.&nbsp; I can move/copy files, view files via windows explorer and then request to remove the
 usb stick.&nbsp; It seems that win 10 no longer gives the message that its ok to remove the device, instead it looks like it adds a usb icon in the taskbar.&nbsp; This seems to work.&nbsp; When I see the icon, I remove the device and then the Icon goes away.&nbsp; But if I access
 the usb stick (or any other usb device), with a third party program, ie: ( Quicken 2015, Acronis 2015, or just about any other program) and I write to that usb stick, end the program and then go to remove it via the taskbar icon, and select the device, I always
 get "A program is using the device - try again later".&nbsp;&nbsp; Well it never gets free.&nbsp; The only way I can free that device is to re-boot the system.&nbsp;
</p>

</p><p>Under win 8.1 (on this laptop) and win 7 (on my desktop PC)&nbsp; this never happens.&nbsp; There is some system task under win 10 that is hanging on to that device and not releasing it. &nbsp; But this only occurs only if I write to the device via the third party program.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody have a solution or the SAME PROBLEM&nbsp; !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any info will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp; </p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will definitely assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To understand the issue better, I would like to know which third party software are you using?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you are facing could be due to the system is infected, let’s try simple steps and check if it helps. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If a computer is infected by a virus, lots of resources will be taken up to greatly slow down computer performance. I suggest you to run virus scan (</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Microsoft Safety Scanner)</span></strong><span> and check
 if it helps to resolve the issue. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persist try the below step.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I recommend you to open task manager and check which program are on background.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Press <strong>CTRL+Shift+ESC</strong> and open the <strong>Task manager</strong>.&nbsp;Check for the program which are running on
<strong>Processes </strong>tab and try to end the program by right clicking on it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Post us with status we will be glad to help you.</span></p>

            <p>The scan came back negative - No Viruses.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as looking at Task Manager and the processes, of the 50+ that are listed, the program which I ended is no-longer there.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as applications, the primary one is Quicken 2015.&nbsp; If I have it access a usb stick to either read or write to it and then I end the program and then request to safely remove the usb stick, it never gives me permission to remove the device.&nbsp;&nbsp; How ever
 the same program same version running under Windows 8.1 or Windows 7 will always give you permission to remove the device.&nbsp; This only happens under Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disable write-caching and you won't need to use "safely remove hardware" after that.&nbsp; To change it, open device manager and expand the disk drives section.&nbsp; Find the drive, right-click and select "properties".&nbsp; On the "policies" tab you'll see two
 choices - "quick removal" and "better performance" - with explanations for each.&nbsp; As you'll see in the explanations, if you select "quick removal" you can simply disconnect the device at any time without going through the "safely remove hardware" routine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the issue status.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply, but I have quick removal already checked for my USB Stick devices,&nbsp; but my external hard drives that I use for backups, I don't want to slow them down, so I cache writes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I have not seen this problem since the last cumulative update this past week (Which was installed on my system on Friday&nbsp; (10/02/2015)).&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to do some more testing, to verify that it may be fixed.&nbsp;

                    After working fine for months, my computer suddenly is not recognizing the internet cable connection unless the cable is plugged in after the computer is running.&nbsp; even unplugging and re-plugging it while the computer is running does not cause it to be

<p><span>This problem occurs because there are incorrect entries in the Shell folder of the user who is logged on to Microsoft Windows. When Windows Installer
 accesses the Shell folder assignment of the user who is logged on to the computer, Windows Installer cannot locate the correct entry. The solution is in

</span></p>
<p><span>The steps to correct this problem involve editing the Windows Registry.&nbsp; Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that
 may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I suggest you first backup your registry as follows: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</span></span></a><span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps to fix it.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type
<strong>regedit </strong>in the Open box, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the following registry key:
</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the entries that show the path that is listed in the error message.</span></p>

<span>&nbsp;</span>Open Regedit again.&nbsp;In the left pane, right-click <strong>
User Shell Folders</strong>, point to <strong>New</strong>, click <strong>Expandable String Value</strong>, type the Name value that you want to reinstate (AppData)&nbsp;and then press ENTER. Right-click that&nbsp;value, click

Step 8 of KB 886549 suggests that you also check the values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders. However, in fixing my problem, I did not have to modify any of the values in that registry key.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If this does not work, follow ALL the steps in the referenced article.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</span></p>

<h2>            No one on Microsoft want to sort my situation of my refund</h2>
                    
<p>I have been in contact with one of your xbox live team about my situation 29/7/2018. My reference number is:&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;I've even been speaking to PM Microsoft NZ on facebook there the only ones messaging me if it is really Microsoft.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was told my money was going to be refunded back into my bank account within 24 hours.&nbsp;It's been 3 days now. You guys are making me **** frustrated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My situation. On the 28/7/2018 I was trying to buy xbox live gold subscription. As I knew there should of been enough money in my bank account to buy gold. I get&nbsp;a pop up on my tv screen stating that there was something wrong with the bank side of things
 when trying to purchase xbox live gold. My bank details I installed failed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I thought ok. I'll install my bank details on my xbox one again this is the second time I done this just incase I missed something. Still the same stupid pop up. I tried another two times to install my bank details. Ok what the ****.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Then my bank app on my phone starts going off. Then I checked my bank account details showing me that you guys MICROSFT have taking X4 payments of $2 out my account. I was pissed off. As you guys have taken your guys fees without giving me what I wanted.
 Which was my xbl gold membership&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>28/7/2018 i got a hold of one of you guys from ringing through &amp; lady taken down my situation &amp; passed me over to guy in your xbox live support team. He was a great help. So I had atleast $12.56 in my bank account &amp; I gave my bank card details to him so
 he could try sort my situation but he got same pop up as me. But that&nbsp;**** me off you guys charge me another $2 fee &amp; at the end of it I still got nothing out of it besides you guys getting free money from me. The xbox live support person told me that my money
 will be refunded back into my account with in 24 hours. It's been 3 **** days now. Your Quick to take the cash but slow to **** do.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What makes it worse is that I've used this same card to buy battlefield 1 &amp; killer Instinct games off xbox live &amp; my bank details are all still there but just not active</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Get in contact with me to sort this situation out. This shot is frustrating I've already tried to email you guys my details ect.&nbsp;</p>

            If you are attempting call from an airport, you probably chose one of worst places to make that call. Bandwidth at an airport is usually at a premium and interference from the hundreds of thousands of other devices on the same WiFi network can result in failed or dropped calls. If you can switch to mobile data, you might have better luck or keep trying periodically.

<h2>            Use XBox for Windows 10 Controller instead of mouse and keyboard</h2>
                    
<p>Hi !</p>

<p>I would like to know if Microsoft has a software to attribute mouse and keyboard's behaviors to the Xbox Controller.</p>
<p>I mean a software which will let me gives for exemple that :</p>
<p>Keyboard &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Controller</p>
<p>A &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; A</p>
<p>Z &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; B</p>
<p>E &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; X</p>
<p>R &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; -&gt; Y</p>

<p>It's strange that even though Xbox Controller for Windows 10 has been sold for computer, there is no notice about a software which will allow us to grant keyboard's and mouse utility to the controller.</p>

<p>After searching a little, there is a software named "XPadder" but since it's not distributed by Microsoft, i don't really feel like using it since the origin is unknown.</p>
<p>Xpadder's website smells fishy too. We are supposed to give our mail adress. Which means since we got no information about XPadders origin's, their software can give to our computer malwares and virus. They can plan to use our mail adress to bombard it with
 a lot of ad too.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello Chibi,</p>
<p>There is (currently) no Microsoft software which binds controller buttons to mouse/keyboard inputs. However, some games natively support the Xbox One controller, and for those you will be able to use the controller without issue.</p>
<p>Third party software should be approached with caution. If it's not from a reputable vendor, it's not worth the risk.</p>

<p>Hey, just wanted to put my two cents in about Xpadder. I have used it for certain games that don't support Xbox controllers directly for years and I actually loved it and actually started using my controller as a mouse when watching Netflix away from my
 keyboard , and no "fishy" things happened, just because something isn't officially from Microsoft doesn't mean it isn't legitimate, I totally agree with your trepidation but for some reason I am daring enough to give programmers the benefit of the doubt for
 things as useful as that type of software. And if it doesn't go well, that's why I have daily backups and restore points. Mostly because I too am a software engineer and it is incredibly important to backup and have a restore point when working on projects
 but also for threats of malicious intent.</p>
