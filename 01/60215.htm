<h2>            GWXUX is causing Windows 7 to crash multiple times per week - is there an uninstall for this program</h2>
                    <p>2-3 times a week a Windows 7 (Professional) system is crashing with the signature tied to GWXUX.exe. I do know what this program is suppose to do - and there is no way I can go to Windows 10 with all the hardware I had to 'force' Windows 7 to recognize and
 use.&nbsp; I need to get this program off my system, tempted to delete it - but know that will cause more problems...&nbsp; - the crash signature ties almost every time to this program, otherwise it shows up as unknown.&nbsp; This system had no problems prior to the installation
 of the 'security fix' that attached this program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help? I hate the crash after working 3 hours on a video production...</p>

            <p>OK, I have run through the ones I could do - and will let you know. I had another crash/lockup today at 9:03 - which tied to GWXUX again - and when I went in to the task manager - at exactly 9:03 it says it successfully executed a login.&nbsp; I have no doubt
 not this is crashing the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will feedback if it stops, I disabled what I could..</p>

            Hi jasqid,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your question to "Getting Ready for Windows 7" community forum.<br />
<br />
If I'm understanding the question correctly, the miniplayer is activated if you click the StartORB / in the Search Line type Windows media player / Launch the player from the programs list.&nbsp;&nbsp; Verify if this is&nbsp;the player you were referencing?&nbsp; If it is not
 the player you were referencing do not hesitate to post back to us that information.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
<span>Please let us know if this information assists you or if there is further assistance that is needed.<br />
<br />

            Jasqid,<br />
The preview box when you highlight WMP has the forward backward and play/pause buttons.<br />
<br />
So far that is all that I have personally found to be a good way of navigating.<br />
<br />
I agree with you, the Windows Media Player toolbar is very useful.<br />
It may have been removed infavor for a sleeker interface (consider the WMC gadget that you can add to your desktop).<br />
Either way, lets see what the future result will be, ofcourse Windows 7 is not yet finalized.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes you still need a pagefile as many programs will use gigs of Virtual Memory and/or require<br />
the pagefile to exist. Its really best to let Windows manage the pagefile.</p>

<p>Beside adding even more RAM you can also use up to 256 Gig of ReadyBoost - both of those<br />
would limit the pagefile access and improve speed. Use a FAST USB Drive.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Windows 7 ReadyBoost will support 8 drives and a total of 256 Gigs. For each device - The device<br />
must have an access time of 1 ms or less. The device must be capable of 2.5 MB/s read speeds for<br />
4 KB random reads spread uniformly across the entire device, and 1.75 MB/s write speeds for 512<br />
KB random writes spread uniformly across the device.</p>

<h3> mssnoopers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft snooping. Why&#63;</h2>
                    So, it's always the same. New rules for MSsnoopers services by September, look at the privacy. I'm just wondering: who **** are you to snoop on my stuff? Who? Yes, but Bill is such a philanthropist. Yeah, of course, with a **** product which you pay hundreds
 of bucks made on stolen ideas, nothing else. We are philanthropists, we pay for that product. And you want to make money on data too? All those services, protocols, encrypted communications which start automatically, it's beautiful. Who **** are you? So, if
 I don't accept the rules have I to stop using your "services"? Ok, it was time. And they explain why they "share" your data in the contract. Maybe you've misunderstood, you are not allowed to share!!!! Emails contents, that **** of Cortana, search history,
 passwords, videos, photos, etc. You are out of mind. I don't want the explanation. And you must still give me back the money for that old **** of windows vista that you quickly replaced with windows 7 that I cannot use anymore

            <p>Please allow me to help feed your crazy. This company, "Conversant," is a "ad partner" with Skype, which is Microsoft, and also built into Windows. You have never heard of them, you do no business with them as they have no product they produce... Sorry,
 they do, they sell... You. This company is linked to in Microsofts privacy policy for Skype. Be advised, according to the ToS and privacy policy, you agree to allow them to do whatever they like, to sell you, to whoever they want, just by using Windows 10
 or Skype. I would like to share a little sickening excerpt from their website. </p>
<p>"http://www.conversantmedia.com/digital-marketing-solution-overview</p>
<p><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>We know consumers better than they know themselves</strong></span></em>. We track over 1 million online actions per second to build each profile across more than 7,000 dimensions—including web browsing,
 app usage, video plays, email activity, cross-screen engagement, life events, hobbies, ad interactions and product interests.
</p>
<p>All in all, they’re the most complex consumer profiles ever built, allowing you to really get to know your customers and grow your relationship with them over their lifetime."</p>
<p>They know you, better then you know you, and their entire business model revolves around selling you, yet you don't know them, probably never even heard of them, and they give you, their product, absolutely nothing in return.</p>
<p>But check it, all the info is completely anonymous right, thats what they say</p>
<p>"http://www.conversantmedia.com/digital-marketing-solution-overview</p>
<p>With an unprecedented amount of data, Conversant’s 96% matching accuracy dwarfs the industry average of just 50%. Our understanding of consumers is built from the anonymized transactional data (both online and off) of more than 4,000 retailers. And the depth
 and breadth of our IDs continue to grow as we observe over 80 billion online interactions every day, across every device.</p>
<p>That’s millions of verified IDs. They’re completely anonymous, scrubbed of all personally identifiable information. And they last a lifetime, so your conversation with each consumer never misses a beat."</p>
<p>Right, just asinine. You gotta love the pics on the side, the pics of individual people and their "anonymous" id's. Apparently they know everyone is a gullible moron.</p>
<p>"http://www.conversantmedia.com/digital-marketing-product-overview</p>
<p>Expand your mobile marketing with commerce-driven accuracy and the industry's best reach.
<strong>You’ll get a single view of each target consumer, rolling up their activity across all of their (average 3.4) devices</strong>."</p>
<p>Anonymously right?</p>
<p>Hmm... Right. Have fun with that.</p>
<p>

            <p>There is no law that says that. Your operating system is a platform to launch other programs, it is not a consumer data driven ad revenue creation service, oh, yeah. Your anger, and blatant ignorance, in your post, while defending a company that A. does
 not need your defense, and B. has no loyalty to you (you are expected to be loyal to it), is actually kind of scary. Educate yourself, demanding proof, which is everywhere, will teach you nothing, but you don't really want to "know" anything, do you. Anything
 "shown" to you would just be ignored or dismissed. Ignorance begets ignorance. </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p><span>First of all, I don’t have to show you anything and you know why? Because is in the contract, they do what I say by law, legally. There is no company that makes a violating privacy contract if there is no need to do it, they would lose money and in
 this way they make money, they lose money with me for sure and with many other people for what I know. And then, in your description you missed something about what I said, hence I assume you agree.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>FIRST PARAGRAPH. </span></span><span>Which part of the word “encryption” and therefore “encrypted communications” you don’t understand? Why can’t I see the content of those communications? By the way, people can verify what I say just installing
 a good firewall that block everything. Look closely, really closely for period and not communications. So, I am sorry, I don’t have the password to decrypt the content of those communications to relate them to my PC content but I can reasonably assume that
 those communications are the physical part of the contract that store history data to track my activities and God knows what, because is the only possible way to apply it: through communications from my PC to Microsoft but communications that I am not allowed
 to see for their content. But you know that, don't you? It’s in the definition and pure syllogism. They say they store and share data, even if I opt-out privacy setting, communications keep flowing from my PC to Microsoft. What’s a communication? Information
 flowing maybe, right? They said they share data. Which data? The only data they have are those they receive from those communications. What there is in those communications? I cannot see it, it’s encrypted. And even if they say there is nothing there I don’t
 trust them, why should I? The only thing they clearly state is that they share and store everything, is in the contract. . Got it kid?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SECOND PARAGRAPH. First of all, a code example? Really? Are you serious? Do you have the source code of windows? Can you see the kernel? Pass it to me please, I will become rich and they will go in ruin. But I want to follow you. So you say that they
 must obey court laws or requests, right? So they can help, right? And how **** can they do that if they don’t have a backdoor on windows which let them to violate the encryption of your disk? Do you know what a **** backdoor is? But just look at the Iphone
 case and what said that smart guy who owns MSnoopers. He would have done that if he could, so he must know something about disk encryption to violate it a let the law be applied, right? So, who else can violate my PC? They share the key for that backdoor with
 anyone (I mean, government agencies for istance)? How can I be sure I am safe? And if there is a bug in that backdoor (as many bugs appear in windows just to make hackers’ life easier) an hacker can use it to violate my PC? I thought no one could violate my
 disk with encryption, not even MSnoopers. And why Apple refused? So, even Apple could violate encryption but didn’t do it, BillSnoop objected on that. Beyond that….Kid, what kind of people you know? I know many people and you know many people, we all know
 people. So you define yourself and your opinions with “someone said”? First of all, I am the first “someone”, the second is “Bill Gates”! Is that enough?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>THIRD PARAGRAPH.<span>&nbsp; </span>I’m not saying they must delete without my consent, I’m saying that they cannot use it or share it. Again, it’s all in the contract, they do this for sure. For your information, when your data switch hand to another hand
 you should read and accept or not an infinite chain of contracts without being sure what is stored and where your data are stored. How many people you know doing that? And, maybe you don’t know that, there are providers that encrypt messages with a double
 check, one for your account login and one for the recipient. They don’t have the second password, for the recipient, just you, they cannot see the content. Guess why is this thing not widely used? By the way, look at the contract. Got it Kid?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FOURTH PARAGRAPH.</span></p>
<p><span>I can’t get it, my statement was clear and a good example, here you’re just loitering, no sense at all.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>FIFTH.</span></p>
<p><span>Well, if there is a law must be obeyed but here we are not talking about one single, rare court order based on real, effective proofs of acting against the law, I can agree on that or I couldn’t, it depends on the case. Here we are talking about “your
 government” <span>&nbsp;</span>apparatus. MSnoppers many times in its contract don’t specify with who it shares information so, how can I be sure they don’t share information with the CIA, NSA or whatever **** governative organism without a court order? Who ****
 is NSA to snoop on a polish guy’s computer and his girlfriend’s naked photos? That is not in the law, Polish law for sure. But, just look at Snowden case. Are you sure on that too? Oh, I see then.</span></p>
<p><span>Are you a reseller of MSnoopers products? Because either you are one of them or you work with them, no other reasons of not reading the contract without puking. You must have some advantages I guess of some kind. Why don’t you post the contract here
 piece by piece so that we can discuss it. I know contracts, I can explain it to you.</span></p>

            <p>Here we are, again. I've already answered on this. First, you mentioned just that, so assume that you agree with everything else I said (people profiling, privacy violating contract, prohibiting software and hardware, etc.). That being said, you're trying
 to support your statements saying that I must demonstrate the link between my "private information" and "the content" of those packets. But, honey, the content of those packet is encrypted, I cannot see it, it's just a bunch of 00, numbers and letters. Can
 MSnooper give me the key to see the content of those packets? I will be glad to show you the content. Why Microsoft hide the content of those packets? If there is nothing to hide why those packets are encrypted? You have to ask Microsoft for that. Now, for
 sure I know that after opting-out privacy settings windows keep communicating with Microsoft with encrypted packets that I am not able to see. They violate every possible privacy right in their contract so I am scared of what is contained in those packets
 because they legally have the right to do whatever they want and I can't suit them. Do you understand that? Did you get it? Is it clear enough? Will you ask again the same thing? I will explain it as I'm talking with a Kid. Listen carefully, really carefully
 because maybe could be difficult for you. For instance, suppose you have a neighbor that is a ped...le, he's being controlled by the police but no one knows for sure if he is a ped...le. Now, you have a Kid, four years old. Would you like to hire him as baby-sitter?
 Answer on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But maybe you know what encryption is and you're just forgetting everything else I said, pointing out on this aspect just because you are one of them or you work for them, or just because you're wasting your time trying to demonstrate that you know that
 there are security experts in the world, that you have knowledge and you can write a for loop, I don't know. It doesn't seem so. By the way, if you are real, as Mike said, ignorance begets ignorance. Be happy with your windows 10 and as Mike said, "Your operating
 system is a platform to launch other programs, it is not a consumer data driven ad revenue creation service". But you agreed on the fact that Microsoft don't have to profile people. Right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, again, I will ask you another thing, actually the same you asked. Why Microsoft is hiding the content of those packets? Can Microsoft demonstrate that the content of those packets has nothing to do with my private information? It's just the reversal
 of the proof, as I cannot demonstrate because I don't have the encryption key Microsoft cannot demonstrate that I am wrong, it's a legal matter that maybe you don't know anything about but you know that there are security experts in the world. It's hilarious.
 At the end it's a matter of faith if you want to think in this way. The problem is that the devil showed himself in the contract. Did you read it? So, you have faith in the devil. The problem is that many people are a flock of sheep that don't read contracts.
 These companies trust on that. I cannot explain it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Oh, I forgot, I didn't say I could read the content of those packets, never said that, just if the entire post is still not clear and by the way doesn't invalidate everything I said. This just to make clear that you don't know what a protocol and a
 packet are. The subjects (complements) were "communications" and "protocols". Before learning a for loop try to learn english, I am excused because is not my language.</p>

<p>on top of that your internet provider keep a meticulous record of everything you do with their service</p>

            <p>Same thing here. I tried to access the newest GwG to add to my collection, but the console says I have to be a Gold member to do it. When I access the "Subscriptions" tab on My Games and Apps, it says I have to subscribe... but all games I ever got through Games with Gold are listed as ready to install and I'm able to play multiplayer with my friends with no problems. And through the console settings, it says my current subscription is active (it was automatically renewed in May 28th, but will only be charged in June 10th - 5 days from now).</p><p><br /></p><p>I'm a Live&nbsp;subscriber for almost 11 years and it's the first time I run into such an issue.</p>

            <p>I'm back with an interesting bit of info to get everyone even more puzzled: I was able to download the free Xbox 360 game available now (Assassin's Creed III) without issues. When selecting it, the price was listed as FREE. But unfortunately, the console still says I have to buy a Gold subscription to download the other one (SpeedRunners).</p><p><br /></p><p>So weird...</p>

<h2>            Force Scroll Lock On at startup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I need to force Scroll Lock on at startup and the registry fixes I've tried don't work (it reverts back to the original setting).</p>
<p>I've tried the fixes involving&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Keyboard</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Control Panel\Keyboard&nbsp;</strong>with no success. Again, it reverts back to the original setting upon logging
 off/back on.</p>
<p>There is no option in the BIOS for setting the scroll lock. &nbsp;i am using windows 8.1. &nbsp;thank you</p>

    <title>What the Next Generation of Xbox Should be Named - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lethal_left_eye  say:</h3>
<h2>            What the Next Generation of Xbox Should be Named</h2>
                    
<p>So we've probably all seen everyone nickname the upcoming generation of Xbox 360 the Xbox 720. It's easy enough to understand; 360 + 360 = 720. However, this name fails to capture some sort of feeling of a "4th" generation of Xbox. It is true that in reality
 the Xbox 360 was only the second generation of Xbox. However, the reason "360" was chosen as the name for the second generation of Xbox was because it had the number "3" in the name and that gave the Xbox a competitive marketing edge when it came to competing
 against the PS3 and Nintendo Wii. Because the Xbox 360 was being marketed at around the same time as the PS3, Microsoft needed a name for their console that gave them a competitive chance against the PS3 etc. Think about it, at the time would you have rather
 bought the "Xbox 2" vs the PS3 or the Xbox 360 vs the PS3. The "360" certainly sounds better and newer.</p>
<p>Now, this brings me to my idea for the naming of the next generation of Xbox. Because "720" has been used as a popular nickname for the next Xbox generation, I thought of a name that encompasses the "720" but also gives Microsoft a competitive edge when
 competing against the "PS4". Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you: The Xbox 4 Pi. While I'm sure the percentage of people reading this right now and saying "4 Pi?" is through the roof, I will go through and explain what "4 Pi" means. Excuse me if this gets
 a little math related.</p>
<p>In school grades 10-12 (depending on where you live) you may encounter introductions to calculus. These introductions normally involve using what is called a Trigonometric Circle. This circle is used in conjunction with a Cartesian plane to graph wave functions
 in pre-cal and calculus. The circle itself has fractions marking different positions along the circle and they are added up as you count "laps" around the circle. Furthermore, each fraction designating a position on the circle can be measured with degrees
 (this coincides with "720"). Every time you count around the circle you add the degrees for each "lap" and so two complete laps around the circle end up equaling 720 degrees OR, if measured using the fraction coinciding with 720 degrees, 4 pi. Therefor, the
 name for the next generation of Xbox should be the Xbox 4 Pi.<br />

            That is exactly what it does do. The console will turn the controller off, if you turn the console off. It's always done that.

</p><p>The C:\i386 folder is what you will see on a system that comes with Windows installed from the factory - it can be used if you ever need to restore your system back to as shipped from the factory condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you get your system home and start updating your system with MS updates, the c:\i386 folder immediately gets "old" and out of date - might not be much useful in there anymore but you will need it if you ever need to do a factory restore (ugh).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally wmipvrse runs when it is updating the Windows Management Instrumentation database - then it quits running.&nbsp; Even if you launch it manually it should run for a bit and then disappear if it finds nothing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A sign of a corrupted (but fixable) WMI database is not being able to successfully run msinfo32.&nbsp; From your Star orb are you able to successfully run msinfo32?</p>

            Hello, I see that you have some corrupt files in Windows 10. You will need to fix this in order to get the ms-settings working again. I would recommend you to run System File Check, and or DISM. All info could be found here:

            Hi Jeff.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />You can reinstall the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Jeff. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a></p>
<p><br />
<strong>Settings will not open</strong><br />
</p>
<p>You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:
<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a><br />
<br />
You can reinstall the Settings app from Option Two here: <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a></p>
<p><strong>Tried, did not work</strong><br />
<br />
Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most
 thoroughly. <br />
<br />
If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing
 it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a><br />
<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install
 in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a><br />
<br />
There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:

<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>One thing I did notice this evening, I went to File Explorer, then C: drive.&nbsp; right clicked and selected properties.&nbsp; in the security tab, under "authenticated users" there were no permissions defined, no check marks at all.&nbsp; With high hopes, I granted full
 access, applied (there were several errors) and rebooted, the start menu still does not open with a left click :(</p>

Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This problem sounds as though you are referring to the function key controls that are standard with almost all
 laptops. Who manufactured your laptop? Do you see a function (FN) key somewhere on the keyboard? After you have located the function key, look for the F1-f12 keys that are above the numbers on your keyboard. There should be icons on them showing you what each
 key will control such as sound control and dimming control on the screen. Find the key that looks like a small sun with lines radiating around it with an arrow pointing up or down next to it. Press this button while holding down the function (FN) button
</span></span>which usually is in blue. This should adjust the screen properly.</p>
<p><span><span>If this does not work then the damage may be permanent and may need to be looked at by the manufacturer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if this helps.</span></span></p>

<h2>            How to rewire Turtle Beach X12 Left Speaker&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so I had to take apart my turtle beach X12 left speaker because I couldn't hear anything. Inside I noticed a big mess of wires (8 to be exact). Now it was almost impossible to see what wire came from where and went where. So Now I am left with a problem.
 I have it all cleaned up now with all 8 wires separated but do not know which wires get soldered where. Below is a diagram showing what I mean:
<a href="http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/ae122/Radical924/Web%20Posts%20-%20Not%20Halo%20Maps/TurtleBeachDiagram.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://i964.photobucket.com/albums/ae122/Radical924/Web%20Posts%20-%20Not%20Halo%20Maps/TurtleBeachDiagram.png</a>
<br />
<br />
In the image you see there are yellow numbers and blue letters. If someone could be so kind to take a look at there X12s and pair up the numbers with the letters in the diagram that would be great!
<br />
<br />
Example: <br />
<br />
1A <br />
2C <br />
3G <br />
<br />
etc....... Also notice the way it is colored and how the Speaker with the B has a copper wire coming from one side.</p>

    <title>My right click is sometimes acting like double left click - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My right click is sometimes acting like double left click</h2>
                    <p>I have this annoying issue: after a while of using my laptop, suddenly my right click starts acting like a double left click,</p>
<p>meaning that<strong> if I want to right click on: icons, folders, files, everything I suppose, they basically open. I have this problem when I use ANY program, in which right click is acting like double-left click.&nbsp;</strong>Sometimes it also appears the
 list like when normally right click on a file/folder for example, and also file/folder opens and sometimes just the file/folder opens without list appearing. It's crazy.
<strong>The only solution is to restart/shut down my laptop</strong> and it works normally after turning on for few/dozens minutes or even less (it is like I have a countdown of the right clicks and when they finish, the problem goes on or something - I say
 this because sometimes I didn't pressed right click for hours using my laptop and it worked normally all these hours until the problem finally appeared)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It is NOT a mouse issue</strong>! It is happening with every mouse I tried (both bluetooth or USB connected) and also when using the mouse pad. I have read and checked the mouse settings. Primary setting is left, no left-right click is interchanged
 etc. I believe <strong>settings are correct.</strong> Also, I personally met the EXACTLY same problem on a PC at my work place (Windows 7). I have read for about 2-3 hours all related questions on the internet and didn't find a solution to this kind of issue
 and I am dealing with it for almoust 2 years. It is happening every time I turn on my laptop and use a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run on Windows 10, 4GB RAM, 64-bit system, Processor: Intel Pentium CPU N3540 @ 2,16GHz</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please, I really want this to stop!!</strong>!</p>

<p>Hi Nicolae,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue regarding mouse is usually happening due to corruption of drivers. To fully understand what's causing this, we would like to know if you made any modifications/configurations prior to the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">install and update
 drivers in Windows 10</a></strong> as it usually does the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>I guess no modifications were made. Or, I do not know what exactly you refer by "any modification/config"&nbsp;</p>
