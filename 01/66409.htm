<h2>            Skype Video Issues&#47; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>As of only 10 days ago I am experiencing multiple video freezes using both my internal USB webcam and an external Logitech HD720 webcam on all Skype video calls.&nbsp; All drivers are up to date.&nbsp; I am running Windows 10 Version 1803 on a Dell Inspiron 5566 Laptop.&nbsp;
 My Skype version is 12.1815.210.0.&nbsp; Everything was working correctly until 10 days ago.&nbsp; Now every call has video freezing throughout the call.&nbsp; This is very annoying, especially to my clients.&nbsp; My internet is high speed internet through Comcast/Infinity&nbsp;
 with no interruptions or speed and/or connection issues or outages that would cause this problem.&nbsp; Thanks for any help you can offer.&nbsp;</p>

Resolving the Windows Update KB2667402 Error 80004005
<div><span>Posted by <a href="http://msdnrss.thecoderblogs.com/author/msdnrss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Code Monkey</a> on July 4, 2012 </span></div>
<div>
<p>This error can drive you nuts if you are dependent on your machine being upto date for Network Access Protection or other purposes requirements. For weeks my machine was stuck to where I could not uninstall the May version of KB2667402 so that I can successfully
 install the new version of the same update. I tried everything on the web including the Fix-It tool and the Windows Update Readiness tool (Windows6.1-KB947821-v22-x64.msu) etc. with no success.</p>
<p>Running “sfc /scannow” had reported the following errors:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-98-68-metablogapi/2783.image_5F00_0D93D67C.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmsdnrss.thecoderblogs.com%2fwp-content%2fplugins%2fwp-o-matic%2fcache%2f91fdf_4527.image_5F00_thumb_5F00_4053B723.png" /></a></p>
<p>After several support escalations my only options was a re-install, which I obviously did not want to go through. So I decide that I would take a chance at hacking the registry in an attempt to remove any references to this update. Of course this is a very
 dangerous procedure not then again no more grave than having to re-image. Either way I was going to reimage so the chance of avoiding such would be a little gift to myself.</p>
<p>I basically search for anything related to “KB2667402” and started deleting all entries and hives. There are Windows Update specific entries that I could not delete due to permission issues. Once I deleted what I could I went back and tried to do an uninstall
 of the KB2667402 and this time it succeeded. I couldn’t believe my eyes.</p>
<p>I then went back to try the Update again and it succeeded with no issues whatsoever
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmsdnrss.thecoderblogs.com%2fwp-content%2fplugins%2fwp-o-matic%2fcache%2f91fdf_4760.wlEmoticon_2D00_smile_5F00_32E3BE59.png" /> Never thought seeing the all green successful install message would feel so good:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>May not be a classy answer, but its a better answer then I have seen/tried from any support engineer with myoursoft.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I suggest you to perform the steps from the following article and check.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the Windows update troubleshooter and check.<br />
<strong>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a>

</p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: I suggest you to put the computer in clean boot state and check if Windows update installs successful.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
Refer the link below for more details:</p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><em>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps in the above article to reset the computer to start as usual.</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: If the issue persists, perform the steps from the following article.<br />
<strong>Unable to install updates in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2</strong><br />

</p>
<p><em>Note: </em><em><br />
</em><em>a) Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge
 Base: </em><em><br />

    <title>Metroidvania Mania&#33; &#40;Discussion&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oraclea  say:</h3>
<h2>            Metroidvania Mania&#33; &#40;Discussion&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Right now is an awesome time for Metroidvania games on Xbox, with Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night now available, Castlevania: Symphony of the Night currently on GwG, and many great Metroidvania games either recently added to Game Pass or coming soon.&nbsp;
 I think now's a great time to discuss Metroidvanias, and in true Metroidvania fashion, let's have a somewhat non-linear discussion.&nbsp; So, here are two potential prompts to answer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-For a Metroidvania game you've enjoyed, what makes it stand out among the crowd?</p>
<p>-What game would you recommend to a beginner to the Metroidvania genre and why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll answer the first prompt and highlight one of the newer Game Pass additions, Steamworld Dig 2.&nbsp; The thing that really stands out to me about this game is that it has a core gameplay loop and it's really addicting; basically, you explore and collect,
 then you return to a main hub and get upgrades, then repeat.&nbsp; The digging aspects make the exploration really fun, and it's the kind of game with a lot of items and secrets to find that rewards thorough exploration.&nbsp; Although I didn't think the game was too
 hard overall, there is some real tension in knowing that you have limited light and health in the mines and that you'll lose resources you collected on your current trek if you don't make it back to the hub.</p>

            Salt and Sanctuary is a good example. I like it because it's like a Dark Souls 2D game. I highly recommend it.

<p>Hello Oraclea!</p>
<p>Recently i have played Dead Cells, and i would totally recommend it, the thing wich i like the most its like a roguelike RPG game, its hard at the beginning but as you continous playing your character becomes stronger and you unlock more habilities or paths
 that make it easier. Plus its a cheap game!</p>

            I don't know. Not a big fan of those style of games... would Enter the Gungeon count? I know its technically a "bullet hell" kind of game but it is reminiscent of the Metroidvania style to some degree.&nbsp;

<h2>            SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION and other BSOD for my computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello. so recently i installed a new GPU and new RAM into my PC. upgraded from 8 GB RAM to 16 GB RAM and upgraded from a GT 720 to a GTX 770. &nbsp;For some reason the computer would randomly restart itself, so i changed back to the old GPU and did all the driver
 uninstall/reinstall/update stuff. And now my computer will just die on me...If i am in any internet browser, eventuall it will say Adobe ShockWave crashed or just exit out entirely. If i am in any game, evnetually after 30 minutes to an hour, it'll just say
 (insert game name here).exe has stopped working and then close out. if it hasn't done either of those, then it'll blue screen. and there are multiple blue screen errors, so i might not get the same one 2 times in a row.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>in order of frequency:</p>
<p>First one is (SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION) Bugcheck code :0x3B</p>
<p>Second one is (VIDEO MEMORY MANAGEMENT INTERNAL) Bugcheck code: 0x10E</p>
<p>Third is (CRITICAL PROCESS DIED) Bugcheck: 0xEF</p>
<p>Fourth is (SYSTEM THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED) Bugcheck code 0x7E</p>
<p>there are some others but they are rare and i forget their names</p>

            <p>Two crash dumps, two different causes, but here's the kicker. AVAST is flagged in one of the dumps and that leads me to think the second dump that flagged Nvidia Display driver was a false alert and here's why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your loaded modules list, I found what I believe is a remnant module from IObit Malware Fighter (IMFFilter.sys)&nbsp; and it may have been conflicting with AVAST, but I don't know that for sure but, it's very likely the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I suggest you should do. Run AVAST removal tool. Then locate and remove the leftover IOBIT Module/s</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>AVAST Removal tool.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.avast.com/uninstall-utility</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Manually search for and remove IMFFilter.sys (IOBIT) but if you can't find it, use "Autoruns" linked below, to disable or delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Autoruns for Windows v13.62.</p>

<p>I've visited the forums and still have found nothing. I've tried a couple tips they've provided but hasn't helped. I have a couple new dump files I was curious if you could analyze.&nbsp;</p>
<p>https://1drv.ms/f/s!AvrE-aZ3Nm_BklqsZJx8-LGWnOEn</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some backstory I guess: It seemed like it would not let me into the league game, it would crash on the loading screen, at the exact same place. I restarted my computer multiple times and would still not get into the game. It occurs randomly, as I played
 a handful of games with 0 problems. I did remove Norton Security from my computer because the trial expired.&nbsp; I also reinstalled my video drivers multiple times, Windows is 100% up to date as of yesterday, and I can't find any driver on Device Manager that
 seems to be completely out of date. I've left Driver Verifier on for multiple hours running only the non-microsoft&nbsp;drivers, and my computer freezed once or twice but no BSOD or memory dump. I've ran Memtest86 overnight and into the afternoon (ETA 16 hours)
 and there were 0 errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I haven't tried is a complete wipe and a fresh start, it's not ideal but I'll probably do it if the problem persists. Is it possible that my video card is defective? I'm very confused and frustrated as my league account is probably getting
 flagged for dcing in games, and I don't want to get banned or lose rank. Any help is appreciated, and I'm getting desperate, to the point that I've considered bringing it into a store. Please help :'(</p>

<h2>            How do I unpin all my programs file in the taskbar so I see everything that is open&#63;</h2>
                    In the taskbar, I want to still be able to see all my windows across the bottom of the screen. I'm finding the new way the many windows are "hidden" is very unproductive when trying to work between documents. Is there a way to change the setting so I can
 view all open programs/files like you could in previous versions?

If you want it to look like Vista, click 'Use small icons'. This will display the icon and button name.

            <p>It's a Presario &nbsp;SR1610NX with an 3200+ AMD Sempron Processor. &nbsp;Yes, I know it's getting a bit old, but it works really well for me, except for the sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using compatibility mode, like you mentioned, but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hearing from a lot of others that it is likely to be a registry problem. &nbsp;So, if possible, we need a registry fixer for Windows 10, like Microsoft Fix It, but there is no Microsoft Fix-it for Windows 10 yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully being able to fix the registry so Windows Update will work should fix my problem, as well as that of others.</p>

    <title>Problem reading .eml files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariagl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem reading .eml files</h2>
                    <p>Hello:</p>
<p>I just converted my computer from XP to Windows 7 and pretty much all went well.</p>
<p>The following did not go well:<br />
Saved .eml files - I exported all mail that existed in Outlook Express 2003 and imported the mail to Microsoft Office Outlook 2007 -- worked well.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I have some mail items that I saved to my harddrive and they are ".eml" files.&nbsp; I get an error while trying to open these mail documents.&nbsp; Is there a way I can read these items in Outlook 2007?&nbsp; Do I have to convert these .eml files?</p>
<p><br />
thx in advance</p>

            That was not the way to transfer messages. What you need to do now is drag these eml files into a user created folder in Windows Live Mail. Then transfer them to Outlook.<br />

<p>Thank you Bruce for the info.</p>
<p>Actually it was just easier to send the&nbsp;eml files&nbsp;as attachments&nbsp;(using Outlook 2007 - at least I could still attach them) and then once received I was able&nbsp;to &nbsp;save the attachments as Messages of Outlook.&nbsp; I was then able to open the messages in Outlook
 2007.</p>

<h2>            White cortana search box seems to be a bug not feature &#40;I GOT PROOF&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I really hope Microsoft is working a fix. I seen everything posted as to why it's now white(corrupted files, part of light theme, etc.). I tried the so called change your country and restart fix. Every time you click the search box or the start menu it goes
 white again.&nbsp; This is clearly not part of the light theme. I had another computer that was on a really early version(can't remember number, 1607?). I had the search box not visible ,but the Cortana icon visible when updating. I went online to get the update
 to 1709, instead of waiting for windows to tell me a update was ready. I now have version 1709, the search box is the normal color, and the theme is set on light. One thing I noticed on the one with the white search box, if you click the search box and then
 click one of the options on left side(home button) it changes back to normal color. It only seems white when Cortana is "minimized".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the computer that kept the color after update. The only thing different is having search box not visible when updating to 1709.</p>

            Hi AFWS, this does seem to be a bug and users eyes are drawn to this white box.
<br />
<br />A Fix for now is:
<br />
<br />Right click your Taskbar, choose Search - Show Search Icon
<br />
<br />Then you will only have the magnifying glass icon
<br />
<br />When you need to use the search function, you can either click your Start Button and type or click the Magnifying glass icon and type . . .

            Where are you located?
<br />
<br />Run the DISM Tool. If the issue persists, I would have run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.  
<br /> 1. Click on 'Start'.
<br /> 2. Enter 'Command prompt' in the Search box.   
<br /> 3. In the list of results, swipe down on or right-click Command Prompt, and then tap or click 'Run as administrator'.  
<br /> 4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt Window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, 
<br />and then press Enter.
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it. 
<br />
<br />Restart the Cortana Process in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list of processes, select Cortana then click End Task.
<br />
<br />Restart Windows 10 then see if it starts working.
<br />
<br />
<br />Reinstall Cortana
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />At the command Prompt, type then following the hit Enter.
<br />Exit Powershell the restart
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

            This is what I had to do to both. The one that kept the color ended up changing to white like after 5 hours.

<h2>            Cannot cast from Windows 10 to Anyview cast Smart TV</h2>
                    <p>I'm attempting to project to a second display onto a Smart TV supporting Anyview Cast (Hisense Smart TV). I've attempted this with two different Windows 10 laptops, both using the Project to second screen &gt; Connect to a wireless display options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In both cases, it attempts to connect for a while, and then nothing happens. One laptop also states "Couldn't connect" in yellow (with no further diagnostic information).</p>
<p>

<p>SOLVED !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>after much faffing and playing with drivers and doing everything under the sun which didnt work......By flook i got it working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn hisense on ( not in anyview cast mode !!! ) on laptop Go to the add devices and printers section. Remove the little tv icon/ device if its there and then re-add the device .... BUT !!! AND THIS IS WHAT MADE IT WORK , WHEN YOU RE ADD IT DONT ADD IT BACK
 AS THE TV ICON !!!!! IT NEEDS TO BE ADDED BACK AS A PC/SVR/MEDIA BOX TYPE ICON!!!! &nbsp;Which will show in the row below where the tv icons are/were. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went to my movies and said cast, it found my hisense smarttv ( the first movie i chose format didnt work, but the 2nd one i chose, clicked cast and play in the little window that came up and true as nuts it played )&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>hope i am making sense here&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Issues on Toshiba satellite laptop</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 now my C50 Tashiba satellite laptop and it's Matshita DVD RAM UJ8E2 won't work. Computer recognizes it in device manager and says driver is up to date but it won't do anything once you put a disc in the tray. I have done
 the regedit thing to the registry and it still won't work. Deleted the drivers and reinstalled and still nothing...Can anybody help me? Toshiba is clueless wants to charge me $199 to fix it but I know its something simple that I am just over looking. Anyone
 else having this issue?

<p>It appears that you are another victim of the great windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>The compatible check said that my Toshiba L500 laptop was compatible, but it stuffed my cdrom drive also.</p>
<p>On checking the Toshiba site I found that the L500 was not compatible with windows 10. &nbsp;After going back to Windows 7 Pro I still have no DVD drive.</p>
<p>Thank you very much Microsoft!</p>

<p>Well, I don't know why, but this really worked! &nbsp;I have been reading information on this issue for 3 weeks before I arrived at this site. &nbsp;I have been involved with computers for about 24 years and never thought that removing these 2 programs would fix what
 is claimed to be a corrupt registry entry.</p>
<p>THANK YOU VERY MUCH!</p>

            <p>Sorry to read that you still have the problem.</p>
<p>Windows 10 would have to be the biggest stuff up ever released by Microsoft. &nbsp;There are sooooo many issues being discovered by soooo many people.</p>
<p>The latest that has been brought to my attention is that after a time the USB ports cease to function. &nbsp;I tried to revert her computer to Windows 7 Home, but it just reinstalled Windows 10. &nbsp;After 10 days the USB ports again would not work. &nbsp;Yesterday I
 started the recovery process again for her, and this morning she told me that the USB ports were back again. &nbsp;My guess is that when the computer gets a gut full of Windows updates again, the problem will reappear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why was Windows 10 free?</p>
<p>Why do you see "Fix Windows 10 problems quick" keep appearing on your screen?</p>
<p>Why did they include a "revert back to your earlier version" in the program? &nbsp;They must have expected people to experience problems!</p>
<p>They are probably waiting for the public to find a fix for the problems and then release a paid version.</p>

    <title>Issues with Recovering System to New Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heyo_speaker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Recovering System to New Hard Drive</h2>
                    <br />
I don't know which of the following information is relevant and helpful.&nbsp; I apologize if I have provided a lot of unnecessary information in this post.&nbsp; I tried solving several different problems related to my issue, and I explain them all below, but I don't
 expect solutions to them all.&nbsp; I just need to get a Windows installation transferred in its entirety to a new hard drive.&nbsp; I apologize for diverging so much, but I wanted whoever reads this to be informed about everything I've tried and every problem I've
 had.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am working on a Vista computer that seemingly experienced a corruption of Windows that prevented it from booting and caused a blue screen of death.<br />
<br />
By pressing F8 at startup, selecting "Repair your computer", and running the pre-installed recovery software provided by Gateway, I was able to recover a fresh Vista installation along with the drivers for the computer's built-in hardware.&nbsp; I assume this recovery
 came from an image stored in the separate "Recovery" partition on the drive (but I could be wrong -- this is the first time I have done this kind of recovery and I'm not familiar with the process).<br />
<br />
However, I am now trying to transfer the entire system, along with the "Recovery" partition, to a new hard drive the owner bought out of concern for potential hard drive corruption (though chkdsk did not find any bad sectors in the C: partition), and also because
 the new hard drive has more storage space.&nbsp; I thought this would be easy to do with disk imaging software, but I had never actually recovered a system from a backup image before and I was not expecting to run into so many issues.<br />
<br />
I downloaded and installed a free imaging program called DriveImage XML and created backup images of the system partition (C:) and the recovery partition (H:) on a third hard drive.&nbsp; I used Vista's Disk Management to create two partitions on the new hard drive
 and then used DriveImage XML to recover from the backup images to the partitions on the new hard drive.<br />
<br />
Here's where my understanding of things gets fuzzy.&nbsp;&nbsp; At that moment I assumed that the contents of the new hard drive exactly matched the old hard drive, except for the differences in the amount of free space, and that Windows should boot exactly as it did
 on the old drive -- but Windows would not boot.&nbsp; The computer just kept restarting over and over without booting Windows.<br />
<br />
My best guess is that there is some kind of identifier built into the drive independent of its contents, and that Windows cannot boot because it is still trying to access files from the original hard drive on which it was installed, based on this identifier.&nbsp;
 But I really don't know.&nbsp; (It would be great if someone could explain this to me!!!)<br />
<br />
I found some FAQs for DriveImage XML (http://www.runtime.org/driveimage_faq.htm), which said:<br />
<br />
<br />
<i>Q. I restored my boot drive, why does it not boot?<br />
<br />
A. To boot from a drive:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boot partition should be located on the first drive (DISK0), which is usually the master drive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boot partition should be the first partition on the drive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boot partition must be a "primary" partition.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boot partition must be "active".<br />
<br />
If your drive still does not boot you can try to set a new "Disk ID". Windows remembers old drive letter assignments which can cause problems when trying to boot from a cloned drive. You can force the removal of old drive letter assignments by setting a new
 Disk ID. Click Tools-&gt;Set new Disk ID and read the instructions.<br />
<br />
Vista Boot Problem:<br />
<br />
If your cloned Vista drive refuses to boot with a "winload.exe is missing or corrupt" message, you might need to change the BCD store.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
In Disk Management, I checked that the partitions were "primary" and that the system partition was "active".&nbsp; Also, in Disk Management, the system partition is listed before recovery partition, so I assume that means it is the "first partition on the drive"
 (but...&nbsp; I really wouldn't know). &nbsp; DriveImage XML includes a "Fix Vista boot problem" tool.&nbsp; I think that was what I tried first, and it allowed Windows to boot, but multiple error messages appeared on boot and the Desktop didn't look right, etc.&nbsp; (I don't
 remember all the details).&nbsp; I may have then tried to set a new disk ID using the "Set new disk ID" tool in DriveImage XML but I don't think it had any effect -- it may have even prevented Windows from booting at all but I can't remember.<br />
<br />
I repeated recovery again from the same backup image, but this time I used a bootable utilities CD that included DriveImage XML instead of the copy installed on the old hard drive.&nbsp; I still could not boot off of the new hard drive after recovering the system
 to it, but some combination of the "Set new disk ID" and "Fix Vista boot problem" tools (run off of this bootable CD) finally worked and allowed me to boot Windows off the new hard drive!&nbsp; I can't remember if I used just one or both of those tools.&nbsp; That first
 time that Windows booted from the new hard drive, I believe there was <i>one</i> odd message that doesn't normally pop up during boot (maybe about "setting up your desktop", and/or it "had to restart to apply the new settings" or something), but other than
 that it looked like Windows was running normally with no problems.<br />
<br />
Despite having seemingly achieved my goal of transferring the system to the new hard drive and getting it to boot, I may have found some problems with the installation.&nbsp; After running chkdsk on the new disk, I went into the Event Viewer to retrieve the chkdsk
 log and while I was there I discovered some error messages from System Restore.&nbsp; I found a possible fix here ( http://www.eventid.net/display.asp?eventid=8193&amp;eventno=9479&amp;source=SystemRestore&amp;phase=1 ) but the writer also says "This problem could be a sign
 that the drive was improperly cloned, and might need to be individualized again using Microsoft's SysPrep tool."<br />
<br />
....The words <i>"improperly cloned"</i> caught my attention.<br />
<br />
After a bunch of research and wading through technical articles from Microsoft that are not written for someone with my experience level, I concluded the following:<br />
<br />
-- SysPrep is something that should be run before trying to clone a system to a new computer because it "generalizes" the Windows installation, which is then "individualized" again once the new copy of Windows is booted on the new computer.<br />
<br />
-- Even though the new copy of Windows will be used on the same computer, I perhaps should have run SysPrep on the original installation of Windows before creating the backup image so that the new copy could be individualized to accommodate the new
<i>hard drive</i>.<br />
<br />
But if this is truly necessary, then why don't the guides for DriveImage XML, my imaging software, say anything about it?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I decided to give it a try, so I tried to run SysPrep on the original installation of Windows.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and it didn't work, of course!&nbsp; An error message appeared saying something like "A fatal error occurrred while trying to sysprep the machine."&nbsp; I
 did a Google search on this error message and found the following (which are not written for someone at my experience level):<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929828<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947212/en-us <br />
<br />
After reading (and trying to understand) those articles, I concluded that to pinpoint the problem with SysPrep I would have to find this Setuperr.log file, so I went to start up the computer again (booting the original installation, on which I had tried to
 run the SysPrep), and......&nbsp; for the first time since I began working on this computer, I experienced some strange behavior when the computer itself turned on -- it didn't even try to boot Windows, just the fans went at high speed and nothing appeared on the
 screen (unless I had my monitor set to the wrong input at first), so after waiting a moment I turned off the computer.&nbsp; I have NO IDEA if SysPrep could have affected something on the computer other than the Windows installation on the hard drive?&nbsp; That seems
 odd and unlikely to me, but it also was a weird coincidence.&nbsp; So I started up the computer again and this time everything was normal, but then I got a blue screen of death in Windows when it tried to boot, so I assumed that blue screen WAS because of the SysPrep
 failure....&nbsp;&nbsp; I turned it off and back on, and something else weird happened, like the computer started briefly and then turned off...&nbsp;&nbsp; maybe I didn't press the power button hard enough?&nbsp; Another weird coincidence.&nbsp; Then I started it again and that time Windows
 booted fine.<br />
<br />
Did SysPrep cause any of that weird behavior?&nbsp; Is something else on the computer screwed up now by a SysPrep procedure that was cut off prematurely??&nbsp; That seems so strange to me that SysPrep would affect anything on the computer beyond the Windows installation,
 but I really have no idea and I couldn't overlook the coincidence.&nbsp; I have no idea what SysPrep does specifically, so I'm just trying to interpret what I see.<br />
<br />
So maybe SysPrep caused the BSOD and then Windows corrected itself with the next boot?&nbsp; But now I don't trust this installation of Windows and feel like I need to recover it to the manufacturer installation again from the recovery partition.<br />
<br />
Anyway, since Windows was up and running, I looked for that Setuperr.log file so I could figure out what went wrong with SysPrep.&nbsp; I searched for "setuperr" in the Windows folder and tried to open some of the text files that came up, and, naturally, got an
 "Access is denied" message.<br />
<br />
...........<br />
<br />
So maybe I could work around that "Access is denied" message by adjusting the Windows security settings, as I think I have done before.....&nbsp; But right now I am feeling very discouraged, fed up, and tired, and I don't even know if I am on the right track with
 this SysPrep thing in the first place.&nbsp; I know all this complication comes from not having a Windows CD, but Gateway won't provide one and I don't think Microsoft will because Windows came along with the Gateway computer.<br />
<br />
To summarize my successes so far:&nbsp; I recovered Vista on the original hard drive and managed to copy it to the new hard drive and get it to boot, but not without some possible hidden problems as indicated by the System Restore error messages I saw in the Event
 Viewer.&nbsp; And now I may have messed up the Vista installation on the original hard drive by trying to run SysPrep, but I assume I can just restore the manufacturer installation again from the recovery partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; .........Hopefully!<br />
<br />
I can't help but feel like it SHOULD BE WAY, WAY EASIER THAN THIS to simply copy a system from one hard drive to another.....&nbsp;&nbsp; I would have thought this was a common thing to do that should be pretty streamlined.&nbsp; Yet it seems from what I've read Windows has
 to be "generalized" and then "individualized" to the new drive (even though the instructions for DriveImage XML say nothing about this) using this SysPrep tool that I've never heard of, which then ran into a fatal error and possibly screwed up the original
 Windows installation if not something else on the computer.&nbsp; ....Every new idea I come up with just keeps running into obstacles and more obstacles and I don't seem to know enough about what I am doing to get anywhere!<br />
<br />
I am posting this because I seem to be getting nowhere (in fact, further into trouble) by simply searching the Internet for answers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am...... BEGGING anyone with some insight into what is preventing Windows from being cleanly transferred to the new hard
 drive to enlighten me!!&nbsp; I can provide any information needed.&nbsp; There's GOT to be a simple solution to this, unless Microsoft doesn't want there to be....&nbsp; Really Microsoft and Gateway should provide Windows installation disk replacements upon request, for
 a reasonable fee.&nbsp; (Gateway won't because the computer is more than 3 years old or so, and something I read said Microsoft won't provide one because the owner acquired Windows through the computer manufacturer.)&nbsp; Maybe that IS the only simple solution, but
 unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be an option.&nbsp; But it should be simpler than this to copy Windows to a new hard drive and then tweak whatever needs to be tweaked to make it fully compatible with the new hard drive.&nbsp; Can this be done
<i>without</i> a Windows disk, <i>without</i> running SysPrep?&nbsp; Do I just need to follow through and get SysPrep to work?&nbsp; Is there a better way?<br />
<br />
The only alternatives I have to transferring the system to the new hard drive would be to ask the owner if he's willing to just use the old hard drive with the original installation and hope the drive is not actually damaged (and hope SysPrep didn't have any
 effect on my ability to recover the manufacturer installation again), and ask if he is willing to settle for the smaller capacity drive; or, I could try re-installing Windows XP on the larger drive and then manually installing all the drivers for the computer's
 built-in hardware....&nbsp; but that might be another big headache if the drivers are not compatible with Windows XP.&nbsp; Plus, after investing all this time into it, I would really like to actually
<i>know</i> how to do this kind of transfer so I will be able to do it for others in the future.<br />
<br />
There was one other idea I tried.&nbsp; Since I had recovered both the system partition and the "Recovery" partition to the new hard drive (in two separate partitions), I tried simply starting up the computer with the new hard drive in it, pressing F8, and selecting
 "Repair your computer" so that I could use the installed Gateway software to recover the manufacturer installation from that clone of the "Recovery" partition.&nbsp;&nbsp; ....No luck with that either (well, what did you expect?); it wouldn't even bring up the repair
 options, as it did when booting from the original hard drive.&nbsp; It just proceeds to boot normally into Vista.&nbsp; So it's just another sign that something was lost in the migration to the new drive.&nbsp; I just don't know what exactly that was.<br />
<br />
And I just had one more idea I <i>haven't</i> tried:&nbsp; I could repeat the process of recovering the backup image to the new hard drive, but this time NOT run the DriveImage XML tools to either "Set new disk ID" or "Fix Vista boot problem", and then even though
 I know Windows won't boot in that case, maybe pressing F8 at startup, selecting "Repair your computer", and running the recovery software provided by Gateway
<i>will</i> allow me to recover the manufacturer installation from the clone of the "Recovery" partition.&nbsp; But maybe that would be futile -- if Windows can't boot normally, why would pressing F8 allow me to boot into the repair options?&nbsp; At this point, maybe
 it's worth a try.&nbsp; .....But I think I have tried enough senseless ideas for tonight.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the help....&nbsp;&nbsp; I really appreciate it!!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You can not Clone the Recovery Partition from the original HD to a new Hard Drive.</p>
<p>It is only used on the original Hard Drive where it was imaged during manufacture of the Computer</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can obtain cloning Software from the new Hard Drive Manufacturer's website; they supply it for free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are a number of other&nbsp;3rd Party Programs available to do a Complete PC Backup; some you have to pay for, some are free.</p>
<p>This Program has to be bought:</p>

<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

            Sounds like you have logged into a temporary profile. Try restarting your computer a few times. Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />At the sign in screen, click the power button, then click Restart. Do this a few times then try signing again. If the desktop still does not show up, then create a new local user account. 
<br />
<br />Try creating a local account: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-local-account-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-local-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into the new account.
<br />Open File Explorer on the Taskbar &gt; This PC 
<br />Open the drive where Windows is installed 
<br />Open Users 
<br />Look if your old account old is there with your files - they might be amended with your machine name.
<br />
<br />If they are, you can copy them over to the new account.
