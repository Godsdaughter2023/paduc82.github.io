<h2>            keyboard jumping</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new computer and new deluxe keyboard and using a Logitech roller ball mouse.&nbsp; When I use the space bar, the type jumps and even when I'm just typing, the space bar kind of jams and jumps ahead. Do I need to download a new driver?</p>

    <title>Incorrect order of monitors, TV is automatically selected as monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n_than  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incorrect order of monitors, TV is automatically selected as monitor 1, computer boots up to messed up screen resolution</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: Using TV as occasional monitor while leaving it plugged in</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went out and bought an Xbox Controller and a 10m HDMI cord so that I can connect my PC to the 55" TV on the other side of the room so that I can play games on my couch using Steam Big Picture. I've been trying to work out the best way of managing the
 TV so that it doesn't use up additional resources or interfere in any way when not in use and to be able to easily switch over to the TV (including setting default audio device as the TV). So far Using the Win+P shortcut to select between PC Screen Only/Second
 Screen Only works OK, but there are still a few problems... (I should also note that my monitor res is 2560x1440 whereas TV of course is 1920x1080)<br />
<br />
- Windows always allocates the TV as monitor 1 which, from speaking with NVIDIA and reading various forum posts, there seems to be no way around, which means selecting PC Screen Only actually selects the TV and vice versa.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Windows boots up not to the display selected as main display but whichever I used last (PC Screen Only or Second Screen Only)<br />
<br />
- If the PC is booted up from the TV when I move back to my monitor the resolution is all screwy where the toolbar and desktop shortcuts are big but if I open a windows browser everything is tiny and text is blurry, I've checked and made sure that the resolution
 is correct (2560x1440). When I boot up from the PC monitor I don't have this problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- Still haven't found a way to automatically select TV as default audio device when switching over to it.

            <p><span><span>Hello N_Than,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the issue description, I understand that you have a TV connected to your computer through HDMI cable.
 Windows automatically selects TV as monitor 1, hence selecting PC screen only select the TV and vice Versa. Also, Windows boots up on the display whichever the last was used and the screen resolution is messed up.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>LCD monitors, including laptop screens, typically run best at their
</span><span><strong>native resolution</strong></span><span>. It's usually recommended in order to ensure you see the sharpest text and images possible.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you set your monitor to a screen resolution that it won't support, the computer display might appear not pleasant.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may try the steps in the article below for help in getting the best display on your monitors.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Get the best display on your monitor</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>For TV getting selected as primary monitor issue, you may check manually designating the preferred primary display.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps below to do so:</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press
<strong>Windows+X</strong> and select <strong>Control Panel</strong> from the menu.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click <strong>Personalization </strong>
<span>&nbsp;</span>and then <strong>Display Settings.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>To designate the primary display, on the
<strong>Monitor</strong> tab, click the icon that corresponds to the monitor that you want to designate as the primary display, and then select the
<strong>This is my main monitor</strong> check box.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Select the screen resolution and color quality for each monitor that you're using.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, there can also be possibility of Video cards problem, you may refer the article below to troubleshoot Video card Problems.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply but you've obviously not read my post properly as neither of these answers answer my question.<br />
<br />
1. This is not about which monitor is designated as 'main monitor', I'm fully aware how to do this. This is about the order of the monitors, which is 1 and which is 2. No matter what you do there is no way to change this in Windows for some silly reason, nor
 am I able to fix it through NVIDIA control panel (my GFX card is a GTX 970) which I have confirmed with NVIDIA is not possible.<br />
<br />
2. This is not about a change in screen resolutions, again I am fully aware of native screen resolutions and how to change the resolution of windows.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Below are two screenshots taken from my PC Monitor that will demonstrate my issue more clearly. You will see in both that my Dell U2713HM is selected as my main display but is designated as "Monitor 2" and that the screen resolution does not change from 2560x1440.
 It's a little hard to read but NO displays settings change between screenshots.<br />
<br />
<br />
This screenshot is after rebooting my computer from being set to my PC Monitor. &nbsp;This is what the desktop shortcuts, text, toolbars SHOULD look like.
<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/044e55f7-899e-41e1-b6c1-8f31996f8059" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now this screenshot is after rebooting my PC from being set to the TV. I've switched back over to my PC monitor and while the resolution is correct the desktop icons and toolbar are big while the windows and text are small and slightly blurry (this also
 does not happen from incorrect resolution, its either all big or all small depending on which way you went in the wrong direction)<br />
<br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please read my post more carefully this time, thank you.</p>

<p>Before shutting down you could switch to Extend with your PC as primary.&nbsp; That's what works for me.&nbsp; In fact, lately I have been finding windows moving over to it that didn't used to and that I would rather stay where they were but it sounds like that would
 suit you fine too.</p>

            You can change which is 1 versus 2.&nbsp; The "main" monitor, after being applied, is always number 1 when you are using the "extend these screens" option.

<p>@ Shawn</p>
<p>For me that only switched some attributes such as Taskbar and Start Screen location&nbsp;and held after a Hibernate.&nbsp; I had stuff open that I didn't want to close so a full Restart will have to wait.&nbsp; I still saw my Surface screen being used first and it is still
 being identified as being #1.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm going to switch it back because I really have no use for that configuration but I can at least attest that it works as designed.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I guess I'm not really proving anything about what the OP wants because my resolution
 on both monitors is the same.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, how would I turn off the Surface monitor to have only the HDMI monitor showing and still have Display set to Extend mode?&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You wouldn't of course. But if there's only one display turned on, it will always forcibly become the "main" display.&nbsp; This way when a program calls the
<span>Get­Monitor­Info</span> API call (or other API's), it will throw the image it is presenting to the one and only display that's currently turned on.&nbsp; Basically this guarantees that things like a dialog box get shown on the active monitor and not&nbsp;out
 of bounds&nbsp;where you can't see/view it.&nbsp; You can test it by pressing Win+R. The Run box will always appear on the main display.</p>

<h2>            System Volum Information taking 1.1 TB.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I saw 10 minutes ago that I had 124,9 GB free out of 1849. I was suprised, because this morning I had 1,2 TB free out of 1849 GB. I looked with a program called TreeSize that the file that was 1.1 TB was klobjdb.bat in Systeam Volume Information.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If the Operating System came preinstalled, as it would appear to be as the Product Key&nbsp;sticker was on the bottom of the Laptop, NO, you can not find&nbsp;a Product Key that you can use for any useful purpose&nbsp;in your System.</p>
<p>The only Product Key you would find in your System is the Manufacturer Factory Installation Product Key which is used for multiple Installations solely during original&nbsp;manufacture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish to reinstall the Operating System contact the Manufacturer and ask them to either send you Recovery disks to reinstall the Operating System, which they should do for a small cost&nbsp;and also ask them if you have a Recovery partition on your Laptop
 to do the same thing, i.e. reinstall the Operating System.</p>
<p>Neither of the above reinstallation methods normally requires you to&nbsp;insert a Product Key during reinstallation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>p.s. Serial Number (SN:xxxxx)&nbsp;is to do with the&nbsp;Identification number&nbsp;to give to&nbsp;the&nbsp;Manufacturer if you ever contact them so they can look up details of your Laptop&nbsp;and is nothing to do with the Product Key.</p>

 I attempt to download netflix again it gives me a moment of the active downloads screen then says "Cant download Netflix" with no error code. Please help this is infuriating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on the information above, it is possible that you have sent the request to a different Skype profile which would explain why they cannot see or receive your contact request. To confirm, you can use their Skype account's&nbsp;<strong>registered email address</strong>
 or <strong>phone number</strong> to search the correct account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moreover, as a workaround, you may also provide your <em>Skype username</em> and&nbsp;the
<em>registered email address </em>for them to send you a contact request instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>

<p>Are you saying that your PC doesn't current get assigned a DNS server?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, this is typically the responsibility of the router* to provide your PC with the IP address of the DNS server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or are you talking about the DNS service on your PC?&nbsp; If so, this is perfectly normal... most PCs do not act as DNS servers.&nbsp; So, that service should remain disabled.</p>

            Both windows and xbox supports related to this topic are simply useless, no support related to other games except for your xbox apps and games, typical capitalist aproach... Sad to see zero customer care service unless you are using a paid software/game
 directly from windows.

Do the following steps<br />

                    The only audio audible is Skype and few others. For instance, I cannot hear Youtube or any similar programs... The headphones identify themselves as Realtek High Definition Audio. Anyone know how to fix this error?

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<span>
<p>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community!</p>
<p>It seems that you cannot hear the sound from headphone. 
</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><br />
1. Do you receive any error message on the computer?<br />
2. Did you make any changes on the&nbsp;computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
To get the issue fixed, you may try the steps:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may check if you are able to hear sound while connecting a different headphone to the computer. Also check if your new headphone works on a different computer without any issue.</p>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may also check with volume settings and check if it helps.<br />
a. Right click on the speaker icon in taskbar and select volume control options.<br />
b. put a check mark on "All devices currently playing sound".<br />
c. Make sure you have "The default communication device unchecked".<br />
d. Place a check mark on both speakers and headphones.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>You may also set the speakers as the default device. Follow these steps:<br />
a. Click "Start" and select "Control Panel".<br />
b. In the search box, type "Sound".<br />
c. From the search results, click the "Sound" option.<br />
d. Under the "Playback" tab, click "Speakers"<br />
e. Click "Set Default" at the bottom.<br />
f. Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the settings.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 4:<br />
</strong>You may also update the sound card drivers from the manufacturer website and check.<br />

<h2>            Arrow key issues</h2>
                    I have seen that other people have had a similar issue, but none are quite the same. My problem is that my up and down arrow keys have stopped working, without any apparent reason why. One night, I'm playing games and using my arrow keys just fine. I shut
 down my computer and log back in the following evening, and the two keys fail to operate. I figured perhaps all I needed to do was shut down the computer, and when I turned it back on, the issue would resolve itself, but this is not the case. Is there anything
 I can do to fix this problem?

</p><p><em>My sister uses her cell phone number to skype with....when i call her on skype or she calls me on skype it uses her cell number and she pays nothing.....</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow-up question: </strong>How did your sister create her account? Are you using her phone number to call her Skype account? Does her phone number display when she calls your account?

</p><p><strong>Q: </strong><em>How do I use skype -to-skype without getting a paid skype number ?&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Really don't need to know it though since it is embedded in the firmware.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Starting with the release of Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate
 one of the easier ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various
 letters and numbers when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8/10 computers.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regrets the inconvenience you have experienced. Let me ask few questions to help you in this regard:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Make and model of your device?</p>
<p>* What problem you're facing with Cortana?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the issue might due to the incompatible drivers. Suggest you to check and install the latest Windows 10 Video and Audio drivers for your device from the Manufacture's website and see it helps. You can search for the drivers&nbsp;using&nbsp;your device model
 in Manufacture's website.</p>

    <title>Moving Windows 7 from old computer to new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigredbird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Windows 7 from old computer to new</h2>
                    <p>I am putting together a new PC, NOT a pre-assembled system but building from scratch. It has NO operating system. My current computer had OEM XP installed; I used a retail upgrade to install Windows 7 Home Premium. I really don't want to spend $190 for a
 full Windows 7 install if I can avoid it. Besides, I already bought the upgrade, right? Can I transfer the Windows 7 operating system to the new computer? How?</p>
<p>If I install my existing boot drive into the new computer, can I then transfer the operating system to a 60GB SSD drive and use it thereafter for bootup (swap out boot drive either physically or thru BIOS)? Or can I install the SSD drive in my old computer,
 transfer the operating system, then install in the new? It seems I ought to be able to do something like&nbsp;this, but I&nbsp;have no idea&nbsp;how to go about it.&nbsp;Can I use my existing operating system without purchasing a new full install?</p>
<p>Edit: One further complication, maybe - my existing machine is 32-bit, the new machine will be 64-bit. Does that change anything?</p>

            <p>According to the Windows 7 license agreement, you need a full version license in order to install on a blank hard disk / motherboard.
</p>
<p>. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>Windows 7 32 bit can work on either 32 or 64 bit CPU's, if you want to run Windows 7 64 bit, it will work on that too.
</p>
<p>--------------</p>
<p>You could try doing a clean install with the Windows 7 Upgrade disc and see if it works, if not, you will just have to invest in a full version Windows 7 license, or consider purchasing a copy of Windows XP Home Edition or Windows Vista Home Basic full version
 and use that as your qualifying license.</p>
<p>How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>

Sorry, you will need to buy a Full version of Windows 7. <br />
<br />
Your OEM XP license can not be moved to another computer.<br />
<br />
<span>Because you have a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista license. A custom built computer doesn't have a license, so it doesn't qualify
 to use the Windows 7 Upgrade you have.<br />

 as it's only installed on one computer at a time <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
(and if it's a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista/7 license)</span>. The previous Windows 7 installation on the old computer must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened
 to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.
</span></p>
<p>
 purchase and Windows bought separately, are tied to the first computer they are installed on and can not be transferred to a different computer. To install Windows on a different computer you will need to buy another copy.</span><br />

    <title>Turtle Beach headset mic not working in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> canyoureadthis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Turtle Beach headset mic not working in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Turtle Beach Earforce P11 headset that features a USB connector and a 3.5mm audio jack for the headphone port.<br />
<br />
It worked fine under Windows 8.1 for several months and worked fine under Windows 10 up until a few days ago.<br />
<br />
While the headphone portion can still play back sound, the microphone doesn't seem to work. The bar level in the recording devices section of sound only seems to go up when I flick the ON/MUTE switch. Otherwise, nothing.<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling device drivers from the Device Manager, unplugging and replugging the headset, changing default devices, and restarting the computer, all to no change. I'm thinking that there might have been a recent Windows Update
 that somehow messed up the way the headset is being detected, as I noticed something strange under Playback Devices.<br />

Yeah, the headset is listed twice and named once. I've tried the audio test feature, and both the headphone entry and the first speaker entry play through the headphones, though the speaker entry plays louder. The only physical audio equipment I have hooked
 up is a Logitech subwoofer and twin speaker combo as well as this headset. No idea what the SPDIF thing is. It's not a physical device that I can see. The microphone does appear under Recording Devices, but of course no audio is picked up.<br />
<br />
Also, I heard a rumour that a Windows 10 update somehow toggled the onboard sound settings in the BIOS, but I checked that and mine was still enabled. As for the VIA HD audio, I've tried disabling that on startup and restarting to see if that was causing the
 problem, but nothing seems to have changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I occasionally see a popup when opening playback talking about driver enhancements causing problems, but disabling/enabling those doesn't seem to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Just unplugged the headset while the sound panel was open and this entry disappeared</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, none of those proposed solutions have worked for me. The troubleshooter comes back and tells me that it can't identify the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Turtle Beach site doesn't appear to have drivers for this headset, presumably because this headset doesn't usually require any special drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed the link and tried installing the generic device drivers on my main audio driver, as well as the other drivers listed in the Update Driver Software page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>High Definition Audio Device</p>
<p>VIA HD Audio</p>
<p>VIA HD Audio (Compatible)</p>
<p>VIA HD Audio (Win 10)</p>
<p>VIA High Definition Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that doesn't seem to have made any difference. The headset itself only lists a generic "USB Audio Device" driver.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. &nbsp; I have he Titanfall Atlas. &nbsp; Can get everything working fine except for the microphone. &nbsp; I've tried everything. &nbsp; Windows thinks everything is fine. &nbsp;Tried generic drivers. &nbsp;Updated USB drivers. &nbsp; Uninstalled and reinstalled drivers.
 &nbsp; I have a gigabyte motherboard and use the integrated sound card. &nbsp;It is an older board (z68 socket 1155) and uses Realtek Audio. &nbsp; I've tried their drivers but it still doesn't help. &nbsp; Windows does not recognize a Jack for this USB microphone. &nbsp; It does
 not work on my Windows 10 laptop either. &nbsp; &nbsp;Additionally this issue seems to have carried over to my Xbox One as well..... &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Werty, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />I doubt a driver update would cause your desktop icons to disappear, but it's worth updating or reinstalling your graphics drivers just to be sure. Here are links to download the drivers compatible with your brand of graphics card:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:
<br /><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amd.com/en/support</a>
<br />
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />Intel Graphics:
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />I'd also recommend booting into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also see if the System File Checker fixes the issue:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

            Hi WertyNM, no, updating drivers should not make your icons disappear, the solution  depends on what you are seeing on your Desktop: 
<br />
<br />1. 
<br />If you wallpaper is visible, but no icons: 
<br />Right click your Desktop and choose View - Show Desktop Icons 
<br />
<br />
<br />2. 
<br />If you see square tiles instead of your Desktop 
<br />You are in Tablet Mode . . . 
<br />Press Windows key + A 
<br />On the Resulting Flyout, if you cannot see the Tablet Mode Button, click 'Expand' 
<br />If the Tablet Mode Button is not gray, click it so it becomes gray 
<br />This will turn off tablet mode 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://imgur.com/HO0JqQK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/HO0JqQK</a> 
<br />
<br />
<br />3. 
<br />If you do not see your files or icons, you are signed into a Temporary Profile:
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around 
<br />Restart your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours? 
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.) 
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time 
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

<h2>            Can&#39;t stop old 2006 driver from automatically installing</h2>
                    I've just got a new digital camera, and when I plugged it into my computer it connected and started working right away with the software that came on the cd, but then I got a prompt saying it was beginning to instal a driver for the device, and as soon
 as it finished my computer will no longer detect the camera. I set every possible setting I could find to prompt me before or disable automatic installing drivers, but it still does it every time I unintstall and try again.
<br />
<br />
The driver it keeps installing is the only one on my computer, as the software from the disc seems to make it work without an installed driver, the camera is compatible with vista and I've double checked everything, I've even tried to end task the installation
 of the driver, but it won't let me. Is there anything I am missing or any way to stop this?

<h2>            Microsoft Money Plus</h2>
                    <p>Case # 1471245315</p>
<p>
</p><p>In March 2019 with the Windows update it completely corrupted my computer including a set restore point as well as a prior backup saved on a separate drive.&nbsp; I had to send it to a repair shop to try and restore as much data as possible.&nbsp; They were unable
 to restore my computer to its former self and many programs were lost as well as data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>In regards to Microsoft Money 2004 the files were still viable but upon restoring the program Microsoft automatically updated to the last registered version proceeding mine and loaded with a trial period. Upon exiting the program it is requesting to purchase
 the program.&nbsp; Upon attempts to purchase the program is no longer available. </p>
<p>Microsoft was unable to restore to an earlier version with my original disc as it will not recognize the OS, or come up with any solutions,&nbsp; I am now posed to lose access to over 15 years of valuable data.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have any solutions as to how I can rectify this problem and continue forward.</p>
<p>

<p>You can't download or you can't install?&nbsp; Note that while some people have successfully installed the Sunset version on Windows 10, it's not supported--from the download page:</p>
<p>

<p>Also note that support for all versions of Money ended in 2011, and you were using a 2004 version.&nbsp; Not a good strategy for dealing with "valuable" data.&nbsp;

<p>The original purchase was Money 2004 and I still had the disc which a Microsoft tech tried to access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that they stopped supporting in 2011 but in the years prior I was still getting upgrades and had been running fine until the the last Windows upgrade in March that crashed my computer.</p>

<p>You'll probably have better luck posting in the Money forum <a href="https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?category=money&amp;filter=alltypes&amp;sort=lastpostdesc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you had done the prudent thing and dumped Money when support ended, you could probably have migrated successfully to
<a href="https://www.quicken.com/support/archived-how-do-i-importconvert-my-microsoft-money-work-quicken-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Quicken</a>, and there's a slim chance that you still can, depending on the nature of your data.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can't test that as I don't want to install that version of Money. (it's US only)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the Microsoft tech tried to install the 2004 version you have in compatibility mode. You can try it by not using the autorun of your CD (if it starts on its own) and open File Explorer then go to the optical drive and right click, select properties
 and then the Compatibility tab. Select a previous operating system version and see if it will install.&nbsp;<span>It's a long shot.</span></p>
<p>As Windows 10 updates with Feature updates then support for older programs is often removed, some keep working but others cannot be used.</p>

            I had Quicken Cash Manager 2016 and it was one of the programs that completely crashed.. Just spent 2 hrs on the phone with Quicken&nbsp; Tech mostly on hold to find out that MAYBE if I purchase a new version of Quicken on line that I might be able to transfer
 my Money files as my quicken files have crashed.&nbsp; And bonus I will have to pay yearly to keep it running
