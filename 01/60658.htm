<h2>            Spider Solitaire Cards will not move in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    When playing spider solitaire I have a problem with some of the cards not moving. I had this happen a couple of times with Windows 8, but the problem stopped. I'm guessing it was due to an update. Now when I play the game on Windows 8.1, the middle section
 of cards will not move, while I do not have a problem moving the cards closer to or on the end stacks.

            <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>After I updated to Windows 8.1, Windows 8 came installed on my laptop, I uninstalled then reinstalled Microsoft Solitaire Collection several times, about 5, I have not had a problem with Spider Solitaire since doing so. You may want to try it. I am not stating
 this as a solution, but it worked for me. </p>

<h2>            Kinect Positioning advice.</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking to&nbsp;get the Kinect. I've heard a lot of reports from people saying that you need at least 6ft to play and 8ft to play with someone else.<br />
I've also heard that if you raise or even lower the Kinect it can help.<br />
The space I have between the front of the stand and the sofa is about 6 and half feet.<br />
<br />
I was thinking about getting a wall mount to go above the TV which will give me a little more room but I was then concerned about the camera not being able to see low enough, I have a 5 and half year old so I need to make sure it works for her and everyone
 else too.<br />
The TV sits about 8 inches from the wall.<br />
<br />
Any advice please. Hopefully I've given enough info.</p>

<p>The thing to remeber about Kinect is that not only do you need to stand well back (6' or so) you also need plenty of space to wave around without hitting other people, walls furniture etc. It's not just a limitation of the tech, but also a requirement of
 the game play. You just need lots of open space. both between you and the TV and also around the players.</p>
<p>Some games need less space than others. Kinect adventures needs loads of moving about, Child of Eden just needs arm movements for cursor control and works well even in a tight space.</p>

<p>Update on this. We have got the Kinect and mounted it on the TV (within the 2ft-6ft MS reccomended height) using the Crown TV mount. Went to setup it up yesterday and my Wife seemed to have been tracked/ID on it but she was right back to the front of the
 sofa and couldn't "step on the green squares" behind her. My 5 year daughter had major issues, again she couldn't step back onto the green squares behind and her avatar legs were bending in all kinds of places.</p>
<p>Someone earlier on here mentioned about putting the Kinect 15cm above the TV. My concerns are as the TV is slightly forward of the wall when the camera pans down will the TV be in the way also will it still be too high to be able to see all of ours bodies,
 including out feet?</p>
<p>I've also thought about putting it at the minimum height of 2ft? but will I have the opposite effect and me and my wifes heads can't be seen?</p>
<p>I appreciate any and all advice </p>

</p><p>Just to clarify, did you try downloading a different item from a different site?</p>

                    Very frustrated. Downloaded Adera from the MS Store with no problem. Paid the $20 for Season 1 with no problem (of course). Attempted to download Episode 1 with no success. Have uninstalled and installed several times, twice from a clean boot - still with
 no success. Have cleaned the store cache, still no success. Have clicked links on other posts with this problem, and they provide no answers as to how to resolve this issue. Would someone please help me out?

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />There are two things I'd try to fix the MS Store:
<br />
<br />Open the command prompt by clicking Start, then typing "cmd". Right click the Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />Type "WSreset.exe" without quotes and press Enter. This will reset the MS Store and may resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, try re-registering the store with the steps in the link below:

    <title>Desktop icons move in W10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woodstockjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Desktop icons move in W10</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro (1) running Windows 10 with two users.&nbsp; My wife is set up as an online&nbsp;(Microsoft) account; I am set up as a local account--I like it that way; both are administrators.&nbsp; Every time I sign out of my user account and then later go back
 in, the icons have moved to the left side of the screen.&nbsp; I have read a lot about this and tried just about everything. Unchecked "Auto arrange&nbsp;icons", "Align icons to grid" and "Allow themes to change desktop icons".&nbsp; Tried "Refresh".&nbsp; Nothing works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any *NEW* ideas!</p>

<h2>            created password reset disk on a USB thum drive 2.0 drive and want to &#39;move&#39; the psw file to another thumb drive &#40;USB 3.0&#41;</h2>
                    When I invoke tlhe 'wizard' a second time it senses there's already a password and that making a new one will make the first one unusable, and asks if I want to continue anyway. When I answer yes it returns to the window where I entered the (same) password
 but identified the other (USB 3.0) thumb drive where I want to create the file (while the both USB thumbdrives are in the ports simultaneously).&nbsp; This is an endless loop therefore that goeth nowhere. What's wrong and how do we end the endless loopiness?<br />

            I did, even after your reply. When I invoke the wizard thing, it greets me with the same pair of greetings in my mention yesterday creating an endless loop? This seems hopeless.&nbsp; So, I deleted the psw file to see what happened. I removed the thumb drive,
 reinserted it, invoked the wizard and voila, the infamous greeting appeared. Go figure :-(<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persist you can try to follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Copy the files from USB 2.0 to desktop first.<br />
2) unplug it.<br />
3) Now plug USB 3.0.<br />
4) Now copy the psw files from desktop to USB 3.0.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Try the steps and let us know if it works.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you</p>

            <p>I have done what you are trying to do [copied/moved password reset disks from one drive to another].&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You only use the wizard once for each user account.&nbsp; So, to tidy up your drives, delete all but the latest psw file now.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Once you have made the psw file, you can copy it wherever you want and it will work when you need it as long as it is in the root folder of an external drive and it is still called userkey.psw.&nbsp; As you already know, the only Password reset disk that will
 work is the latest one made for that user account [on the same&nbsp;PC &amp; the same&nbsp;OS].&nbsp; Within those constraints, during storage you can hide it, rename it, give it a different file extension, zip it, make multiple copies of it - anything, as long as you don't
 tamper with its contents or create a new one and as long as you are able to put it back in the root folder with the correct name when it comes to needing to use it.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can also continue to use the external drive for other purposes - having the psw file on it does not create any limitations.&nbsp;

            This may be the most naïve question you've ever gotten (read dumbest), but assuming I forgot my password whether it was changed from the one used when I created the psw or not. How would I use it to log on to the account. Also, since creating it, I renamed
 the original and only account 'Standard User' (keeping the original password) + I created a second account called 'Major User' (which is what the first and only account was called before calling it 'Standard User'). The newly created 'Major User' account has
 a password that is not the same as the one for the current 'Major User'

<p><span><font color="#000000"><span><span>3&nbsp; As a direct, although not
 as useful, response to your last post - Windows really dislikes accounts being renamed as it was not designed to cope with this.&nbsp; It is impossible to predict how it will respond to Password reset disks before or after the renaming.&nbsp; Personally, I would make
 a new Password reset disk for each renamed account and then use each one as a&nbsp;test.&nbsp;I think you should never try to rename the additional admin accounts I have recommended at para 2 above so that you can be confident that there is nothing to interfere with
 system recovery in the event of problems.</span></span></font></span></p>

</span></span></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><span><span>4&nbsp; As you are dealing with multiple
 user accounts, you might also wish to consider how to keep all the Password reset disks.&nbsp; There are probably other solutions but here's mine.&nbsp; I have a USB that lives behind the boiler.&nbsp; In it is a folder PSWs that has subfolders Admin1, Admin2, User1 &amp; so
 on to match all the user account names I have made.&nbsp; In each folder is the Password reset disk for that user account.&nbsp; In the root of this USB [to ensure it is ready for immediate use], I have another copy of the Password reset disk for Admin1.&nbsp; This scheme
 avoids having to keep multiple USBs with the different Password reset disks on them.&nbsp; If the problem affects Admin1 then I am ready to go; if the problem affects another account then I can log on with Admin1 and copy the appropriate Password reset disk into
 the USB's root folder.&nbsp; It's always copy rather than move so I don't accidentally overwrite &amp; lose one of them.</span></span></font></span></p>

            Thanks for your answer but unfortunately that is not what I am looking for.&nbsp; Neither "THIS COMPUTER" nor "MY PC" directly monitor network traffic.&nbsp; Also, neither of those two has an&nbsp; icon consisting of two computers, one behind the other.&nbsp; Once again,
 what I am looking for is the equivalent of the icon in Vista and W7 of two computers.&nbsp; Their "screens" are normally black but turn blue momentarily when packets are sent or received.

            <p>Ok I do got now what are you saying. to check that just open your task manager and click on APP HISTORY button .there you will find what you need.or just open up settings &gt;NETWORK AND INTERNET&gt;DATA USAGE. and yes in windows 10 you will not find two computers
 one behind the other which when packets are sent or recieived turn their screen colour to blue.</p>

 a number of apps, but they all want to pretend they're commercial level IT monitors that report on 47 network variables, and have an option to display the Dow Jones Industrial Average and keep you up to date on sports scores around the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I really want is a small indicator that says "Hey, I just sent a packet." and "Hey, I just received a packet."</p>

            <p><br />
Step By Step For Dummies:<br />
1) Create <strong>Temp folder</strong> (doesn't matter where, you can delete it when you're done.</p>
<p>2) Download the&nbsp;directx_Jun2010_redist.exe<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">into said temp folder</span></strong><br />
3) Run&nbsp;directx_Jun2010_redist.exe by double-clicking<br />
4) Box will pop up asking for a location in which to extract the install files (starting to get it?)<br />
5) Input "C:\..."<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> path to your <strong>Temp folder</strong></span> and confirm (If you cant find the pathway, open the
<strong>Temp folder</strong> and copy the address bar as input)<br />
6) After extraction is complete,&nbsp;<strong>Temp folder</strong> will be filled with around 157/158 archive files, two .dll files, the&nbsp;directx_Jun2010_redist.exe you just ran and ONE other .exe (should be something like "<strong>DXSETUP.exe</strong>") if you cant
 see it, click on the fille type column header to re-sort untill the .exe and .dll files are at the top (<strong>NO MORE THAN TWO CLICKS!!!</strong>)<br />
7)Run <strong>DXSETUP.exe</strong><br />
8)Follow step by step wizard to complete setup (won't ask for anything technical and if you fsck this part up you need to step away from the computer)<br />
Delete <strong>Temp Folder</strong> if desired (like I said, no baring on the product after installation is complete)<br />
8) Congrats, now go play that game you've been itching for ;)<br />
Hope this helps; even my most negligent and un-trustworthy users can do this now :)<br />
edit:<br />
really cant believe that Microsoft's left this unanswered, found it solved on Yahoo of all places when doing thorough search!!!</p>

    <title>Commit charge increases until no virtual memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gratefuldiver11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Commit charge increases until no virtual memory</h2>
                    <p>Beginning several days ago, I receive pop-ups that my virtual memory is low. Eventually, the system enters something that appears like safe mode and eventually freezes up. This occurs when only using browsers for email&nbsp;and another&nbsp;few websites, no gaming,
 no streaming...nothing the slightest bit intensive and nothing different from what I've done for years on the system. I used to be able to leave the system on for days or even weeks and never had to clear the cache. Now, the commit charge just keeps rising
 until it gets to 100 percent. Physical memory hovers between 35 and 60 percent. I've read several other Q&amp;As on this issue on this forum (thanks!), but all are at least 2 years old, so I don't want to search for old bugs. Here are more details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7, 4 GB RAM, ~100 GB of HD free.</p>
<p>Known recent changes to system: Adobe Flash and Java. I can't be sure if these updates were before or after the memory issue began. Firefox had an update but this was definitely after the problem started--updating did not resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Browsers are Chrome and Firefox, both always updated. It looked like that Chrome was using too much memory,&nbsp;and I read about memory leaks with Chrome, so I spent a day or two trying to fix this and eventually uninstalled Chrome. This hasn't solved the problem.</p>
<p>Finally I did a system restore to make sure that my playing with the paged memory settings didn't make things worse. The oldest system restore available was 01/27/15 ~0700. This didn't help either but the problem may have started before this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA,</p>

            <p>46 running processes isn't too bad and 15,000 handles is not out of the usual, on my machine with about the same number processes I usually have about 17,000 open handles so the problem is in one or some of the items that you disabled.&nbsp; I also see on your
 latest screenshot that your CPU charge is down to 0% from 12% in your earlier screenshot but the earlier 12% charge may just have been a spike when the snapshot was taken, if the CPU charge is always around 12% then something running in the background is labouring
 and taxing the CPU and it may be the cause of your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You only have 4GB of RAM,&nbsp; Windows&nbsp; 7 will run without problems on 4 GB but don't push your luck, if you run memory intensive applications you may want to add more RAM to the machine.&nbsp; Only you know how many running processes you need, just remember that
 when it comes to computer resources there is no free lunch, anything running will consume resources and it all adds up and contributes to performance degradation.&nbsp; Always keep an eye on your running processes, make it a habit to check how many are running
 when you boot the machine, the number of running processes at boot time should not change, if you notice a change in the usual number of processes at boot time investigate and find out which processes have been added to the start list and decide if you need
 it to run all the time.&nbsp; Just about every piece of software that you install no matter what its use will want to add itself to the startup list in one way or another, familiarize yourself with your list of running processes, find out what they are for and
 if you don't need them turn them off.&nbsp; It's easy to keep a handle on these processes if you keep a close eye on them, if your running processes go from 42 to 43 investigate immediately, don't wait until it goes from 43 to 64!&nbsp; By checking the list every time
 you boot the computer you will get to know the list intimately and you will quickly notice changes and see which ones are out of place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Knowing how many processes should be running when your machine boots is important troubleshooting information, when you notice changes in the behaviour of your machine extra running processes are the first thing to look for, if you boot your machine and
 notice an extra process running investigate, it may be a virus or other pest or a piece of legitimate software that you installed but that doesn't need to run for nothing in the background, if you only use an application once a month or once a day at the end
 of the day why have it running for nothing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should also keep an eye on scheduled tasks as this is a sneaky way for intrusive applications or&nbsp; unwanted pests to launch or run on your machine in an inconspicuous manner, if throughout your computing session you notice an unusual climb in running
 processes they may be started at certain times or by certain triggers via scheduled tasks.</p>

<p>While you will lose some functionality, you can safely untick each and every item under the Startup tab. You should do the same with the items under the Services tab, but only after you have ticked the box labelled "Hide Microsoft services".<br />

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>It's not only you - we got the same issue.&nbsp; For example, the .TXT icon went back to the default Notepad icon, even though we use another program for .TXT files, and we can't seem to change the icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened after the .NET Framework 4.5.2 update on a Win7 x64 desktop (we manually&nbsp;do any big update by itself, not in bunches, so we know which update causes an issue).&nbsp; We did the same update on a Win7 x64 laptop, and sure enough, resulted in the same
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it's not only the icon issue - we're discovering&nbsp;new issues as well.&nbsp; Another one is the Clipboard Manager sidebar gadget showing "initialization failed" error message, even after reboots and uninstall-reinstalls.&nbsp; Though more importantly, the OneDrive
 program now crashes immediately, also even after reboots and uninstall-reinstalls.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there seems&nbsp;something fundamental that changed with .NET Framework 4.5.2 that's breaking these processes.</p>

            <p>Slowly one by one 4 of our workstations with Windows automatic update&nbsp;are showing the same problem+.&nbsp; I think its from the update.&nbsp; After login, the icons on the desktop flash white, startup programs are hanging and not loading, desktop flashes again, and
 continues to struggle to load anything.&nbsp; Click on an icon and will light up, then go back to normal without opening.&nbsp; Restart the workstation a few times and we might get things connected and working for the day.&nbsp; Then the next morning, same deal.&nbsp; I rolled
 back my workstation to before the update and worked fine.&nbsp; That's why I'm thinking its the update.&nbsp; I also see a Windows download center orange arrow in the startup icon tray during the struggle.&nbsp; We can't be the only one experiencing this.</p>

            <p>Hi - As I mentioned in my first post here this arrived with my Jan updates but was unchecked so I assumed that meant my 7/64 system had deemed it unsuitable/irrelevant so I hid it and never installed it...I should do the same if the issues go away when it
 is uninstalled (btw I always install important updates unless there is a reason such as the above, not to do so...but I review all updates before installing rather than auto-updating, just so that I know what to look at more closely if there are any hiccups!)</p>
<p>Hope you get things back to normal...Ric</p>

<p>Hi Erick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corrupted file is one of the possible reasons as to why your game keeps crashing when you attempt to play it. Regarding with your questions, we're working for a fix on the game and expect that it will available in the upcoming game updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may perform the following solutions on your PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1</strong>. Click on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for the steps to perform a clean boot. This process will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 2.</strong> Reset the game from the <strong>Settings </strong>
menu. This process can help restore corrupted game installation files.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong><span>Windows key</span></strong> on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Select <strong><span>System</span></strong>, and then select
<strong><span>Apps &amp; features</span></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Find the game, and then click on <strong><span>Advanced</span></strong> options.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Click <strong><span>Reset</span></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 3</strong>. Remove temporary files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong><span>Windows key</span></strong> on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Select <strong><span>System</span></strong>, and then select
<strong><span>Storage</span></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Select <strong><span>This PC</span></strong> and click on
<strong><span>Temporary files</span></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Select <strong><span>Temporary files</span></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Click <strong><span>Remove files</span></strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</li><li>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you install all the critical and important Windows Updates on your PC by following the steps on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027667/windows-update-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested solutions above.</p>

<p>Hey Nexuz! First, can you verify that the region of your account is what you think it is. Please go to
<a href="https://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://billing.microsoft.com</a> and click on "Go to personal information". What region is displayed there? Does this region match the WLID you are creating?<br />
<br />
Also, you do need to have access to the current WLID in order to change your account to a new one. If you have problems with this process, please try contacting phone support (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a>)
 to see if they can assist you with this. Let me know how this all goes, thanks!</p>

<p>I cannot login to https://billing.microsoft.com/ because I get a message that says my Windows Live ID
<p>On the Xbox it does nowhere ask for login information to my current ID, it just states that the Live ID isn't valid (when connecting to Xbox LIVE) and takes me to the "Change Windows Live ID"-wizard.</p>
<p>When I go trough the "Change Windows Live ID"-wizard on the Xbox, at the end of the process, on the summary page (before trying to complete the transfer), it states "Country/region: Finland". So, I have created fresh account which I set to Country: Finland.
 Didn't work, same error. I also tried creating a brand new Live ID during the wizard using another email (not live), which should set the region to whatever is necessary for it to work. Didn't work, same error. I explained all this in the first post.</p>

<h2>            How to undo a change in regedit</h2>
                    Yesterday I made a tiny change in regedit and I didn't make a backup.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I was wondering if there is a easy way to undo this small change without having to reset/restore/refresh my PC</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it's any help, the thing I changed was</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and I changed the data value thing of "Applnit_DLLs"</div>
                </div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The only 'undo' feature is having a backup of your registry and then importing it. Other than that, the only thing left to try before a restore would be to manually go ahead and recreate the key(s) by setting whatever it was to exactly what it was before.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            <p>Restore is probably the safest, fastest, and easiest solution.&nbsp; It only takes a couple of minutes, it won't touch your files, and you can always "undo" the restore if you don't like it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Be careful with the other options, because <em>reset</em>&nbsp; and <em>refresh</em> are destructive types of options: using them will mean you have to reinstall your apps or maybe even lose your files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I would suggest using Restore first.</p>

<h2>            Sf-930 NOT RECOGNIZED IN CONTROL PANEL&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Recently I purchased the microphone 'SF-930' which has a wire that fits into a 3.5mm jack, which fits in my speaker jack (I have a HP laptop with no microphone Jack but I don't know if that makes a difference). When I plug it in however it is not recognized.
 I checked the control panel to see how to work it out but the only options there is my built in mic. (Realtek High Definition Audio Microphone)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried <strong>almost</strong> everything my new mic still isn't recognized. Any advice?</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p>

            You need to check with HP regarding the capabilities of your computer.&nbsp; You can't plug a microphone (input) into a speaker jack (output) and expect it to work.

    <title>How do I turn off the Mouse pad when an external mouse is detected in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tljones  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off the Mouse pad when an external mouse is detected in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I've got a Dell Inspiron 1525 running Windows 7 (recently updated from Windows Vista). &nbsp;In vista, I had an option to automatically disable the touch pad mouse when an external mouse was detected. &nbsp;Since I updated to Windows 7, I've got no option.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note, my main gripe is that, when I'm typing, I don't want to have to worry about touching the pad and relocating my cursor to some other part of the document. &nbsp;If there is some other way to get around it, other than the auto disable, I'll be good to go
 with that. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If this is a duplicate question, please let me know where to go for the answer. &nbsp;I located similar questions for Vista and XP but none for 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<p>
</p><p>HI, I am using a Compaq Presario CQ61 Notebook. It had Windows 7 (32bit) OS which worked well, since upgrading to Windows10 I have run into a problem with my DVD disc drive!! It will not play any sort of media, although it is trying to boot. In 'Device Manager'
 it says it is a cd-rom with the yellow triangle. In 'File Explorer' it is showing D:/ present, but with a ? across it! I have tried Updating driver, Uninstalling driver in device manager with no success. Microsoft Fixit comes up with the message 'OS not supported
 by Microsoft&nbsp;at this time!!!!!! Any suggestions please!</p>

            <p>Hi Ray,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to play any sort of media after upgrading to Windows 10 and I will be happy to answer your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows DVD Player app is available free for a limited time for people upgrading to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> from Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium, Windows&nbsp;7 Professional, Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate,
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> with Windows Media Center. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that Windows Media Center isn't included in <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> and will be removed when you upgrade to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>. After the upgrade completes, Windows DVD Player will download automatically to your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be eligible for the free DVD Player app, you must upgrade your Windows&nbsp;7, <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> PC rather than perform a clean installation. If you’re running an edition of Windows&nbsp;7 or
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span> that doesn’t include Media Center and you upgrade to <span>
Windows&nbsp;10</span>, go to Windows Store to buy Windows DVD Player or another app that plays DVDs. Provided your PC has an optical disc drive, Windows DVD Player will play DVD movies (but not Blu‑ray Discs).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more info, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=617135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Also, I would request&nbsp;you to visit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest DVD driver available for the same computer model that you have.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in case the latest driver is not available, install the current driver in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.&nbsp;Right click the driver installation file and select
<strong>Properties</strong> then tap or click the <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b.&nbsp;Place a check in the <strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for:
</strong>box. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c.&nbsp;Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">d.&nbsp;Try installing the driver and check.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan, thank you for your reply.&nbsp;With regards to the&nbsp;Windows DVD Player app, would it warn me that the free period is over and direct me to the app store to make a purchase? Mine is opening normally and asking me for a DVD and on inserting one the
 drive&nbsp;starts searching, but the screen does not change! By the way I did upgrade from Windows 7 having been asked by Microsoft if I wanted to 'upgrade for free'</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows DVD Player as&nbsp;run out of its free&nbsp;period, surely this&nbsp;would not stop me loading other software onto my laptop via my drive? Which makes me think it is a driver problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking in Device Manager it says that Microsoft supplied the DVDRAM GT30L driver, where on your site do I find it? As&nbsp; I've &nbsp;hunted high and low for it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your help would is appreciated</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Niranjan, I have tried both of your suggestions several times now, to no avail! HP site just directs me to your site as it is involving Windows10... I tried a couple of 3rd party driver sites and their scans seem to indicate that there is no problem with
 my drivers!!! Is it possible that my Compaq Presario CQ61 just doesn't like Windows 10??? Is it too old a machine? Can I revert back to my original Windows as I have been using W10 for some time now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With my limited knowledge, I'm in a quandary to know what to do as I need to load some software reasonably urgently.....</p>

<h2>            Unable to install update KB955839 - error code&#58; 80070490   &#38; vista servicepack 2</h2>
                    I have vista ultimate and have been unable to install KB955839 for sometime now I can install every other update except KB955839.<br />
Without KB955839 installed I am not offered Servicepack 2 as an update in windows update, however when I hide it I am offered servicepack 2 as a update.<br />
Install however fails everytime.<br />
I have tried both manual install and windows update install for both updates to no avail.<br />
Servicepack 2 update seems to be related to KB955839 install being successful <br />
I have tried most of the fixes in this forum<br />

<h2>            Thunderbird has suddenly stopped working with &#34;hotmail&#34; IMAP</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>Yesterday (17 November 2016) my perfectly functioning Hotmail IMap functionality in Thunderbird stopped working saying the Password is incorrect, it has been working for about 10 years prior to yesterday, nothing changed at my end. My laptop with thunderbird
 and my home computer with thunderbird both have stopped working, so its not a settings issue here, I am using the following settings:-</p>
<p>IMAP</p>
<p>imap-mail.outlook.com - 993 - SSL/TLS - Full Email address - Normal Password</p>
<p>SMTP</p>
<p>smtp-mail.outlook.com - 587 - STARTTLS - Full Email Address - Normal Password</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can log into my account on the internet no problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having read on the internet it could be due to 2 step authentication, I checked, it was turned off, and to be sure, I set it up and then turned it off to be sure it wasnt a glitch</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled Thunderbird and reinstalled it, I deleted my hotmail account and tried to recreate it, all to no avail, thunderbird refuses to connect, any help gratefully recieved</p>
<p />

            <p>I have exactly the same problem as of a couple days or so, right down to seeing a successful login attempt in my recent activity online.&nbsp; I have tried disabling and re-enabling pop on my online account in case that will reset it, 2 step verification has
 not been enabled and hasnt re-enabled itself, I've even tried changing my password. I tried deleting my account from Thunderbird entirely along with the local cached folders, no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know its not a problem with my machine, the internet or Thunderbird, becasue my wifes hotmail account is also in there right next to mine and is still working fine!</p>

            <p>Having the same issue.&nbsp; Trying to isolate the issue, I have found the following, that proves it is realted to outlook/hotmail server issues and not the email client:</p>
<ol>
<li>Switched from POP to IMAP:&nbsp; Not resolved.</li><li>Downloaded a couple of other mail clients and tried POP and IMAP settings.&nbsp; Same issue, not resolved</li><li>Tried Windows 10 Mail.&nbsp; When I configured the email account manually (as Other Account type on the list) and added IMAP/SMTP server details in manually it did not recognise the account and I had the same issues.</li><li>When I then added the email account as an Outlook account it all magically works.&nbsp; But if you then try to get to see what exact settings the account is using, none of the menu options show it.</li><li>My Samsung Tablet also cannot access the account.</li></ol>
<p>So in short it seems Microsoft has changed the server settings and it's anybody's guess what the new ones are...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating, expecially as MS chat support is useless, too.</p>

            <p>I'm glad it's not just me screwing something up. Both Thunderbird and my Mail client on my phone refuse to sync with my primary Hotmail account. Hotmail still has the same imap server settings on the settings page online, too.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weird thing is, I have a secondary Hotmail account with the exact same imap settings and it sync's perfectly.

            <p>I suddenly have the same problem on just ONE of my Hotmail accounts in Thunderbird, while others are still working fine.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I use my Thunderbird for multiple email accounts via IMAP (not POP).&nbsp; I actually have three hotmail.com accounts, one live.co.uk account and one live.com account configured under Thunderbird and all the others work fine!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a common problem which has only recently occurred and appears to be something wrong that Microsoft have done.&nbsp; I have seen stated elsewhere that Outlook.com data is in the process of being migrated to Office365 servers and I wonder if this
 is the root cause, with something on the new servers not set up correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a thread on the MozillaZine Thunderbird forums about the issue too (which I have contributed to):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=39&amp;t=3025360&amp;sid=e37ddd648bc18ea6137d94ee7aa28458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Connection failed</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be pleased to hear anything definitive from Microsoft, if only to acknowledge that they are aware that the problem exists and they are attempting to resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had Hotmail accounts way before Microsoft bought them out and just want them to keep working for email and do not care about two step verification, office integration, using for login on Windows 10 or Skype.&nbsp; Please just keep my email working!</p>

            <p>Found the following in another thread, it worked for me! Its a workaround until Microsoft sort this problem out properly</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is only for hotmail.com accounts, but not for outlook.com ones.<br />
<br />
Log on your hotmail account on the Web<br />
Click on the top right on the little icon or image representing you, and in the appearing menu, click on View account<br />
A new browser tab/window opens .. inside it, click on "Your info"<br />
Then click on "Manage how you sign in to Microsoft"<br />
In there, you see a list of accounts aliases .. -&gt; only 1 for me, my hotmail.com one, set as Primary<br />
Click on "Add email"<br />
Then make sure the radio button "Create a new email address and add it as an alias" is selected, and in the box below type in a new &lt;account&gt;@outlook.com you want to create.<br />
In my case, my hotmail account name was not free, so I used the a different account name @outlook.com.<br />
Click on the "Add alias" button<br />
Now go back to Thunderbird, and either modify your account to log with your new alias in outlook.com, or create a new account, and use the same password as your hotmail account .. and all is good !!<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Well the method outlined by Paul2463 above did work for Thunderbird!&nbsp; Someone else proposed something similar on the MozillaZine forum and I followed that and got things working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did something VERY stupid, so let this be a warning to others.&nbsp; My hotmail email had also stopped working on my iPad too, so I decided to go a bit further with the Microsoft account to see if that would resolve the issue properly.&nbsp; Logging back into
 my Microsoft account using my hotmail.com email and password, I made my new outlook.com email alias to be the primary alias, then deleted my hotmail.com alias (please do not do as I did!).&nbsp; When I tried to add the hotmail.com email address back as an alias,
 then it came back with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This email is part of a reserved domain. Please enter a different email address</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I was completely stuffed!&nbsp; I opened up a support case with Microsoft and after waiting for a long time, managed to chat with a Microsoft agent.&nbsp; The outcome of the chat was that there was no method available to undo the action, which means
 that my Hotmail email is now left inactive and unable to receive emails.&nbsp; The agent could only suggest trying to recreate the Hotmail email address after 365 days, which "should" work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a broken Hotmail email address which nobody can send email too.&nbsp; Fortunately, I do have access to my past emails via the outlook.com email address, but I need to use the new address for my Windows 10 account and a Windows phone.&nbsp; I will switch
 to using a gmail address for my main email now and will have to change lots of sites (that I can remember) to use that address, as well as let all my address book know to use it too.</p>

<p>I am truly sorry to hear about the loss of your Hotmail account, but thanks for putting the information here for others to learn from your mistake</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My above information was taken directly from the Mozillzine forum as it did work for me and hopefully will work for others, until Microsoft manage to pull their collective finger out and solve this problem properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if you are in this boat, try the above mentioned method to at least get your account working again, bearing in mind what Richard wrote about not deleting the Hotmail account alias or you will lose you Hotmail account completely.</p>

    <title>What is Microsoft up to in Updating SKYPE every single week&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tatoopierced  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is Microsoft up to in Updating SKYPE every single week&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The ONLY reason why Skype could POSSIBLY<strong> need to update every week</strong>... well one of TWO reasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason one... they are <strong>spying</strong> on us for the US Dept of Defense and they return collected data every week to the NSA or CIA or something. And there is too much data to do it quarterly... or the govt wants the info weekly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason two... There is an inherent <strong>security problem</strong> with skype, and the only way to stay ahead of the online hackers is to change up coding and or security measures often. Like with windows. If they leave it alone, hackers can figure out
 how to inject viruses. Same reason that real viruses keep mutating... to make the drugs ineffective against them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reminds me of Windows updating... although more often. An unfinished product that they seem to have to keep playing with until they get it wrong. For instance, I notice now, for the first time ever, when I click on a contact I want to call... the first time
 it resets to the top of the list again. Then I have to find it again and click again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also... there is no<strong> RADIO BUTTON</strong> feel to it. things weakly fade in and out if you get near the tiny little grey ovals or whatever. You can't just do one button things. Makes me think a committee of women designed the ergonomics and controls
 of this thing. The service works well... its just such a poorly thought out, clunky control mechanism.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would a control interface that simulated real telephones from the 1980s really be all that bad? A
<strong>permanent push button dial pad</strong> displayed for instant dialing, a <strong>
hang up button,</strong> a <strong>dial tone button</strong> to ready for dialing. Really... thats all I need. Plus the contact directory. And defaulting TO the contact directory everytime would be sweet. My ideal Skype.&nbsp; Maybe some easily accessible equalization...
 bass / midrange / treble tweeking. Perhaps some reverb.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also... it resets after every call to the CHAT option columns... and I never use those. It would be much better if it defaulted after a call to the CONTACTS list, and if there were color, large, simulated push buttons there to go to where you wanted to,
 hang up, or to make a call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about calls that can be purposely listened into? You know... people who like to call other people and be overheard. They can allow people at the push of a button to hear them... random skype people... but NOT talk to them or interact with them. Kind
 of a pseudo public chat... just thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

Creating a new user account will not only re-register&nbsp;<em>Start Menu</em>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<em>Store</em>&nbsp;and all other apps as well. Hence if your&nbsp;<em>Start Menu</em>&nbsp;is malfunctioned due to some other feature, creation of new user account will
 be able to solve this.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
Also, if you’ve switched to&nbsp;<em>Microsoft account</em>, try switching back to<em>&nbsp;local account</em>&nbsp;and vice versa, see if this contributes to solve the problem.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">
One more suggestion I want to add here is to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-enable-start-screen-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">enable
 Start Screen</a></span></span>. Since the error looks confined to&nbsp;<em>Start Menu</em>,&nbsp;<em>Start Screen</em>&nbsp;should work normally then. So try enabling&nbsp;<em>Start Screen</em>&nbsp;and revert back, check the status of issue.</p>
