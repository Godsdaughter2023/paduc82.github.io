    <title>Dual Monitors in Windows 7 va Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davejyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual Monitors in Windows 7 va Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have 2 monitors hooked up to my PC.&nbsp; I am using "Themes" with a custom-designed theme of my own.&nbsp;&nbsp; This theme changes the background picture daily, and uses pictures from a file I select on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, the background picture was the same on both monitors (which I want).&nbsp; However with Windows 10, each monitor shows a different background, and they change independently of each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to make it like it was when I had Windows 7, however I can't see anywhere where I can do this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am&nbsp; sure it will turn out to be a simple thing, but since things have been "moved around" in WIN10, it's time-consuming to find them.</p>

<p>Nope - Span will stretch an image across both monitors, but it distorted and oversized for the screens, and tile does just that - creates tiles of the picture, but the pictures don't fit the screens.&nbsp; With it set on "fit", the pictures are scaled to the
 screens, but the image is different in each screen (in WIN7, they were the same).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how it looks now:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/97649a07-c49b-4dd9-b1e9-b85be7967bc6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is tile:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37c25a8e-e927-406d-88c7-dc8fa3b114d8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is span:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4e00fda-ca60-4066-877b-deddda4b0c9c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And this is what I would like to have:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a26cb0d6-8605-4425-83a4-356a03898445" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>(I am never sure I describe things right - and pictures are worth a thousand words - - - so&nbsp;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Thanks to&nbsp;J. Scott Campbell for the artwork)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no way to do this, no biggie, but I like having the backgrounds the same on all of my monitors, if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            No, if you are in Slideshow mode there's no perfect way currently to have it show at two different resolutions across both monitors.&nbsp; That *will* work great in single picture mode, but in general with slideshow mode it shows one different image per monitor.

    <title>Managing disk space when backing up on a samba share - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prezzio  say:</h3>
<h2>            Managing disk space when backing up on a samba share</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>in the past I noticed some issue on Windows 7 when backing up on a samba share: apparently it wasn't able to correctly manage the network disk space so everytime I got a full backup instead of differential/incremental. This was almost annoying because after
 a while the samba share went completely full and I had to manually remove the oldest ones to save space.</p>
<p>Do you know if File History (Windows 8.1 and Windows 10) has the same problem? And what about to backup on a NetApp storage?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you understand that programs which are not developed by Microsoft and if there are issues using them, you can contact the manufacturer of the same for the best possible support.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><span><span><em>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third
 Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start using File History to back up your files, you need to first select where your backups are saved. You can select an externally connected drive, such as a USB drive, or you can save to a drive on a network. There are other choices, but these
 two provide the best options to help protect your files against a crash or other PC problems. For more info about using File History, see

</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History only backs up copies of files that are in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the
<span>OneDrive</span> files available offline on your PC. If you have files or folders elsewhere that you want backed up, you can add them to one of these folders.

<p>If you're going to use a new external drive, connect it to your PC. If you see a notification asking if you want to configure the drive for File History, tap or click it, and then turn on File History on the screen the appears.</p>
<p>Otherwise, follow these steps to choose either a network drive or an external drive that’s already connected to your PC.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <span>Search</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click
<span>Search</span>.)</span> </p>
</li><li>
<p>Enter <span>File History settings</span> in the search box, and then tap or click

<p>Tap or click <span>Select a drive</span>, and choose the network or external drive you want to use.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Turn on <span>File History</span>.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the network drive you want isn’t in the list of available drives, tap or click
<strong><span>Show all network locations</span></strong>. If the drive you want isn’t listed there either, open File History in Control Panel, tap or click
<strong><span>Add a network location</span></strong>, and follow the instructions on the screen.</p>

    <title>Imap has 4 sent folders. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Imap has 4 sent folders.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8 and use Windows Live 2012 and have it set up with IMAP.&nbsp; After setting up the account, I was presented with four Sent Folders, three Deleted Folders and three Junk folders.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted Folders are named Deleted, Deleted Messages and Deleted Items.&nbsp; Sent Folders are named Sent, Sent Items, Sent Messages and SentMail (no space between words).&nbsp; Junk Folders are named Junk, Junk E-mail and Junk Mail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted, Sent and Junk mail are not duplicated and sent to all folders.&nbsp; They are sent to one of the other.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to find a sent or deleted email, it is a nightmare.&nbsp; The Sent Items/messages/sentmail&nbsp;folders tells date/subject/from (me, of course)&nbsp;but not&nbsp;the receipient which makes it nearly impossible to search for a sent email.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an iphone and the same folders are also on my phone.&nbsp; Another thing I find strange is that I have a folder in my Windows Live that is named Notes.&nbsp; I did&nbsp; not set up this folder, it just appeared when I created the IMAP account.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Notes in this
 folder are the exact same as the notes I created in my iPhone (which has nothing to do with email) as reminders to myself.&nbsp; I don't have a problem with them being in my Windows Live but wonder why and how this folder was put there.&nbsp; It all is just so strange.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help you may be able to give to me.&nbsp; (I put this post under Sending and Receiving Email because there was no other selection that described my question.)</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I have the same problem but not as bad as you do.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have Windows 7 and use Windows Live 2012 and have it set up with IMAP. When I send e-mail it saves it in a folder called "Sent Items". On the left side
 I have Charter (thetaz00) with folders called Inbox, Drafts, Sent Items, </span>
 Trash. Right below that I have Outbox with no folders. Below that I have Storage folders with folders Drafts, Sent items and Deleted items. Don't know why they would have two different sent folders and two different junk folders with different names. To me
 if I'm sending mail it should go in a folder called Sent Mail.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I just keep playing around and finally figured out how to get sent mail to go to the folder I want it to go in which is Sent Mail. I'll try and do my best to talk you through it. I have Windows 7 but it is still Windows Live Mail 2012. Of course go to Windows
 Live Mail. Then under home to the left side you should see your carrier and your default account. Mine says Charter and (thetaz00). Right click that and go to the popup at the bottom and click properties. You will get another popup with General, Servers, Security,
 Advanced and IMAP. Click on IMAP and you should see Folders and Special Folders. Under Special Folders you will see Store special folders on IMAP server. Under mine I see &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sent Items path: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sent Items</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Drafts path: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Drafts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted Items path: &nbsp; &nbsp; Deleted Items</p>
<p>
</p><p>Junk path: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Junk E-mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next to Sent Items path: it says Sent Items. I just changed Sent Items to Sent Mail (with a space). I clicked apply and OK. You will get another popup that says "You have made some changes that may affect your list of folders. Would you like to refresh your
 folder list? Click Yes. I then created a new e-mail and sent it to myself. Under subject I just put Test and in the header Test again. I then hit send. In a few seconds I received the e-mail in my Inbox. Now this took a little longer about a minute but I checked
 my Sent Mail folder and a copy of the E-mail was in there and not in my Sent Items folder. Under my IMAP properties I only have these 4 folders showing with the new location Sent Mail which I changed from&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sent
 Items.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sent Items path: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sent Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drafts path: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drafts</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleted Items path: &nbsp; &nbsp;Deleted Items</p>
<p>
</p><p>Junk path: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Junk E-mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>and where the information should go. You can go back to the left side and delete and folders you don't want especially the duplicate folders. The only ones you cannot delete are the ones you have assigned under your IMAP properties. Two other folders you
 cannot delete are your your Inbox folder or your Trash folder. I just deleted the extra Sent folder and the extra Junk folder. Now it looks clean with only six folders that you only need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Inbox</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm surprised that Microsoft didn't start support .BPG format for photos. It has a much better compression than JPG and support transparency like PNG. It can also be animate like GIF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the image format that should be here by default.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - install and uninstall issues &#40;error 50 etc.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the latest version of Windows 10. I'm reasonably technically competent but not down to registry entry editing type stuff...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago I was upgrading some software (Final Draft 10 as it happens, but probably not relevant) and it failed to install correctly and just hung. Ever since I rebooted my laptop I am having problems installing and uninstalling programs. I get Error
 50 messages and various installers get so far and then crash out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple way of refreshing the install/uninstall mechanism or a specific troubleshooter app available??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Alan.</p>

    <title>Xbox party chat, Issues with connecting to certain people. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lobz3000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox party chat, Issues with connecting to certain people.</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem when trying to join or invite certain friends into a party chat. When I send or receive an invite with this particular friend I will be prompted that he is trying to connect for a long period of time before eventually it will say he is disconnected
 and I have an error code saying I have a problem with my network settings. The same goes for him when he sends me an invite. We both hard reset our Xbox and routers and there has been times where it would eventually let us connect and chat as normal. It's
 rare but it can work however after hours of trying it's not worth the effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now just to help understand my situation a little better.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>This has just recently started happening. We have been able to chat with no problems for 14 years.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When trying to chat in-game he can hear me fine but his chat breaks up constantly to the point of it being uncomprehensive.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We both have OPEN nat types.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We both have new headsets.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We both have no problems chatting with other people but if were both in a party with others we CANNOT communicate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We both have relatively new routers ( about a year or so old ) and they are both Xbox live compatible. We have been able to chat with our current network setup in the past.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>We both have the same ISP and both have the same internet package. 300Mbps</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WE HAVE UNPLUGGED BOTH THE XBOX AND ROUTER. That is not going to fix this problem.</strong></p>
<p>We have been fighting this issue for months and cannot get any help from anywhere. We searched the internet, called customer support, and discussed the problem with anyone who will listen and nothing has worked. Sorry for the giant post but I needed to be
 as detailed as I could. Thank you so much for any help.</p>

            Unfortunately we have tried this and many variations of this such as hard reset along with unplugging the xbox completely for 5 minutes or longer while we rebooted the routers, we've tried turning off the xbox from the controller, tried going to offline
 mode in the settings and turning it back on after a few minutes. Just a few examples. I'm at a loss of ideas now. I appreciate any replies regarding this.&nbsp;

 will cross this thread and show me a solution. Thanks again to anyone who replies. I appreciate y'alls time.

<p>Hi Lobz, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to recommend trying to join the party again then quitting or leaving the party. Others have had similar issues and this seemed to help. It seemed like it was a glitch. Also, if it shows another party that the profile had joined, then try to
 leave that party as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears the steps completed would have been from this link: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/troubleshoot-parties" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
You can't switch to party chat on Xbox One</a></p>

            I read the article and I understand it, but my question is why should I have to deal with the dialogue box every time that I turn on my laptop?&nbsp; Is there anything that I can do to resolve the issue that brings up the dialogue box.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I apologies for the delay in response. I will certainly help you with this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to change the UAC (User Account Control) settings to Never Notify (Not Recommended) and check if it solves the issue. To do so kindly follow the below given steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key </strong>and type <strong>UAC</strong> in Search and hit enter.</li><li>Drag and set the bar to Never Notify (Not recommended).</li><li>Click OK and check if issue persist.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Post back with updated issue details for further help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Please&nbsp;start by answering my original question: What service pack did you rebuild the system at?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then please tell me what service pack you are currently at?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not at SP3, what happened when you tried to get there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally the 404 is almost certainly accompanied by a hex code (format 0xhhhhhhhh, where h is any hex digit, 0-9 and A-F), please look for it and let us know what it is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, the "cures" given by some people do not&nbsp;ring true to me,&nbsp;so I am forced to the conclusion that this really is a temporary issue that most times will go away by itself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having said that, here are some general things that may also assist...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make sure that the time and date are correct for your time zone...</p>
<ul>
<li>Right click the clock at the bottom right of your screen</li><li>Click Ajust Date/Time</li><li>Click the Time Zone tab and make sure that the correct time zone is selected in the dropdown</li><li>Click Apply if you changed the time zone</li><li>Click the Internet Time tab and click Update Now</li><li>Quite often the synchronization fails so try again if it does, if it fails repeatedly try a different time server in the dropdown.</li></ul>
<p>2. Reset windows Update components...</p>

<p>...and run it to get to IE8. Ignore any suggestions by Microsoft to get a later version, IE8 is as good as it gets for XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then try fixit again but don't expect too much, fixits do not have a good reputation on this forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you read the bit that says step 4 should be skipped if this is the first attempt to reset components?</p>
<p>So you typed this</p>
<p><span><strong>Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore *.bak</strong></span></p>
<p><span>...</span>and got an error message? What was the message? Are you sure the spelling was correct?</p>

            Hello BobSelff,
<br />
<br />Are you insider or not?
<br />
<br />At this moment this build is no longer available for updating and we do not have much information about it. This was returned back to developers for further investigation and fixing. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you make copies of your data (it is important step to be sure that your data is saved) and wait for a new updates and fixes.
<br />
<br />Now we do not know when these updates would be available, we are waiting for official announcement.
<br />
<br />If the build works not very good you can always to reinstall previous one. On official website you can find 1803 ISO. 
<br />
<br />But with yous issue I would better recommend just wait a bit and later take some actions.       
        </p>

<p>Mark,</p>
<p>I am not an insider (sorry) but what is odd, is that it works on some units but not on others. Both my units (different hardware) have the same build. I am glad (don't tell her) it is her unit and not mine.</p>
<p>Thanks for the input, I will have to wait.</p>
<p>

<p>Kapil,</p>
<p>Thank you for your input. I have tried your solution pertaining to re-registering, but it did not correct the issue. The actual issue is anything I change in the start menu gets removed when I log off or reboot.</p>

<li>reregister start menu</li><li>run sfc (no errors found)</li><li>local user</li><li>change time zone</li><li>update</li><li>reinstall display drivers</li></ol>

</p><p>This is a brand new machine from Dell.&nbsp; Considering this is a brand-new machine is it easy to reinstall windows?&nbsp; Would this be a potential fix?</p>

<p>Dominic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read the responses from the individuals above, I would not make that assumption. It appears to be a hit and miss on each individual unit. I have 2 units both running the same version of windows 10 Pro and the same build, but one is working as it should
 and the other has the issue I described above. As you know, none of the fixes stated appear to correct the issue.
</p>
<p>As Mark stated above, we just have to wait until MS decides to correct the problem, or maybe revert to an earlier build.</p>

    <title>How can I get my computer to download pictures from my iPhone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duboisfamily  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get my computer to download pictures from my iPhone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Help!&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have an iPhone 5 and a Dell PC (desktop) which had Windows 7, I think. When I first got the iPhone it downloaded pictures just fine! But now, it barely acknowledges that the iPhone is even connected. I've cleared all the text and email photos from the
 phone, I've checked my PC's autoplay settings and set them to 'ask me first' when the iPhone is plugged in, I've unlocked the phone with the pass code, I've done everything I can the PC still refuses to believe that the iPhone has photos on it. In Printers
 and Devices it has the iPhone as 'unspecified' and when I right click on is the only three options are: Create shortcut, Troubleshoot, and Properties, in that order. &nbsp;Files doesn't recognize that anything is plugged in via the USBs. For a while we thought
 it may have been because we didn't have enough room to download the ever-accumulating load of pics that a family seems to need to take. So we bought another hardrive and installed that. Still nothing. We are getting a bit desperate. There are quite a few pictures
 needing to be downloaded. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Do you hear the USB "device detected" sound when you connect the iPhone?</p>

</p><p>Does the AutoPlay window open when you connect the iPhone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does iTunes start up when you connect the iPhone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened to your computer shortly before this stopped working (power failure, malware attack, used a system tune up/registry cleaner, etc.)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by "the PC still refuses to believe that the iPhone has photos on it"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect the iPhone, does it show up when you click the Start Orb and select "Computer"?&nbsp; It should show as a "Portable Device" or possibly a "Digital Camera" --</p>

</p><p>It's normal for an iPhone to show as an "unspecified device" in Devices and Printers, but there should also be an Apple Mobile Device USB driver icon.&nbsp; Do you have this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>My guess is that the Apple Mobile Device USB driver (or one of the other iPhone supporting programs) has become corrupted.&nbsp; I suggest that you completely uninstall iTunes and its related software and then reinstall.&nbsp; Doing this should leave your music and
 photos intact, but it's always prudent to make a backup.</p>

<h2>            Technet Library Download&#47;Archive</h2>
                    I would like to archive&nbsp;some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;information&nbsp;relevant to Windows XP.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As I understand it the support is done, or&nbsp;will&nbsp;be soon enough, and would like&nbsp;their&nbsp;references available to archive permanently, similar in their current structure.<br />
<br />
Is their an archive already available? or perhaps a web&nbsp;crawler&nbsp;to find and download all relevant pages/links?<br />
<br />
If this has already been done, and is available that would be great.<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any information.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>..One other question, how large is the data that I am asking about?&nbsp;Terabyte&nbsp;drives are fairly cheap.. So several hundred gigabytes, isn't an issue. Several Tb could be. :)</div>

<div>I had much for Windows 98 SE, and still have 1 computer that uses it. The cheapest way, outside of upgrading several thousands of dollars worth of old hardware and software that still works. Still bugged by that, but I have started to purchase some newer

<h2>            BitDefender Problem &#92; Safe Mode Doesn&#39;t work right &#92; Search doesn&#39;t work at all</h2>
                    <p>Let me start by saying that this is a complicated problem, and I don’t exactly know which parts go in which forum. I may duplicate this and post it in other forums as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 10 on a Lenovo G700 laptop.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>This morning, I’d just run <em>chkdsk
</em><span>on my system. It finally finished, and I tried to log into Safe Mode to delete a stubborn file. When I got to the screen where I can Choose “advanced options,” an error box popped up and told me that “BitDefender threat
 detection” had a problem. I don’t have BitDefender installed, so I was puzzled by the message. I tried logging in several times, and finally succeeded.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>I had been booting up in “Safe Mode” (F4). I tried booting up in “Safe Mode with networking” (F5), but the system did not connect to the
</span><span>WI-fi.</span><span> (It connects normally on a regular bootup.)
</span><span>The BitDefender box also showed up again; it doesn’t appear on a normal bootup, but only when I try “Safe Mode” and similar settings</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>I typed “Control Panel” into the search box. Search/Cortana usually displays possible search items as I Type; this time, nothing came up—the box remained empty. When I pressed
</span><span>Enter, nothing happened. I ran the Search Troubleshooter, but there was no change in behavior.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>As you can see, this is a complicated set of problems, and I have no idea how, or even if, they are related. I have not updated my system since 6/14/17, although several of my apps
 have been updated. </span><span>Thank you in advance for any help you can give (including telling me where this needs to be posted).</span></p>

<p>The first thing I would ask is if you ever had BitDefender installed. (even as a trial as part of the Lenovo SW) If you think you had or even if you are not sure I would try running their removal tool.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/uninstall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bitdefender.com/uninstall/</a></p>
<p>I'm not sure about why Safe Mode with networking wouldn't work or why a Search doesn't bring up Control Panel. Which version/build of Windows 10 do you have.?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I just tried restarting in Safe Mode (with networking) myself selecting 5 in the list (not F5) and it works as expected. I'm running version 1607.</p>

<p>Apart from a Reset (which will remove all your programs/apps, but give you the option to keep personal files) you can perform an inplace upgrade.</p>
<p>As you have version 1703 you can use the latest ISO from the Media Creation Tool.</p>

<p>Nielpzz, sorry for the delay--things took longer (a<strong> lot</strong> longer) than anticipated. First after several attempts (and having to go through PowerShell), I got the ISO file I downloaded (BTW, should I hang on to the ISO file?) mounted and started
 the procedure. It took, as you probably guessed, several hours. Next, I ran <strong>
chkdsk</strong> (which took, believe it or not, seven hours. here are my reults, organized by Problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>(BitDefender) When I booted up after the procedure, I rebooted (before I ran <strong>
chkdsk</strong>) and saw no evidence of BitDefender. I then rebooted to check Safe Mode with Networking, and as the old song goes, "the cat came back"--the Bitdefender box reappeared
<strong>after</strong> I selected SMWN. It looks like the box won't be coming at everyr boot--just those into SM.</li><li>(SMWN)The system still doesn't connect to the network in SMWN--it says "Connections are available," but it won't let me select one. I don't know what the problem is.</li><li>(Start menu/ search box) I can now bring up the (left-click) Start menu, and the search box works normally.</li></ol>
<p>Well, it looks like I'm "one (or one and a half) of three: Safe mode still doesn't work, the Bitdefender box shows up occasionally, and th Start menu ans Search box work normally. The SMWN problem still bothers me, though.</p>

<p>It quite possibly takes hours to run the in-place upgrade. It's the same as installing windows.</p>
<p>Yes you should keep the ISO. You can burn that to DVD. (making a windows install boot DVD) Or you could create a boot USB, but you will need a program like Rufus to create your boot flash drive.
<a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.akeo.ie/</a>&nbsp;I'm only giving you this because I have read on here others give this as a good program to create a boot USB. Myself I never got my PC to boot using the USB created
 with Rufus, but I used windows commands. I used Method 4</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm out of ideas now for why your device continues to load SMWN but will not connect and shows BitDefender.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>The only other checks I know of are system file checks. (but I would have thought these would be fixed after the in-place upgrade)</p>
<div>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>Run system file checker (SFC) and see if it helps. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not help, use method 2.</div>

<p>Just to be sure it is working make sure your PC can boot using the disc. When you say you copied the ISO you need to burn the image to disc not just copy the ISO file to a disc.</p>
<p>You should be able to right click the ISO in File Explorer and burn to disc. When you view the disc in File Explorer it should show the files.</p>

                    Hi!<br />
I have software that does not support Vista, but DOES support XP.&nbsp; I have Vista on my computer, I need to use this software. Could I download XP and use it for this program? Or will it cause problems with the other programs ?

            <br />
<p><span>First, go to your computer manufacturer's website and check to see if your model computer has XP Drivers available for it..</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If XP Drivers are not available for your Model, forget the idea.<br />
<br />
If it has, download them and save to Flash drive or CD.<br />
<br />
<strong>Next, buy an XP disk and Licence.<br />
</strong><br />
Save all your Data, as it will be lost during installation of XP.<br />
<br />
Then follow the steps below to&nbsp;do a clean install.</span></p>

<br />
Once installed, reload ALL your other&nbsp;Programs from original Media, or download again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reload all Drivers and Utilities for your Motherboard.<br />

Windows Vista Compatibility Center<br />
<br />
First thing to do is to check its Vista Compatibility at the above link, and if not see what patches/solutions are available from its Manufacturer..<br />

<br />
If it is not Vista Compatibile, read the info at the&nbsp;above link.<br />
This&nbsp;works for some Programs, but not all.</span></p>
<p><span>This applies to Software Programs, NOT Hardware Drivers.<br />
</span><br />
If the above does not work, buy a newer Vista Compatible&nbsp;Program.<br />

<h2>            Can Windows 8.1 read UDF Disc&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running Windows 8 on external DVD RW drive, there wasn't any issue of reading UDF Data disc.&nbsp; After upgraded to Windows 8.1, the same external DVD RW drive, the same disc is no longer readable.&nbsp; The DVD drive keeps reading and reading but nothing appears
 on Window Explorer.&nbsp; Why is this so?&nbsp; Is there any solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Ensure that you enable your account at the gmail site.</p>
<p>If you still have problems then copy and paste any error message that WM<br />
gives.</p>

            In addition to what mac.sgb says, make sure your antivirus program isn't getting in the way.&nbsp; Completely uninistall it and reinstall it without any mail scanning feature.&nbsp; Also, make sure your firewall is allowing the outgoing connections.
