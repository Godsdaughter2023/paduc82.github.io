            <p>Hello Marco,</p>
<p>I am following the instructions you are giving Alice even though I have been struggling with this problem for over 6 months.</p>
<p>As I stated above, I had to give up recently and start from scratch with a format and fresh install which was only good for 4 days.</p>
<p>I have just run wsreset.exe again, as per the roughly 50 other times I have done this as well as the troubleshooter for windows store, it does nothing towards fixing the 0x8024401c error.</p>
<p>Maybe the first step you should take is to clarify with Alice what error message she is getting?</p>

Is this only on Huffington Post, and what browser are you using? If for example you are using Firefox, have you tried Internet Explorer, and if so, did it work?<br />

    <title>Start-up repair freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertherzog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start-up repair freezes</h2>
                    <p>I have a custom build Windows 8.1 64 bit Intel core I5 Cpu 750 @2.67GHZ 4 gigs Ram AMD radeon HD 5700 series machine.As my machine is a little slow to boot I tried the system start-up repair to see if this would help. All went well until I came to choose
 an account to continue when everything freezes, my cursor stops working the up and down arrows are no help and I could not get the task manager, the only way I could get out of it was to press the restart button on my machine. I then went to safe mode but
 when I got there the same problem arose no cursor, nothing would work I had to press restart. I tried SFC as an administrator, no change I then run DISM still no help, disk check did no good either, so now I am stuck. &nbsp; Whilst not desperate as Windows still
 starts a little slow perhaps but when the desktop appears all works as normal I would still like to fix these 2 problems if possible. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Regards Robert</p>

            <p><span>Hello Robert,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you due to this Internet Explorer issue and
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. However, there are few more steps that we can try to diagnose the root cause.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur if the Windows system files are corrupted, third-party application conflict or user profile corruption. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp;How did you perform Startup repair?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. What do you mean, when you say “Windows still starts a little slow perhaps but when the desktop appears all works as normal”?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Do you have Windows 8.1 installation disk?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If not, then I would suggest you to login to any other working computer and
<strong>create a Windows 8.1 installation disk</strong>. Using that disk you can perform the troubleshooting methods given below.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the link to&nbsp;create the installation disk:</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>How to create installation media for a PC refresh or reset:</strong>

<p>
</p><p><span>After creating the Windows installation disk, I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span>Notes: </span></em></strong></p>
<p><em><span>1. To&nbsp;boot the computer through&nbsp;Windows 8.1 installation disc, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For more information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included
 with the computer or contact the computer manufacturer.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>2. <em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp;
</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Perform an Automatic Repair</strong> through bootable Windows 8 installation disc.<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do so,&nbsp;follow the steps given below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Insert the Windows 8.1 installation DVD in the DVD ROM and restart your computer.
</span></p>
<p><br />
<span>b. After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "<strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD</strong>". Press any key.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Click<strong> on Repair your computer </strong>in the lower left corner.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e. Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> from Choose an option screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>f. Click on <strong>Advanced options </strong>in Troubleshoot screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>g. Click <strong>Automatic Repair </strong>from Advanced Options screen.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>h. Next, choose the operating system by clicking on its button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>i. Windows 8.1 will then look for problems on hard drive(s) and verify that all required files are intact.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span> </span>
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the automatic repair doesn’t work, then&nbsp;<strong>perform System Restore</strong>, please restore the computer to the date when the computer was working fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Boot the computer through Windows 8 installation disc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b. Click on <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c. Click on <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> and then select <strong>Advanced Options</strong>.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d. Select <strong>Restore</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the System Restore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For more information, refer the link:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</em></span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Amit,</p>
<p>Thank you for your quick reply, I thought before I start any of the fixes I will reply to your questions.</p>
<p>1) I performed the start-up repair by opening the charms bar-settings-change PC settings-update&amp; recovery-recovery-advanced start-up-restart now-troubleshoot-advanced options-start-up repair-</p>
<p>choose an account to continue and this is where the problem arises the whole screen is frozen and I have no cursor and the only way to continue is to either turn the computer off or press the restart button on my machine which is what I did. &nbsp; Please correct
 me if I am wrong but by starting with a disk I will end up with precisely the same problem? I assume that following your tutorial using a disk I will end up with choose an account to continue and a frozen screen.</p>
<p>2) In the last two weeks my computers start-up has slowed from under 2 minutes to about &nbsp;4 minutes which is why I wanted to run start up repair hoping that it would restore my machine to a faster start-up.</p>
<p>When the desktop finally appears the system operates as normal just as it always has, the only complaint I have is the slower start-up time.</p>
<p>3) I have a Windows 8 installation disk I upgraded to 8.1 through the store when it became available but I will make a Windows 8.1 DVD if you think I should.</p>
<p>As to system restore I have tried this with 4 different restore points it runs for a few minutes and then tells me that it had encountered a problem and no changes were made, and I should try a different restore point. &nbsp;The same problem arises in safe mode
 no cursor the arrows do not work it is all frozen and I have to press the restart button to get out of it. i hope I have not left anything out and you have enough information to help me.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Robert</p>

            <p>Hello Amit,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply I did what you suggested and disabled driver signature enforcement in</p>
<p>startup settings but unfortunately it made no difference at all, it still takes about 5 minutes &nbsp;for all the</p>
<p>icons to appear. Just for your information I then re entered startup settings and selected repair my computer it diagnosed for quite a long time but then said it was unable to repair my computer.</p>
<p>Do you want me to re enable driver signature enforcement or leave it as it is ?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Robert&nbsp;</p>

    <title>My integrated webcam is not showing up on the Device Manager in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alfred01  say:</h3>
<h2>            My integrated webcam is not showing up on the Device Manager in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I am not sure if this has just happened because I upgraded to Windows 10 or not, but I can't locate my webcam in the 'device manager'. &nbsp;No sign of it. &nbsp;Checked device manager and then 'imaging devices' but no sign of it. &nbsp;As the device is already installed
 in the notebook then I don't know who the manufacturer of the integrated web cam is - so wouldn't be able to locate drivers for it anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did find a warning triangle against 'PCI device' icon in 'device manager' but not sure if this is relevant to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be gratefully received.</p>

            Hi Green
<br />
<br />Please explain this in more detail, what settings exactly are you trying to change and where are you doing that from on your PC when you get this error.
<br />
<br />There may be another way around this . . 
<br />
<br />Are you running a 3rd party Anti-virus on your PC?

    <title>Forza 3 server is unavailable&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bufordtjustice6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Forza 3 server is unavailable&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys. For over 24 hours when I have been playing Forza Motorsport 3 and try to view the auction house, check the leaderboards or join a multiplayer race I have been getting a message that says "The Forza Motorsport 3 server is not available at this time.
 Please try again later." The problem is not with my Internet connection, as my console logs onto Live, I can see my friends and messages, can stream Netflix in HD, etc. I put in MLB 2K11, Rock Band 2 and Guitar Hero 5, and all of them acted normally as far
 as online/multiplayer content, so the problem seems to be limited to Forza 3.</p>
<p>I did a search for this problem and found a <a href="http://forzamotorsport.net/en-us/wir_11-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
note on the official Forza website</a> warning that the server for Forza 3 would be down on Wednesday, November 30 for approximately 24 hours. It's Friday night as I write this... I realize that most people have moved on to Forza 4, but I'm still trying to
 get the last few achievements in 3. If anyone reading this has a copy of Forza 3, I'd be grateful if you could start the game and tell me whether or not you can access the online content. I'm hoping that their server maintenance is simply taking a lot longer
 to complete than was expected, but my pessimistic side is worried that something got funked out on my console. I've read that clearing the system cache on the hard drive might help, but I don't want to start messing with data and settings if this problem is
 affecting everyone and not just myself.</p>
<p>Sorry if it's a dumb question but this is the first time I've had any sort of problem like this with one particular game. Anyway, thanks very much to anyone who took the time to read this, and in advance for any replies.
</p>

    <title>I Lag out of every single game on Halo 5. Network details are bad. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> t4inted fate  say:</h3>
<h2>            I Lag out of every single game on Halo 5. Network details are bad.</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Here is my problem. &nbsp;I have 50 mb down and 5 mb upload speeds. &nbsp;I am always getting 45-50 mb download speed on speedtest on all devices including the XBone leading up to this point. &nbsp;It does not matter the time of day because
 I live in a small town and this has never been an issue.</strong></p>
<p><strong>So, as of 3 weeks ago, my internet suddenly goes to crap on all devices. &nbsp;I did speed test on my laptops, cell phone, and the Xbone. I was getting about 5 mb download max, 5% packet loss, and a high latency. &nbsp;Because of this,
 I lag out of every single Halo 5 game I tried to play. I tried all sorts of things for about a week...I'm very stubborn and like to fix things myself. &nbsp;I double checked my NAT, changed out&nbsp;Ethernet&nbsp;cords, tried&nbsp;wireless&nbsp;on my Xbox, tried a new router, did
 several power cycles, even logged into my router and tried tweaking a few things. &nbsp;I eventually called my local internet company, they showed up a week ago. &nbsp;The instant he walked in the door he said they had fixed it and everything was on there end. &nbsp;He switched
 out the Modem and tested a couple cables. We went ahead and factory reset my router back to where it was before since I had messed with it. &nbsp;Everything worked fine for a few days.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now, starting about a week ago, it suddenly went to crap again. &nbsp;THIS TIME IT WAS DIFFERENT. &nbsp;All of my other devices work just fine. &nbsp;Speed Test on cell phones and laptops are top notch. TiVo isn't having any issues. &nbsp;My
 Xbox is the only thing that doesn't work. I am back to the 5% packet loss, about 6 mb download speed and a high latency. &nbsp;I lag out of every single Halo 5 game. I tried all the stuff I had tried before like resetting everything, full power cycle, you name
 it. Nothing worked again. I went ahead and called my internet provider again, they came out and tested all my cables while resetting the router and modem. &nbsp;I tested the Xbox in front of them and it magically worked. &nbsp;WTF! Then a few hours later, it went to
 crap again. &nbsp;I am baffled by what is going on. &nbsp;I called Xbox customer support during my lunch break...waited 45 minutes and never got an operator...and then hung up because I had to go back to work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This forums is pretty much one of my few last attempts before I have to call a professional network person and spend $100's of dollars to have it fixed. &nbsp;After work I will call Xbox Customer support...but I have never had
 any success with them. &nbsp;If nothing works tonight, I am going to factory reset my Xbone. &nbsp;If that doesn't work then I am going to borrow a friends xbox for a weekend and see if his will work. &nbsp;That should really narrow it down. &nbsp;If his works, then it is 100%
 my xbox. &nbsp;If his doesn't work...then it is something deep within the network.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>-I live in Eastern Iowa.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><b>-I am using an **** Modem that was provided by my internet company.</b></p>
<p><b><strong>-I am using the Netgear NightHawk for my router that I purchased.</strong></b></p>
<p><b>-I have an Xbox One and TiVo connected to the router via wired. &nbsp;Two cell phones and two laptops occasionally use the wireless.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b><strong>-I use wired on my Xbone.</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>-Is UPnP Enabled? YES.</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>-Do you have a NAT error? NO, NAT is open on the Xbone and Router. &nbsp;Occasionally&nbsp;it will say I am behind a CONE NAT.</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>-No errors or codes.</strong></b></p>
<p><b><strong>-My ISP is a local internet service provider.</strong></b></p>

<p>Hi there &nbsp;from the sounds of it t4inted it could be a problem with your Internet &nbsp;company have you try reaching out to them to explain &nbsp;the problem with your connection &nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any other router you try and use to see if the problem could be with your Nighthawk router
</p>
<p>Other option is to try and turning your router and making sure &nbsp;you have the correct port open to Xbox live
</p>
<p>Also &nbsp;if there high traffic in your area that can cause connections to slow down
</p>
<p>Hope this helps </p>

<p>If you read what I wrote, they have been to my house twice. &nbsp;They claim everything looks good on there end.
</p>
<p>Again, if you read, I said I tried a different router and it still didn't work.</p>
<p>Ports are open.</p>
<p>And once again, there is no high traffic in my area that is not the issue.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I just direct connected my laptop to my router and pinged google. &nbsp;I had 3 packets lost out of 100.</p>

<p>The Arris modem is just a modem. &nbsp;It is not a router/modem. </p>
<p>UPDATE: I called xbox customer service. &nbsp;They informed me from the information I gave them that it is 100% not on there end. They made me try a few things and it had the same results, packet loss. &nbsp;They explained the reason my cell phone, tivo, netflix,
 and laptops all work is because the packets they send out are very small. &nbsp;Online gaming using different packets and that is the reason for the problem. &nbsp;They said it was on my ISP's side of things. BUT, the only way to be sure is to hook my xbox up on a different
 network with my same router or use another xbox on my network and see what happens. &nbsp;I have yet to do this.</p>
<p>Secondly, &nbsp;I decided to do some pinging. &nbsp;I am getting packet loss, about an average of 3%-5% when pinging from my laptop, which was directly connected into the modem. &nbsp;This further confirms that it is on the ISP side of things. &nbsp;The head tech had me do
 some more pinging and other stuff and he too believed it was probably on their side (ISP). &nbsp;It has been passed to the telecommunications manager and they are going to work on it this week. If this doesn't work, then I have absolutely no idea what to do next.
 &nbsp;Will update in a few days.</p>

<p>You could also plug the xbox one straight into the modem and see if it acts any different, but sounds like an isp deal...sometimes its as simple as running new cable and eliminating splitters and connectors , they can cause problems...</p>

<h2>            Blue screen today</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe some updates took affect last night and this morning, Sept 19, 2016. &nbsp;But now I cannot get the Surface 3 to boot up any more. &nbsp;Here is all I get after hitting power button:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Black screen with "Surface" logo. But no swirling white dots (I think that is what usually appears)</p>
<p>2. A blank light blue screen appears. &nbsp;Nothing else, no words, images, etc.</p>
<p>3. Machine shuts down</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched on line and read about problems earlier this year, but nothing recent. &nbsp;Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Dave</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">It is one of the desktop versions of Microsoft Windows 10. It can also be deployed and used on the tablets and hybrids. This version of the Windows 10 has
 been built on the line of Windows 10 Home. However, there are many extra features in this version that make it different from that of the Home version of the operating system. The Pro version of the operating system has a lot of features to help small businesses.
 The OS helps the entrepreneurs to meet and deal with the diverse needs and requirements of the business world. The operating system helps the businessmen to efficiently and effectively manage their valuable business data, devices, and applications. It helps
 in supporting the remote, mobile productivity scenarios. It does all that by taking the advantages of the cloud technology. If your organization supports the Choose Your Own Device programs and is "in" for prosumer customers", your company should choose the
 Windows 10 Professional. The version of the operating system also lets you take advantage of the Windows Update for Business. This in turn will reduce the management costs and provide control over the update deployment. In addition to that, it helps in providing
 quick access to various security updates of the system.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Microsoft this time has secured each specific version of Windows 10 targeted at specific users and user groups. The Windows 10
 Education is targeted majorly at the educators. The Windows 10 Education is that version of the new operating system that has been designed explicitly for academic purposes. Recently, Microsoft has revealed that the Windows 10 Education version of the new
 operating system will be available through the Volume Licensing program. This version of the operating system will be aimed at both students and the educators at various levels. However, according to the reviewers, it is quite unclear that how the Windows
 10 Education will be different from that of Windows 10 Enterprise. However, the major parts of the Windows 10 versions is still a mystery that is soon to be revealed.

            <p>This story doesn't help me at all, espewcialy the psudo philosophical statement that "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">the major parts of the Windows 10 versions is still a mystery that is soon to be revealed</span>", what is that?</p>
<p>Anyway, seing that the support here is quite ineffective I have searched for an actual answer online and found that according to Wikipedia
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_10_editions</a> the features that Windows 10 Educations has are exactly the once the Enterprise version has which intern superside those of the Pro version.
</p>
<p>So I want to be sure - that feature wise, is going with the education version going to be my best bet? (Clarification - I am both a student and have Windows 7 Pro - so I am eligible for both Windows 10 versions).</p>

            <p>That was helpful, but confusing also, from what you are saying it shows that windows 10 education is better as compared to windows 10 pro. And that table i got from: http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/feature/windows/windows-10-home-vs-windows-10-pro-uk-difference-3618710/.
 shows that windows 10 education is better than any other version of windows 10</p>

            Once you have clicked the screen and sign-in appears go to the bottom right hand corner and select the power icon, hold down shift and select power then restart. This should give you Troubleshoot. Select that and then Advanced options, after that you should
 see an option System Restore. Select that and see if you have any restore points so you can restore back to a time prior to the problem. Let it run through the process and after a&nbsp;restart see if you can now sign-in.

<p>Hello "TheSacredOrphan" &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Sorry to hear about your issue &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>The problem is either your HDMI Cable or that your TV is on its way out.</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>I started gaming when my friend gave me his PS One stuff because he upgraded into the PS2 (it just came out).</p>
<p>I chose the Xbox brand and have been with them (Xbox) ever since.</p>
<p>I haven't seen any "Jaggies" in games since the Original Xbox console. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless of course the developer purposely chose to use "Jaggies" like in Minecraft and Terreria.</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night "TheSacredOrphan" &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Could be your TV or type of HDMI cable you're using. </p>
<p>I have a Sony KDL40EX720 full 1080P HDTV and I sometimes get jaggies in Halo Reach, and Zoo Tycoon on Xbox 1. Odly I don't really get jaggies in Minecraft and if I do, they're minor.
</p>
<p>I too was deciding whether to get Xbox 360 or PS3. But I chose the Xbox brand as it's own by a kwl company (some older folk may not know what kwl means, it means cool). And because it's user friendly and have made great friends and have had a lot of fun
 with it. Well it may have weaker hardware than sony, and definetly high end gaming PC's, Xbox still has millions of users worldwide. Try adjusting the Sharpness in your TV settings, that way picture edges should be less emphasized or something. I can say the
 frame rate in Forza 6 is butter smooth in my experience. </p>

<p>Some games have the jaggies, I've been playing a bit of Black Flag lately and that suffers from the jaggies on the ropes of the ship and stuff, however, it's a ported last-gen game so, meh. But I started playing Bound by Flame on 360 and it took me about
 twenty minutes to adjust to the horrendous jaggies in it, made Black Flag look positively smooth.</p>
<p>Check your TV settings, resolution, turn off any auto settings, and try a different cable as has been suggested already. Sniper Elite is at the top of your games list, it was lauded for its high resolution [native 1080p] on X1 and PS4, and post-processing
 anti-aliasing... so... it's one game that is decidedly free from from jaggies. =)</p>

<p>Rise of the Tomb Raider has jaggies on certain assets... I've learned. I noticed you've recorded some gameplay showcasing it. If you go to xboxclips dot com and search for Rise of the Tomb Raider you'll see multiple examples of it too.</p>
<p>I know the Game DVR only records in 720 but still. It's there.</p>
<p>If your Sniper Elite is super smooth, you'll know it's not a problem with your gear, and not to worry. =) The jaggies probably only appears starkly on Rise of the Tomb Raider because the rest of it looks so good.</p>

<p>Hey, im in the same situation, every game looks ****, most of the time i think it's in my head because others don't even notice those thick lines, but not just in pc i see them in my mobile phone,tv too, in games like call of duty mobile,pubg mobile. I didn't
 notice anything like that in pubg mobile before,and now it's frustrating and unplayable because of that issue, it's even visible on google earth. This is the reason i uninstalled gta v and every other game. How can nobody notice that, it looks a lot more worse
 than a normal game without anti alising</p>

<h2>            Speech Recognition not working</h2>
                    My Speech Recognition has stopped working.&nbsp; I used to get little box telling me this and that "Windows is searching for a solution to this problem" but haven't seen that for a while.&nbsp; It will "start listening" but doesn't type anything and keeps saying
 "what was that?"<br />
<br />
Also, it won't open when I click on the icon in the Start menu.&nbsp; The only way I can get it to open is to shut down and turn it on again because it launches when I boot it up.<br />
<br />
How do I get it to work again, I really need it.

A 320GB hard drive with 290GB of available space is normal. See the following:<br />

The 100MB partition is also normal - it contains the boot files for Windows.<br />

<h2>            No Sign-in window after waking up from Sleep Mode</h2>
                    <p>
I have been running Windows 10 for the last year, the PC goes into sleep mode after 20 minutes. I press the keyboard/click the mouse once to wake it up, and press the keyboard/click the mouse again for the sign-in window to appear. &nbsp;Since the Microsoft security
 update on 14th Jan the PC still wakes up fine, but after the second press/click the sign-in window no longer appears. &nbsp;Now I have to do a ctrl+alt+del each time before the sign-in window appears.<br />
<br />
I have checked all the options to ensure that "select ctrl+alt+del" is not set anywhere. &nbsp;How can I go back to the way it used to work before?<br />

 my pc has ran into a problem and it will restart it for me and then it doesn't the diagnose load and goes completely black and I thought if I left it it would just at some point load or say something but I've left it for like 12 hours and it's still black.
 I turned it off and stopped using it for about a month and now I have tried again and it still shows my the same problem. I have tried to unplug it and hold the power button for two minutes and that doesn't help.

<h2>            Workgroup networking not working after update</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I installed the Windows update on Feb 12, 2019 on one laptop running Windows 7 Pro SP1 and the work group network has stopped working. When I open the computer from the Start menu no computers are showing in the network. I uninstalled KB 4486563 and that
 did not resolve the issue. My other laptop that I did not install the Feb 12, 2019 Windows updates can still access the updated laptop.</p>
<p>What is the solution?</p>

<p>Hello Kapil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstalled KB 4486563 on 1 laptop and the issue was still there. I have read most of the thread provided dating back to 2009 and have tried several of the suggestions, although I am running Windows 7 pro on the laptops. The Windows XP and Visa do not
 apply in my situation. I can access the other laptop from start, search, \\"computer name".</p>
<p>I shut off Norton firewall and then all computers did show in the network. Turned firewall back on and rebooted all laptops several times and all computers are shown.</p>
<p>I have my laptops sign-on password protected and user name/password set to logon thru the network. That is only working on one (1) laptop. I have reset those setting several times and no joy.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
lxcctime.dll is part of a Lexmark printer driver.<br />
<br />
Cancel all print jobs - here is how<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/4d4f151c-1cc3-44cb-aca3-1390c5603c061033.mspx#EF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/4d4f151c-1cc3-44cb-aca3-1390c5603c061033.mspx#EF</span></a><br />
<br />
Add or remove a printer<br />

    <title>Surface Precision Mouse middle click issue on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darin perusich  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Precision Mouse middle click issue on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After applying the latest Windows 10 patches today, when I middle click on my Surface Precision Mouse, to say open a new browser window/tab, the mouse will no longer focus on any other applications when I click on it. If I click the start button when in
 this state it will expand however I cannot click on any of the icons and typing does not perform a search of apps. I'm able to use the keyboard to navigate, alt+tab to move between apps, Windows key to access the start button, but I need to log off and back
 on for the mouse focusing to begin functioning normally again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially had Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center 64bit 3.2.116 installed, upgraded to 10.4.0 which is the latest, and have removed it and the problem persists. I've attached the mouse to a Lenovo T470 which never had Mouse and Keyboard Center installed
 and the behavior exists on that device as well, so it looks to be a Windows 10 specify issue when using a Surface Precision Mouse. My super old IntelliMouse does not cause this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experience this issue?</p>
<p>

<br />
<br />
We appreciate your response. To be able to understand the issue better, let us know more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Can you clarify if the button on the Surface Precision Mouse that you're referring to is the one below the scroll wheel or the middle part of the side buttons?<br />
• Can you tell us which other devices (laptop/PC) have you tried connecting the mouse aside from the one you've mentioned?<br />
• Were you able to check the battery status of your mouse?<br />
• Have you tried reinstalling the Mouse and Keyboard Center to the earlier version? Were there any differences?<br />
• How about installing the 32-bit version?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know so we can help you further.

</p>
<p>The scroll wheel itself<br />
</p>
<p>• Can you tell us which other devices (laptop/PC) have you tried connecting the mouse aside
</p>
<p>from the one you've mentioned?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Book 2 15in</p>
<p>2 different Lenovo T460's</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Were you able to check the battery status of your mouse?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse is fully changed and the same behavior occurs when it's plugged into the charging cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• Have you tried reinstalling the Mouse and Keyboard Center to the earlier version? Were there any differences?</p>
<p>The issue occurs with versions 3.2.116, 10.4.0, and on systems where it's never been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>• How about installing the 32-bit version?<br />
I have not tried the 32-bit version yet but I will shortly.<br />
<br />
Uninstalling patch KB4340917 removes the behavior, however middle clicking with the wheel is no longer working.</p>

<h2>            Old account sending messages</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have a Skype account with this name. I haven't used it in years, and can't remember the login details, but my sister received a message from it today (see below). It looks like it's been hacked and is sending messages to contacts. Any advice?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/04d30389-f5a5-4b58-86a1-6766339ecd5d" title="carolinedaly1">
<p>
</p><p>We cannot determine whether the account has been hacked or not because there is an issue before wherein some Skype accounts, send random links to its Skype contacts without the user's knowledge. And the workaround for this, is to change the password and
 run anti-virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you cannot access the account, we would advise you to try <strong>resetting
</strong>the its password with the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to this <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 103, 184, 1)">link.</span></a></strong></li><li>Enter the credential when you initially create the account <em>(Skype name)</em> then click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>On <em>Why can't you sign in?</em> page, choose <strong><span>I forgot my password
</span></strong><span>then hit <em>Next</em>.</span></li><li><span>After that, <em>"Enter the characters you see" &gt; Next.</em></span></li><li><span>The security info associated with your account shown there, if you have access to any of them, choose one.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If in case, you do not have access to the security info provided, kindly choose
<strong>"I don't have any of these"</strong> to proceed&nbsp;with&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account recovery</a>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let me know of the results.</p>
