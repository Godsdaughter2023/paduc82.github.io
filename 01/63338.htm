<h2>            How to run an XP program in windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have recently upgraded to a new laptop with windows 7. There is a software program that is compatible with XP thast has not been built for Windows 7. Is there a work around for XP programs using windows 7?</p>

<p>Have you tried right-clicking on the shortcut to the program, or the .exe, or the Setup.exe&nbsp;and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; You'll have to learn this procedure if you are new to Vista or Windows 7 and coming from XP.&nbsp; It is called "running
 elevated", and is sometimes necessary because, by design, Administrators in the later operating systems are running with Standard User privileges, it is more likely to be&nbsp;necessary with older programs that may not have the Windows 7 Logo on their packaging
 or download file link.</p>
<p>Make older programs run in this version of Windows (Windows 7)<br />

<p>This code is executed, but does not send messages to the Mail group, as I expected.<br />

How do I change the code so that messages are from my account? Or messages to an existing group?</p>

            That error according to the error codes can be fixed by just unplugging and re-plugging in your headset.

About 2 or 3 weeks into the PC, it froze once or twice while working on software that I use for my job (ArcGIS). Everything stayed fine and normal.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to yesterday and here is what happened:<br />
<br />
It froze, so I had to hold the front button on the tower the turn it off, it did.<br />
-Turned it back on, and instead it would power on for 1 second, then off, then on, then off, then on, then off
<br />
-Then it would turn on and the FANS would be REVING. They would spool up fast, then slow, then fast, then slow, then fast, then slow, then it beeped 5, 1 second long beeps and then it would shut down. Then it turns on again and the cycle of fan reving, 5 beeps,
 shuts down, turns on - repeat. <br />
<br />
What I did was just jiggle stuff around cuz I read that it has something to do with the Ram stick being inserted incorrectly idk but it seemed to work.<br />
<br />
Today it happened again. <br />
I was working on that software and the exact same thing that happened yesterday, it repeated today.
<br />
All the crazy turning off and on, reving of the fan(s), 5 beeps. jiggle stuff around and it was fixed for about 30 mins.
<br />
<br />
but then.....it froze, i turned it off, when i tried to turn it on the same thing would happen except instead of 5 beeps it was 6, 1 second long beeps. I juggled stuff around and it didn't seem to work as easily. I had to juggle stuff around and then tried
 waiting some time before i tried starting it up again. It seemed to work, except now the problem I have is it freezes. I'll be doing any random task (using the work software and even tried to queue up for 1 league of legends match) and it freezes.<br />
<br />
The thing this time is I can turn it on and it boots without a hiccup, however it has frozen 3x since the last time it was going in a boot loop.<br />
<br />
What should I do?<br />
<br />
is the the processor? thermal paste? bad ram stick? bad Motherboard? <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fm.bestofmedia.com%2fsfp%2fimages%2fdesign%2fusr%2fsmilies%2ffrown.gif" />&nbsp; thank you for reading

<br />
<br />
BTW: I've had 2 blue screens also, 1 yesterday and 1 today. Here are the 2 codes<br />
<br />
1 (yesterday) DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL<br />
*i have no clue what that means, and looking it up didn't help me either*<br />
<br />
2 (today): SYSTEM_THREAD+EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED<br />
nvlddmkm.sys<br />
* I looked this one up and I guess it was a software issue that I had to uninstall and re download to fix*<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />
<br />
Following day after I posted this: the computer turned on like normal and stayed on for about 4 hours before it froze. Then the revving of the fans started followed by 5 beeps and a sudden shut down before repeating the loop endlessly.<br />
<br />
I moved stuff again (Reinstalled the cpu and moved around the ram stick), and it turns on. It does the 1 beep to reaffirm me that everything is loading correctly. Soon after that beep, the GPU fan stops spinning, and as it loads either freezes at the first
 loading image (motherboard picture during loading) or it freezes at the windows 10 log in screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>***</p>
<p>I posted this with the PC that's giving me the problem.&nbsp; After more juggling around, it seems to be working "ok". Lets see how long it last before it freezes on me again and becomes reluctant to turn on.&nbsp;

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over heating of your custom-built computer is one of the possible causes of your freezing computer. If the issue persists, we highly suggest that you post your query in TechNet forums, so you can get best suggestions of what hardware that you can use for
 your computer. You may refer to this <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you have any other concerns.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So an update:</p>
<p>I thought it was the motherboard that was the main issue because of the erratic behavior (random freezing at any and all points of the computer start up, up to when it's in regular use).&nbsp; I returned it and got an MSI B250 Bazooka instead (read good reviews
 on it).&nbsp; Everything worked fine for 10 minutes and it froze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference in the freezing this time around is it wouldn't go into a boot loop anymore, but it would simply freeze.&nbsp; There would be a *pop* in the speakers/headphones and instant freezing.&nbsp; The disk drive still worked but that's about it.&nbsp; When I would
 boot up again, I went to the Reliability History to check out the log and it recorded that the computer was shut down in a bad way (I pressed the start button for several seconds to turn it off)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So from that, I figured the motherboard wasn't the issue.&nbsp; Leaving the HDD, CPU, GPU, RAM to be questioned.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>From here I thought it was overheating because the GPU would be SUPER HOT (just to hover my hand over it I felt the intense heat).&nbsp; I also noticed that the fans would not turn on.&nbsp; So I downloaded MSI Afterburner to manually set the fan speed and it worked!!!!
 For another 10 minutes.&nbsp; Froze again. (turns out newer Nvidia card fans turn on after a specific heat point so it was working like it was supposed to)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So from that left the HDD, CPU, RAM.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I figured it wasn't the HDD cuz the problems weren't too consistent with HDD failure.&nbsp; Not even the skipping/scratching sound of a faulty HDD.&nbsp; Super quiet.&nbsp; That and because it recorded the errors that were happening so I figured it was doing ok if it was
 recording stuff while frozen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I ruled out the CPU for the same reason, it wasn't consistent with a bad CPU.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So that leaves the RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried Windows Memory Diagnostic tool, and it kept freezing early into the test.&nbsp; Unsure of anything and unsure if I'm even diagnosing this correctly, I searched for another method to test memory.&nbsp; I download and made a bootable flash drive for MemTest86.&nbsp;
 it kept freezing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up just pulling the trigger and saying to myself, given all of the troubleshooting and errors, it points more towards a bad RAM than it does the rest.&nbsp; I sent it back to get a refund (amazon) and order 2, 4GB sticks (same brand) and the
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em>problem has gone away.&nbsp; my computer works now flawlessly &lt;3</em></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR - Bad RAM stick.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 not booting without bootable usb plugged in. PLEASE HELP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 not booting without bootable usb plugged in. PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    <p>Here is the story,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of days ago I downloaded and&nbsp;installed windows 10 using the media creation tool to create a&nbsp;bootable USB. I then used this USB to upgrade to windows 10. I then noticed that when I went to reboot it got stock on a black screen and stayed there. It
 never even made it to the windows symbol. However, with the bootable usb plugged in it boots no problem and I can remove that USB and windows 10 still functions normally. I have looked around to see what could cause this and I feel it has to have installed
 the boot files for windows 10 onto this USB. As an attempt to correct this mistake&nbsp;my first thought was&nbsp;to revert back to windows 7 pro (my previous version before 10 pro). This option was said to be unavailable because somehow windows had deleted necessary
 files. I then saw that I may need to reset the PC so I did that but all that did was delete programs and got me back to the same issue I have been having. What could&nbsp; be causing this and how would I go about fixing it??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for the quick response! I am at work at this time however as soon as I arrive home later tonight I will try the above methods. Here are the answers to your questions.</p>
<p>"1. Did you select upgrade while using Media Creation tool?"</p>
<p>I did try to upgrade using the simple upgrade option in the media creation tool from windows 7 pro. The process ran entirely smooth until it got to the first reboot point. From there it went to a black screen with no cursor and the blue windows logo. after
 a manual reboot the computer said reverted back to windows 7. error C1900101-20017. I did this two different times to get the same result and a solution I read was to try the same media tool using a bootable usb so I did. I have again since tried this method
 while i'm on windows 10 operating system (after I have unplugged the usb) and get the same result. The only difference is instead of reverting to windows 7 it reverts to my current windows 10 as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"2. After creating bootable media USB, have you tried to boot Media Installation from the desktop of the previous operating system?"</p>
<p>After creating the bootable media USB I simply followed the onscreen instructions from the previous operating system. I went to the tool on windows 7 and did not turn the computer off and try to boot from the USB.&nbsp;I just let the tool start its work on the
 previous operating system interface by going to the big windows upgrading screen saying this may take a while and will restart a few times.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>two&nbsp;questions I have is with regard to some of the methods to correcting the issue&nbsp;in the above post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>do I preform options 1 and 2 in windows 10 or is this something I do when the computer is first booted up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I turn on my computer it never asks if I want to boot from the USB. it just boots normally (ie. does not display&nbsp;as if&nbsp;any&nbsp;special request or action is being performed)&nbsp;when it is in and does not boot at all when it is not. Is this a bios settings problem?
 should it ask me before preforming a&nbsp;USB boot?</p>

</p><p>I happen to have the exact same laptop as this user and his symptoms appear identical. My issue is most likely an update to the bios if I were to take a guess based off of this guys post. However, I am not sure how to access the Lenovo utility tool. I know
 you are not a Lenovo expert as your a Microsoft support engineer but would you happen to know how to access the bios update utility tool?</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender can&#39;t delete or remove</h2>
                    On Windows Vista I am getting the error message 0x800106ba I have gone to Vista and found the resolution listed.&nbsp; Problem Defender is not listed in the add or remove programs and I also tried the methold of using Windows Installer Cleanup Utility and nothing.<br />
Problems on the laptop is that the internet is connected but it will not open Internet Explorer.&nbsp; It always comes up with unable to connect to the internet.&nbsp; I have checked the network connections and it works.&nbsp; It is sending and receiving from the server.<br />
Any help would be GREAT!!!

            Hi Tazz25,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Vista Support forum,<br />
<br />
Seem like you having two separate problems.&nbsp; <br />
First, Windows Defender error, since Windows Defender is part of Windows it will not show up in Programs and Features.&nbsp; I know the article might be a little misleading since it doesn't state which OS it is for.&nbsp; Here's something you might want to try to resolve
 the Windows Defender error:<br />
<br />
Click Start<br />
In Search - services and click on Services to open the window<br />
You will now have a list of services on the PC<br />
Scroll to Windows Defender and right click, select Properties<br />
It&nbsp;probably will say&nbsp;Manual under Startup Type<br />
Change it to Automatic and Start it then.<br />
<br />
Also if you have McAfee as you antivirus/firewall.&nbsp; It might be the cause of the problem since it have a known issue with Windows Defender running at the same time.<br />
<br />
Second, for the internet connection problem, please go to the search box and type CMD and hit Enter<br />
Next, type in Ping <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com</a> at the command prompt.<br />
Get back with us with the result to further troubleshoot this problem<br />
<br />
Hope to hear from you soon,<br />

    <title>Genkibowl VII Not Working &#40;In Many Ways than One&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> igc creeper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Genkibowl VII Not Working &#40;In Many Ways than One&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>So, where to begin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First I'm a Season Pass Holder and I have purchased all the DLC's directly from the In-Game DLC menu.&nbsp; This includes Genkibowl VII.&nbsp; Now on Tuesday, I Downloaded Genkibowl VII from the In-Game Menue.&nbsp; I loaded a Save Game, (100% Complete)&nbsp; Now everything
 was working okay, that was until I started the Second Mission from the Phone. &nbsp; While playing the Mission, the Mascots you have to Kill (If Told To) would be Invisible and Invincible, I would completely Destroy the Golf Carts but they still be Marked as Kill.&nbsp;
 That or You can Kill them but Eventually the Game would Freeze.</p>
<p>Well I doubt this is a Factor but my Xbox at that time was beginning to show its age, the Disk Drive would not recognize the Disk, Tray would stick.&nbsp; So I got a new one on Wendsday.&nbsp;&nbsp; I Transferred the DLC's to my new Xbox.&nbsp; Inserted the Game, Downloaded
 the Update and then.&nbsp; The Game will keep me from going past the Main Menu</p>
<p>I've done the following that Hopefully would fix the issue.</p>
<p>1) Deleted and Re-Installed the DLC (FAILED) X 5</p>
<p>2) Deleted All the DLC's except for Genkibowl (Can Play the Game, but all I get is CheapyD as a Homie.</p>
<p>3) Followed the Instructions THQ provided in the News Section. Same as #2</p>
<p>4) Completely Formated my Drive.&nbsp; Installed Update, Downloaded DLC AGAIN.&nbsp; SAME AS #2</p>
<p>So what am I doing Wrong?&nbsp; I've sent THQ, Violition a E-mail about it.&nbsp; I know I'm not the only one who is having this Problem.&nbsp; And Saints Row the Third is messed up for some reason so I can't know if the problem was fixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, what was the point
 of getting the Season Pass if it won't work?</p>

<p>Did they every try to actually fix this? &nbsp;My Genkibowl dlc has never worked, I've tried clearing my cache and re-downloading and it still doesn't work. I purchased my season pass within the first week of the game coming out, and this specific dlc has never
 worked for me.</p>

            I had this game on ps3 and ps4 and all my dlc worked perfectly fine but now I got it on Xbox one and I bought the season pass but it only gave me the trouble with clones dlc and it is really angering me that I spent money on something that it didn't even
 give me if anyone can tell me how to solve this problem I would appreciate it.

<h3> spinneyhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to Wifi, Windows 10, after shutdown</h2>
                    <p>A couple of days ago, we were expecting a big storm so one of our computers was shut down using Start. Power. Shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On restarting it could not connect to the WiFi network. It can see the network but cannot connect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another "identical" computer was not shut down by command but shut down during the storm as a result of a power flicker. It was restarted a couple of hours later and connected to the internet immediately and since (hence this message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Disabled and Enabled the WiFi network card on the subject computer.</p>
<p>I have Updated the driver. It is the same as the one on this computer (the "twin"). Windows said it was already up to date.</p>
<p>I have Uninstalled the network card and restarted. The same driver was reinstalled.</p>
<p>I have reset the network.</p>
<p>I have done ...<strong>netsh winsock reset</strong></p>
<p><strong>netsh int ip reset</strong></p>
<p><strong>ipconfig /release </strong></p>
<p><strong>ipconfig /renew </strong>(both this and the command above failed because there was no adapter in a suitable state to carry out the command)</p>
<p><strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong></p>
<p>all successfully except the two noted. </p>
<p>I have powered down and up the modem-router.</p>
<p>What should I do next? </p>
<p>Is there something I should look for in Event Viewer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computers are Dell Studio One Nine (1909), running Windows 10 Home v. 1607 build 14393.1066.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible reason why your computer is unable to connect automatically to the network is that the network may not be set to connect automatically. For us to isolate this issue, let's remove your network from your saved networks list, then reconnect to
 it. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Settings</strong>, then select <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Wi-Fi</strong>.</li><li>Click<strong> Manage Wi-Fi settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <em>Manage know networks</em>, click the name of your network, then click<strong> Forget</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once the network is removed, click on your Wi-Fi icon and search for your network name, then reconnect to it. Make sure to check the box for
<strong>Connect automatically</strong> when you connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I have done that and the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooter says there is a driver problem. Will the checksums of the driver files on the problem computer be the same as on the sister computer? The date and time of the sys files is when the computer was last started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I delete them and copy over from the other computer? I tried to delete one of the two from Command Prompt as Administrator but access was denied (after uninstalling the network card).</p>

            <p>This morning I tried connecting with ethernet. The same problem is present. "There seems to be a problem with the driver" of this device. It is the same network card and driver version and file as this computer is using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all happened suddenly over a shutdown. It looks like the driver software or configuration file is corrupted.

<p>
</p><p>Might there be an event logged that gives a clue as to the problem?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is perhaps possible that the update did not install correctly. If you would like you can try uninstalling the update by going to Control Panel&gt;All Control Panel Items&gt;Programs and Features and then clicking on View installed updates. Be sure to then do

            <p>Thanks for your reply Richard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled KBKB4015217 - it took a while - then immediately restarted. It was immediately reinstalled and the date of installation was still shown as 12 Apr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the download is corrupt? </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many files in c:\Windows\System32\CatRoot that come up in a search showing as Package_XXXX_for_KB4015217. Can I delete them?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea then would be to uninstall the update, restart, check for updates and download it then reinstall. Maybe this will fix a corrupt download - if that is the problem.</p>
<p>
I am told now that when the computer was turned on after the storm, it installed updates. That may be when it went wrong.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I use MBAM free, and have for years, as a stand alone scanner that I run about once a month to check for anything that might have slipped past Win Defender or had been inadvertently (snuck) installed by a 3rd party program. Nothing has yet slipped through
 Defender in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After removing the infections if you can then connect to the internet update MBAM's definitions and run another scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cant connect on the device, from the other PC you can download the&nbsp;MBAM Junk Removal Tool, it's portable, onto a USB stick and then run it on the problem device.</p>

            I downloaded Malwarebytes v. 3.0.6 and installed it on the problem computer. It found 93 PUPs but did not find the winamp32 problem. None of the PUPs looked to be bad things. I quarantined them all and MB restarted the computer. Problems persist. (No ethernet
 and no wifi.) Actually it says it is connected to wifi but cannot see the network in Windows Explorer.

            <p>Ok, being that you have an identical PC that does not have the problem (assuming that all of the hardware and drivers are the same, you might want to compare the Network adapters using Device Manager) if it were me I would try uninstalling the update again
 before digging deeper&nbsp;now that all of the infections have been removed or quarantined.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are many programs that can open and view jpg files, and what comes with Windows is not necessarily the best. I recommend the free irfanview at https://www.irfanview.com/</p>

<p>You can see the system requirements here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the page don't work:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Processor:</strong></p>
1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC</li><li>
<p><strong>RAM:</strong></p>
<p>1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>Hard disk space:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Graphics card:</strong></p>
DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver</li><li>
<p><strong>Display:</strong></p>
800x600</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps, it can take more RAM?<br />
</p>
<p>Perhaps, it better like Windows 8.1? So it was for me, when I tested the Windows 10 on a little laptop - it didn't like the Windows 10 - and all that update-trouble I had, and when it restarted, it allways gave a mosquito-sound, so I decided to buy a Windows
 8.1, which now is running without any complaining from the harddisk! Perhaps, your screen-resolution is too low, (1024 X 600) so you don't can use the apps, but only the normal programs - so is it for me - nevermind with that - I never use apps anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You have to check, if you now are running 32 bit or 64 bit, so you got the right version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before installing a new system: Go to the computermanufactorers webpage to see, if there is a never BIOS-software, and if the newest is for only Windows 7 or 8, or 8.1, you take this. Is it a laptop, you have to plug the powercord in, because the fan will
 run fast, when installing the new BIOS-software!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are on the webpage, also check for other newer drivers - e.g. for the mouse and screen..... And when the new system is onboard, you can go to the site and get the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you <strong>WILL</strong> install the Windows 10, and ABSOLUTELY not Windows 8.1, "please wait..." You still have to april 2017, to use the old Vista... So you hopefully gets an ERROR-free Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Before doing anything, save your stuff on extern harddisk and USB-stick, so you don't lose anything - THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT!!!</strong> When installing a new system, all will be deleted. The product-key, you have to use, when installing, is the
 one on the new Windows-CD, you are going to buy...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also have Windows 7-, or 8.1-PC's? when upgrading these systems, you ALSO have to save your stuff on extern media!!! An upgrade unfortunately removes files for REALLY many users....</p>

                    <p>Hi, I have a problem with editing picture metadata in Windows 10 (updated).<br />
When I try to save for example edited rating on picture in File Explorer I get error message:&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I don't have problem with every picture taken by Huawei P10 stock camera, just about 1/3 of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ExifToolGUI also shows warning to all pictures taken by Huawei P10: "Warning: [minor] Unrecognized MakerNotes"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it bug in Huawei stock camera app or in DirectWrite (<a href="https://www.hresult.info/FACILITY_WINCODEC_DWRITE_DWM/0x88982F52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.hresult.info/FACILITY_WINCODEC_DWRITE_DWM/0x88982F52</a>)?</p>

            Its possible an issue with how your phones camera encodes the image. They might adding special effects to image that makes incompatible with existing meta data editing options. I guess the only option right now is batch convert all your imported photos as a JPEG first then make the necessary metadata edits.

    <title>Surface 3 external monitor connection not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterd-ct  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface 3 external monitor connection not working</h2>
                    <p>My surface 3 does not provide a signal for an external monitor.&nbsp;I have tried both HDMI and VGA adapters for the display port, both docking and straight out of the unit, and two different monitors. I have tried extending the screen and duplicating the screen.
 The external monitor is just dark. Windows is fully up to date. I have visited the Microsoft page below, which mostly says "make sure it's plugged in." Any better ideas?</p>

<p>The new monitor is an HP - 23es IPS LED FHD Monitor.</p>
<p>However, I have tried two other monitors (a 20 inch DELL and a 32 inch Samsung) and the behavior is the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the mini display plug on the Surface 3 dock, the system at least makes an effort to connect--the Surface screen blinks, the mouse freezes, then it tries again, every 3-4 seconds. But there is no action at the external monitor.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sounds common.&nbsp; Have you tried using the magic bullet (my mnemonic for Win+Ctrl+Shift+B)?&nbsp; Also, if you have only been extending and duplicating you may still be affecting the operation of that monitor by the characteristics of your tablet's
 screen.&nbsp; So have you tried using <em>Second Screen Only</em> too?&nbsp; You would have to activate Narrator (Win+Ctrl+Enter) to keep control of course and with that particular transition you would also have to reply to the Keep this...? prompt sight unseen (e.g.
 press Tab and Enter to go from having keyboard focus on a No button to getting it on the Yes button.)&nbsp; But then you would at least have a chance to try the "magic bullet" while you were supposedly using the second monitor only.&nbsp; Hint: it might save you from
 having to keep using Narrator, e.g. switch back to PC Screen Only, or it might do something else more exciting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Related to this, what is the primary screen?&nbsp; If it is not the attached monitor you would have another opportunity to experiment with its real screen attributes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><p>OK so I identified one issue! The clever teenager at Best Buy who helped be with this project sold me HDMI and VGA mini display port adapters for a MAC, not a Surface PC. So I now have the correct adapters.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>VGA still fails completely, but I was able to get some action out of the HDMI adapter when using the docking port. Now I have a second screen, but the color is failing. Red tones saturate as monochrome red lines and dots for any image with a bit of red in
 it. <span>
Win+Ctrl+Shift+B, and rebooting, but the problem persists.&nbsp;</span>If I could fix this, I would be home free!</p>

<p>OK so I bought the Microsoft adapter. The behavior is once again different, but not so good: Both screens are dark. There is some blinking action illustrating that the Surface is struggling to do something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a shame, because it would be great to use the Surface 3 with an external monitor. But if the $40 Microsoft adapter is still not good enough, then I'm not sure what else to do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            SanDisk memory card reader not detected on computer.</h2>
                    I have a SanDisk memory card reader that takes memory cards from cameras and imports the pictures on the computer. When I insert it into my computer, nothing pops up. When I look under "My Computer," I don't see anything about it, but it makes a noise
 whenever I insert it or take it out of the side of my computer. How can I find the memory card reader on my computer?

<div>Hi shelbylorene,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong> Check if the device is getting detected in device manager. Follow the steps to go to device manager<br />
a. Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
b. Search for the name of the device in the Universal Serial Bus Controllers&nbsp;list.<br />
c. If you see the item related to SD card, right on it and click Uninstall.<br />
d. Restart the computer and check if the card installs successfully.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> If the device is not&nbsp;visible in device manager's items list, then check if it is hidden device.<br />
a. Click show hidden devices under View.<br />
b. Expand all the nods under device manager.<br />
c. There would be many grayed out entries in device manager uninstall all the grayed out entries under all the nods and then restart the computer and plug the external device to the computer and check if it works.</div>

I had just done a messy uninstall for a Pinnacle product.<br />
And then I lost the menu bar off Explorer.<br />
<br />
Searching the MS Support pages, I found XP_ToolbarFix.exe.&nbsp; Running this did not restore my menus.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Can I get free email support for this problem, since the MS fix did not work for me?<br />

            If system restore doesn't work then you have other problems with the system.<br />
<br />
If you have your installation CD I suggest that you run the system fle checker.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Go to <b>Start -</b> <b>Run </b>and type in:</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>sfc /scannow</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This command will immediately initiate the Windows File Protection service to scan all protected files and verify their integrity, replacing any files with which it finds a problem.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may be prompted to insert the installation CD.</span></p>

<h2>            GetWindows10-Web_Default_Atte.exe not running</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am upgrading to Windows 10 from the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade?pm=MSN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade?pm=MSN</a> website. After I download the GetWindows10-Web_Default_Atte.exe and I "Run as Administrator", nothing happens. I have done this in other computers and I had no problems. This is a Windows
 7 Pro 64 bit Intel i5 4GB RAM machine. A little history about this PC, it was the epicenter of a recent Crypto locker attack and Windows had to be reinstalled. I confirmed that Windows has been correctly activated. I have tried all possible solutions in google
 but most of the people are getting the Upgrading App to run and then the problem happens, I don't even get to open such application. I try to run the App and is like clicking a blank space in the desktop meaning nothing happens. Has anybody come across something
 similar? Please, let me know what can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            Update.exe &#47; updrgui.exe&#58; Is Spyware eating my CPU&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to research this problem the last couple of days extensively and, as it seems, I'm by far not the first to have it.
</p>
<p>Starting a couple days back, every time after booting my PC (Windows 7, 64 bit), both update.exe &amp; updrgui.exe miraculously appear in my Task Manager, create multiple clones and start hogging the CPU (constantly 100%). As has been reported previously, simply
 trying to end the processes manually doesn't work. An error message occurs and says that it is not possible to end the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other threads, different MalWare-blockers were advised to use. I have tried both Luke Filewalker as well as Malware-Bytes, both of which found a sufficient amount of threats and claimed to have put them into quarantine. Nonetheless, the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any of you could help out with this, or at least pinpoint me to a former thread I haven't found yet, that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings,</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that after booting your computer both update.exe and updrgui.exe keeps on appearing in Task Manager.
<span>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Update.exe or updrgui.exe is may be a component of Windows Update or any other parties. A process named update.exe appears to be part of several different programs. So many malware named itself update.exe.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">:</span></strong> Any malware can be named anything - so you should check where the files of the running processes are located on your disk. If a "non-Microsoft" .exe file is located
 in the C:\Windows or C:\Windows\System32 folder, then there is a high risk for a virus, spyware, Trojan or worm infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend you turn off Automatic Windows Update and check if the issue persist or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the Method mentioned below How to Turn off Automatic Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To turn on/off Automatic Updates yourself, follow these steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <span>Windows update</span> in the search box, and then click
<strong>Windows Update</strong> in the <strong>Programs</strong> list. </li><li>In the left pane, click <strong>Change settings</strong>.</li><li>Select the option that you want. </li><li>Under<strong> Recommended updates</strong>, select the<strong> Give me recommended updates the same way I receive important updates</strong> or
<strong>Include recommended updates </strong>and <strong>Never Check Updates.</strong></li><li>Select<strong> Never check updates </strong>and<strong> Restart the computer</strong></li></ol>
<p>If the issue persist then it is not component of Windows Update.</p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><p>Update.exe or updrgui.exe may also be a component of Avira Antivirus Product Updater. So, I would recommend you to uninstall the Avira Antivirus program and check if its helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: <span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable/remove your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable/completely remove it
 to install other software, you should re-enable/install it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled/removed, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist then I would recommend you to Run Microsoft Safety Scanner to check if its helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you confirm that Windows 10 Home edition cannot use Remote Desktop as a way of remotely accessing a Windows 10 Home because it does not come with a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Terminal Service License</span>? In my experience with Windows 10 Home after an update pushed out in April of 2017, it appears that you need to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro to acquire a Terminal Service license. Is that
 true?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, how many Terminal Service licenses does Windows 10 Pro allow for vs a server?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            Ciao Jenna,

yes, it's Windows version related issue.

Just to clarify that the workaround I forwarded is perfectly legitimate -even not suitable for an enterprise environment, as it shouldn't Windows Home editions.

Hope this helps you somehow!

Ciao and thanks
Ugo
