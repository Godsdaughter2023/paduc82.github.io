<h2>            Ctrl C and V are not working properly</h2>
                    <p>I'm running off of windows 10 on a Microsoft Surface Pro 4. I'm also using the Microsoft edge browser. Never posted before so forgive me if I don't know some stuff. I've done a quick search but have not come across the same problem I am having. The copy
 and paste functions seem to working properly on most web pages but I've found that these functions don't work properly when there is a video player in the browser. When I hit Ctrl C to copy something it reloads the web page instead of copying?? If I hit Ctrl
 R is reloads the page right away where as Ctrl C reloads the page after a couple of seconds. I've also noticed that the copy and paste functions weren't working as I built a business page on Facebook. From what I noticed I don't have this problem on Chrome
 but I haven't tested it fully yet. I believe that I have the latest updates. Is there something that I'm unaware of that is happening? Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Backup Error 0x8078011E - Windows 8</h2>
                    I have a Dell laptop running Windows 8 and just started getting&nbsp;backup error message 0x8078011E "Windows Backup failed to get an exclusive lock on the EFI system partition (ESP)".&nbsp; Even though I get this "Backup Failed" message, when I select "Restore"
 (files or folders) everything seems to be there and I am able to access the files.&nbsp; So I'm not sure just what files (if any) are not being backed up.&nbsp; Would appreciate any advice on this.

<h3> rock iguana1  say:</h3>
<h2>            That didn&#39;t work. Sorry, try that again message.</h2>
                    <p>So I tried logging on a few days ago and found that I can't do anything on my  Xbox except for playing games. For some reason every time I try to access clubs, my profile, friends profiles, and my game clips it keeps popping up with the "That didn't work sorry, give it another try" message. When I go to the sign in tab it shows a small orange triangle with an explanation&nbsp;mark in it next to my gamer tag, and like I said I can't access my profile without that message popping up. &nbsp;I do have Xbox live membership so that's not the problem. So I checked my network and multiplayer connection and it says that" it is all good". &nbsp;So multiplayer works apparently even though I can't join my friends game or party. I have also have&nbsp;hard restarted my Xbox multiple times yet the problem still remains. Dose anyone have the same problem? And can anyone please give me some&nbsp;suggestions, thank you.</p>

</p><p>Hi Robbie, </p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to know more about the issue, kindly verify the following: </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How many Bluetooth devices are connected when you get this error? </li><li>Have you done any recent updates or changes to your computer? </li></ul>
<p>Usually, when there is more than one Bluetooth devices working simultaneously on the computer, the bandwidth is shared. If there is a low bandwidth, there is a possibility that you might get a poor quality when using a Bluetooth headset or speaker.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you update your drivers to the latest Windows 10 compatible drivers, visit this

            <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Only one bluetooth connected at a time</p>
<p>2) This problem has been happening since I had the laptop, so all regular updates have not changed the issue</p>

            <p>There is not much I can do regarding positioning your devices but try whatever you can.&nbsp; If it is interference from the WiFi that doesn't happen very often and needs strong signals to cause the interference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On most systems, the wireless and Bluetooth are on the same card.&nbsp; Possibly you might consider changing that out in case the card is the problem.&nbsp; You might even look at the card and make sure the antenna connections are secure.&nbsp; The interference may even
 be from another source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try disconnecting the speakers and let them pair again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be interesting to know if you take the computer and speakers in another room if the situation continues.</p>

            I have similar problem with OP. My bluetooth audio stutter when I use the internet via wifi. The problem stops when I stop browsing/streaming. I think bluetooth use the same bandwidth with wifi to connect with my laptop or something like that, causing
 the data received from the internet choke the data bandwidth sent to bluetooth speaker.

            Hey I found a solution that works for me. I installed bluestacks on my windows 10 PC to run android virtually. Had all my music there and installed jet audio apk. Now i have my music playing via Bluetooth on my sony home theater without stutter, lag or
 whatever else you had called-hiccups. I am sure other virtual software would lead to the same results.&nbsp;

<h2>            Skype - again</h2>
                    I get it Microsoft, your amazing, you know better than everyone about what we want. You bought Skype and decided to make it your own, I get it I do. But you've seriously said 'stuff you' to your customer base. At least we used to be able to download the
 old versions and ignore your updated less functional, awkward and frankly amateur version of Skype. It was great because for those of us that enjoyed making little conference calls whilst gaming we could control how much the game was muted, your store version
 we cannot its completely muted, which is useless. At least when we had the original version, we could see our contacts in a really easy user friendly way, now we've reverted back to the 70's phone-book, I know retro has a bit of a fashion statement, sadly
 not with Skype, retro is just over complicated and a complete pain. I know, I know, you probably have no allegiance to the old version of Skype, and you probably had a party, you probably invited Bill out of retirement to share the

    <title>Is there STILL no way to force mono sound output in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> half-def leppard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there STILL no way to force mono sound output in Windows &#40;10&#41;&#63;&#33; Am I just missing it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My apologies in advance is this reads like a rant, but I'm at my wit's end, after having scoured the Internet and audio support forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am deaf in my left ear. I also must use headphones for much of my computer time, which includes listening to music, playing games, watching YouTube videos, etc. A lot of these things playback the sound such that much or all of certain sounds are only audible
 in the left or right channel. So I'm essentially missing half of what I listen to. Changing the balance does not shift the left channel to the right, it just makes the left quieter and the right louder. This means that if I want to hear everything, I'd have
 to stuff both earbuds into my right ear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, that's not a viable option. Neither is getting a stereo-to-mono jack to physically downmix. Neither is relying on Windows Media Player, because that doesn't cover my games and browsing needs, and because frankly, I don't like it for videos or
 music, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The sound drivers for this computer and accompanying software also do not provide this option. My previous computer was able to enter a virtualization mode which at least blended parts of the two channels, but even that option is missing. Accessibility and
 Ease of Access has nothing for single-sided deaf users, or any special audio settings, for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there seriously no way to do this with software? Mac products apparently have had this option for more than a decade. Please tell me I'm missing something.</p>

                    <p>When are Microsoft going to fix '2017-09 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4038788)'. Since it installed, I can no longer put my computer into sleep mode as it crashes every time I wake it- the screen freezes and the
 only way to fix it is to restart the computor. I run an online business and need to access it at numerous times through the day so this is an absolute nightmare. I can uninstall the update but it it keeps hoovering it back up and dumps it back on the computer
 again. Is there a work arround for windows 10 Home until it get fixed. Please help. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Well you have more on your screen than I get. Mine just go dark. There are all kinds of post with all kinds of issues on this update, a lot dealing with HP but I've got a Dell XPS8700 Desktop. After looking at the update notes I thought it was Edge and reset
 my start page to MSN. That worked for a while but now if I let it go to sleep I have to do a hard reboot, sometimes after I've logged in. I've reset to restore point from 9-12 and set my computer to Never Sleep but now the update is still sitting there waiting
 for a restart. I'm just not going to restart until some kind of fix is issued. If I'm forced into it again I'll go back and reset to 9-12 once more.</p>

<p>I've found this about that too. :&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/app-readiness-service-windows-10-pro-does-this/369cb71f-b95f-4a76-abe1-ecba89d42bfe .</p>
<p>I can't believe a lot of these replies/answers are to reinstall the software. First that's a pain, second it won't stop the updates from causing the issue again. There's one guy who says basically "What's the big deal? They'll fix it sometime in another
 update."&nbsp; </p>
<p>Anyway thanks for your response. I'll give it a try if they don't come up with something. Otherwise I'll just sit on the 9-12 restore point and not do any shut downs if I don't need to. It kind of unnerves me to think it'll shut down in the middle of doing
 another restore/reset and really screw something up.</p>

            I uninstall the KB4038788 update virus (yes I'm calling it that now) in the morning which sometimes takes a couple of attempts. I can then, as you do, put the computer in sleep mode. It would be interesting to know if you experience this also- once the
 computer re-downloads KB4038788, it will wake itself every hour or so to promt you to restart the computer thus re-installing the update. I eventually cave in and just shut it down as I don't want it waking in the middle of the night. It's obviously the update
 causing the issue- when it's uninstalled there isn't an issue. I think it's disgusting that Mega corp Microsoft haven't issued even a statement about this over the five days since they screwed everything up.

<p>I actually didn't re-install the update but the message is there telling me I need to restart to finish the install. I'm fairly sure it will start the process over so I'll just try to wait it out. So far just having my computer set to NEVER go to sleep and
 staying with the 9-12 version I'm doing fine.</p>
<p>I know you are in a different position than my having an online business to run. I really don't need to be on my computer all day like you might.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can just use my laptop (Lenovo ThinkPad) which got the same update on 9-12 and doesn't seem to have any issues.</p>

<p>I have the same issue, computer locking up when coming out of sleep mode. &nbsp; After having to reboot the computer three times on 9/14 after a 9/13 KB4038788 update, I did a system restore to just prior to the update. &nbsp;All was well until the updater re-installed
 KB4038788&nbsp; again on 9/15. &nbsp;Same problem coming out of sleep mode again. &nbsp;Yesterday, I set sleep mode to 'never' and all has been well since then. &nbsp;I'll have to leave it that way until the issue is resolved unless someone comes up with a fix.</p>

<p>I have just been on the phone with Tech wizard Maria Mendosa at Microsoft for the last hour and now know what is going on. My computer is now quite old and the drivers for the Asus P5QL Pro motherboard&nbsp; are not compatible with windows 10 (they just haven't
 created a windows 10 version yet). This explains why I get an express gate error code 8C000002 and the motherboard screen on restart. Untill Asus update the drivers this will always be a problem with the KB4038788 update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was provided with a work arround which involves hiding the update. Download this from Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930/how-to-temporarily-prevent-a-driver-update-from-reinstalling-in-window</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't talk you through instillation as she did it for me but instructions are on the page- there was a clear option to select the offending update and it works a treat- wakes from sleep every time now without freezing but obviously the update is blocked
 which may cause other issues further down the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            I checked my display drivers in DM but the roll-back button is grayed out and the driver dates are well before this update, meaning they were not updated as part of KB4038788&nbsp; so apparently something else is causing this issue as well. &nbsp;I guess my choice
 is to roll back the update, use the troubleshooter and forego any security fixes or leave the sleep mode off. &nbsp;

</p><p><span>Then just have to make sure&nbsp;</span><span>KB4038788 update never gets installed but without jumping through hoops re hiding the update, it automatically installs and sits there waiting
 to bite whenever computer restarts. Cue another uninstall cycle.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This has to be affecting many people. T</span><span>here are many Asus M/Bs of this and similar vintage still in everyday operation, working quite well (absent this problem). Any chance
 of revised&nbsp;</span><span>KB4038788 being released? Or (slimmer) chance of Asus driver updates?</span></p>

<p>Okay this is odd and maybe just a fluke. I have a Dell desktop and two monitors. Nothing high tech, just using what I had on hand. One is a 25" HP thru DVI for main and one 22" LG secondary thru VGA.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday I bit the bullet after reading articles and what not and restarted my computer only to end up with the black screens again. The first time both totally black and nothing. Hard boot, nothing again. Waited about 20 minutes since some articles said
 startup was delayed. Hard boot again, got the Dell logo and spinning circles on the LG which is normal, login screen comes on the HP which is normal. Start to type in password and goes black again. I wait and still nothing. Hard boot again same thing. Trying
 to at least get to a Safe Mode option.</p>
<p>So since I'd read a lot of stuff about HP laptop issues, I turned off the HP monitor and booted. Dell logo and circles come on the LG, nothing, turned on the HP after about 10 seconds and there is the login screen. I log in, go to the updates and download/install
 the KB 4043292 update/fix they have listed for this update. So far everything is working but I'm keeping watch. I guess it "possibly" was my HP monitor all along or it could have been the video card but right now I don't care as long as it works.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            New SSHD installed and Windows doesn&#39;t boot up normally after restoring the system image</h2>
                    <p>i recently replaced my acer 5740g laptop HD with a seagate 1TB SSHD. &nbsp;I used a system image to reload the files and the operating system. &nbsp;Since then my machine boots up ok and then just freezes up, the mouse moves around but thats about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i keep getting this error code&nbsp;0x8E5E0247 if i try using 'fix problems with windows update'</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if it thinks my image file is not genuine Windows 7 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i cant run the windows activation in safe mode!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i must say i did load up a windows 7 disc which i had for my desktop machine but the image file would have deleted it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>do i need a drive for the new hard drive? it says the drive is upto date.</p>
<p>

Nothing to do with the AD User account, really.<br />
<br />
The error message you cited clearly says that the *computer* does not <br />
have a valid (it may just be disabled, though) Domain account. <br />
Therefore, no one can long into it using AD Domain credentials; the <br />
computer would not be permitted to access the domain controller to <br />
authenticate them. Each user would need a local user account.<br />

<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What happens when you try to install the update automatically?</span></p>
<p><span>The update will not install - see description of my original problem above.</span></p>

<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does it happen with this particular update or with other updates as well?</span></p>
<p><span>All recent updates - all 15 of them - installed okay although I did have a<br />
problem with a non critical update about a year ago.&nbsp; I spoke to someone<br />
on the microsoft help line.&nbsp; She took over control of my computer but<br />
could not fix it and just 'hid' it.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>

<p><span>I tried this two days ago and it didn't solve the problem.&nbsp; I just run it again and it still doesn't solve the problem although it did find one other problem, which it fixed.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
&gt; Method 2:<br />
&gt; Place the computer in a clean boot state and then try to install the<br />

I have not tried this yet as I can see it is going to take quite a lot more<br />
time.&nbsp; I will attempt this, with some trepidation..., and will get back to<br />
you.<br />

            It is 8:00 PM and after 9 hrs, and more than 20 reboots, I have finally managed to manually install the 19 'stuck' Windows 'Automatic' Update installations. I was able to install many of them individually or in small groups. Then 2 would NOT install. It
 turns out that my 'automatic updates' were not installing because Microsoft had a corrupted file on their website. Their 'fixes' failed to be sure the file my system had downloaded was complete/correct. Thankfully, some other folks out there with the same
 problem were on the trail and mentioned the file (for KB2676562) was not large enough. I located it, downloaded it again -even though my system thought it was there - extracted the files and ran it - SUCCESS. I am sure Microsoft is disappointed that installing
 a corrupted file on my computer 'automatically' did not result in me paying their geeks my hard earned dollars - just wasting my valuable time.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The problem: KB2676562 had downloaded 'automatically' as a very small (a few kb) file. Upon reading this in someone else's problem chase, I found....</div>
<div><br />
<div>The solution: I found the file on the Microsoft website, downloaded it again, viewed it to see that it was now much larger - a few mb (sorry, I did not record the numbers), extracted it and ran it. This update allowed the last remaining 'stuck' update
 (KB2707511) &nbsp;to run also.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Prayerfully there will no longer be updates 'installing' every night yet mysteriously 'not installing' - yet not 'failing - and no more update logs showing they were cancelled - by whom? I was in bed!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Is this issue occurs only in Windows Explorer or other applications as well?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to check if the scroll lock button is enabled. If it is enabled, I would suggest you to disable and check.</div>
<div>For reference:</div>
<div><strong>Change mouse settings</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-mouse-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-mouse-settings</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: System Restore</strong></div>
<div><span>Perform a System Restore to a point prior to the issue and check if that fixes the issue.</span>
<div><span><strong>What is System Restore?</strong></span> </div>

<div><span><strong>Note:</strong> When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span>Hope this information helps.</span></p>

                    <p>Oh dear,&nbsp;</p>
<p>really been having internet connection problems today. Three hours on line with Jonas @ Microsoft support. We did the whole thing: remote connection; troubleshooting etc etc. I am a home user, not techie.
</p>
<p>All seemed fine at the end, and I signed off on it. Put my laptop to sleep then &nbsp;- nightmare, "one or more Internet protocols missing" - the original problem.
</p>
<p>Have mailed Jonas of MS fame, but now poised with rope round neck and 'puter in toilet (not really!).</p>
<p>ideas please?....</p>
<p>ps have done all sorts of things - network adapter stuff, flush dns etc etc.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the complete error message? Do you receive any error code along with the error message?</span></p>

<span>When do you get this error?
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I suggest&nbsp;you to&nbsp;follow the methods mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> We need to check the status of the Internet
 Connection on your computer. Please follow the steps and let us know the status.
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Internet Connection troubleshooter.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press the <strong>
Windows Key + W</strong> on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> in the search box and then press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on <strong>view all </strong>and select <strong>Internet Connections</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Perform Network adapter troubleshooter.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>
Windows Key + W</strong> on the keyboard.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type <strong>
troubleshooting</strong> in the search tab and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>

<span>Click <strong>
Network Adapter</strong>, new window will popup.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Follow the on screen instructions</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;One of the components of the Internet
 connection on your computer is a built-in set of instructions called TCP/IP. TCP/IP can sometimes become damaged or corrupted. If you cannot connect to the Internet and you have tried all other methods to resolve the problem, TCP/IP might be causing it.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s reset the winsock entries and TCP/IP stack and to troubleshoot the issue further.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press <strong>
Windows Key + X </strong>together and select <strong>Command Prompt (admin</strong>).</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type the following command and hit Enter after each:</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>netsh winsock reset catalog</span></strong><span> (reset winsock entries)</span></p>
<p><strong><span>netsh int ip reset reset.log hit</span></strong><span> (reset TCP/IP
 stack)</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Reboot the computer and check.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step2</span></strong><span>:
<strong>Flush your computer's DNS cache.</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>From Start screen, type
<strong>command prompt</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Right-click on
<strong>Command Prompt </strong>and choose <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>At the command prompt, type the following commands. Press Enter after each command.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></strong><span><br />
<strong>ipconfig /registerdns</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /release</strong><br />
<strong>ipconfig /renew</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>

            <p>Thanks again for responding to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your questions, with answers:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
</li><li>
<p><span>What is the complete error message? Do you receive any error code along with the error message? Troubleshooter Message reads: "One or more network protocols are missing on this computer". No error code.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Is it a wired or wireless&nbsp;connection? I use both, and problem is with both connections. Usually wifi though, at the moment.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the computer? Acer Aspire V15, V3-572G-7105.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>When do you get this error? It's been happening quite a lot - all after Windows 10 'upgrade'.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>Method 1, Step 1: just ran the Internet Connection troubleshooter, took a screen shot (same problem as described above), but the screenshot upload failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1. Step 2: Network Adapter troubleshooter - "Wifi doesn't have a valid IP configuration". This is me in desperation, having tried to reset manually. I'll put it back to Auto when I figure out how!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will complete Method 2 when I've done that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>
</p><p>reset catalogue successful</p>
<p>reset log gave "resetting failed, access denied", then next line said "resetting ok"</p>
<p>DNS flush successful</p>
<p>registration initiated</p>
<p>release - no operation whilst media disconnected</p>
<p>renew &nbsp;- same response as 'release' above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After reboot, internet pages load so slowly (Ibut nternet speed is slow today) and I ran the roubleshooter and it's just come up with the original problem: "One or more network protocols are missing on this computer". This is like a virus - Not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>yesterday the MS support guy (Jonas V) suggested it was a network adapter issue, caused by an updated driver conflicting with Windows 10. After uninstalling and reinstalling it, he's now told me he's exhausted his resources and that I should speak to my
 ISP provider. I'm now having to use my iPad to report all this to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an absolutely critical connection issue for me - can you advise where we go from here?&nbsp;</p>

<span>Further update for you: my missing network protocols problem

<div>
<p><span>Here's a link to the solution i found: THANK YOU BRO67!!!!</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I've never touched RegEdit before, but was running out of alternatives. I followed this process:</span></p>
<div>
<br />
<blockquote>
<div><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Control\Nsi\{eb004a00-9b1a-11d4-9123-0050047759bc}\26</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Then right
 click on "26" and set to allow "Full Control" for everyone. The last thing you need to run is "netsh int ip reset resetlog.txt".&nbsp;</span></div>
</blockquote>
<div>
<br />
<div>
I had reset 'int ip' in previous troubleshooting, but had been denied access and I don't think it reset successfully. This post (from Bro67 on page 2) overcomes the permission problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<br />
<div>
Anyway, thank you for all your help. Maybe you could log this &amp; pass it on to other sufferers - I nearly junked this laptop and bought a MAC.....</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Creator&#39;s Update &#40;1703&#41; has extremely high - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exboxnick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Creator&#39;s Update &#40;1703&#41; has extremely high amount of processes running</h2>
                    <p>I work for a software company, so I'm no dummy when it comes to Windows things. I'll start with that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I'm not sure how much you guys pay attention, but typically, whenever I see a computer idling (no open programs) it's really rare to see over 80 processes running in the background. It does not matter if it's my own, work, business customers or personal
 friends and family. This does not matter which version Windows- 7 vs. 8/8.1 vs. 10 etc- Usually when I see over 100+ running, that's signs of a corrupt OS or issues with malware, viruses, etc, but this is different. There seem to be a lot of "Services" that're
 showing up in the Processes area. Is this "NORMAL"? I've not had the chance to dig nor do I want to spend a lot of time at home troubleshooting, but I've noticed that my "Processes" count in task manager was over 140 on my personal computer at home!!! Also,
 my RAM usage is close to 3GB out of 16GB and normally, idling I'm right at 1.5GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently going to run sfc /scannow along with maybe a few other things. Bitdefender has found no issues too. Now, I am a gamer, and so I've closed out of anything running that doesn't need to be which has brought that number down to the mid 120's (usually
 mid 70's) and that's still really high in my book. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When viewing details of task manager, I see under the processes tab, down under Windows processes, roughly 60 processes are "Service Host: _______" so maybe that's where this increase comes from. Still, I'm not too trusting of this and I'll have to review
 other workstations and personal computers to be sure. I'm not about to reload Windows, etc, too time consuming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BOTTOM LINE: has anyone else noticed this? Anyone running build 1703 "Creator's Update"? Open a Run window and type "winver" and it'll show you the OS version #. Then review task manager &gt; Performance tab and see the Processes section in the bottom middle.
 The see processes tab and look under the Windows Processes...</p>

<p>In an Insider build back in October 2016, they made some changes in how processes are run.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out the link, about half way down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2016/10/07/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-14942-for-pc/#xfIIAvGRq1b3zLIw.97</p>
<p><strong>Service hosts are split into separate processes on PCs with 3.5 GB+ of RAM:
</strong>If your PC has 3.5+ GB of memory, you may notice an increased number of processes in Task Manager. While this change may look concerning at first glance, many will be excited to find out the motivation behind this change. As the number of preinstalled
 services grew, they began to get grouped into processes known as service hosts (svchost.exe’s) with Windows 2000. Note that the recommended RAM for PC’s for this release was 256 MB, while the minimum RAM was 64MB. Because of the dramatic increase in available
 memory over the years, the memory-saving advantage of service hosts has diminished. Accordingly, ungrouping services on memory-rich (3.5+ GB of RAM) PCs running Windows now offers us the opportunity to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase reliability: When one service in a service host fails, all services in the service host fail. In other words, the service host process is terminated resulting in termination of all running services within that process. Individual service failure
 actions are then run. As you may have noticed in Task Manager before, service hosts can contain a lot of services:<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwinblogs.azureedge.net%2fwin%2f2016%2f10%2fservices_1.png" height="143" width="548" /></li><li>Increase transparency: Task Manager will now give you a better view into what is going on behind the scenes. You can now see how much CPU, Memory, Disk &amp; Network individual services are consuming.<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fwinblogs.azureedge.net%2fwin%2f2016%2f10%2fservices_2.png" height="194" width="942" /><br />
To see the name of the service, click on the left-most arrow such that the Display name drops down.&nbsp;Alternatively, right-click on the header and select ‘Command Line’ to add the Command Line column. Service names will be listed in the format ‘svchost.exe -k
 &lt;svchost name&gt; -s &lt;service name&gt;.’</li><li>Reduce servicing costs: Following reports of instability, service engineers, IT admins, and Microsoft engineers can rapidly pinpoint issues to the exact service and fix it.</li><li>Increase security: Process isolation and individual permission sets for services will increase security.</li></ol>
<p>Note that critical system services (services whose recovery require system restarts), as well as a couple of select service hosts, will remain grouped.</p>

    <title>HP LaserJet 3030 drivers for Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> win 7 frustrated  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP LaserJet 3030 drivers for Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 and the HP Drivers for scanning on our HP LaserJet 3030 don't appear to like each other on our new HP Pavillion e9300z Desktop. Even though Windows updater says we have the latest.</p>
<p>Essentially, the scanning process on the HP LaserJet 3030 is now as slow as molasses and sometimes in the middle will stop and close Adobe Acrobat 9 down - the program we use to capture the PDF file.</p>
<p>Don't have this problem using Windows XP Pro with the same version of Adobe Acrobat on a Dell 8300 Dimension&nbsp; Desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not sure where the problem lies - have checked drivers for the Laserjet and HP PC.</p>
<p>Would sincerely appreciate any insight someone may have.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            We have checked the touchpad settings before. Today when we opened the laptop again, the touchpad has completely stopped working. We can only select using the touchscreen.

            <p><span>Hi Daniel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How did you remove the virus?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Error 1706</span></b><span>
 appears when you install a Windows Installer (MSI) package from removable media, such as a CD-ROM or DVD, and the MSI file doesn't reside on the root folder of the media. In your case, the system is trying to configure Common.msi and trying to access the source
 files from CD-ROM.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Good to know that you have already removed the virus on the computer. However, I would suggest you to
 run <b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> for any spyware or malware infections.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 The <b>Microsoft Safety Scanner</b> expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again. Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting
 the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Try to restart your computer in
<b>Safe mode</b> where in the computer will start with minimal set of drivers and programs and check if you still get the error:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link to use the system file checker tool (sfc) to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system
 files in Windows:</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files
 on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></b></p>

<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the issue occur with all the programs?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to restart your computer in a clean boot state to check if any third party application
 is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts:</span></p>
<p><b><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></b></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b>” to return the computer to a
<b>Normal startup</b> mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if that resolves the issue:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention
 with this tool was to recover a deleted non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Important</span></b><span>: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found, then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on that sector might be lost.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><b><span>Custom Install Disclaimer</span></b><span>: If you don't format the hard disk during installation, data files are saved to a
<font><b>Windows.old folder</b> on the partition you installed Windows 7.<span> </span>
</font>However, you should still back up the files. If you have data files that are encrypted, you might not be able to access them after installing Windows 7. If you've backed up your data files and then restored them after installing Windows 7, you can delete
 the Windows.old folder.</span></font></p>
