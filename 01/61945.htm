<h2>            Microsoft keep enabling hidden updates&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have now 2 time's gone through the process of Uninstalling &amp; hiding 2 updates. KB2952664 &amp; KB3035583 which are those that download windows 10 upgrade setup files. I now have 2 of the same updates hidden. Same name, different file sizes! This is happening
 on all my companies machines &amp; I am sick to death of having windows 10 pushed down our throats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wan't to make it clear. I do not want windows 10. I don't want to be encouraged to upgrade to windows 10 &amp; I don't wan't to wake up the next day to find out you have found another way to get windows 10 onto my systems. When I install windows 10 on any
 of my companies machines it will be when I decide to do so &amp; not you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop pushing windows 10 &amp; making life as uncomfortable as possible by secretly issuing the same files to initiate windows 10. I already had one laptop reboot &amp; when it restarted it had windows 10 &amp; it lost data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a Company owner of over 300 staff &amp; 180 machines running windows 7. I will make it very clear! Stop or I will see what legal options we have to make you stop!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company own windows 7 &amp; are happy with windows 7. We have apps &amp; software designed to run on windows 7 that is not compatible with windows 10. You have no right to dictate what operating system we want to use &amp; I'm pretty confident in some way you are
 breaking UK law or some EU law by persistently trying to get us to upgrade &amp; in some case's without permission.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just stop!</p>

            <p><em><strong>Please understand that I and many of the people who respond in this forum are not Microsoft employees.&nbsp; Just guys with a lot of experience offering help to people.&nbsp;
</strong></em>I support 150 client computers myself.&nbsp; None of my clients want windows 10 either.&nbsp; They all use Windows 7, and are delighted to keep it, as you are.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have advised my clients to do what I have dreaded doing for years -- turn off Automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The problem is compounded by an incessant drive by Microsoft to install Windows 10 on your computer without your permission.&nbsp; They keep re-installing KB3035583 (that is the enabler) on your
 computer, even if you uninstall it.&nbsp; The result is the huge download and then constant nags without an apparent way to say no.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So I have advised my clients to shut down WU.&nbsp; Once a month on the 2nd Tuesday, they will get an email from me advising to manually start WU and then to reject specific updates like KB3035583.&nbsp;
 Then update.&nbsp; WU remains on NEVER. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some may scoff at this idea.&nbsp; Well they are incorrect.&nbsp; Never means you are never giving Microsoft a chance to decide what you download and install.&nbsp; It does NOT mean you will never update.&nbsp;
 The difference is that now you take on the responsibility of updating.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some may believe that Microsoft would not do such a stupid thing.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You must read Woody Leonhard (one of the most respected writers in the trade)<span>&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2983777/microsoft-windows/how-to-clean-the-windows-10-crapware-off-your-windows-7-or-81-pc.html?nsdr=true</a>
 Woody calls the Windows 10 download “crapware.”</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you see the Windows flag on the bottom right of your screen, chances are pretty high, your computer already has the Win10 file.&nbsp;Even if you do not, it may be on your computer by now anyway.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Here are instructions on how to rid yourself of it:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using windows 7, and have
<strong><span>not</span></strong> installed win10 and do not want it, here is a procedure that I have used many times and it works.</span><span><span>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, I am aware that this site isn't manned by Microsoft technical staff but I am aware they they do take note so I wanted to basically express my feelings directly to them &amp; not as a question for help.<br />
</p>
<p>I do exactly what you do but my systems are managed by myself &amp; 3 other tech guys &amp; that's over 180 machine's we check &amp; managed. They all have custom software running for our own needs &amp; we locked the user's directly out of window functions so they cant
 use social networking or anything that can run the risk of compromising the security of the systems so we do all the technical stuff ourselves &amp; do this over &amp; over is making my blood boil. This has already made me ask our software dev if the same software
 can run on linux. He's yet to get back if it can be rewrote to work easily enough &amp; have seamless transgression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like windows. We absolutely loved Windows XP &amp; for all those years it was out without being replaced we got accustomed as many of us have with having control over our own systems. We skipped vista &amp; jumped to windows 7 &amp; we now love it. But, now windows
 10 is here, Microsoft is slowly eroding our control over our own machines &amp; this is why as a company for the foreseeable future will not be taking up windows 10 for 1 reason only. I like full control over our own systems &amp; not give it to someone else!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just come up with an idea writing this.. manually downloading the security updates after checking their purpose &amp; having them issued network wide for install. I'm sure our dev guy can come up with a delivery system.<br />
<br />
When Microsoft said windows 10 upgrade would be free. I bet we all got a bit of a smile on our face's when they said that. But personally, Free indicates choice! So far we have very little choice about it!</p>

            I think you need to speak directly to a Microsoft rep.&nbsp; You are a big enough account.&nbsp; I believe there is a way to setup and use an update server that would give you total control.&nbsp; There are thousands of corporations your size that have this problem.&nbsp;
 Having spent years in corporate IT, I know full well how much Win10 is something you sure don't want.&nbsp; I don't know of any self-respecting, knowledgeable IT guy who wants to keep his job that would allow Win10 in.

            <p>I agree with the above and Do Not want Win 10 on any of my PC </p>
<p>Updates have been Shut off</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. KB 2952664- a secret snooping patch first pushed to Windows 7 back in April.
<br />
<br />
2. KB 2976978 – last issued in June, it is a scanner which sends diagnostics to Microsoft from CEIP participants.
<br />
<br />
3. KB 2977759 – another diagnostic scanner, this one analyses computers to see whether their hardware is compatible for upgrades to Windows 10 and sends the data to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
4. KB 3035583 – this patch contains the infamous ‘Get Windows 10’ nagware pop-up which anyone who hasn’t upgraded to Windows 10 will likely have disabled by now. Well Microsoft thinks you need reminding, because now it has been reclassified as ‘Important’ and
 will therefore install automatically. So prepare for those Get Windows 10 pop-ups to start appearing again.<br />
<br />
Windows 10 Upgrade Pressure Is Excessive &lt;&nbsp; STOP IT<br />
<br />
In fact these four re-releases come just one month after Microsoft formally admitted it has started automatically downloading the full Windows 10 upgrade (over 3GB) onto all Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers – even for users who specifically stated they
<strong>do not want to upgrade.</strong><br />
<br />
This info was found on several websites</p>

            <p>I can see legal action being taken not just by my company but many others over this forcefulnes of Microsoft pushing Windows 10 down our throats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has a Samsung R505 laptop he uses for collage. It's not a modern laptop but it's more than good enough for all his word processing needs &amp; has a SSD so it's pretty nifty on top of the fact I have upgraded it's CPU to the max model it will take with
 windows 7 Pro on it. Now the problem is, I attempted to upgrade it to windows 10 for him as he wanted to try it &amp; it just wouldn't work. 9/10 time's it would stick at the windows loading screen &amp; then take about half an hour to allow the desktop to be usable.
 So, I reverted back to windows 7 &amp; removed all the updates related to windows 10. He was using it the other day &amp; he turned it off but closed the lid before it actually shut down. He woke up in the morning with windows 10! This has led me to turn off windows
 updates for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this course of action appalling by Microsoft as not only are they changing updates &amp; re classing them as important, also automatically doing the upgrade without permission but they are pushing this **** onto hardware that doesn't work with windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already consulted my legal team &amp; they have been looking into this &amp; so far they think there is a case to answer because Microsoft do not have the right to forcibly push a operating system onto a user of a windows they already own or onto hardware that
 does not support. But they, as far as my legal debt so far aware are breaching Consumer rights of choice. Also Microsoft do not own the hardware or have any right to store any data on our hardware without our permission. Which brings me to having windows 10
 downloaded &amp; stored onto our HDD's discreetly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 180 machines with windows 7 on them. Imagen the bottleneck created by having them all downloading windows 10 discreetly in the background without our permission.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Font is pixelated in Modern UI Apps</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was looking at this forum and it made me realise just how ugly and pixelated the fonts in the Modern UI apps appear.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've looked a bit on the web with no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the latest drivers (ATI) installed. I've also tried to install the beta of the next version but again that did not change anything.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can any one help? I'd like the fonts to be sharp as they should be</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's a link to a screenshot so you can equate what I'm talking about:</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, other than the fact that reinstalling the drivers in Windows 7 mode took in excess of 2 hours, the problem remains.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I'm typing I see that this box has the same fonts as the Modern UI apps and here it's crystal clear and beautiful. I'd really like this to be the case in the apps as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did try to switch power plans but didn't mess around creating another power plan as I fail to see what it would change. Can you explain? Right now, I'm at High Performance mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you very much!</div>

<h2>            Intel 8750H CPU stuck in C2 c state after waking up from S3 sleep &#91;bug&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Following bug report, tested on two different laptops. One is Dell XPS 15 9570, the other a Lenovo both having Intel 8750H CPU. Please, can some MPV/community user give this bug report to intern MS team for bug report, because I tried reporting it before
 over the Feedback tool and it just gets ignored or no up votes because&nbsp;people have no insight into this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to reproduce:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. activate S3</p>
<p>2. put the laptop to S3</p>
<p>3. wake up from S3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now CPU is bugged and stuck in C2 state and wont go lower anymore, and package power idle drain is about 1.6W instead of 0.4W. You have to reboot Windows to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How it should be:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88386140-4e63-4090-9a54-badfbcbbe755?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88386140-4e63-4090-9a54-badfbcbbe755?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Package stuck in C2 after S3 wake up:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01f13f98-3f88-4877-bafe-6048c14c7040?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/01f13f98-3f88-4877-bafe-6048c14c7040?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that if you activate hybrid sleep, the issue doesnt&nbsp;occure. It also doesnt happen obviously with hibernate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed a glitch&nbsp;randomly happening after S3 wake up, that the screen sometimes will flicker black. You also have to reboot Windows 10 for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 64bit 1803, latest version.</p>

<h2>            Trying to map the &#34;Tab&#34; keyboard button to my Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer 2.0</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I didn't know where else to post this question, but I figured this may be a good start. &nbsp;I have a customer whose old PC had the Microsoft Mouse (IntelliPoint 5.2) software utility configured so that when she right clicked (anywhere in Windows), the
 computer understood the command as a strike on the Tab key. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Inside of Microsoft (IntelliPoint) Mouse software utility, I can map all kinds of things (CTRL+V instead of a right click, etc). But when I strike the tab key, the cursor simply moves from the "Input keystroke" field to the next tab-stoppable button
 (incidentally, it's "Cancel" in the dialog box for keymapping).&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The technician before me had used a registry edit that appears to re-map or somehow modify the tab key's function, but I don't understand it.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>Any suggestions? Thank you. Really. I can post the registry file or email it for verification.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p>This morning, after I downloaded and installed all the 8.0 system updates, I upgraded from the windows store once again and this time had no issues. So take note, update your 8.0 system files prior to downloading 8.1.</p>

    <title>How can I remove the Windows 7 Operating System from My Computer when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrismur  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I remove the Windows 7 Operating System from My Computer when Computer is not working &#63;</h2>
                    <p>"Hello", &nbsp;&nbsp; My Computer / Windows 7 Operating System had some kind of Very serious fault which has caused it to not work - ALL of the Reboot options have been tried and did not work&nbsp; -&nbsp; tried by Friends who know more about Computing than Me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a complete `Novice` in Computing having had NO Training whatsoever&nbsp; -&nbsp; I am Self Taught - only in the basics of Internet Browsing - Emailing - Creating Files etc.</p>
<p>I have been told by those Friends&nbsp;who know far more about Computing / Computers than I do [although NOT Experts] that I should try and find out how to Remove the Windows 7 [Home Premium] Operating System and then Purchase Windows 7 Home Premium on a Disc
 to then Install on My Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I questioned HOW I could remove the Operating System when I cannot even Start Up My Computer&nbsp; -&nbsp; this is why I am asking this question on the Forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am under the impression that removing the Windows 7 Operating System and Re-Installing Windows 7 from a Purchased Disc is the ONLY way that I will be able to get My Computer working again [?].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason that I will have to purchase a Copy of Windows 7 Home Premium is because what is `On` My Computer is from an Upgrade Disc&nbsp; -&nbsp; When I purchased My Computer it had Windows Vista Installed&nbsp; -&nbsp; because this was just after Windows 7 was released I
 was entitled to receive a Free Upgrade to Windows 7 - I obtained this Upgrade on a Disc arranged by My Computer`s Manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would really appreciate Help with this Please&nbsp; -&nbsp; I would need `Step by Step` Instructions as I have VERY little Computing experience&nbsp; -&nbsp; Also I will not be able to answer Technical Questions about what happened to My Computer&nbsp; -&nbsp; It started with a Blue
 Screen and Error Message which stated: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>STOP: c000021a&nbsp; [Fatal System Error]&nbsp;&nbsp; The initial session process or system process terminated unexpectedly with a status of 0x00000000&nbsp; [0xc0000001 0x0010056c]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system has been shut down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope that I will be able to Remove and Re-Install the Windows 7 Operating System&nbsp; -&nbsp; But I am doubtful about this because I cannot even Boot Up / Start My Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>IF there IS a way that a Computer Technician could do this [If too complicated for Me / Novice] I would then be prepared to take the Computer to PC World or a similar `PC Repair` Company and also purchase the Windows 7 Operating System on a Disc for them
 to Install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I don`t want to do is to take My Computer to a Technician / Company only for them to inform Me that&nbsp;&nbsp; -&nbsp; `As the Operating System is Compromised it cannot be Repaired`&nbsp; and charge Me for something that I already know&nbsp; -&nbsp; also I would not want to purchase
 the Windows 7 Operating System on a Disc IF I cannot then use it to install on My Computer&nbsp; -&nbsp; As IF I have to buy another Computer this will already have the Windows 7 Home Premium pre-installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading this long Post&nbsp; -&nbsp; I wanted to try and fully explain what I am asking about and Why I am asking this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Chris,</p>
<p>I <em>have</em> tried to make allowances for your IT literacy as far as is possible with the written word.</p>
<p>I am still none the wiser for your attempts to explain, in fact I am even more confused. You say that...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&nbsp;meant that I do NOT have the Windows Vista Operating System `ON` A DVD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I do have Windows `Repair Discs` that I Burned immediately upon Starting Up My Computer for the First Time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You also you say...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I meant that I do NOT have the Windows 7 Home Premium Operating System `ON` A DVD</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...and...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was entitled to receive a Free Upgrade to Windows 7 - I obtained this Upgrade on a Disc arranged by My Computer`s Manufacturer.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Going back to your original question...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>IF there IS a way that a Computer Technician could do this [If too complicated for Me / Novice] I would then be prepared to take the Computer to PC World or a similar `PC Repair` Company and also purchase the Windows 7 Operating System on a Disc for them

<p>&nbsp;Chris</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...which I believe that I have answered with...</p>
<p>To summarise what I believe ought to be achievable by a repair facility...</p>
<ol>
<li>Replacement of any parts found to be faulty (obviously there will be hardware costs and labour costs here)</li><li>Re-installation of either Vista or Windows 7 without the need to purchase any additional OS licences (i.e. you should only need to incur labour costs here)</li><li>Recovery of data on your hard disk, assuming that there is no hardware fault and that nothing has been erased by your friends (again only a labour charge should be incurred)</li><li>If there is a hard disk fault, data recovery may still be possible (but the costs quoted may be prohibitive)</li></ol>
<p>The above does assume a positive interpretation to your contradictory statements. A computer repair facility will be able to examine exactly what you do have (which I cannot) and tell you whether or not they can repair your PC on your terms. A reputable&nbsp;establishment
 should not charge you for this assessment.</p>
<p>With regret I believe that a repair facility is the right route for you. To attempt to get you to repair yourself via this forum is, in my opinion, frought with the possibility of an unsatisfactory outcome and a lot of wasted time for both of us.</p>
<p>Tricky<br />

<p>I have not said that you were careless and nor do I think that. I have attributed the contradictions&nbsp;to your (self professed) lack of understanding of matters related to&nbsp;IT. Whilst the contradictions are understandable, to me they are an indicator that,&nbsp;at
 least in this matter, this forum is not an appropriate way to effect resolution.</p>

    <title>Error message when attempting to create Exchange email in Outlook. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> attagirl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message when attempting to create Exchange email in Outlook.  &#34;Exchange Server is unavailable&#34;</h2>
                    &nbsp;Exchange server address and Name are entered correct but are not underlined. When I click "Next" I get the message: "The connection to Microsoft exchange is unavailable.&nbsp; Outlook must be connected or online to complete this action." When I click OK to
 that, a Microsoft Exhange window pops up with just a General tab and two fields for "Microsoft Exchange&nbsp; Server" and "Mail Box". Both entries are correct but not underlined (as they should be). If I click on "Check name" for the Mail Box field, the original
 error message: "The connection to Microsoft exchange is unavailable.&nbsp; Outlook must be connected or online to complete this action" appears again. If I click on "OK" in the Exchange server window, the next error message reads: "Your server or mailbox names
 cannot be resolved". All of the suggestions in for similar errors I could find on the internet did not resolve my problem.

            In order to use Outlook with an Exchange Server, you have to be connected to the same physical network as the server. &nbsp;Without help from the Exchange Server administrator, you cannot connect to an Exchange Server over the Internet. &nbsp;An&nbsp;Exchange&nbsp;Server
 can be setup to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;this through a methodology called "RPC over HTTP" (otherwise known as Outlook Anywhere), but the&nbsp;administrator&nbsp;must enable and set this up, plus, he must give you specific instructions on how to setup Outlook to work with it. &nbsp;Otherwise,
 you must either establish a VPN tunnel to your work network (so you're physically connected to the same network as the server), or use Outlook Web Access with a web&nbsp;browser (again, provided the administrator has enabled and set this up, see him for instructions).

            So&nbsp;your traveling with a laptop on another ISP? If thats the case then its probably the guest ISP blocking email to your personal ISP as an antispam measure. You could either...
<ul>
<li>Check with your personal ISP to see if they provide both SMTP authentication and an alternate SMTP port to use. For example Cox HSI, my ISP, uses SMTP Auth and an alternate SMTP Port, TCP Port 465, so I can send email anywhere while traveling...</li><li>Use web based email from your ISP which gets around those restrictions.</li><li>If your ISP does not have a web base email then setup a free Gmail account as a temporary measure to send/receive emails. You can also setup Gmail to forward email to/from your regular account using the Mail Fetcher and&nbsp;Forward&nbsp;features.</li></ul>

<p><br />
Unfortunately, there is no "Windows Classic Theme" that is available with the new Windows 8.1 Operating System.</p>

<h2>            mass effect or bioshock&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>i've been looking at some games i've wanted to get. With two that caught my attention, not to mention there are new installments coming out for both bioshock and mass effect this year. i wanted to know your guys's opinions of which one i would enjoy more.
 I like fps but i stopped playing cod last summer and I'm beginning to try games out of my comfort zone. Hell i just got skyrim and i've never been much of a rpg fan, but i've really been enjoying it. thanks</p>

<p>Skyrim is awesome......I have friends who usually only play soccer or FPS that love that game. To your question both are great games in there own rights and as awesome as ME is bioshock is an experience in its own, atmosphere, characters the music oh and
 the game is just beautiful plus it's a little closer to FPS than ME is but adds all the things I mentioned and is fun to play. The ME experience is just as fun the plot missions are great, the assignments are so-so but it also has great characters and the
 RPG side isn't such a noose you can just get on and play the game without worrying about optimal load outs it just makes the game more personal to you. Still Bioshock just takes it for me personally, just.....</p>

<p>Mass Effect by far. I have played both and Bioshock was great. You cannot beat ME though, for one it's replay value. There are so many things you can do and your actions carry over to ME2 and eventually on to ME3.</p>

<p>As Tyador Borlu said it depends on what you are looking for because both games are quite different. I purchased Bioshock 1 probably just over two years ago (I got it with Eldar Scrolls: Oblivion in a two game edition, I can't remember what I paid but I'm
 sure that it was less than £15. Just check out the retailers like the amazons etc and the various superstores now and again as you can get some great offers) and love it. It is a good FPS with a good bit of character customization/developement, an interesting
 backstory which unfolds as you progress and you also find lots of recordings and files which give more of the background to what has occured, and it has great atmosphere, characters etc. I picked up Mass Effect 1 about four days ago as, like yourself, I was
 looking for something abit different. I do like RPGs but I'm a staunch swords and sorcery type gamer, the idea of a futuristic RPG used to make me shiver (this is probably because way back when I was a young gamer, I'm nearly 40 now so consoles were pretty
 young then lol, I purchased one of the earlyish Final Fantasies, 4 or 5 I think, and to be honest it was god awful!! I thought I'd picked up one of the Pokemon games by mistake, not that they're bad it's just that I like a little bit of believability in the
 races with which you interact. (BTW another reason why I never took to or would recommend the Halo game, bleedin comedy monkey-turtles destroying the universe? I don't think so!!!!) So with that in mind I wasn't holding out much hope for ME1 but so far I haven't
 been able to put it down! It has been quite in depth thus far but I like to talk to everyone, read all the data logs etc, so I guess if you skip all that then you could probably get through it quicker but you'd miss out on so much. The action side of it is
 pretty good although your allies can get quite annoying in a fire-fight as they'll sometimes get infront of your line of fire or charge ahead when you want to be a bit stealthy. But that aside I'm very impressed with it . So get both if you can otherwise Bioshock
 if you only have shortish periods of gametime or Mass Effect if you have all the time in the world (Aha cue for a song! lol)</p>

<p>If you are trying games out of your comfort zone then Mass Effect is definitely something to try. Bioshock is beautiful and is presented really well but it still will give you that first person perspective gameplay. While it is different from shooters such
 as those in the Call of Duty series, I think you should give Mass Effect a shot.</p>

<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007A<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x7A: KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR<br />
<br />
</strong>The KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check has a value of 0x0000007A. This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.
</p>
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
<br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<strong>Cause</strong><br />
<br />
Frequently, you can determine the cause of the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check from the error status (Parameter 2). Some common status codes include the following:
<ul>
<li>
<p>0xC000009A, or STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, indicates a lack of nonpaged pool resources.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009C, or STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR, typically indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000016A, or STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000185, or STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR, indicates improper termination or defective cabling on SCSI devices or that two devices are trying to use the same IRQ.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC000000E, or STATUS_NO_SUCH_DEVICE, indicates a hardware failure or an incorrect drive configuration. Check your cables and check the drive with the diagnostic utility available from your drive manufacturer. If you are using older PATA (IDE) drives, this
 status code can indicate an incorrect master/subordinate drive configuration.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>These status codes are the most common ones that have specific causes. For more information about other possible status codes that can be returned, see the Ntstatus.h file in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><br />
Another common cause of this error message is defective hardware or failing RAM.</p>
<p>A virus infection can also cause this bug check. <br />
<br />
<strong>Resolution</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Resolving a bad block problem:</strong> An I/O status code of 0xC000009C or 0xC000016A typically indicates that the data could not be read from the disk because of a bad block (sector). If you can restart the computer after the error, Autochk runs automatically
 and attempts to map the bad sector to prevent it from being used anymore. </p>
<p><br />
If Autochk does not scan the hard disk for errors, you can manually start the disk scanner. Run
<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> on the system partition. You must restart the computer before the disk scan begins. If you cannot start the computer because of the error, use the Recovery Console and run
<strong>Chkdsk /r</strong>. </p>
<p><strong><br />
Warning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; If your system partition is formatted with the FAT file system, the long file names that the Windows operating system uses might be damaged if you use Scandisk or another MS-DOS-based hard disk tool to verify the integrity of your hard disk
 from MS-DOS. Always use the version of Chkdsk that matches your version of Windows.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a defective hardware problem:</strong> If the I/O status is C0000185 and the paging file is on an SCSI disk, check the disk cabling and SCSI termination for problems.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a failing RAM problem:</strong> Run the hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies, especially the memory scanner. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><br />
Check that all the adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p><br />
Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve this error.</p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</p>
<p><br />
If the preceding steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can cause this error.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a virus infection:</strong> Check your computer for viruses by using any up-to-date, commercial virus scanning software that examines the Master Boot Record of the hard disk. All Windows file systems can be infected by viruses.

=============================<br />
<br />
</p>
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
TDSSKiller.exe. - Download to the Desktop - then go to it and Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
it will show any infections in the report after running - if it will not run change the name from<br />
tdsskiller.exe to tdsskiller.com. Whether it finds anything or not does not mean you should not<br />
check with the other methods below.<br />

Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower
<br />
memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory
<br />
tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<strong>How to Run the Memory Diagnostics Tool in Windows 7</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>Could be a driver related issue though less likely than memory.</strong> Update your drivers<br />
manually by looking at System maker and Device maker's sites.</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

                    <p>With the latest Skype Update (7.40.0.103) I can no longer save an alternate ringtone. &nbsp;</p>

</p><p>After changing the ringtone to "Skype ringtone (Classic)" and pressing "Save", when going back to the Sound Options page, it has not saved the change and has reverted to the default ringtone.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before I go ahead with it (can't be living with the meek little Skype default ringtone) does this mean I will lose all settings (contact info, messaging history, and the like) in the process?</p>

<p>Thanks Ruwim.B for your prompt response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure Skype ringtone (Modern) is perfectly adequate for those who use Skype on a smartphone (glued to their ears) but for those of us of advanced years (and perhaps diminished hearing) who use Skype on desktops, its meek intrusion (at normal volume) leads
 to many missed calls and messages.&nbsp; We are then reliant on the tiny task bar indicator to eventually alert us to our loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid this deficiency detracts considerably from the value of the program (sorry App).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only hope that those who decree which bugs will and wont get fixed can be bought to realise that this particular problem is one of very practical importance to some of us and reinstating our choice is not merely required for aesthetic purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Do you get any error message when you access the short cuts?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Computers often use shortcut links to make it easier for users to locate and open files. These links are commonly placed in a folder easily accessible to users, such as a desktop folder. When
 a shortcut is created, it is given directory information and an icon. If the file associated with a shortcut is later moved, the shortcut may fail to locate the file. When this problem occurs, you need to update the shortcut's directory information. This process
 is often automated by operating systems, but in a some instances, you need to repair shortcuts manually. I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> I would suggest you to rebuild the icon cache and check if the

<h2>            Unable to search files and folders using Windows Search</h2>
                    <p><br />
<strong>Original Title:</strong> Windows search returns no results, but only for one user - other user works fine - Windows 7
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of a sudden windows search for files and folders (from windows explorer) won't return any results - even if I search in a folder with a file name that I know is in there.&nbsp; However, it does work for the other user on this system.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Things that I have tried or looked at that did not work:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>configuring folder options to defaults.</li><li>rebuilding the index</li><li><span>sfc /scannow - said "windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them.&nbsp; I have the CBS.Log file if needed.<br />
</span></li><li><span>made sure windows search was checked in "Turn windows features on or off"</span></li><li><span>Ran Windows Search Registry - it said that it fixed two things (can't tell you what they were now), but it still didn't fix the problem. When I run it again it says there are no errors.<br />
</span></li><li><span>I checked this registry key: </span><br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced&nbsp; and the key Start_SearchFiles -- which was set to 2, the default</li><li>Under Customize Start Menu - Search with public folders is selected under Search other files and libraries.</li></ul>
<p>It is still not working.&nbsp; The search box on the start menu seems to work, but not for just anything I search for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frustrated!</p>

</p><p>Anyway, it first sounded like&nbsp; genuine call centre ( phones ringing in the background, others talking) but then the person I was speaking to sounded a bit strange...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>She first asked for my phone number and email. She then sent a verification code to my email, from the following address: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp; I confirmed this code, where they then asked me to send over the documents/ receipt of where I bought the code/
 image of product key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all seemed a little odd so i ended the call, however I am now worried I may have been scammed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched this number online again, where I have seen it listed as a microsoft number, but it's nowhere on the official Microsoft website?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Not sure what to do.</p>

<h2>            I have problems using mics on headphones with my new desktop with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Problem with mics</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems using mics on headphones with my new desktop. I am using a Dell Inspiron 3847 and ive tried earbuds and headphones with line-in mics. I used a y-cable to connect them to the pc and the pc recognises headphones and mic. The sound works
 fine but when I try to use the mic, there is a clicking sound and no voice with whatever mic I use. I dont know if it is the desktop or both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 have the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a USB mic that I borrowed and it worked fine, but I would rather be able to use a normal 3.5mm jack headset. If someone could give me more info on this problem or a solution that would be great.</p>

            <p>Ok, well Methods 1 and 2 didn't work. I installed all the updates I could from the Dell website but the problem still happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron 3847 which is using a Intel Core i3-4160 CPU if thats important. I've been trying to use Apple earbuds and ive tried Infinite stereo headphones with in-line mic as well but I returned that because I thought the mic was broken. Both
 have a combined jack which I used a y-cable to connect to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do think the issue is different now, when I plug in the y-cable without the earbuds, it still recognises a mic... When I plug the earbuds without the y-cable into just the mic jack, when I test it, nothing indicates that the mic is working.. But when I
 plug the earbuds into the headphone jack, with or without the y-cable, the sound works, mic still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use the borrowed USB headset for now but not for too long. If this is simply a problem with combined jack connecting to separate jacks, I can buy a headset that has separate cords for mic and sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I do want to have a mic ready by friday so tomorrow, unless you guys tell me my pc just can't handle mics in the mic jacks right now, I'll buy a headset that has separate cords for mic and sound and see if that works. If not, Ill probably return that
 and borrow a USB headset until I can get my own.</p>

<h3> h.hoodie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello not setting up</h2>
                    <p>I previously had Hello set up with a fingerprint and pin. I was having issues with my scanner recognising the fingerprint so figured it would be easier to delete the fingerprints and start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After scanning the fingerprints, it prompts me to create a pin, but when I submit it, nothing happens. Only the "Add" button under the pin settings is available, no "change" button, so it's not that I'm getting it wrong compared to a previous pin - none
 seem to exist but it also won't let me create one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix/workaround?</p>

            Hi HH.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you cannot Add or Remove the PIN in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign in Options even after a restart, then unhide Hidden Files in File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; Folder and Search Options &gt; View tab &gt;  tick box to Show hidden Files.
<br />
<br />Browse to C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Local\Microsoft\NGC
<br />
<br />Delete or rename to NGC.old this folder to reset the PIN.
<br />
<br />
<br />You may need to first take ownership of the folder:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you delete or rename the folder it will recreate it so you can add a PIN normally in Sign-In Options.  You may need to restart the PC first.
<br />
<br />__________________________
<br />
<br />Here are additional steps for fixing Windows Hello:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup:  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />  Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options
<br />    Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />    After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />    Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />3)  Modify Group Policy Settings  (for Pro version only)
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />    Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />    Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />    Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />    Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />    Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />    Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform.  
<br />
<br />Go to the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model, Serial Number or Dell Service tag, compare the latest Biometric drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  download and install any newer,
<br />    
<br />   If no newer driver Right-click on Start button and select Device Manager.
<br />    Locate the Hello, Biometric device, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually, choose Driver tab, 
<br />    Select Update driver,  then Automatic.  
<br />    If no newer driver, choose Roll back or if not available, choose Uninstall, 
<br />    Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />    Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />    The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> 
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi H.Hoodie
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Check to make sure any third party security software that came with your computer is not enabled. Examples include:
<br />
<br />- Encryption software
<br />- Third party facial recognition software, might be conflicting with Windows built in software.
<br />- Examples of such software include HP Client security, Lenovo Fingerprint Software 
<br />
<br /> 
<br />1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings - skip this step if you are not running Windows 10 Pro/Enterprise only
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

            Hi Greg, thanks for your quick reply. I followed the steps (although using regedit always makes me nervous!) and I've been able to reset the pin. Now I'm having the same issue with the fingerprint. Is there a similar solution I can use to fix that as well,
 by deleting one of the other files to allow a fresh start?

<h2>            Unable to buy Season pass for Tales of the Borderlands.</h2>
                    
<p>is any one having a problem with purchasing the season pass? It says to download in game which I do but when I click on to purchase the season pass there is no option to purchase at all, the only thing I can do is pin it. I already have episode 1 like it
 says you need to have but I can't get my head around why it's not working at all. If any has a similar problem or a solution please let me know.</p>

<p>Same issue. &nbsp;From the looks of it, this is something that TellTale has known about since it was released. &nbsp;There is a long support thread on it, at their forums. &nbsp;I think we, who have purchased it, are in a sense, *** , because the only record of us buying
 it, is the Microsoft Purchase History. &nbsp;Since it does not download a file to our XBOX One console, the game/console will never know we have bought the liscense to the season pass. &nbsp;This in essence is online DRM. &nbsp; &nbsp; TellTale should know better, because the
 X1 storage system relies heavily on DRM liscenses being on the internal drive. &nbsp; This company may be going out of business for all we know.</p>

 either [or the internet!].</p>

<p>My desktop spkrs.&nbsp;have their own seperate volume control so of course I want to set the other ''wave'' and ''playback'' volumes at a fixed (recommended) level. thanks.</p>

<p><br />
Thank you for the PARTIAL answer but not exactly a clear and&nbsp;specific answer (especially considering how specific my questions and description was!). A link describing wave [not too advanced comp. jargon please] would be nice (anyone!).</p>
<p>&nbsp;Piecing together from what you state though, I assume wave is the sound the MS operating system uses -- except for the mentioned exceptions (with possible unmentioned others) but wave, I'll assume is MS's main sound output format! Okay so why two volume
 controls? "wave" and "playback"?</p>
<p><strong>MOST IMPORTANT of my questions though is can having wave volume on full/max volume cause any distortion?</strong></p>
<p>or playback volume when it is NOT the master?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There should be a link&nbsp;for all this, i.e., recommended volume levels for the various volume controls&nbsp;in conjuction with&nbsp;various type activities/applications with our microsoft operating system (windows xp) but I could not find anything and that's why I am
 here.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Wave is essentially what everything uses. System sounds have their own slider.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Leaving them both on max should not be an issue. “Recommended” would be whatever level you feel is comfortable. It is perfectly fine to
 set it max and lower the physical speaker volume or to lower the computer volume and increase the speaker volume.</span></p>

Fair enough, although, the issue is still in the gray&nbsp;for me. I still can find no information anywhere on this (i.e., the various volume controls). Strange that MS would even have a WAVE volume [?] and worse, have one and have basically no info anywhere about
 it. I currently have my wave and computer volumes (also WMP and any secondary volumes) at 80-85% and use my desk-top speakers as my master volume.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This way I sense less distortion but I have nothing to go by but my ears! and our ears, when detecting slight sound differences, can play tricks on us</p>
<p>Thank You Srinivas KR.</p>

            This screen for volume controls functions as a "Mixer".&nbsp; Sound can come into your computer from several sources.&nbsp; "Wave" is most common, but there is also "SW Synth" (for synthesized sounds such as .midi files), CD Player (direct audio from your CD drive),
 PC Beep, and perhaps a microphone or other external "Line" input for something plugged into the back of your computer like a tuner.&nbsp; There is a volume control that will make everything louder or softer, but you need the individual mixer controls to set the
<u>relative</u> volume for each of these inputs so that when they're combined, one input doesn't wipe out the others.&nbsp; The resulting mixture is further controlled as a whole by the Master Volume.<br />
<br />
For example, If you are playing a game on your computer, the sounds for that game will come in the "Wave" input.&nbsp; If you want to listen to your CD music while playing the game, the CD music will come in the CD channel.&nbsp; You may want to set the CD volume such
 that it is quieter and in the background so that you can hear the sounds from your game over the sound of the CD music.&nbsp; So in this case, you would want to set your Wave volume higher and your CD volume lower.&nbsp; The master volume will then adjust everything
 else up and down keeping the same relative volumes between channels.<br />
<br />
If you are only using a single audio input (wave), then it doesn't really make much of a difference where you set the control so long as you can hear it.<br />
<br />
Distortion?&nbsp; If you have ears like mine, if you don't hear any distortion, then there isn't any.&nbsp; ;-)<br />

            <p>I didnt upgrade to windows 10 version from windows 7. i wanted a clean installation, my laptop was buyed in canada so it had windows home premium 64 bits (english version) but i downloaded the windows 10 home 64 bits (spanish version) is because i was wondering
 if the language version matters in the licence activation, i cant activate with my licence OE of my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to activate by windows phone and says,&nbsp; cant activate windows by phone please contact your system administrator for more info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i change the product key i got this error:&nbsp; You are running windows home , the windows key you entered cannot be used to activate this edition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is for the language version? or it doesnt matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i downloaded the english version&nbsp; and&nbsp; i will format and install it.</p>
<p>- im trying to activate with my license OE(the sticker from my laptop which has a windows 7 home premium version)<br />
