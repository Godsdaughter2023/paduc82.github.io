&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes you can play Space Cadet Pinball on Windows 7.&nbsp; If you have a valid copy of XP you can copy the Pinball folder from your XP machine and put it on your Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; I found pinball on my XP box at this location:&nbsp; C:\Program Files\Windows NT\Pinball.
 **Note that the Program Files folder is&nbsp;a system folder and will not show it's contents&nbsp;by default.**&nbsp; I copied the entire folder and pasted it on the desktop of my Windows 7 box and it runs just fine.&nbsp; However, fullscreen mode did not look too good.&nbsp; I'm
 assuming that is because I have a wide-screen monitor and it wasn't created for those dimensions.&nbsp; In the window mode it looks just fine.&nbsp;

<p>If you go to www.rewards.xbox.com it will tell you how many points are pending and how many you should have already received. Please note you won't get your points deposited until you've earned over 100 Pending Points, they will then be deposited into your
 Xbox LIVE account by the 15th or 30th of each month. It may be a simple case of you not doing as much as you had thought to earn points, or you may have even spent them without realising. You should have recieved a statement email at the end of each month
 telling you how many points you've earned and how many are pending.</p>
<p>I hope this has helped!</p>

            Hi Ken.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This is a known issue I elevated to developers over a year ago, and only received notice recently it is not being changed.  When you establish a MS Account during install without it being able to connect to your account to access it's display name, ti creates am account with the first five letters of your MS Account email address.
<br />
<br />You can always create a new Local Admin Account with your preferred User name, move into it, from the old Account settings Change it to a Local Account to delete it, then associate your new properly named Account with the MS Account.
<br />
<br />Possibly the easiest way to deal with the permissions issue on the external or any other file or folder (besides the entire C drive, which is unsafe) is to use the Take Ownership shortcut from your Admin Account:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-take-ownership-context-menu-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3841-add-ta...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then run a Disk Check on the external drive:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also run drive diagnostics to know for sure it's condition:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps I would not give up before installing the hard drive again internally to try accessing the data that way to copy it out.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

            Try taking ownership of the files and folders on the drive:
<br />To take ownership of a file or folder
<br />
<br />    Open Windows Explorer, and then locate the file or folder you want to take ownership of.
<br />
<br />    Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, and then click the Security tab.
<br />
<br />    Click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.
<br />
<br />    Click Edit, and then do one of the following:
<br />
<br />        To change the owner to a user or group that is not listed, click Other users and groups and, in Enter the object name to select (examples), type the name of the user or group, and then click OK.
<br />
<br />        To change the owner to a user or group that is listed, in the Change owner to box, click the new owner.
<br />
<br />    (Optional) To change the owner of all subcontainers and objects within the tree, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.

            <p>What is your computer make and model?</p>
<p>Can you please post copies of the Errors reports from the Event Viewer System log?</p>
<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged
 and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report
 at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the Details tab and check the box before XML View.
 Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally
 Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer
 was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important
 and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

<div>Did you check with <a href="http://www.asus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Asus</a> ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>According to Asus there is no Bison camera in the a6vm laptop a6jm laptop has Bison camera, and there is a driver download available&nbsp;only for Windows vista 32 bit and not for Windows 7</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
You can give a&nbsp;start from here
<div><a href="http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download/download.aspx?SLanguage=en-us</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Select notebooks, A6000 series, A6Jm and</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Under cameras you can find the Bison camera driver.</div>

            Hi Gabriela.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can go into Action Center at the right end of Task bar to choose Tablet Mode.

            Hi Gabriela.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Troubleshoot touch screen issues here:

<br />
<br />If none of those help then I'd use the one-year included Support warranty that comes with every new PC to ask Asus telephone or chat Support to help you get this running properly.  During that year they need to get all problems fixed or replace the PC.  Do this early enough that you can then make sure the fixes or replacements are good.  They really like it if you wait and don't use the warranty.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />The first thing I would suggest to do is to reset the sticky notes app. 
<br />
<br />To do this you can:
<br />Open settings &gt;apps
<br />Search for "sticky notes" and select it
<br />Click advanced options
<br />Then click "reset"

            Sorry to hear!
<br />
<br />A checkmark does not appear next to the reset button after it is clicked?
<br />
<br />The next thing I would make sure is that there are no windows updates available. 
<br />
<br />And after that make sure the windows store and all apps in it are updated by: 
<br />Select the Microsoft Store Shopping bag-shaped Store icon. In Microsoft Store, select See more Three-dot More icon &gt; Downloads and updates &gt; Get updates. If an update for Microsoft Store is available, it will start installing automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br /> Then lastly run the troubleshooter for microsoft store apps here:
<br />Start Windows logo Start button button &gt; Settings Gear-shaped Settings icon &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />After all this restart your computer and see if the issue is still there.

            It sounds like you - or someone else with access to the computer - restored it to factory condition. Stop using the computer immediately. If there is any question that the drive is at fault - it's making noises for instance - and the data is crucial
 others. General prices run from $500-$3,700 with an average of around $2,700. I understand that some insurance companies are now covering data recovery costs so check with your insurer.<br />

</a><br />
<br />
 and either use it from that operating system or create a bootable cd/floppy and work with that. If you don't have the skill and/or equipment to do these procedures and the data is crucial, take the machine to a professional computer repair shop that has experience
 in doing data recovery. This will not be a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. In-shop data recovery is usually not exactly cheap (for example, my charges are generally $150-350USD), but it normally costs less than sending the drive to a company like

<p>Hi: Thanks for your input.&nbsp; Please see the addition to my initial post. The computer is a home&nbsp;laptop, so there is no chance that anyone has done a factory restore, my self included.&nbsp; Drive I believe is healthy, as I am using said laptop as we speak.&nbsp; Below
 is the copy................</p>

<p>The details about the forced quit are important. Either your computer is severely infected and/or the hard drive (or other hardware components) are failing. Now the operating system is in an unknown (scrambled state). What I would do if it were in the shop:</p>
<p>1. I would first boot with a Linux Live CD like Knoppix to see if I could find the data. If I couldn't, I would then run R-Studio to retrieve the data.</p>
<p>2. Once the data was safely on an external hard drive, I'd do hardware testing to make sure it was sound. If any components failed physical testing, I would replace them if practical (based on the age of the machine and the cost of the component).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Hardware_Tshoot</a></p>
<p>3. If the hardware was good, I'd do a clean install/factory restore of Windows because it will be too difficult to untangle Windows from the mess. There are ways to deal with a corrupted user profile ("user profile failed the logon") but it sounds like your
 computer is in worse shape than just that.</p>
<p>I must stress that you should not take what I have written as a definitive diagnosis. I cannot see or test your computer from here. I'm giving you my opinion about your computer based on my professional experience as a computer tech and on what you've written.</p>

<p>There are no significant disadvantages, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you enable hibernate, the hibernation data file must be present. Depending on your system, this file could take up anywhere from 2-10 GBs of space.</li><li>On older systems, it's beneficial to shutdown because it can&nbsp;help flush up the 'gunk' over time.
</li></ul>
<p>Otherwise, there is no disadvantage/harm to hibernating.</p>

            <p>You have got it completely wrong. The truth is that Hibernate and Sleep are two, entirely different functions, and also that Hibernate is very synonymous with Shut Down.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sleep</strong> puts your session in RAM. This is an extremely efficient power function as RAM is very snappy, and you will not experience stability problems because the system isn't completely powered off. You can think of Sleep as a pause button
 for Windows, it momentarily stops your PC, and when you're ready to go, just hit Play, and Windows will be right there waiting for you instantaneously. This mode is recommended if you are going to leave your PC for a few hours, or maybe even overnight. This
 mode draws <em>extremely </em>low amounts of power, only enough to sustain RAM. The average laptop 2-3 weeks or longer when in sleep mode.</li><li><strong>Hibernate </strong>takes your session, stores it on your HDD, and then shuts down everything<em>.
</em><em>Everything. </em>When your PC is turned back on, the system loads your previous session from the HDD. Some older systems can bog down over time because of Hibernate because memory, temporary files, and other Windows components need to be flushed, or
 refreshed, from time to time. Use this mode if you want to Shut down your PC completely, yet you have unsaved work that you don't have time to finish up. This mode does not use power at all, as it basically shuts down your PC. Therefore, it does not extend
 battery life.</li></ul>

            <p>I have never heard either of Sleep or Hibernate starting to misbehave as systems get older...&nbsp; it either works or it doesn't and if it doesn't, you figure out why and fix it.&nbsp; There are no "moving parts" involved to deteriorate or suffer in performance over
 time unless electrons start to move slower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the XP days when I had 256MB RAM (MS recommends 128MB) , I used to Hibernate all the the time since resuming was a little faster than a cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I started adding more RAM (512, 2GB, 4GB) , resuming from Hibernate started to take longer and longer because the size of the hiberfil.sys file got larger and larger (this makes sense) so when I got to 4GB RAM, it took longer to resume from Hibernate
 than it took to cold boot (~18 seconds to cold boot) so I quit hibernating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Windows 7 system I tested today it has 4GB RAM and resuming from Hibernate I timed with a stop watch and it took 94 seconds to resume and a cold boot only take 19 seconds so why Hibernate?&nbsp; The more RAM you have, the longer it will take to resume from
 Hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sleep lets you get running again faster but I never suggest Sleep for it is inherently dangerous since if you have unsaved work and files open and for some reason your system loses power, your work could be lost, files may be corrupted, etc. and that is
 not why Sleep was invented.</p>

            <p>Hi, in my experience, hibernate/suspend can become a problem when, once in hibernate/susp, the laptop is moved (either physically or logically) either to a different network or off of the network&nbsp;it was using previous to the hibernate/susp, very common in
 business scenarios. This loss / change of connection is not handled well when the laptop resumes, and can result in programs freezing and potential loss of data. Would be glad to hear your thoughts on this.</p>

            <p>If you use a password on wake there is no difference in hibernation and using shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If using a ssd = solid state drive is about the only reason to disable hibernation in windows 7 to disable unnecessary writes.</p>
<p>Amount of ram has to be considered and what programs are open for a system whether it will like or not hibernation in win-7.</p>
<p>If not using a back up battery system hibernation is a good feature </p>
<p>Power outages will happen and that is where hibernation kicks in as a good thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if over night.... I'd normally shut down there's no good reason to hibernate all night...</p>

<h2>            Just starting out...</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all...new to Black Ops...Im just trying to get some advice from the veterans here.&nbsp; Which gun is the best to start out with? I have been playing the training to build up my skills and getting owned in the real games, I realize that the skills will
 come with practice. I have no problem with my low kills at that this point. One thing I noticed is that as soon as I spot an enemy, I am just about able to get a shot off, and then I am killed. I am using the MK 16 and not sure if this is the best gun, seeing
 that is has a 3 shot burst. I was hoping to get suggestions on a better gun to be using at first. Is TDM the best game for anew person to start off with?&nbsp; I am really enjoying the game and starting to embrace the online multiplayer. I am not complaining about
 not being good at this stage, I am just looking for tips on a gun to use and perhaps the best game for a new guy to the game. If anyone else out there is in the same boat or anyone for that matter, feel free to add me, I am always looking to play! Thanks!!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; You're better off starting out with something full auto. The m16 is a great weapon at medium to long range once you get the hang of it. But if you're new, I'd suggest using the famas. The enfield is one of the first ar's you unlock and is a decent weapon
 until you get something better.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; My suggestion , however, would be to try them all out as you unlock them. While people will say the famas and the ak74u are the most powerful ones .......... wjat's most imprtant is how it feels to you and how it fits with your playstyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ghost is a good perk to use in the beginning. Later on you may decide to stick with it or use something else, but until you get the feel of things, you are better off not giving the enmy advance warnings of your presence.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As far as everything goes though ..... just experiment. dont worry about getting killed a lot, it will happen. Just pay attention to what you were doing when you die, and try not to do that any more.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Most importantly .... learn the maps. you can do it in combat training or in a private match. But knowing where you are going and where you are at will probably be the most beneficial thing. &nbsp;Once you are somewhat familiar then jump right in to ffa.
 Personally, I dont care and suggest just jumping in to whatever game mode you like, but there are those out there who get hissy about bad players on their team.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; As I said .......... &nbsp;I'm all for jumping right in to any mode. You really cant learn how to play dom, or tdm, or whatever else by playing ffa. Ya gotta play to learn. But ffa will let you learn a little about traffic patterns and getting a feel for
 the weapons, while not feeling like you have to do welll to please teammates.</p>

<p>Ground War. Big team battles so you will always be running into enemy players so you will die alot at first, but on ground war domination k/d doesn't matter much. the more skirmishes you get into the faster you &nbsp;will learn. Kind of like jumping into the

<p>Enfield, FAMAS, and Galil are all great early weapons. Like the other guy said, learning your maps is probably your best bet. I can't tell you how beneficial it is to come around a corner and already know all the possible places somebody could be sitting.
 You learn to scan high traffic camping spots and throw grenades into areas where skirmishes usually happen. You'll get better it will just take time. As somebody said above though, test out whatever weapons look interesting to you. You may love a gun a lot
 of others hate.</p>

            Hi J.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Store uses Digital Licensing in WIndows 10, which assigns a permanent Digital License to the PC stored in Microsoft Activation Servers.  So you can reinstall any time skipping the key during install and it will activate as soon as it connects to the internet.  
<br />
<br />What is the Activation Status and Edition showing at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />If unactivated run the Activation Troubleshooter in the same location and report back its findings
<br />
<br />If you sign in with your Microsoft Account it will link the DIgital License to your account so you can manage and if necessary move it to other hardware.  
<br />
<br />More about DL's here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/activation-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/a...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi J
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What you bought was the Windows 10 Pro Pack (or Easy Upgrade) for $99.
<br />
<br />You won't get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase. 
<br />
<br />If in the future you need to reinstall Windows 10 Pro, just go ahead and directly reinstall Windows 10 Pro.
<br />
<br />If you are prompted for a product key during setup, click the option 'I have a product key' 
<br />
<br />See: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Pro will automatically reactivate.

            <p>Hello Rick,<br />
<br />
Let's have that resolved. <br />
Follow the steps advised below to sort out issue with boot configuration. </p>
<p>Firstly, enable the <strong>Use original boot configuration</strong>:<br />
<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys from the Keyboard.<br />
2. Type <strong>msconfig</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
3. Click on the <strong>Boot</strong> tab.<br />
4. Under <strong>Boot options</strong> check mark on the <strong>Safe mode</strong>.<br />
5. Select the <strong>General</strong> tab.<br />
6. You can see that the <strong>Selective startup</strong> option will be selected and the
<strong>Use original boot configuration</strong> will be enabled.<br />
<br />
Then, follow the below steps to enable the Normal startup:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys from the Keyboard.<br />
2. Type <strong>msconfig</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
3. Click on the <strong>General</strong> tab.<br />
4. Select the <strong>Normal startup</strong> option.<br />
5. Click on <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Ok</strong>.<br />
6. Restart the system and check.<br />
<br />
<strong>Reference</strong>: Refer to the following Microsoft article on <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/msconfig-the-system-configuration-tool/273dea8e-4cbe-47e9-8489-f400e879ce17">
Using System Configuration (msconfig)</a>.<br />

            <p>Thanks Jane...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgive my questions but I don't want to mess anything up... clearly I'm not a computer expert.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your first steps on the boot tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under <strong>boot options </strong>I checked <strong>Safe boot </strong>it then defaults to
<strong>Minimal</strong>- Is this correct? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied this configuration and then went to the <strong>General Tab</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Selective Startup </strong>is selected.</p>
<p>The <strong>Use original boot configuration</strong> is <strong>Not</strong> selected. I needed to check it myself and it then
<strong>greyed out</strong></p>
<p>and <strong>Load System Services&nbsp;</strong>is filled with a black box and the <strong>
Load Startup Items </strong>is checked as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then applied these options</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then&nbsp;went back to the <strong>Boot Tab&nbsp;</strong>and the <strong>Safe Boot</strong> box&nbsp;is now
<strong>un-checked</strong>- Is this how it should look?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming yes, should I then do a restart before proceeding to the next set of your instructions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I very much appreciate your help.</p>

            Not a problem, Rick. The <strong>first set of steps</strong> is to <strong>enable Use of original boot configuration</strong>.
<br />
<br />
" Under boot options I checked Safe boot it then defaults to <strong>Minimal</strong>- Is this correct? " --
<strong>Yes</strong>.<br />
<br />
" Selective Startup is selected.<br />
The Use original boot configuration is Not selected. I needed to check it myself and it then greyed out and Load System Services is filled with a black box and the Load Startup Items is checked as well. " ----
<strong>Don't</strong> do any changes after clicking the <strong>Apply</strong> button in Boot tab.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After clicking <strong>Apply</strong>, go back to <strong>
General tab</strong>, make sure <strong>Selective startup</strong> is <strong>ticked</strong>. Click
<strong>OK</strong>.&nbsp; A pop up box will advise you to restart your computer for the changes to apply. Select
<strong>Restart</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>PC will boot into safe mode</strong>. <br />
<br />
You would then need to follow the <strong>second set of steps</strong> to <strong>
enable the Normal startup</strong>.

<h2>            Task bar won&#39;t move,  but is not locked</h2>
                    <br />
The operating system on my Acer Aspire 5610 is Windows Vista Home Premium. The taskbar was at the bottom of the screen,
<br />
and that was where I wanted it. I guess that the taskbar wasn't locked because it just spontaneously moved to the right side of
<br />
the screen. As far as I know, I didn't do anything to cause that to happen.<br />
<br />
I've tried to move the taskbar back to the bottom of the screen. However, it will not move even though it is not locked. I've locked
<br />
and unlocked it to see if that would allow me to move it. Unfortunately, that didn't help. The method I used to attempt the move was to
<br />
click on an empty space in the taskbar, hold the button down and try to drag the taskbar to the bottom. No Luck!<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />

            I just solved my issue with that. I rebooted (again) and then right clicked on the desktop and clicked refresh. Then I left clicked at the very bottom of the task bar and drug it to the bottom of the desktop (where I wanted it to be). Be sure to unlock
 the task bar during all this. It went where I wanted it to. I then locked the task bar.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I still haven't figured out why it jumped up to the left side of the screen in the first place. I've run several different virus scanners and no virus is being detected. Oh well, its back to normal anyway.</div>
<div><br />
<div>good luck.</div>

If you are using windows 10 don't use the drag method right click task bar select properties and select task bar location from the drop down menu.

            I faced the same problem. I had another problem. Right clicking gave settings not properties. Eventually a I found an option with drop down list for position. It said bottom but the task bar was actually a the top. So I changed it to side and it moved
 to the side. Then I changed it to bottom and it moved to bottom as I wanted. That's software I guess.

<h2>            Packet loss with Belkin G wireless router</h2>
                    Hey im having a problem with my Belkin G wireless router.&nbsp; I sometimes need to plug it in to allow someone with a laptop to connect to the internet, but as soon as i do i become unable to find servers in online games.&nbsp; When checking my connection on speedtest.net
 i came across Pingtest.net, i tried it out and found that i had an 88% packet loss.&nbsp; I have attemped to configure for DMZ with no effect... what can i do?<br />
Gateway W3650 desktop computer all standard parts<br />
Belkin G wireless router F5D7234-4 v3<br />
Webstar DPC2100 Modem<br />
<br />
it works up untill i plug in the Router

            The 'packet loss' is probably artificial due to the router's firewall.&nbsp; To check, go to http://192.168.2.1/ and click on 'Firewall' on the left side, and disable.&nbsp; Now test again, you should be get 0% loss.&nbsp; It worked for me.<br />
<br />
You may want to enable it after checking.&nbsp; I don't know that it actually reduces performance, it just makes it hard to perform that test. ...I think.
