<h2>            How to make Caps Lock behave like in a typewritter - windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my previous computer, I used to make the Caps Lock key behave like in a typewriter : to lock the capitals, you press Caps Lock key; to unlock the capitals, you press the Shift key. &nbsp;I find this match more efficient, as I learned typing on a simple mechanic
 typewriter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, on Windows 10, with my new computer, I can't find the way to get this. &nbsp;Can anyone help me ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<strong>Set your computer to turn off Caps Lock with Shift.</strong> Most versions of Windows have an option to turn Caps Lock off (but not on) using the Shift key instead of Caps Lock. Here's how:

<h2>            Disabled my wireless adapter and now I cannot enable it...</h2>
                    
<p>I was trying to connect to my home wireless router and thought maybe if i try disabling then enabling the wireless adapter it would work. However, now that i have disabled it I cannot enable it. I tried going into windows mobility to click enable but the
 wireless device didn't even show up. I know it's not a drive error because the laptop is only a week old and it was my fault for disabling it.</p>
<p>I have windows 7 and i just can't find the device so i can enable it.</p>
<p>Please help I need the wireless so I can do my work. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            No Next &#47; Previous Arrows In Windows 10 Photo</h2>
                    <p>Windows Photo isn't showing any next / previous arrows next to the photo I open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm double clicking the photo to launch it in Windows Photo. My folders are full of ONLY photos. I've tried this in different folders and I still don't get any arrows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run an Apps troubleshoot and nothing was detected. Is there a fix for this? It's really annoying to have to open photos individually.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It depends what folder you're access it from -- but you said you already tried several folders. &nbsp;Specifically I want to point out that it won't work if you open a picture file from a special location like 'Quick Access' of recent files, since that's not
 an actual folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from that, my best suggestion is to use a better photo program. &nbsp;For example, no one knows about it, but the old picture program from Windows 7 is still included. &nbsp;To use it, right-click any picture file, choose "Open With &gt; Choose New Default" and
 pick the Windows Photo Viewer program from the list, instead of this modern photos app.</p>

<p>C drive of 43Gb!</p>
<p>Other all of 63Gb each!</p>
<p>I need more space on C drive!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
So the details you previously posted were incorrect? ie;</p>
<p>Drive C - 4.92GB ...............should be 43gb</p>
<p>Drive D - 40.54GB.............................63gb</p>
<p>Drive E - 24.96GB..............................63gb</p>
<p>Drive F - 25.76GB...............................63gb</p>
<p>Drive G - 33.16GB.............................63gb</p>
<p>Your configeration still makes very little sense, or purpose&nbsp;for such a small drive</p>
<p>Move any data on D to another drive, delete D partition, Expand C to take up the resulting free space. (I'm assuming C &amp; D are adjacent)</p>
<p>Or do as I previously suggested, since you have only just installed win7, back up all data to external, clean install win7 and at the first part of win7 installation delete all partitions and install using the entire disk space</p>
</blockquote>
<p>C - 4GB free of 43GB</p>
<p>D - 63GB Free of 63GB</p>
<p>E - 21GB Free of 63GB</p>
<p>F - 25GB free of 63GB</p>
<p>G - 48GB free of 63GB!</p>
<p>here's the original thng!</p>
<p>is there any other way??!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
<p>No, but since D contains nothing why are you concerned with deleting the D partition then expanding C to utilise all the free space</p>
<p>You still dont say why you created so many partitions on such a small drive, such a configeration is rarely needed or helpfull. If any of these partitions is for backups then that is a complete waste of time/space on a single disk, as if the disk fails so
 will all partitions</p>

    <title>Windows could not start the Background Intelligent Transfer Service on - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows could not start the Background Intelligent Transfer Service on Local Computer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recently wanted to download an app from the windows store and so I clicked onto it, and it told me that I was not connected to the internet (even though I definitely was), and so that led me to try and resolve the issue. I did not alter anything, just
 simply began to search online for a resolution, and they suggested that it might have to do with the Windows Updater. When I went to settings and then to updates, I discovered that there were indeed many important updates that had not been installed (even
 though it is set to automatically update). However, when I attempted to download these updates, it got stuck on "downloading updates", with the little bar not increasing by any amount after an hour.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I ran the troubleshooter which stated there was a problem with windows updater but that it could not fix it. So I downloaded and ran WindowsUpdateDiagnostic which resolved some security issues i believe, but there was one thing that stated "not fixed" and
 that was "problems installing recent updates".<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I was running the diagnostic tool, I noticed that it was taking a while on "starting Bits service" so I went onto Services and saw that it was not "starting" or "running". After the tool finished and gave me the diagnostic, I decided to try and start
 BITS, and it gave me this error message:<br />

</p>
<p>Error Code: 2147023828 (in case the image isn't visible enough)<br />
</p>
<p>Any help would really be appreciated. I'm running Windows 8.1 x64 if that makes a difference to the solution.<br />

            <p>Hi Thomas,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for replaying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Go to <strong>Control Panel </strong>-&gt; <strong>Administrative Tools</strong> -&gt; Services and scrolled down to the bottom to find the "Windows Update" service and stop it.</p>
<div><strong>2. </strong>Then restart it again and go back to Windows Update, it will show all the available current updates. You need to deselect all the updates and select just the first two and install it, it should install successfully (reboot required).</div>
<div><strong>3 .</strong>After the reboot, chose two more and install them. Then chose 5 updates and install them. They should install successfully (reboot required).</div>
<div><strong>4. </strong>The reboot will take a long time. You may see "Configuring Windows updates" for about five minutes. After rebooting, select the remaining current updates, including an Optional driver update. They should install successfully as well
 (reboot required).</div>
<p>
</p><p>If you are connected to WIFI or your bandwidth is low then it might take some time. I suggest you to wait until all the updates are getting install.<br />
<br />
If you need more assistance, please get back to us.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I took your suggestion and created a new Notepad in Chinese. At the time I was typing it it showed the Chinese characters correctly, but after I saved and close the file, when I open it again it showed questions marks "????????" in place of Chinese characters.
 &nbsp;When I open another Notepad file containing Chinese characters created in a different computer, it showed a bunch of strange characters in stead of question marks.<br />
</p>
<p>I did also tried changed the font style under format options, but it didn't help either.</p>

            <p>I tested this: I pasted some chinese characters from charmap into notepad.</p>
<p>On saving, a message box warned me that I have to change the encoding.</p>
<p>Did you get the message box?</p>
<p>When I use "Save as", and select "unicdode", reopening the file will display chinese characters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT: notepad always uses ANSI as default, so is probably not the best choice if you have to do this more often.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            MSPaint will no longer save in png format</h2>
                    same time Paint.NET began closing as soon as i opened an image, I tried a few things I needed done on MSPaint only to find out it would error me that it could not or would not save in png format so everything with MSPaint has to be jpeg. I work with pngs.
 I am a graphic composite artist and I need the transparency. It seemed to happen a couple of window updates ago I believe, or about the time Adobe updated PS CS6 which I have lapsed for a month or two due to finances (subscription). So, the biggest issue is
 not having Paint.NET work. I have tried the clean reinstall, the repair tool etc. There doesn't seem to be one for MSPaint. ideas?

            <p>Hello Kathy,</p>
<p>PS commandeers extensions when you set it up. Have you tried releasing the PNG format from PS and re-assigning it to MS Paint? Go to Control Panel, and select Default Programs, when that screen opens select Set your default programs. That opens the window
 where "Paint" is located (not MS Paint).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

=======================================<br />
I would suspect Paint is having a problem with the <br />
.PNG graphic filter. Reinstalling the filter may be the fix.<br />
<br />
Before proceeding it would be a good idea to create a <br />
System Restore point.<br />
<br />

<br />
Since the filters are shared files...a simple reinstall of <br />
a program will not work. First the graphics filter must<br />
be found and renamed. Then a reinstall of a program<br />
that includes graphics filters should replace it.<br />
<br />
PNG filter&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; - &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; PNG32.FLT<br />
<br />
Do a search for .flt or try the following path:<br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt<br />
<br />
Example...rename the .png filter from : <br />
PNG32.FLT&nbsp; -&nbsp; to:&nbsp; PNG32.OLD<br />
<br />
Now install a program that includes graphics filters...<br />
<br />
The freeware IrfanView for example.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

            I actually completely uninstalled Paint.NET for now, even went through with regedit and deleted everything relating to PDN. Then did complete Tweak regime by Major Geek. Restarted. Went to default and MSPaint had none one 14 defaults assigned to it. I
 assigned all that it has capabilities of being assigned, just the lump some top choice. then I screen printed my desktop and pasted it into MSPaint and save as png and still got the "Paint cannot save this file. Save was interrupted so your file has not been
 saved" error message. Will try door number 2 below and get back to you. I want this resolved before I reinstall or try and reinstall PDN. I'm a bit upset since my main laptop does not display the windows starting graphic nor next the arrow and so on though
 the screen lightens and darkens appropriately as if the graphics were there. Windows 7 64-bit. That is why I &nbsp;am on this buggy thing and my work is being interrupted. I am a retired disabled ICU nurse, and my graphics "hobby" keeps me c

            ps I have Irfanview and XnView as well as a lot of other programs. Corel PSPx4 has no problems saving png files. I DID have a prob seeing thunbnail pngs and found the compression checled so uncheck a few thinking I would have to uncheck all of them under
 the property advanced menu of each image, but most, not all, show up now, and if I go to medium instead of extra large view of thumbnails, they all show up so I have a feeling it is a memory or a presbyopia issue like my own lol. I can't see well enough to
 make sense out of medium thumbnails while scanning. They seem to open within most programs, others not so much but at least most are displaying. cheers for now :)

            <p>&nbsp; on way over to Major Geek for some stuff &nbsp;you suggested. Reinstalled Irfanview and all plugins in their default install locations. still nothing but the tiff party in common folder under program files. By default, pngfilt.dll.mui is located in the system
 directory: C:\windows\system32 &nbsp;and it is not there. So I assume without that mui file nothing will get done with just a .dll, which I had taken out of the common folder where I had pasted it and put it on the desktop during the Irfan install. I. Am Screwed.
 I will try a PDN install now, can always uninstall again. The error msg where PDN must be closed, has to be ok checked before the program closes, so I can get stuff done, while I sweat out the dreaded pdncrashlog that invariably sooner or later appear on desktop.
 I have been saving in PSD so I can do the early layer work in PDN then go over to CS photoshop or Corel PSP which neither I am very good at yet, and finish, but I know Paint.NET SO well I can wreak miracles out of the dang thing I haven't learned to do yet
 in the other programs. The only other program I have that takes the proprietary format for Paint,NET is Chasys' Draw and that is one hinky program, another stressful interface. I need to get my Compaq up and running again. this HP used to do the same thing,
 not show the windows graphics, and discharging the residual energy would fix it but oh no, not the compaq.

====================================================<br />
The&nbsp;&nbsp; pngfilt.dll.mui is not the file you need to replace. The file<br />
you are looking for is : PNG32.FLT&nbsp;&nbsp; rename it to&nbsp; PNG32.OLD<br />
<br />
After the file is renamed...reinstall IrfanView.<br />
<br />
If you cannot find the path I quoted...it may be hidden.<br />
<br />
Try changing the following setting and have another look for...<br />
<br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\Microsoft Shared\Grphflt<br />
<br />
Try the following steps in Windows 7:<br />
<br />
Go to.....Start button / Control Panel / Appearance <br />

            <p>Several reasons.&nbsp; To wit, all 6 of my other Windows 10 computers have this tab.&nbsp; Also, When I look up solutions to my problems (that I forgot to list in my original post), the solutions say to go to this tab and check certain boxes ("allow the computer to
 turn off this device to save power").&nbsp; These solutions are on SP4 issues, suggesting that the SP4 should have this tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the other issues that I am having cannot be troubleshot properly until I can manipulate the features in this tab.</p>

</strong>for more info.</p>

<p><strong>I have a desktop pc (Dell XPS) which is connected with ethernet cable to a D-Link 655 router. The router is set to G and N standards. Furher the router is connected to a QNAP NAS with cable.</strong></p>
<p>The pc cannot see the NAS, though it can see other units with wireless connection to the router.</p>
<p>Problem should be related to Windows I guess. I have removed the Windows firewall and I have also tried to temporarily remove the antivirus, but it did not help. The network identification program in windows is set to Networks identification disabled. When
 I set it to Enable and than save it seems not to accept it, because when I look again under Network - Advanced Options is again shows that the network identification is disabled.</p>
<p>I have by now spent + 100 hours trying to find a solution. Anyone has a clue?</p>

<p>I tried the compatibility mode unsuccessfully, and tires another answer I found in the community.&nbsp; I deleted the 2010 x 64 and x86 version 10.0.40219 of the&nbsp; Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 and then installed Microsoft Streets and Trips without a hitch and it
 installed it own version of C++ 2010 is version 10.0.30318.&nbsp; Hopefully this will not affect any other programs.&nbsp; Question - can one now install the newer version without compromising the Streets and Trips program?</p>

    <title>Disposable culture&#63; The Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse appears not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rupert_w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disposable culture&#63; The Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse appears not to be designed to work reliably with rechargeable AA&#47;HR6 batteries.</h2>
                    <p>As you can see from the photos below,&nbsp;the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Mouse&nbsp;uses the commonly available AA size batteries and&nbsp;has a label in one of the battery compartments&nbsp;that states AA/LR6 cells and nominal electrical power of 3V 125mA DC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many consumers who buy products that accept AA cells expect to be able to use rechargeable batteries interchangeably.
</p>
<p>For some, this is merely a matter of convenience or cost, but for an increasing number of consumers, disposable single-use batteries are anathema on environmental grounds, regardless of how frequently, or not they may need replacing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Improved chemistries have overcome the earlier problems of limited capacity and self-discharge such that&nbsp;Panasonic now produce&nbsp;a Ni-MH AA (HR6)&nbsp;1900 mAh cell that retains 70% of its charge after 10 years and can be recharged up to 2100 times - an appealing
 alternative to disposable cells, I'm sure you'd agree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the improvements mentioned above, rechargeable AA cells are rated for a nominal Voltage of 1.2 Volts and non-rechargeable cells are rated at 1.5 Volts.&nbsp;This can cause a problem if the device has not been designed to take account of this difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Voltage from&nbsp;cells varies depending on many factors, particularly state of charge, and all cells begin with an output above their nominal rating, which then drops off in use. However, rechargeable cells will reach a steady Voltage state below that of
 a non-rechargeable cell and this is where the problem can lie. Most devices will work with fully charged&nbsp;rechargeable cells for a period, but may become problematic as the Voltage levels out around 1.2 Volts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Has Microsoft designed the Sculpt Comfort Mouse to work reliably with 1.2 Volt cells or must disposable 1.5 Volt cells be used?</strong></p>
<p>

<p>All I can say, is that in my experience, it would appear not.<br />
</p>
<p>It will work with rechargeable Ni-NH cells for a week or so, then become highly intermittent.
<br />
I can't be certain if this this what's going on, but it feels as though the device has been designed to only work with disposable batteries, if anyone has had a different experience and&nbsp;can correct me on this, I'm all ears.</p>

<p>The first two result in my mouse behaving erratically (dropping signal, vibrating as if I'd touched the blue swipe zone and generally misbehaving). It's worth noting here, that neither the part used Alkaline or the rechargeable Ni-MH caused the low battery

<p>You can transfer Microsoft points when in a Family Membership IceStorm from the 'parent' account to one of the child accounts in amounts of 400 I believe.<br />
<br />
Instructions on how to do so can be found here&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-live/how-to/family-pack/billing-points-family-pack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Family Pack | Xbox LIVE Membership | Gold Family Pack - Xbox.com</a>.<br />

<p>The primary member on the Gold Family Pack membership can give Microsoft Points to other family members (secondary members), so that they can make purchases on Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p><strong>Give points to family members</strong></p>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>On your console, sign in to Xbox LIVE using the Family Pack primary account (the account used to sign up for the Family Pack membership).
</li><li>
<div>Go to&nbsp;<strong>My Xbox</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Family Centre</strong>.<br />

</li></ol>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Select the member that you want to give points to. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Grant Allowance</strong>. </li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to give Microsoft Points to the secondary member. Points that you give to a secondary member cannot be reversed later.
</li></ol>

            Hi adityapuranik1, Microsoft only provides us with one route to go from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 10 Home and that is a clean install of Windows 10 Home . . .
<br />
<br />Important - You will need to backup all your data before proceeding and your 3rd party applications will need to be re-installed once the clean install of Windows has completed . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            You need to reinstall the right edition using the following steps:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 update KB2976978</h2>
                    This update came up through Windows Update as one of the Important Updates (not Optional) and indicates it was published on 10 Apr 2018.&nbsp; However, when I click on the link for "More Information", it opens a Microsoft web page showing error 404 and cannot
 seem to find any information relating to this update.&nbsp; Furthermore, when I checked my installed updates, it appears that I have previously already installed this update successfully.&nbsp; Not sure what's going on but now a bit reluctant to run that update.&nbsp; Anyone
 experiencing the same issue?

            That was my initial reaction - to ignore it.&nbsp; But I wasn't sure why Windows Update would keep offering it if I had already previously installed it back in March 2018.&nbsp; Plus this one has an April publish date. Thanks for your reply all the same.

            You are welcome. Sometimes Microsoft will publish a revision of an update. Maybe there is a bug in the initial release or additional enhancements are added in the second release.
