    <title>How can I find out what Program&#47;Application is associated with a - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How can I find out what Program&#47;Application is associated with a given file extension&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>General question: How can I identify what Application uses a certain file extension? Some are well-known, such as .doc is for MS Word, .xls for MS Excel, .pdf for Adobe Acrobat. But is there a master list somewhere that is searchable by the general public?<br />
This question came about because I was gettnig low on disk space on my hard drive, and upon doing some searches, found a group of 5 files with extension .ECW, totaling almost 50 MB. After trying for a couple of hours to find on the Web what program might have
 created these files, I gave up, backed up the files to a CD, and deleted and rebooted. So far, no bad consequences, but still a little nerve-wracking.<br />
I would think that all sotware manufacturers must have to register their extensions with MicroSoft, correct? To repeat: is there a published list, or how do I find out this information in the future?</p>

            Make sure that all drivers are installed for your graphic card.&nbsp; Perhaps your card cannot go that high of a resolution.&nbsp; Perhaps you could try 1024x768.&nbsp; That is also a 4:3 aspect ratio.<br />

<h2>            Battery will not charge after last windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>On 11 Jan I installed the patch to the creators update. I noticed yesterday that my lenova yoga 3 11 is not actually charging although the battery icon in the sys tray indicates the adapter is plugged in. I managed to quickly go to device manager / batteries
 - it says it was modified on 11 Jan.</p>
<p>now down to 7 % battery. the laptop will not charge even when off. The battery is housed inside the sealed laptop. The usb port where the charging cable plugs is working as it read a usb flash drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Sally,<br />
<br />
Conflicts with the power plan settings is one of the possible reasons why your battery is not charging. For us to assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li><li>Which version and OS build number of Windows 10 is currently installed? To check, press the Windows key, type winver, and press the Enter key.</li><li>Do you have a third-party security software installed?</li><li>Have you tried using the troubleshooter in Windows 10?</li><li>How long have you had your battery on your laptop?</li><li>Have you tried checking the battery or the cable for charging if there's any damages?</li><li>Have you tried using another compatible battery or charging adapter?</li><li>Have you tried contacting your laptop manufacturer to check if this is a hardware issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, you can try to reset and restore the Power Plans to default and check if you will still encounter the same issue. You can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key + <strong>X</strong>, then select <strong>
C</strong><strong>ommand Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>Type in the command:<br />
<br />
<strong>powercfg –restoredefaultschemes and press Enter.</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This procedure would reset the power plan settings to default. Any previously customized power plans would be removed.<br />
<br />
We'll be looking forward to your reply.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply and support. I will reply to each in order but please understand the battery is now completely drained so I am unable to do any checks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 when I realised I had an issue, I checked the device manager / batteries / the long entry was modified on 11Jan. Same date I installed the windows &nbsp;patch for the Fall creators update. the battery icon in the system tray has the red dot on it - indicating
 the adapter is plugged in when it is not. I checked the power usb port on the laptop with a flash drive - it is working. The laptop will not charge when powered off - no white light next to the on off button.</p>
<p>2 windows 10 including the Fall creators update</p>
<p>3 Bitdefender 2017 internet security</p>
<p>4 no</p>
<p>5 battery like the laptop - about 2 years old. Lenova battery care s/w always reports battery health good. Time between discharge and recharge is good and not noticably different to day of purchase.&nbsp;</p>
<p>6 visibly checked the cable and adapter looks ok. No opportunity yet to try another cable</p>
<p>7 no</p>
<p>8 contacted Lenova UK team. Problem unknown to them. They suggested checks in the BIOS and the battery management s/w - no done yet as I have no power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>lastly will try your suggestion of power reset as soon as I can.&nbsp;</p>

            Good morning - hopefully last message from me... I managed to get into town to our main computer repair centre yesterday. Explained everything. They confirmed that would start with the basics. Fortunately they had a genuine Lenovo adapter &amp; cable for my
 yoga 3 11 - we had an orange light next to the power button 😀 so although it looked like a s/w update issue it was just a coincidence and my cable had failed. Thank you again for your support&nbsp;

<h2>            Persistent tooltip</h2>
                    <p>This seems to be similar to the question asked here about Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/a-tooltip-is-stuck-on-the-desktop-and-will-not-go/debf9394-8bc0-49bd-b060-218faba8925a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/a-tooltip-is-stuck-on-the-desktop-and-will-not-go/debf9394-8bc0-49bd-b060-218faba8925a</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new laptop with Windows 10 and in the last couple of days, tooltips have started to persist on my screen. They are from a right-click menu in Windows. Here are two examples of this with the same tooltip. The tooltip, itself, came from pasting a
 shortcut to a file in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 1 when searching this forum.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ea40407-7a55-404c-8ce1-ca880d8ee3ac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ea40407-7a55-404c-8ce1-ca880d8ee3ac" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>Example 2 when writing this question:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30769cf6-5f6d-4b45-acab-5b97ad0517cc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30769cf6-5f6d-4b45-acab-5b97ad0517cc" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" /></a></p>
<p>I've only seen one at a time and restarting the computer gets rid of it. For that matter, putting the computer to sleep and then going back in gets rid of it.</p>

<h2>            Age of Empires III digital download</h2>
                    Where can I download a digital copy of Age of Empires III? I have my original game and product code but no disc drive on my new laptop. I'm probably just not looking in the right spot because I'm sure Microsoft wouldn't stop making laptops with disc drives
 and then make sure their own game wasn't available to download.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the discs in future even if you copy the contents into the flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To copy the DVD into flash drive, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Insert </strong>the <strong>CD </strong>into the computer drive and also
<strong>plug </strong>the <strong>flash/USB</strong> drive into the same computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;Allow a few moments for the computer to recognize the <strong>CD</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Find </strong>the CD drive on the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;Do not auto-play or install.<br />
</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Right click on the CD drive and click open<br />
•&nbsp;You will find the files and folders </p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Select </strong>the files to copy</p>
<p>
</p><p>•&nbsp;Select the entire content either from Ctrl+A key on the keyboard or highlight the files using the cursor.<br />
•&nbsp;Press Ctrl+C key on the keyboard or right click on the highlighted files and Copy</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Open </strong>the flash drive </p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Paste </strong>the files and folders by hitting <strong>Ctrl + V</strong> on the keyboard or do a
<strong>right click </strong>and <strong>paste</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6.&nbsp;The <strong>files </strong>would be copied </p>
<p>
</p><p>7.&nbsp;Now you can <strong>eject </strong>both the drives </p>
<p>
</p><p>8.&nbsp;<strong>Plug </strong>the flash drive into the laptop where you want to install the game and

    <title>Crimson Dragon Broken - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ezhno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Crimson Dragon Broken</h2>
                    
<p>So I downloaded Crimson Dragon and played it a fair amount, it's generally fun. However, in the game, there exists a 'Dragon Database' which you fill up by altering, evolving, or purchasing new dragons which you own. The problem is
 that you can only obtain each dragon once and when you evolve it you lose the ability to alter it (change attribute) at its previous level. This makes the Dragon Database&nbsp;uncompletable if you evolve before realizing what the Change Attribute option is. Myself
 and many others have come across this problem largely because the game makes literally no mention of any of these features so you're left to figure it all out on your own.</p>

<p>That said, I would be willing to start a new game from the beginning to avoid this issue; but I can't. There is no option in the game to manage my save or start a new game. Additionally, I can't access my save on my hard drive, nor can I access it in the
 imaginary 'cloud.' Even so, I thought I could get around this and start a new game by playing on a friends Xbox One, whom has downloaded Crimson Dragon, with my account. But the only way to get your account is by recovering online (due to no USB support) which
 immediately accesses all game saves.</p>

<p>What do I even do? There's nothing I can do. The game is permanently broken. The game has rendered this feature uncompletable and there was no warning, guide, or information provided.</p>

<p>Multiple people at microsoft have told me that an update to the OS UI is coming that allows game save management. They stated this as a definite fact, I made sure that it's what they meant. Until then there's nothing else to do but wait.</p>

<p>An update, as I've figured out a way around this issue. Not the most favourable of solutions but it satisfies my wants nonetheless. I'm just copying from the guide I wrote for other game related forums.</p>
<p>There is a way to complete your Dragon Database if you've evolved and missed entries! I've just found a way to start a new game save and erase your old one. The down side to this is that it is actually a new save so you are completely starting from the beginning
 once again. This method actually works for all Xbox One games (as many others also do not allow save management).</p>
<p>I will detail the steps exactly as I have done them. Please keep in mind this guide is only intended for those who have missed entries in their Dragon Database primarily as a result of not changing the attributes of dragons before evolving them.</p>
<p>1. Reset your Xbox One to factory settings.*</p>
<p>2. Go through set-up and recover your LIVE account.</p>
<p>3. Sign-in and begin downloading Crimson Dragon.**</p>
<p>4. When the pop-up appears saying 'Crimson Dragon: Ready to play' (around 40%), disconnect your console from the internet.</p>
<p>5. Launch the game!*** You will be given the option to start a new save or begin without saving.</p>
<p>6. Complete the first mission and you will reach a save point. You may also navigate the menus**** as each time you change screens it automatically saves.</p>
<p>7. With the game still open, re-connect to the internet.</p>
<p>8. Close Crimson Dragon and re-launch it.</p>
<p>9. When the game loads, you will be presented with a Xbox One guide screen stating that your save differs from the Cloud save. You can choose to use the new save, Cloud save (old), or stop synchronization at this time and it will ask you again the next time
 you launch.</p>
<p>You have now erased your old Crimson Dragon save and started a new game! From this point you can complete the Dragon Database again (minus the void variants of the dragons, which are not available yet anyway).</p>
<p>[Some notes]:</p>
<p>*Keep in mind that a Factory Reset erases everything on your Xbox One. All content and saves can be re-obtained, thankfully, but all games must be re-installed and it's a bit of a pain in the ***.</p>
<p>**Cloud save synchronization should only take effect when you launch a game while connected to the internet. It should not automatically download your save files at any other time so you can safely stay connected for quite a while.</p>
<p>***If you have difficulty starting the game while disconnected, highlight Crimson Dragon, press start, and select 'fullscreen.' This will force the incompletely installed game to launch. You will likely only be able to play the first mission.</p>
<p>****If you proceed to the Dragon Roost at this point you will notice the absence of the Darkshoulder Chaos. Do not worry, as this should return for you once you re-launch the game while connected to the internet. This may not work after December 31st of
 2013, however. So proceed at your own risk after this date.</p>

<p>It turns out that I didn't uninstall Synaptics before installing Cypress the previous time, so Windows simply thought that Synaptics was already installed (I verified by changing device installation settings back to
<strong>yes</strong>). In fact, just deleting the .exe files from Synaptics's folder triggers the update. Now the issue is not quite solved but at least I managed to retain the Cypress functionalities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question again is, why does Windows Update update a driver into a wholly different one?</p>

                    <p>Previous work-around can be enhanced. &nbsp;Open paint by, right-click Open With. &nbsp;Then create your own untitled.jpg and save it. &nbsp;Make a shortcut to it. &nbsp;Make a shortcut to MSpaint. &nbsp;Copy the icon form the properties menu (via Change Icon button) to the icon
 of the shortcut to the jpg file. &nbsp;Delete the MSPaint shortcut and rename the jpg shortcut to Paint. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then have a shortcut that looks and acts like a shortcut to Paint.</p>

 came that <strong>250GB drive F: is not accessible. Access Denied. </strong>So I scan and a message came say force disk mount and I clicked yes.</p>
<p>Then it finished and the drive is still locked. My F: drive is not full and need my files as its my back up drive all my works are in this drive. And not the drive is not seen in my computer and I cannot find it. Went to disk management and shows Disk 0:

<p>﻿Hi, Margarita.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Did I wipe the external drive clean?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe, but probably not.&nbsp; It takes a while to "wipe" a drive; about as long as a reformat, because the system has to write zeroes or ones or garbage - something! - into every spot on the disk, and that can take a long time.&nbsp; So your problem is probably less
 complicated than this.&nbsp; Maybe you somehow wiped out the partition table and/or the Master Boot Record.&nbsp; In that case, all the data is still there, right where you left it, but you'll have to re-create the signposts to find it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and is there any way I can retrieve that data?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How "techie" are you, and what tools are at your disposal?&nbsp; Do you have a geeky friend who can help?&nbsp; (One that you trust A LOT?)&nbsp; With luck, skill and tools (or maybe just two out of three), you and your friend might be able to recreate the signposts and
 recover all those files, maybe in minutes.&nbsp; ;&lt;)&nbsp; And maybe not.&nbsp; :&gt;(</p>
<p>To clarify, by "Disk Manager", do you mean the Disk Management utility (diskmgmt.msc), which is included in every copy of Windows since Win2K?&nbsp; Or some third-party utility?&nbsp; When you post back, please give more details, like:&nbsp; How big is the HDD?&nbsp; USB or
 SATA or ??&nbsp; Formatted NTFS or FAT32 or ?? How many files and how many MB/GB/TB involved - a rough guess is good enough.&nbsp; What operating system and file system was your friend using on this disk?&nbsp; What else is on the HDD that might be in danger - or already
 lost?</p>
<p>Disk recovery services are available, but they typically are expensive - hundreds or thousands of dollars - and probably not worth it in this case.</p>
<p>RC</p>

<p>I am having a problem very similar to this.&nbsp; I am working on a laptop that runs Windows XP.&nbsp; My friend recently let me borrow his external hard drive with all of his music files on it.&nbsp; It showed up on my computer as an F: drive and allowed me to transfer
 half of the files over before it stopped recognizing the source.&nbsp; Like this problem, the disk showed up in my Disk Manager as not initialized.&nbsp; Now I believe it's initialized, but the entire disk is showing up as unallocated space.&nbsp; Did I wipe the external
 drive clean? and is there any way I can retrieve that data? Thank you, any help is appreciated - he's going to kill me!</p>

                    <p>I am trying to update from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 on my wife's laptop using the Windows Update process&nbsp;following "Reserve" and pop up message telling me it was ready (as opposed to the ISO option).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually began the process ~31 hours ago...on the current attempt the screen says "Downloading Windows 10..."&nbsp;but does not show a Percentage Complete...it had showed up to 10% then disappeared.&nbsp; It has been like this for just over an hour</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried stopping the download multiple times...have run Windows Update Troubleshooter several times...have rebooted several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran the upgrade on our desktop computer it ran fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of ideas...how do I tell if the Download is actually doing anything ?&nbsp; What am I doing wrong ?</p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/32f6e677-05ad-4248-b095-f634925ba83c" /></p>
<p>The screen above shows that the backups take up 30.9GB of space.</p>
<p>So I go to&nbsp;Control Panel\System and Security\Backup and Restore and try to delete from "manage space".</p>
<p>But inside there, it shows that there are no backup file on my D drive as below screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2eccf442-cff0-42d3-a183-ca12a4628c57" /></p>
<p>So how can I delete those backups?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even in Disk Management, there are no recovery partition.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e92055bd-8450-409a-9b7c-36ce7696dfd5" /></p>
<p>Your help is highly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the help.</p>
<p>By the way I don't think my PC has a&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">discrepancy. The first picture is actually the properties of the "Windows Backup" (highlighted in picture below) in D Drive.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Palcouk,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure are those really backups. Because when I open the "USER-PC" file, which is a windows backup, I got this screen.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e1e73d0-bf85-433e-be26-1c300b998e34" /></p>
<p>and if I click "Restore files", I got this screen:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27b826ed-decc-4b12-8dbb-3ddd3490cb85" /></p>
<p>There are some backups inside the file but I can only restore those backups, I can't delete it. Since its long time ago, I can't remember whether I did this backup or not.<br />
</p>
<p>Or can I just delete the "USER-PC" directly from the D Drive root?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What is the make and model of the router?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>WPA stands for Wi-fi Protected Access. In a wireless network, the WPA key is a password that protects the network from outside intruders. If a wireless router is set up with WPA encryption, you need the WPA key for network access and to make changes
 to the settings of your network.</span></p>

 the number shown.&nbsp; I was then asked my name and told that Microsoft needed access to my computer to eliminate the threat.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> I was then asked to press the "Control + R" keys and enter the following text, "iexplore cbttr.com"</span>
 which I ignorantly did.&nbsp; This gave him remote access to my laptop.&nbsp; He moved the cursor a bit and circled a few programs that were stopped.&nbsp; Then simply said, I can fix this.&nbsp; It will cost you $599.00.&nbsp; At that point I hung up the phone and turned off the
 laptop.&nbsp; It was already to late.&nbsp; I cannot access my computer any longer.&nbsp; I have no idea what to do.&nbsp; Even if I knew, I am an old man on a very limited income without the ability to pay for whatever repairs or replacement costs.&nbsp; Please!&nbsp; Don't let this happen
 to you!&nbsp; All I can do is ask myself "What can I do".&nbsp; The answer is to help prevent this from happening to others.&nbsp; Please tell your friends and family...&nbsp; The wolf is at the door.

            <p>Do you have a backup of your data?</p>
<p>A little trick;&nbsp; Copy your Download Folder, if you have not cleaned it out, to a thumb drive,&nbsp; After reinstalling Windows 10 you can use the downloaded files to reinstall the programs without searching the Internet and download them again.</p>
<p>Use the Media Creation Tool to reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp; Do a clean install.&nbsp; ie do a custom install and when you pick the System partition also click on format before installing.</p>

<p>Yes.&nbsp; I see that this problem (countering scams and hackers) has no easy answer.&nbsp; And yet, I must believe that a meaningful remedy does exist.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to recognize very quickly that I had messed up by giving them remote access to my laptop.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 I believe people like myself, (victims) never have to fear the internet and the great wealth of information and entertainment that can be found at the tip of our fingers.&nbsp; It is very hard to accept that such a beautiful face harbors so vicious a monster.&nbsp;

                    <p>I have a Samsung ativ smart pc XE500T1C-HC1SG. However when I want to upgrade to Windows 10, Microsoft prompted me that the Intel Graphics Media Accelerator that is in my Samsung ativ smart PC is not compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do? Is there any way I can still install windows 10?</p>

            <p>However... looking on the Dell support site, it said that Windows 10 is&nbsp;supported on this device!</p>
<p>But a requirement for the update is&nbsp;"DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 graphics card".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Via dell updates a dell-wrapped version of the Intel drivers were available:<br />
"Intel Atom Processor z2760 drivers" it said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition I found a bios update for my tablet (version A00 to A07, but I guess that is irrelevant.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this, some new important updates were available via Windows Update, with regards to the Intel display adapter. These were not available before - I checked this an hour ago and all was up to date. So it had to do with the new driver packet from
 Intel.</p>
<p>In the update history it said:</p>
<p>Intel(R) Coorporation - Graphics Adapter WDDM1.2 - Intel Graphics Media Accelerator</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this a restart was required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the question is, how to re-run the test for Windows 10 suitability?</p>

            I am having this same issue, I found updates this morning on an Asus VivoTab Smart for the Intel(r) accelerator, installed and restarted, but getting the same message.&nbsp; Intel website is no help either.&nbsp; Nothing from Asus Updates yet either.&nbsp; I hate the
 little button that prompts me to look at new PCs as mine is only a year old.&nbsp; I have an Apple iPad that is old and runs gloriously the latest OS.&nbsp; MS, needs to get better control over there third party manufacturers if they want to keep selling PCs.&nbsp; If this
 isn't fixed soon, my next computer purchase is an Apple, not a PC.&nbsp; I don't know if MS even reads this forum, but I haven't seen any answers, other than making sure your machine meets the minimum requirements.&nbsp; You'd think that MS would have talked to other
 third part manufacturers, especially a large company like Intel, to insure the new OS would work.&nbsp; Please, get this working MS.&nbsp; It seems strictly with Intel, but is there a reset button on the Windows 10 update App that I'm missing, since I updated the Intel
 driver from MS updates this morning, but still get the same message?<br />

<p>
</p><p>Not really. here is what is happening at my house:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Dell desktop with Nvidia GeForce 9300 GE card. Windows 10 installed just fine and the NVidia Control Panel works like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. eMachines desktop with different Nvidia chipset onboard, Windows 10 refuses to install due to incompatible video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Dell laptop with Intel Graphics Media Accelerator chipset, Windows 10 installed perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Dell Latitude 10 tablet with Intel Graphics Media Accelerator chipset, Windows 10 refuses to install due to incompatible video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'm just a little naïve here, but the Technical Preview was out for how long before the official release? I think Intel and Nvidia had plenty of time to get their drivers updated. No?</p>

<p>so, I am having a problem with this file not going away in my Windows Media Player 11. It is blank, I cannot do anything with it. I can't delete it, play it, rate it, edit the information - nothing.</p>
<p>There are no negative effects of it being there (at least that I know of), just it's kind of annoying. any way to remove it? and how would it have gotten there?</p>

<blockquote>Did you first make sure that the WMP Network Sharing Service was stopped? Instead of deleting, I suggest that you rename the full&nbsp;<strong>Media Player</strong> folder containing these files. Does that help?

<p>i didn't confirm that it was off, but I remember disabling it sometime yesterday, not sure if it was before or after deleting the Current_Database file. Just now, I double-checked that it was disabled, closed out of WMP, and deleted the file again.</p>
<p>The blank was still there when I reopened WMP.</p>
<p>So, I closed out of WMP and renamed the entire <strong>Media Player</strong> folder.</p>
<p>Good news! I opened WMP again, and the blank is not there any more! :D Thank you for helping me resolve this simple, (seemingly)harmless yet annoying issue, and it took much less time than I expected!</p>
<p>I am going to do some more playing around to narrow the cause down to a specific file/folder, will post results afterwards</p>

            You will probably have to reset the media library to get rid of this file. To reset the library, follow the instructions for WMP 11 on XP at&nbsp;<a href="http://zachd.com/pss/pss.html#medialibrary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://zachd.com/pss/pss.html#medialibrary</a> . Note that
 resetting the library will make you lose all current play counts, and possibly ratings too.

<h2>            Printing Stopped Working Windows 7</h2>
                    I am working with Windows 7 and have two printers that I use wirelessly. &nbsp;A couple of days ago I was no longer able to send anything to either printer from my laptop. &nbsp;In the printer queue the Status says "Error - Printing". &nbsp;The printers are working as
 I have emailed documents to my cell phone and I was able to print from there. &nbsp;I have updated the drivers and still no success. &nbsp;I deleted and reinstalled the printers with no success either. &nbsp;I then reset my computer to an earlier date and did the window
 updates, still no success. &nbsp;I have done all of the troubleshooting options and still resolution to the problem. &nbsp;I have no idea what to do next.

    <title>Windows 10 Photos App shows all images on my computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos App shows all images on my computer</h2>
                    <p>The Photo app shows all images on my computer. I only want it to show images in my photos folder and cannot find a setting for that to make it work. Is that not an option. Can someone tell me how to get it to work. I do not want to see my receipts (which
 are not in my pictures folder) rotating with my pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>I see the source setting in the Photos app. Apparently it does not work because I only have my pictures folder set as the source and I see many other images that are in other locations in my computer.</p>

</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may remove all the source locations from the photo app and also follow the below steps to turn off OneDrive Sync:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open the photos app, click on folders.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select “choose source folders for photos and videos”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Once you scroll down the page you will find “show my cloud-only content from one drive” option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You may turn off the option.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may now restart the app and add only the source folder and check if you are able to see pictures from “My pictures” folder only.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful. For any further assistance on Windows, feel free to post your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></span></p>
