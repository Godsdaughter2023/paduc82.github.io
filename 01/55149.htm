            Hi,<br />
<br />
Have you added any burning or other CD/DVD software around the time this started to happen? Some can<br />
compete for resources and cause issues.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Please do these top down even if you have done some before as it is often the total process that solves the issue.<br />
It is a check list and not a menu.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Hope these help.<br />

<h3> haljester  say:</h3>
<h2>            games for windows live Fable 3</h2>
                    <p>Just bought a brand new boxed version of Fable 3 fom Walmart last night. The game uses your windows live service which is down and discontinued by microsoft. How on Earth does anyone go about playing a game built on Windows live?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several other live games like Batman Arkham City and Dirt 2 plus others that are now obsolete and cant be played. Thanks alot Microsoft for burning 200 bucks out of my wallet for useless unplayable games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does Microsoft plan on doing to rectify this problem? Is there a patch or a fix to remove the Live Id launcher so the game can be played offline. This is unacceptable that I have spent money on a game, have opened it and cannot be returned now. Thanks
 a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely, very disgruntled consumer.</p>

            <p>You can redeem your CD key for Bats AC on Steam. You will have to download it, but if you are not using</p>
<p>the GOTY edition you will at least get the Harley's Revenge DLC free as Steam only uses the GOTY ed.</p>
<p>(I suppose that is the only retail version going now too. )</p>
<p>- The other issue is the Bats games are among a number of 'recent' games that stuff up your saves if</p>
<p>you switch systems or OS's. There may be a trick for making them work, but I've not found it.</p>
<p>I had to start Bats AC over when switching from Win7 to 10.&nbsp; 47% progress lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried moving Dirt2 to Steam as I've never had an issue with GFWL with that game.
</p>
<p>If you are not on line when you launch the game you can save manually (Options table outside the van),
</p>
<p>which I prefer anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; Bats AA will also save if playing off line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- GTA4 and a number of other GFWL titles can't be switched to Steam, but I had a hacked xlive.dll&nbsp; in
</p>
<p>GTA4 from day one because even before MS dropped GFWL it was nothing but trouble.</p>
<p>There are a number of other GFWL titles that can be transferred to Steam. </p>
<p>Most of those that can't should have a fix/hack on one of the fan or mod sites.</p>
<p>- In many cases, when using a hacked xlive.dll&nbsp; you need to play while off line of you cannot save</p>
<p>(or maybe it's just the auto save that won't work ? ) . Some games are setup in a way that they have
</p>
<p>two saves. One off line, and one on line ( Fallout 3 is one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I don't have Fable 3, and it may also be accepted by Steam. </p>
<p>All versions of this game seem to have had problems, but I've never looked into it .&nbsp;

</p><p>Note that if you have a lot of disk based games you will need to also be wary of a malware developed</p>
<p>by MS. DRM Blocking. This may be why your other games seem to be 'obsolete'.</p>
<p>DRM Blocking was first built into Win10, but is being subversively installed on Win7/8/8.1 via

</p><p><em>"I have spent money on a game, have opened it and cannot be returned now."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here in Oz our main games retailer - EB Games has a one week return policy. </p>
<p>I've returned at least three games in past. - FEAR 2 because of 1.5GB of patches which Steam
</p>
<p>insisted had to be installed even before I could launch the game. I was still on 56K dialup at the time.- BF3 because of the huge 'update' (15GB ? ) which would have sucked up my meager 5GB download limit</p>
<p>at the time (still only 50GB now).</p>
<p>- Flatout Ultimate Carnage because it was a remake of Flatout 2 with fewer tracks and</p>
<p>was a totally stuffed up game that should have never been released.</p>

            thanks for the reply, I have read alot about this topic on the web, there are hundreds of thousands of complaints, maybe even millions of people who were disgusted with GFWL and more than likely why they abandoned the idea. But to make our games unplayable
 or at least to not offer a way to crack windows live out of the game is unacceptable. I understand you can redeem your codes through Steam for some GFWL games but not all. They used to offer Fable 3 on Steam but its gone now and anyone who has previously purchased
 the game on Steam cant even play it now. I have read about and tried the xlive.dll and did not work for me.

<p>
</p><p>I didn't realise the situation was that bad. If Steam was offering the game and no longer does it would</p>
<p>be becasue of MS, I suppose. Probable something to do with the Windows Store. Selling it there now ?
</p>
<p>Probably still broken (I've only stuck my neck into the Store for a couple of minutes).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bats AC is the only GFWL game I've had to convert to Steam at this point, and even it ran OK on Win7.</p>
<p>It was just when I tried using it on Win10 that is stopped running.</p>
<p>Maybe using&nbsp; noCD fix's with my older GFWL games was more beneficial than a cracked xlive.dll ?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;[ My cut and paste comments on the topic, which I have also touched on in the post I linked to earlier]</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have used&nbsp; <a href="http://megagames.com/game-content/fixes/all/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
--this site --</a>&nbsp; (and two others, but only a time or two )&nbsp; for ten years with no issues,
</p>
<p>and there may be&nbsp; software that can be downloaded from this site that includes PUPS
</p>
<p>(potentially unwanted software)&nbsp; but I've only downloaded noCD fixes<br />
(about 70, and have downloaded and scanned many more before linking them on these forums),<br />
and have not&nbsp; had any issue with malware .<br />
No guaranty, but I believe this site is as safe as most sites.&nbsp; Safer than any torrent site, and as safe as</p>
<p>a lot of small business sites. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have your browser security set to block suspect attack sites, or use similar security options,<br />
the download may get blocked.<br />
I don't know how this system works, but expect is has to do with a feedback mechanism, which would<br />
also allow people with vested interest to convince the browser developers (Firefox in my case)<br />
that this site is suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>--------</p>
<p>[ Some new thoughts with a bit more old rant. A bit long winded, but I can't help myself&nbsp; :)&nbsp; )</p>
<p>Unfortunately with Win10 you either bow to the DRM Blocking extortion attempt and pay for any
</p>
<p>game that cannot be transferred to Steam, Origin or UPlay&nbsp; again, or use a noCD fix.
</p>
<p>Your call, of course. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the noCD for both Colin McRae DIRT and DIRT 2 . They both still scan clean.</p>
<p>(The two best of the series, imo. Three is OK, but they strayed too far from rally. Colin McRae '05
</p>
<p>was good too. Didn't bother with 'Showdown'. They really lost the plot with that one. )</p>
<br />
<p>
</p><p>- OK! I just downloaded the <em>Fable3</em> fix and it passed an Avast scan, but Malwarebytes flagged it.</p>
<p>"<em>CrackTool.agent</em>" . This is where things get interesting.&nbsp; AV's don't just check for specific know threats.</p>
<p>They also check for types of code. </p>
<p>In the case of a noCD fix you are obviously dealing with a modified/cracked file.
</p>
<p>This particular fix is does not contain a modified&nbsp; .exe file, but instead a modified
<em>paul.dll</em> file,</p>
<p>which is either a replacement, or an 'added' file.</p>
<p>(btw - I scan the .zip folder without extracting as any threat is kept contained if you don't extract and launch the file.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Step two was to do a search, and the moderator on the Malwarebytes forums said what I expected.
</p>
<p>Because noCD's are technically illegal (more so in some countries than others, but they don't take people
</p>
<p>to court for using them, regardless ) and a potential place for hiding a virus.</p>
<p>The mod also qualifies this move by stating that plenty of cracks are infected.
</p>
<p>There is a good chance there have been <em>some</em> fixes that people have infected, but plenty ?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
- I think&nbsp; what this is really about is these files are <em>potential</em> threats. Much the same as the secdrv.sys file
</p><p>is a <em>potential</em> backdoor for a malware. There are many thousands of files that have a potential for a malware attack.</p>
<p>As with any other file, if a noCD&nbsp; gets tossed around via torrent or similar sites for long enough it may get
</p>
<p>loaded up with a malware along the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Next... Scanned the whole noCD fix folder, and Malwarebytes comes up with 9 files they don't like.</p>
<p>All but two (for un-patched versions of GTA4)&nbsp; are still in use ( Crysis, COD-WAW and Chrome).
<br />
- Avast comes up with a couple of different ones. Two of three different patch versions I have, including</p>
<p>the one I've been using since '13,&nbsp; for version 1.4 of Borderlands.</p>
<p>So it looks like Avast is also checking for a type of crack code,&nbsp; but not the same one as MBytes.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just tried to launch Borderlands. First time in a year or so, and with the same fix I installed in '13,</p>
<p>but now Avast decides to block the game from loading if the rid.dll file is in the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Anyway... Over to you, and good luck in your endeavor. Whatever path you take.</p>
<p>Cheers - BD</p>

<p>However, I do use noCD's, and regardless of EULA's believe I have a right to be able to play games I paid for,
</p>
<p>which often will have problems running or launching due to poorly designed copy protection.

<h2>            Getting a Microsoft .Net Framework Unhandled Exception on Application Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, recently I've been getting an error involving Microsoft .net Framework and don't know how to fix it. Every time I put the laptop to sleep or it sleeps by it self and I wake it up, the unhandled exception message appears. &nbsp;I do not know what the
 cause might have been nor do I recall what application effected it. I do have a Norton Anti Virus if it has anything to do with it. Any help would be highly appreciated and thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>New Camera won&#39;t install driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian m b  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Camera won&#39;t install driver</h2>
                    I bought a new camera, an Panasonic Lumix DMC ZS20.&nbsp; I have a previous version of this camera, ZS7.&nbsp; I have a PC and a laptop, both operating on Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; When I try to plug and play this camera on my PC using the provided USB, the camera
 won't connect.&nbsp; I do the same thing to my laptop, and it recognizes it and downloads the drivers.&nbsp; My PC will connect the ZS7, so I know the USB port is working.&nbsp; When I go to "devices and printers" it does recognize that my camera is plugged in, but it does
 not have a driver for it.&nbsp; When I try to update the driver, Windows tells me it discovered a driver but had problems installing it.&nbsp; I don't believe any of my settings are different amongst these two computers, but I have no idea how to get my PC to recognize
 this camera and download the driver.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Panasonic does not have the driver on their website for download, and their technician told me it is a PC/Windows issue, not an issue with the performance of the camera.<br />

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually this type of issues are caused due to driver related issues. I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Run the Fixit from the following Microsoft Fixit article and check.</p>
<p><strong>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/?wa=wsignin1.0</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the latest chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer's website or from Windows Update and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly#update-driver-hardware-isnt-working-properly=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer to the following Microsoft Help article, the steps are same for Windows 7.</p>
<p><span><strong>Tips for solving problems with USB devices</strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Tips-for-solving-problems-with-USB-devices</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.</span></p>

            Thanks.&nbsp; unfortunately, these methods did not provide a solution.&nbsp; Fixit recognized the driver was not installed, but was&nbsp; not able to install it.&nbsp; Panasonic website indicates
<em>"Drivers</em> are not required. Panasonic's cameras use the native Windows USB
<em>driver</em> officially included since the release of Windows XP."&nbsp; Any other suggestion?<br />

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if you have tried installing the latest chipset drivers from the computer manufacturer's website. If not please try it if the Camera does not need any drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to know if you are facing the same issue when the camera is connected a different computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you fix the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp;<strong>chipset</strong> is a set of electronic components in an integrated circuit that manages the data flow between the processor, memory and peripherals. It is usually found on the motherboard. Chipsets are usually designed to work with a specific
 family of microprocessors. Because it controls communications between the processor and external devices, the chipset plays a crucial role in determining system performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to download the chipset drivers from the following HP driver support link,</p>

</p><p>My CD/DVD player just quit working also.&nbsp; Any type of disc I put in, I receive message "Please insert a disc" and the drive opens back up.&nbsp; Doesn't matter if it is a DVD, CD (Music) or CD (Data).&nbsp; It will not read anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran troubleshoot in device manager and everything is coming back normal.&nbsp; I tried to update the driver to this and Windows tells me (after checking) that I have the latest version.</p>

    <title>HID-Compliant Touch Screen stops working properly every few hours - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HID-Compliant Touch Screen stops working properly every few hours</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem only came up recently in the last week or so. I noticed my touch screen would start acting strange. Every time I tapped the screen it would right click instead of left click, and I could not scroll using the touch screen anymore, instead it
 would start selecting everything I swiped over. It was as if it could only right click. What was really strange is that it affected my touchpad too, and I could not scroll using 2 fingers anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the temporary fix was to disable then re-enable HID-Compliant Touch Screen, but the problem still happens every few hours of use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a more permanent solution to this problem?</p>

<p>Hello.</p>
<p>in follow up with this thread, i've the same problem with my ASUS ZENBOOK UX360U.</p>
<p>the only solution was to disable the HID-Touchscreen driver. Which means that I can't use the touchscreen and consequently the investment. the touches start to appear in dozens on the screen, opening pages, closing, funky behavior.</p>
<p>Searching the internet, this is a problem called "ghost touches". ASUS technical support could not sort the problem nor find any hardware defect. so i'm in catch-22.</p>
<p>This issue happened when I updated the windows-10 with a critical update that was released last january'17.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, suggest you look into the problem, as the level of complaints is increasing dramatically and yet to see a driver update released.</p>
<p>Awaiting your response.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response. I have found more information on the behavior of this bug. If I am browsing the internet using multiple tabs and I am using the touch screen, sometimes on 1 tab it will get caught. Meaning that I touch somewhere on the screen,
 and it does not detect that I have lifted my finger off of the screen causing any more touches to select an area rather than click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to another tab, the touch screen still seems to think it is clicked down on that original tab because the problem persists. If I go back to the first tab and click somewhere using my touchpad(not the screen) it will reset the cursor, and I can use
 the touch screen again on different tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens fairly often in Google Chrome in Gmail, though I'm not still sure how to make it happen consistently.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Wired Controller Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakeinyopants  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Wired Controller Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am posting this because my wired PDP controller won't work on my PC. My controller works perfectly fine on the console but not one the PC. It is detected but missing the drivers. The update service won't find a driver by searching automatically and the
 Xbox support page doesn't include a driver. The light on the controller does not come on and it doesn't work when used in a supported game.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution, a driver, or anything that could fix my issue? I'm running on a Windows 7 Home Premium computer.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks, in advance.</p>

<p>Third party controllers are supported via compatible ID (even if the HW ID doesn't match the compatible ID will). IF you had already installed the drivers for your old controller, then the new controller will work with the old driver because of the compatible
 ID match (it will show up as Xbox Gaming Device instead of Controller). However if you've recently reinstalled the OS or uninstalled the drivers then it may not.</p>

<p>Cy43rguru,</p>
<p>I have previously installed the driver and it came up as a Xbox Gaming Device. But still no reaction, light or vibration from the controller itself. I went though my Windows Update to see if i needed: User-Mode Driver Framework version 1.11 update for Windows
 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 or Kernel-Mode Driver Framework version 1.11 update for Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2.</p>
<p>I have both of these installed and nothing. I was looking around on Reddit and found that i could possibly have a normal Xbox One controller install and then plug my controller in and it would work with the drivers from the Official one, sadly only the Official
 one worked correctly, lit up and the xbox button pulled up Big Picture Mode in Steam. As of now, i'm installing any left over Updates i may need to see if it sorts out. I've tried manually forcing the driver as well: My options being Xbox One Controller, Xbox
 One Controller (DFU) and Xbox Gaming Device. None of the three get it to work. I do have the driver itself from Majornelson.com. I'll keep looking into it and see if i can get it working. Any other tips would be appreciated. Thank you again for your help.</p>

<p>Normally 3rd party controllers should work as is, provided that you use an official controller once to pull the driver down. 3rd party controllers are not recognized by Windows Update for pulling down the driver files automatically. Obviously this does not
 help in your case since you already have the driver installed on your machine. In the meantime I will diagnose this controller on my end as well. It may be worthwhile for you to engage PDP support as well.</p>

<p>Cy43rguru,</p>
<p>I have submitted a ticket to PDP now and hope they'll be able to get me in the right direction, if it helps in specific the controller is Vault Boy Wired Xbox One Controller. Still on my own attempts of trying to install, delete, restart and so forth i haven't
 had any success. I'm surprised the driver itself is removed from the download page for the Xbox One Controller to PC, but though i've found the driver already, and have tried a Microsoft controller, it's just a bit upsetting to not be able to get a specific
 controller to work. Have you had any luck yourself with a Wired PDP Xbox One Controller?

<p>I have the exact same issue on windows 8.1; however after loading the drivers from Microsoft the controller now states that the device has been stopped from running because the device is known to create issues. &nbsp;It almost sounds like Microsoft has officially
 pulled support on their 2014 drivers. &nbsp;Maybe they are going to launch new drivers soon? &nbsp;In the meantime, there doesn't appear to be a way to get this work, which means I may have to go to Logitec.</p>

<p>This is what I did to resolve the issue on windows 8.1:</p>
<p>Hi everyone! I just got a new Microsoft Xbox one wireless controller and couldn't get it to install. &nbsp;Microsoft states that the drivers should install automatically but this didn't work for me, nor did clicking on update driver, nor did forcing a manual
 install of the drivers from the Microsoft update catalog (the link to the catalog can be found in the forums).</p>
<p>I finally got it to work and it was pretty simple. &nbsp;While Microsoft did install the drivers, it appeared to keep the drivers from starting, so my windows 8.1 controller never had an actual Xbox controller icon in device manager, just a generic icon. &nbsp;The
 reason the drivers didn't start is because there are 3 device services which were not started, so by default the controller wouldn't associate nor start. &nbsp;I started the 3 services, reinstalled the drivers and now I have a beautiful Xbox controller icon in
 my device manager and can right click on it, test the buttons and calibrate if necessary.</p>
<p>Here is what I did specifically:</p>
<p>1. I uninstalled the device from device manager and the driver from programs, all found in the control panel.</p>
<p>2. I plugged the controller back in, let windows recreate the controller.</p>
<p>3. Go to System and Security, then Administration tools.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Double click on 'Services'.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Start 'Device association service', 'Device Install Service', 'Device Setup Manager'. &nbsp;You do this by right click on each one and choosing 'start'.</p>
<p>6. Reinstall drivers</p>
<p>Done, you should now have an actual Xbox controller icon in your device manager.</p>
<p>This seems like a lot of steps, but really you can simply start the device services and update the driver with existing driver and it would probably work just as well.</p>
<p>Note: If you have an issue with disconnects, you may want to change the 'Device Association service' to automatically start, right now all 3 services for me are set to manual start, which is why the controller would not install. &nbsp;You can change the Device
 Association Service to automatically start by double clicking on it, then changing the 'startup type' to Automatic in the drop down.</p>
<p>Finally, don't go mucking around in your services...leave the services alone, just follow the steps above to start the 3 specific ones I mentioned.</p>
<p>Good luck everyone and I hope this helps.</p>

 driver defaults to after deleting, restarting and allowing it to install again. I'm sure this would work on Windows 8 because these features are new for this OS, but they do not exist in 7. PDP also has yet to review my ticket, which was sent out this morning.</p>

<p>JakeInYoPants,</p>
<p>I'm in the same situation as you, did you have any luck with PDP support? I have to wait till Monday to see if they can or will help me. If not, guess its back to the POWERa wired controller that worked half ways. I prefer the Rock Candy aftermarket controllers,
 well up to this point I did.</p>

    <title>Having problems with Cortana and Search after upgrading to version - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Having problems with Cortana and Search after upgrading to version 1809</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my Windows 10 version 1803 to 1809. Cortana is slow to trigger and as I speak, it quits without doing anything or sometimes hangs on the cortana menu. Same thing happens when i press the mic option. Also when I search for some app and press Enter,
 the search menu still draws over other apps and even after moving the cursor and clicking outside the menu, it still doesn't go into the background and i have to press Start button to get rid of the menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[SOLVED}: I reset the cortana by going to app setting and reconfigured it. So everything seems to work fine now

            Hi Naveed
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; scroll the apps list down to Cortana
<br />Right click Cortana
<br />Click More
<br />Click App settings
<br />Click Terminate
<br />
<br />Restart Windows 10
<br />Check if it now works.
<br />
<br />If not, here are some other things you can try....
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.
<br />Follow the below steps:
<br /> 1. Open Control Panel.
<br /> 2. Select Troubleshooting.
<br /> 3. Click on Search and Indexing Troubleshooter.
<br /> 4. Run the Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Run the DISM Tool. If the issue persists, I would have run the DISM tool to check the system health and will try to restore the files.  
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click File &gt; Run new task
<br />Type: CMD
<br />Hold down the shift key then click OK
<br />
<br /> 4. In the Administrator: Command Prompt Window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />To close the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type Exit, 
<br />and then press Enter.
<br />Note: The tool might take 15-20 minutes to finish running, so please do not cancel it. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3: Restart the Cortana Process in Task Manager
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list of processes, select Cortana then click End Task.
<br />
<br />Restart Windows 10 then see if it starts working.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 4: Reinstall Cortana
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click PowerShell (Admin)
<br />
<br />At the command Prompt, type then following the hit Enter.
<br />Exit Powershell the restart
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Microsoft.Windows.Cortana | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />

            Hello NaveedUnjum, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest following the steps and instructions down below to help your with your Update issues.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 1- Restart all Running services:
<br />Press and hold the “Windows” button and the “R” button. Now you should have the “Run” window in front of you. In the run box write the following: “msconfig”. Press the “Enter” button on the keyboard or left click on the “OK” button.
<br />
<br />The “System Configuration” window should pop up on the screen. Left click or tap on the “Services” tab situated in the upper side of the window. Now check the box next to the “Hide all Microsoft services” situated in the lower left side of this window.
<br />
<br />After you checked the box from the step above left-click or tap on the “Disable All” button situated in the lower right side of this window. Now Left click or tap on the “General” tab situated in the upper side of the window. Tick the radio button  “Selective Startup” feature and Uncheck the box next to “Load Startup items”.
<br />
<br />Click Apply and ok to make save changes. Close the “System Configuration” window. Reboot your Windows 10 operating system. When the system starts you will have to check if the Instant Search feature works in the metro apps from Windows 10. If the feature is not working then proceed with the next method below.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 2- Check Windows Search Service:
<br />The other reason why your start menu search may not be working is that the Windows Search service is not running. Windows Search service is a system service and runs automatically on the system startup. Check whether the service is running or not. If it is not running, you have to start it manually. To do that, press “Win + R,” type services.msc and press the Enter button to open the Services window.
<br />
<br />Now On Scroll Down And look for the service named Windows Search Service. If the service is not running, right-click on it and then select the “Properties” option.
<br />
<br />In the properties window, click on the “Start” button to start the service. Also, make sure that the Startup type is set to “Automatic;” this ensures that the service will automatically start at every system startup. Once you are done with the changes, click on the “Ok” button to save the changes.
<br />Note: If The Service is Running simply Right Click on it and select Restart. This Will Restart the Service. Once the service has been started, This is what it looks like in your Services window. For me, this method worked perfectly.
<br />
<br />
<br />Method 3- Use Inbuild Troubleshooter Fix the Problem:
<br />Windows have an inbuilt troubleshooting tool to fix problems automatically. let’s use this to fix windows search related Errors. Tap on the Windows-key, type Control Panel and hit enter. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut Windows-Pause to open the Control Panel. Select large or small icons under “view by”. Click on Indexing options, and when the menu opens on the Advanced button.
<br />There you need to click on “Troubleshoot search and indexing”, and follow the instructions on the screen to resolve the issue.
<br />Click the checkbox next to any problems you’re encountering. In this case, we click Files don’t appear in search results.
<br />Click Next. Troubleshooter will detect any problems. Troubleshooter may or may not detect any problems. If it does detect a problem, it will attempt to fix it.
<br />
<br />Hope these methods help!
<br />Thank you and good luck.
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.

            Naveed, I specifically informed you 'Ignore when you are prompted to give a rating (Yes or No) until we actually arrive at a solution that works for you. '
<br />
<br />This highly suggest you have not even read or attempted any of the suggestions.
<br />
<br />I would prefer you not mark my replies as 'The poster reported that this response does not resolve their issue.' while I am trying to help you.
<br />
<br />
<br />I am trying to help you, but if you mark my replies as unhelpful, it makes it even more difficult to do so. Others will also be less willing to help you with your problem too.
<br />
<br />If this continues to happen, I will have to resort to re-routing your question where it will be placed at the very bottom of the list.

            I did check out both the responses. None of them worked. Sorry I didn't reply and directly rejected the response. Then I reset Cortana which worked. So i edited my question

    <title>Windows 7 turns off my P4 3.06gHz hyper-threading function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob_587  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 turns off my P4 3.06gHz hyper-threading function</h2>
                    <p>OK, yes my system is old by today's standards, but I've got a lot of $$$ invested in hardware &amp; software; don't need to see any comments about upgrading! Please!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system:</p>
<p><em>ASUS P4PE mobo</em></p>
<p><em>Intel P4 3.06gHz HT processor</em></p>
<p><em>2 GB DDR333 RAM (maxed out)</em></p>
<p><em>Nvidia GeForce 6200 vid card 512 RAM</em></p>
<p><em>320GB Maxtor HDD, 3GB WD HDD, Iomega Zip, 320GB HDD (USB portable)</em></p>
<p><em>10/100 LAN for Internet and Wireless system with 3 other PC's</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The setup works but has reached the point where the RAM is holding it back.&nbsp; I use the PC to surf the Net, run CAD programs for surveying, run office apps and load up public domain data info while running the CAD program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to re-install Win 7 after having an issue where a "restore" function&nbsp;failed to correct the system startup problem.&nbsp; The BIOS was set to allow Hyper-threading so after the re-install naturally everything ran smoothly and Device Manager showed 2 processors
 under the Processor heading.&nbsp; Since Win 7 has been around for sometime there have been many updates&nbsp;(around 400&nbsp;or so) that will&nbsp;download so I let&nbsp;them and installed them accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when the system reboots it indicates my CPU in this manner:&nbsp; <strong>*Intel Processor P4 3.06gHz</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel Processor P4 3.06gHz</strong></p>
<p><strong>{Note the asterisk in front of only 1 processor whereas prior to the updates it showed both without any asterisk}</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Device Manager only 1 processor is indicated instead or two and in Task Manager under the performance tab only one processor is visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been some issues written about this but none relate to my specific problem.&nbsp; I don't know whether certain updates are responsible for altering the hyper-threading functionality or if the Service Park 1 is the culprit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, someone out there has experienced this issue and has the background to lend some advice that will help me restore the HT capability.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Anshul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; My OS is Win 7 Pro SP 1 to answer your question.&nbsp; I have already&nbsp;tried the MSCONFIG route in addition to making sure the BIOS enabled hyper-threading.&nbsp; The issue takes place some time after receiving MS updates and not after
 the immediate&nbsp;re-install of the OS.&nbsp; Device Manager does indicate 2 processors after the re-install.&nbsp; I believe one of the updates is the culprit but because they all arrive in bunches its not evident which group may be responsible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid that only after a re-install of the OS and diligent study of the updates will this problem be resolved.&nbsp; I have also uninstalled the processor numerous times and restarted the&nbsp;PC in the hope to resolve the issue.&nbsp; So far no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion has been&nbsp;attempted and&nbsp;the system rebooted under a normal startup; unfortunately, one 1 processor is still indicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    <p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE </span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(12 Feb. 2017):
</span></p>
<p>The PC crashes several times at start up. Everytime... After some 5 to 10+ restarts, it performs some tests,&nbsp;searches for solutions, applies some solutions (not sure about that)&nbsp;and finally&nbsp;it works&nbsp;with the issues&nbsp;described below.</p>
<p>I can hear the HDD stop functioning everytime the PC crashes. It stops and immidiately starts spinning again.</p>
<p>This appeared the same time the issues described below appeared. I didn't mentioned it below, 'cause even though I could hear it, I hadn't realized that it was the HDD.</p>
<p>Nonetheless this might cause the PC to crash, but it can explain the issues below,
<strong>and all these appeared the same time</strong>, ie after installing the latest version.
</p>
<p>[end of update]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the problems I'm facing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;installing the latest version of Windows 10 (1607) some days ago, the computer started malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Troubleshooter doesn't work (file system error&nbsp;&nbsp; -2144926975), the Store also, and after searching around, I tried to open Solitare (I read that in an article describing a similar situation) and it also doesn't work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I also noticed this</strong>: I opened the search box, typed <em>"cmd"</em> and tried to right click and run as administrator.</p>
<p>At right click the <strong>only</strong> option I have is to pin a shortcut on the Star Menu.</p>
<p>At this point I'm not aware&nbsp;of what on my PC (desktop) functions properly or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I runned this tool proposed by Microsoft for the Anniversary Edition of Windows 10:&nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/windowsselfhealing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/windowsselfhealing</a>
</p>
<p>which unfortunatelly stucks at detecting the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Store is not working giving me sometimes an error 0x8000FFFF, and other times an error the code Number of which I don't recall now (it appeared after I tried to overcome the 0x8000FFFF error).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I runned the troubleshooter for Windows apps as shown here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/el-gr/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>which proposed that the problem is that I don't have a Store account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get this... Why should I have an account to even open the Store?</p>
<p>Nonetheless I tried through the Settings to create an account, using&nbsp;one I already use&nbsp;at Outlook.com, to get the message that a
<em>"problem occured. Try again", </em>and this at clicking on the option (ie I never&nbsp;got to type&nbsp;the account I use).</p>
<p>Everytime I tried I got the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cut the long story short, I tried these:</p>

            <p>Hello Ariel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>First of all I don't know if you can see that yestarday I&nbsp;updated my comment above providing additional informations on my PC's malfunctions. I'm able to see these informations (labeled as
<em>'UPDATE 12 Feb. 2017'</em>) <strong>only </strong>after I log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway,</p>
<p>Yes, all these started when I installed the latest version of Windows 10 (1607). Prior to this I had some issues with the Windows Update Agent (WU), but certainly no such issues as described above.</p>
<p>Now that I recall I had an issue with the Troubleshooter even <strong>during</strong> the previous version (1511).</p>
<p>I never needed the Troubleshooter, but when I started having problems with the WU, I tried to run this tool, and simply couldn't find it.</p>
<p>However. everything&nbsp;besides the Troubleshooter&nbsp;was&nbsp;functioning properly&nbsp;(Store, Solitare, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So,</p>
<p>I performed a <strong>clean boot</strong>, exactly as described in the link you provided.</p>
<p>Nothing changed. Still I get the same error when I try to run the Troubleshooter, still the Solitare opens a blue window to close 2-3'' later, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also runned three times the <em>sfc /scannow. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You suggest that I should Uninstall the latest version, but there&nbsp;might be some&nbsp;issues doing this.</p>
<p>After I installed the latest version, all Update history prior to the installation was erased.</p>
<p>Should I Unistall all the history I currently see?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I do so, what should I do after unistalling: </p>
<p>- reinstall the latest Version (the 1607ver.), or</p>
<p>- perform a clean istall of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially installed the 1607 version, from here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>exactly because the WU agent couldn't find any update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally,</p>
<p>Judging from what I've read,&nbsp;it seems like an one way road to perform a <strong>
clean installation</strong> of Windows 10.</p>
<p>If that's the solution that solves all problems:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; the term <em>"clean install"</em> means that I have to back-up, then completely erase everyrhing (format), and install
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10, correct?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; A clean installation of Windows 10 is gonna affect in <strong>any way </strong>
my BIOS? </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[I'm refering to UEFI]</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; [related to the above question] If after performing a clean isntall of Windows 10 I decide that I want to return to
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 7 (I have a DVD), am I gonna be able to install the Software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kon</p>

            <p>Regarding your concern, It is best to perform the clean installation of Windows 10 again to your PC so that you will be able to eliminate the issues you encounter with your computer, and you will need to back up your files to make it sure you will still
 be able to access them after installing Windows 10. It seems you are going to use our Media creation tool to install Windows 10 again which is the best solution as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing the clean installation of Windows 10 won't affect the UEFI. If you also want to return to Windows 7, that should also work for you. You may also refer to this

    <title>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool -- after crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gdave adams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Media Creation Tool -- after crash</h2>
                    <p>Have run the MCT almost to completion - the 8GB space required at the start is possibly to small - anyway on what I believe to be the last step [creating the bootable usb device] the tablet powered off, the usb wasn't yet formatted and the disk space was
 all but used - uncompressing I guess going on prior to being added to the usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My query is; Is there a way to, after charging the tablet - skip past all the other steps i.e. not have to redownload, and create thr bootable USB? If there's no official way; can I use the C:\ESD\*.esd to create a bootable usb, without any other files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it matters the usb is to <em>fix</em> another device that started blue screening for no apparent reason.<br />

<p>I discovered you need to have a minimum 12 GBs of free space on the local drive in order to facilitate the download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is unfortunately no work around for the processes required by the MCT. Your best option is to free up at least 12 GBs of local disk space or run the MCT on another computer with enough space.

</p><p>You could try downloading the ISO file directly, then use Rufus to create a bootable copy.</p>

<p>The download itself is/was fine - its a 3gb esd in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you are talking ~7GB in use for individual file downloads and final .esd creation. Then some space is freed and I guess the esd is unpacked to create the usb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my space issue, if there was indeed one was caused by paging file increasing larger than it should have.</p>
<p>I'll try using the .esd file with rufus and see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The esd was fine but proved useless for its intended purpose as you can't upgrade [in-place install] when run via boot/uefi</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Update the WiFi driver - if built-in check with the System Maker's site. Then check with the actual<br />
device maker's site if possible. Of course if a separate device then check with its maker. If no newer<br />
driver then re-install the original one.<br />
<br />
The Virtual Port is used to allow other WiFi devices to connect to the internet via your computer's<br />
WiFi. If you do not use this function then you can disable the virtual adapter. Device Manager -<br />
Network - Virtual WiFi double click it - Driver's tab - Disable.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,
<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Avast 7.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y</a> &lt;-- download<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor's Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.
