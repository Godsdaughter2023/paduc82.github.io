<h2>            What is wrong with my battery&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed lately my surface draining battery at a rapid pace at various states of charge. Today I was at approximately 20% battery and I watched the charge drop to 18, then 16, then 11, then a low battery warning at 9, then 6%, then shutdown, all within
 a matter of about 45-60 seconds. This has happened the last three times I have allowed the charge to drop below 30%. The last time it happened I had barely got below 30 when the unit shut down before i even had a chance to respond. This is very concerning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be sure,I have all the latest updates. The surface is only a month old and i have charged it about 10-12 times total so far. Is this a defective unit? Thanks.</p>

            <p>For a fast battery drain, you will have to contact Microsoft Technical Support. &nbsp;There are a lot of variables involved for that to happen and is rare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try a test and make sure nothing is attached to the tablet (including the keyboard/cover) and run it after a recharge to see if the depletion rate remains the same. &nbsp;That would eliminate an electrical short in the keyboard/cover. &nbsp;Other than that,
 it would be internal and cannot be fixed. &nbsp;It will have to be sent in for replacement.</p>

                    I have a laptop with vista hp, have had alot of problems trying to download windows updates and don't have anything on the machine that i will miss. have tried to reformat hard drive and restore to factory image, the process starts but after about a minute
 or so it says error and stops and i don't have the os disk

If you continue to have problems with the Recovery to Factory Settings Process,&nbsp;you will have to contact the Manufacturer.<br />
It is their Recovery Software/Process, not Microsoft's.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them&nbsp;how to correctly use the&nbsp;Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<h2>            KB3213986&#58;  Stuck at &#34;Please wait for the local session manager&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Attempted three of the Jan 10th updates on a Win10x64 system that has not had a problem doing updates before. &nbsp;Could not get into safe mode and had to use a repair CD to restore to the point before that Jan 10th update. &nbsp;After 2nd attempt I downloaded the
 standalone KB3213986 installer thinking the original download may have been corrupted. &nbsp;Still hangs waiting for the session manager. &nbsp;Downloaded and ran that windows update troubleshooter but no problem was found. &nbsp;This is an older system, Intel D975XBX-2
 Core 2 Quad but has been running &nbsp;Home 10 since it first came out. &nbsp;My Surface Pro 4 updated just fine. &nbsp;This is a development system that has a lot of software on it so possibly there is come conflict. &nbsp;Another older system with gigabyte motherboard did update
 just fine but it has very little software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help fixing or maybe just debugging this. &nbsp;I did see the following error messages in the event log. &nbsp;There are 3 sets of them and about 40 in a row before the next set. &nbsp; I assume it is associated with the failure but I do not know how to interpret
 it. &nbsp;They are all the same "The server {1EF75F33-893B-4E8F-9655-C3D602BA4897} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Temporary I would like to stop the update from being installed as eventually the system will try on its own. &nbsp; I read where there is a registry hack to make the Ethernet metered and prevent downloads but I want to download updates to defender and other programs.
 &nbsp;Just do not want KB3213986 to install again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA</p>
<p>

            <p>Been there, done that, bought the T-Shirt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>chkdsk c: /F</p>
<p>sfc /SCANNOW</p>
<p>
</p><p>used bcdedit to change bootmode to legacy so F8 would allow entering safe mode. &nbsp;Safe mode had same problem.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The DCOM timeout was a problem with Acronis TI only. &nbsp;Uninstalled TI just be be sure and also took out malewarebytes to see if that helped. &nbsp;I deleted windows\SoftwareDistribution as it was over 2gb in size. &nbsp;Edited the registery to set ethernet to metered
 so the auto updates would stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removed my 2nd monitor as I read elsewhere that this update caused problems with a 2nd monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered if I "require users to log in with a password" that this update boots into a locked screen and there is no username / login prompt. &nbsp;The screen just refreshes each time I press a key on the keyboard. &nbsp;If I remove the requirement for password
 then the dots circle forever next to the message "..waiting for session...".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now I have both monitors back on and am staying at recover point just before the upgrade with wired ethernet metered, and except for not being able to update everything seems OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One strange item: &nbsp;Even at the "waiting for sessions manager" some parts of the system run fine: &nbsp;Shared drives are accessable. &nbsp;I can even attempt to log in using SplashTop but all I see through the remote display is the same "...waiting for session manager..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following windows 10 updates installed just fine:</p>
<p><a href="https://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=36abf986-603e-4865-b7d7-80719c6c41c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d36abf986-603e-4865-b7d7-80719c6c41c3" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unaccountably, the Jan 10th one fails horribly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[EDIT] - some addition info from event logs but no indication of problem.</p>
<p>SYSTEM: &nbsp;6:56:52 KB3213986 finished installing successfully (supposedly)</p>
<p>SYSTEM: 8:05:15 startup of system rebooting unexpectedly</p>
<p>the missing hour was the time i was attempting to log in and finally gave up and I selected a restore point and at 8:05 the restore began its boot up.</p>
<p>APPLICATION: lot of entries between 6:52 and 8:05 but nothing obviously wrong</p>
<p>SECURITY: lot of keys being looked at and duplicate entries in log being dropped but nothing obviously wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at ntbtlog.txt from the failed boot. &nbsp;The last entry was condrv.sys the next one SHOULD have been tunnel.sys according to a good boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a bunch of complaints here about the jan 10 update, it looks like a real problem. &nbsp;I did not realize that services can stop the upgrade. &nbsp;That would have been easier to do than the registry hack to meter wired ethernet I read about elsewhere.</p>

            <p>This was solved by doing a fresh install of Win10x64 on a clean drive. &nbsp;I was working with Acronis Tech Support about a related problem and it was determined that I had been using both my original win7 login and the new Win10 login that required my Microsoft
 account. &nbsp;I was installing software and updates from two different login. &nbsp;I also learned that using "Run As Administrator" and "running an install from my administrator account" are two different things and can cause side effects including messing up permissions.
 &nbsp;I needed to stick to the Microsoft login account only and use "Run As Administrator" only if the program asks for it .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, both WIn10x64 and Acronis TI are working fine and all updates are in place including that last one that caused problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I do have one other problem as I cannot hide a printer driver update from HP. &nbsp;This is not new and occurred in Win7 but at least I could hide the update in 7 unlike 10. &nbsp;I downloaded from a Microsoft support site "Troubleshooting Pack Cabinet (diagcab)"
 that was supposed to hide the update but all it did was tell me there was a problem with the printer driver install. &nbsp;When I rebooted the HP driver attempted to install again. &nbsp;I will post this problem on the HP forum but I suspect they will tell me to hide
 it. &nbsp;I am guessing this update driver is older than the full HP install I did on my clean Win10 system and that why it fails to install.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Headphone volume reduced</h2>
                    <p>Using a Dell Precision M6800.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using Bluetooth&nbsp;listening devices with this machine the system&nbsp;sounds and music played has reduced volume compared to if the headphones&nbsp;were plugged in via a corded connection, however, the call volume from incoming phone calls through the machine are
 unaffected. We have three other people&nbsp;in the same office experiencing the same issue with different&nbsp;machines and different Bluetooth&nbsp;devices the only common across all individual is using Microsoft windows operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also at one time (approx 4 months ago) the Bluetooth&nbsp;devices operated normally and in the last couple months did this issue arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers as well as updating drivers. Also disconnecting and re-pairing the devices.</p>

<p>Hi Sean,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you are having issues with the volume of your Bluetooth headphone. To assist you better, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have any third party audio enhancement utility installed on the computer?</li><li>Have you tried connecting the Bluetooth device with a smartphone and see if you will still encounter the issue?</li><li>Have you tried running the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to diagnose the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a Dell audio program installed, however, I have searched through&nbsp;this program adjusting settings and actually turning the program all the way off with no changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device works perfectly normal connected to any other device other than this machine and the other machines in our office that are also having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The troubleshooter does not find any issues either with the device or drivers.</p>

<li>Have you tried disabling the Dell audio program and see if you will experience the issue?</li><li>Are the computers that are having this issue have the same model or manufacturer?</li><li>Have you also tried to disable <strong>Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device</strong>?

<p>Yes, I have disabled the Dell audio program and the only change is the sound quality goes down but the volume issue still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computers having the issue are all Dell machines but they are different&nbsp;models, one is the same as mine (Precision M6800) as stated in the initial question and the other 2 are Precision 7710's. My machine and its counterpart are running Windows 7 Professional&nbsp;and
 the 7710's are running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disabled the Allow applications to take exclusive control of this device and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to note that the Bluetooth devices are all different (Bose headphones, Sony headphones, and a UE Boom speaker) and they all act the same regardless on which machine they are paired to.</p>

            Since you are still having volume issues with your Bluetooth devices that are connected to your Dell computers with different operating system, we suggest that you contact the Manufacturer of your device to resolve the issue. They will be the one to assist
 you since the computers that encounter the same issue has a different version of Windows.<br />

<p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to do a follow up whether the issue has been resolved.&nbsp; By the way, you've mentioned that Dell believed that it is an OS issue since it has remained the same, regardless of the Windows versions. If that is the case, their Bluetooth card may
 not be made for Windows but for a different OS then. If it's really an issue with the OS, it should be for a particular version only, otherwise, we may have to look into the compatibility of that particular card model with Windows OS in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're here to hear your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>The issue is yet to be resolved however by some more in-depth&nbsp;investigation by Dell they have responded with this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">After testing several different systems, it appears that maximum volume is decreased across platforms. This appears to be a limitation set in place by Windows to prevent hearing

</p><p>I have also tried to schedule Restore Point creation, but that doesn't work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas/fixes/resources would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Kathryn</p>

            Hi,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue can be caused if the maximum storage size limit is set to low <br />
for your shadow storage.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resolve this issue, adjust the maximum shadow storage allocation. To do this, follow the steps listed below:<br />
1.Click Start, type System in the Search <br />
box and then click System from the list under Control panel<br />
2.Click System <br />
protection in the task pane<br />
3.Under Protection Settings click to select Local <br />
Disk (C:) (System) and then click Configure<br />
4.Under Disk Space Usage, move <br />
the Max Usage slider to the right to increase the disk space usage for System <br />
Restore points</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If protection is turned on for additional drives you might consider
<br />
increasing the Max Usage for those drives as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks. </p>

            <p>Hi Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. &nbsp;My apologies, I should have mentioned that I have Max Usage set to 10.8 GB. &nbsp;I just created a restore point. &nbsp;It is currently using 33MB of space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same yesterday and today the restore point was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other possible fixes? &nbsp;I will post tomorrow to confirm whether or not the restore point has disappeared.</p>

            <p>So...the saga continues. &nbsp;Below is what my System restore points look like today. &nbsp;As you can see the 10/28 restore point I created is now gone, which is the crux of the issue I am having. &nbsp; A restore point was auto created on 10/30 and I just created one
 today. &nbsp;I have also bumped up my Max Usage to 24GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll see if that helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you running any third party defrag&nbsp; or registery cleaners?&nbsp; These programs can remove restore points.<br />
Also Antivirus programs.<br />

            <p>I use Trend Micro and just ran a full scan. &nbsp;The restore point I created on November 7 is still there. &nbsp;I did a defrag using Microsoft's Defragger and the restore point is still there. &nbsp;I have rebooted the system twice since November 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I should look for in the logs when this happens again? &nbsp;Maybe the name of the file or folder that holds the restore point information? &nbsp;If I can find that in the logs, maybe that will lead me to the offending program.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I had the problem with a new laptop with Windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp; The antivirus program that was pre-installed would not allow my restore points. It think these programs use restore points to monitor a virus that makes registry changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The uninstall for some programs leave orphan files so&nbsp; I used Norton Utilities to uninstall the antivirus program because it cleans traces of programs from the registry. I tested with Windows Defender and restore points work now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Norton Utilities deep defrag warning states it removes restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any programs running that create restore points?&nbsp; Old restore points will be deleted
<span>automatically to save hard drive space.&nbsp; Also check settings in
<strong>System Protection</strong>&nbsp; and increase restore point size.</span></p>
<p>It could be OS bug which allows restore points to delete because the OS recognizes it as old restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know about any log files for this problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just checked and the system is now saving the most recent restore point, but no others. I have almost 25 GB of space allocated, and the current restore point only uses 10.5GB. &nbsp;But maybe the system needs excess space for the actual creation of restore
 points?</p>

    <title>Help unlocking N7 characters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the alpha pixel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help unlocking N7 characters</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;<span>Since the release of the N7 characters, I've been trying to unlock them, but with no such luck other than the Fury twice and the Slayer through a weekend bonus pack. They have a gold/rare level and so I thought buying only
 premium spectre packs would be the quickest and most cost effective way since you're guaranteed two gold/rare items. But all I ever get&nbsp;are weapon upgrades,&nbsp;usually for weapons I don't often use. I just wanted to know if there's something I'm missing. Like
 does your N7 rating influence the quality of items you get? I'm not so sure its just plain rotten luck any more because of the sheer number of the already mentioned packs I've bought.</span></p>

<p>I had the same issue following Earth DLC was launched. What I did was complete a few Gold runs and use all the credits to purchase veteran and recruitment packs. After I built up the foundation of common and uncommon weapons and characters I then switched
 up to getting Premium packs and low and behold, started getting the N7 characters..not bothered with premium packs since.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I know several people who have done the same thing and started getting N7 Characters, all I am missing now is the Fury</p>

<p>To increase your drop rate of the N7 Characters (Which are classified as Rare) etc, I suggest getting all of your Common and Uncommon weapons to level X, then spend time on getting Premium Spectre Packs. Guaranteed Rare drop and a increased chance of getting
 Ultra Rare drops as well.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I will admit, I've had some luck with unlocking characters with buying Spectre Packs, so purchase a few of them and see if the Random Number Generator (RNG) Gods look favorably upon you. To determine what weapons/characters/gear/mods/etc are Common, Uncommon,
 Rare or Ultra Rare, check out your Multiplayer Manifest on the BioWare Social Network. Has a complete list of all items for the multiplayer there, and the ones you've unlocked are highlighted there (Ones you haven't unlocked are shaded out).</p>

<p>I got the new N7's within one week of the dlc. I bought PSP's only? Mu tip is lets say you want the new engi (my fav) then use an engi to buy the PSP. Same thing works with guns but not as often as characters.

<p>Personally I find your assumption about the status of my manifest to be offensive
<b>FueldRockets</b>. If you actually were to look at my Manifest you'd see that all of my Common, Uncommon, Rare weapons are maxed at tier X, all of my Mods are tier V, I have all characters unlocked (All of my Soldier and Engineer Characters have all of their
 appearance options unlocked), have the maximum capacity upgrades for my consumables as well. My manifest is rather good considering I don't spend all my time online or playing Mass Effect 3, as I do share my console with my brother and he does play other games
 on it as well.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>If you don't have anything worthwhile to add to the topic of discussion, besides hateful rhetoric, then please stop. You haven't helped out
<b>SgtSlaughtrFest</b> at all with your post. You opinion that the N7 Slayer is 'useless' is only your opinion alone as others disagree with it. Personally, I think the N7 Slayer is a decent character and alongside the Krogan Vanguard, are the only Vanguards
 I use at all (No... I don't spam Biotic Slash. I actually DO play the N7 Slayer rather capably).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>'Feeding the Credit Machine'? So... you spend real money on buying these packs right? I admit, I have spent some MS points to get a few Jumbo Equipment Packs but 99% of the time I use the credits I earn from playing the game to buy them.</p>

<h2>            getting Error&#58; 0x887A0005 while saving a movie project on moive maker</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Error: 0x887A0005 </p>
<p>
</p><p>While attempting to save a movie project on Movie Maker (into a Movie), I received the above error. &nbsp;I've made many movies and have never encountered this before. &nbsp;In the error it states: &nbsp;"There are missing or unusable files in you Movie Maker Project that
 are preventing your movie from being saved. &nbsp;Please check that file preparation is enabled in Options, or remove the files and try again."</p>
<p>I've tried several times to save the Movie, and get this message each time. &nbsp;Occasionally one of the picks will have a caution sign on it and asks if I would like to remove it so I do. &nbsp;That doesn't seem to help. &nbsp;I looked for "file preparation" under "Options"
 but do not see that option anywhere. &nbsp; Does any one know where "file preparation" is? &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions as to how I can get past this error?? &nbsp;I'm thinking of aborting Windows Movie Maker all together and looking for a different video editor
 that will be compatible with Windows Movie Maker Project but not sure if there is one that exists. &nbsp;HELP</p>

</p><p>There is no size limit imposed on Movie Maker though you are limited by how much free space you have<br />

<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue as the original poster -- however, it only occurs while I am using my mini displayport to HDMI adapter.&nbsp; I am also using a Windows 10 Surface Pro 3, not a Surface 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I play videos from any source (Netflix in IE, Netflix in Edge, Netflix client, YouTube in IE or Edge are the ones I've tried), the playback rate is half normal, and there is no audio.&nbsp; If I remove the external HDMI connection, everything plays just fine,
 but adding the connection back makes the problem occur again.&nbsp; Rebooting, etc. is no help.</p>

            <p>No docking station, and the output device is correctly set to the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The strange thing, to me, is that the audio is not only lost, but the video playback of streaming services like YouTube, Bing Video, and Netflix slows to a crawl.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The audio shows as being output, by observing the green output bar of the control panel, but no actual audio makes it to the TV.</p>

            <p>Redirecting the sound to the internal speakers or to the&nbsp;hearphones (if you connect them) fixes the issue, in my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, just one time I did have the audio working on the TV. It happened just after a BSOD while connecting the mdp adapter: the surface restarted itself and the audio started to flow from it to the tv just fine.</p>
<p>The day after (I disconnect the surface every morning to take it with me) I wasn't able to make it work again, apart from excluding the audio from the hdmi connection.</p>

            <p>Same issue on Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; I'm posting here in support of the original posting and since problem is Win10 related and not the Surface model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All was happy under 8.1.&nbsp; Under 10 video playback CRAWLS when mirroring through the Microsoft Mini Displayport to HDMI adapter.&nbsp; Target is a straight-forward Samsung HD TV HDMI input port that worked perfectly under Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem has nothing to do with streaming.&nbsp; Playing back device-resident videos also crawls along when mirroring through the adapter.&nbsp; Plug adapter in but don't connect HDMI cable and the video will play fine.&nbsp; Plug the HDMI to the adapter and the video starts
 crawling.&nbsp; Unplug the HDMI from the adapter and the video is back to full speed.</p>

            I now have the same issue. &nbsp;Everything was working fine for months. &nbsp;Last night I connected my Surface pro 3 to my television as I normally do via the mini display adapter and everything came to a slow crawl with no sound. &nbsp;I used the same cable and same
 TV as always. &nbsp;Anyone has a solution? &nbsp;I think last night was the first time I tried the setup up under Windows 10.

    <title>Setting Thunderbird as my default mail program - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Setting Thunderbird as my default mail program</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 8.1 and I am trying to set Thunderbird as my default mail program. I go into "Set program access and computer defaults", in Control Panel, expand "Custom Configuration" and click Mozilla Thunderbird under "Choose a default email program"
 then click "OK". However when I go back into "Custom configuration" the email setting has reverted to "Use my current email program". Same thing happens under "Non Microsoft Configuration". Any suggestions. This causing problems when Adobe Acrobat tries to
 send auto emails</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

            <p>Select Tools | Options.<br />
On the Advanced panel, select the General tab.<br />
Make sure that "Always check to see if Thunderbird is the default mail client on startup" is checked.<br />
Click Check Now to check if Thunderbird is set as the default mail client immediately.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsupport.cdn.mozilla.net%2fmedia%2fuploads%2fgallery%2fimages%2f2011-03-14-10-08-08-3db461.png" /></p>
<p>If you want to set Thunderbird as the default client for e-mail, newsgroups or feeds, check the corresponding boxes and click OK. When a box is grayed out, Thunderbird is already set as the default client for that purpose.<br />
If you set Thunderbird to be the default mail client, other applications (such as your web browser or word processing application) may need to be restarted to be aware of the change.</p>

            <p>Santanu, Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Thunderbird configured as you suggest but it makes no difference. When I go into "Set Program Access and Computer Defaults" in Control Panel and expand "Custom" it still has "Use my current email program" checked. I cant check any other option and
 have it stick.</p>
<p>The reason for my question is that I am trying to do a mail merge under MS Word and then pdf and automatically email the documents using the Acrobat PDFmaker Office COM add-in in MS Word.</p>
<p>The mail merge and PDF work fine but when the add-in attempts to send the email I get an error message "There is no email program associated to perform the requested action. Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association
 in the Defaults Program control panel" followed by another error message "MAPI logon unsuccessful. Cannot email messages"</p>
<p>Thunderbird is showing IMAP-mail.outlook.com as the IMAP Mail Server and Microsoft Live Hotmail - smtp.mail.outlook.com as the outgoing server.</p>
<p>Don't know what to try next.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<h3> blegs38552  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker file size</h2>
                    I had a 1.6GB 480p MP4 file that I wanted to trim the start and finish in Windows Live Movie Maker. It did the job well, but when I went to save the file, which I want to watch on a wide screen T, it seemed like the best choice was 780p. This resulted
 in a 5.7 GB file - much to large for my need.<br />
<br />
Since the original file is a 480p file, I don't see why I need such a large file, but I do not see any setting that would seem to be appropriate for my needs.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know which setting I should use to get back to the original file size, or whatsetting I can enter into a Custom definition for this usage?<br />

            <p>What I might suggest is skipping Movie Maker completely if all you want to do is to trim a little bit and then convert the file type to .mp4.&nbsp; In Freemake Video Converter, for example, you can select a video file or files&nbsp;(off a DVD directly, if you like).&nbsp;
 You can choose to trim the video (including spots in the middle, not just the beginning and end) and finally you can choose the destination format (e.g. .mp4) and the bitrate and resolution settings.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to disable thumbnail caching in all except a few folders&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an A+ certified technician and I have a question about thumbnail caching.&nbsp; For reference I have read
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-files/thumbsdb-file-in-use-by-another-program-inhibits/31757847-8be8-439b-8a33-d24599ef3b26?page=3">
this thread</a> and others like it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to&nbsp; prevent Explorer from locking folders that I'd like to modify I need to turn off thumbnail caching in most of my folders.&nbsp; I already know how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question:&nbsp; Can I turn thumbnail view on in just a few folders? (NOT folder "types" such as video.&nbsp; I mean just a single folder.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will this enable thumbnail caching in all of Explorer so that I get the "folder in use" errors in
<em>non-thumbed</em> folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI: I also do not cache thumbnails for the taskbar.&nbsp; So my theme style should not make a difference... I hope.&nbsp; For my clients who have slow computers I normally stick to basic themes anyway.&nbsp; I also do not allow most programs to create taskbar thumbnails
 (such as Firefox.)&nbsp; Let me know if there are other areas I haven't thought of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Taskbar thumbnail caching is an Aero video card cache (desktop window manager) and unrelated to file thumbnail in terms of both generation and storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But no, you can't enable thumbnail cache only in a specific folder, only in the scopes you already mentioned.&nbsp; The functionality just doesn't exist to track it on that level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even with all full defaults, you should not be getting any locking.&nbsp; Any well-written program should abandon modification request is made

But not all programs
 are as well-written as we might like.&nbsp; Still I'd be interested to know what program you are using that is getting locked.&nbsp; The thumbnails shouldn't be able to cause this in Windows 7 and later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>From your post it appears that you are facing issues viewing online videos.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There could be several different reasons for slow-down or buffering issues. <span>
It seems like it is buffering the video, so it will take time. Once the buffering is done the video will not freeze.</span></p>

            Hello . I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

1) Please work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

2) If any steps cannot be performed then try whichever method works to enter Safe Mode with Networking which may work better to perform the steps:  http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html

3) If no  Safe Mode, from the Advanced Startup Options use the Command Prompt at boot to run the Repair Commands in the Checklist:  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html
 
3) If nothing else works then you can reinstall Windows while keeping your files, programs and most settings by running a Repair Upgrade. Install the Media Creation Tool from this

okay for step 1/2/3 I&nbsp;did, I guess its same. The difference is whether I can get into advanced setup or not<br />
for recovery the ask me windows image that I currently don't have it so I need to go to step 3.2<br />
in step 3.2 I only get the windows img but unfortunately again I don't have DVD-RW or such installed on my pc so I need to go to step 4 create bootable media using FD<br />
so... for step 3.2 after I got windows img can, I just install it thro~ that?<br />
or do I need to go back to step 3 and start advanced recovery with the img I just downloaded<br />
<br />
I suspect the BSOD cause lies within the windows file<br />
The problem occurs only at the start of booting when I tried to play a game but ofter once happened everything gets normal no BSOD even after I try to turn off my PC 4 day straight stressing it out and such<br />
<br />
then if I install the windows with keeping all my files option do the registry and other things still there<br />
i mean do i need to reformat my HDD all of it?<br />
<br />
okay i'll try step 3 first try to advance recovery<br />
i'll tell you the result nxt

            If you want to skip to the Clean Install then follow the illustrated steps in this link to prepare as best you can, create and boot the media to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space, then click next to let it auto-format needed partitions and begin.  This gets it cleanest and makes it foolproof.  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587

If you need to rescue files because they're not backed up elsewhere,  there is a step to do this first using the booted media:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6

After install expedite all Windows Updates, then take your time installing programs and settings so you can test performance in between each to isolate what's causing the problem.  I will tell you however that no one who has followed this install closely has reported any fur

<h2>            MSI GT62VR 6RE &#34;Dominator Pro 4K&#34; Vertical colored lines II  Windows update cause&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, since your support page was down I am looking for a remedy on this problem, I'm not sure if it's a windows update or a screen problem. In the video below I am encountering some problems with the screen and had to use a restore point to temporarily
 resolve it before it happens again. </p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WCMfwHs0Pw</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what must be causing this? This laptop is brand new and was working fine till a recent windows update and noticed it usually boots up stuck on a black screen forcing me to put it to sleep and then switching it on from sleep getting the screen
 to boot up. This is probably one of the strangest problems I've encountered this fast with a new laptop from last week.</p>

            <p>Hey, guys! I'm sorry to see that you are having some noises from your console or it's not reading discs anymore. This thread is a little old. BDIDDY2k7 is right, and you should get your console repaired if troubleshooting hasn't helped you out. You can <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact us</a> via phone or chat support for further assistance with that, or use our <a href="http://myservice.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a> to set up a repair on your own.</p>
<p>If you need assistance with any other support issues, please post a new thread detailing what you're running into and troubleshooting you've completed. This way we can get you the individual support that works best on the forums. :)</p>
