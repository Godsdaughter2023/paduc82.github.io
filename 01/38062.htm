<p>If I where to install SP3 I would choose to download the<br />
file and not use Automatic Updates.</p>
<p>Your PC must be at least SP1 or SP2 level as SP3 will not<br />
install on XP Gold.</p>
<p>I would also create an "Image Backup" of my drive prior<br />
to installing SP3 just in case you do have problems.<br />
Don't have any Image Backup software:<br />
Try "True Image" (has a 15 day trial version available)<br />

    <title>Need help&#58; Unsupported disc error, false tampering claim - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evilclint  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help&#58; Unsupported disc error, false tampering claim</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello, there's a lot to tell here regarding my issue so please bear with me and please read either all of it or nothing. I don't want to leave any important details out as I know I'm telling the 100% truth about how Microsoft's update broke my system,
 how they refused to fix it while under warranty, and their false tampering accusations which have left me feeling frustrated, helpless, and scammed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I bought a brand new, factory sealed Xbox 360 Slim around this time last year, played it for a while then got bored with it and stopped playing for a few months over the winter. As my profile shows, I have two games (have online receipts, original cases/discs),
 and have pretty low play time on both. What I'm trying to say here is I've hardly used the system since purchase, and that this is verifiable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The console was working perfectly fine up until a couple months ago when I logged on to play again after the break I took. When I started up the system I was prompted to update to the "2.0.12625.0" patch. During the patch I experienced an error which
 read "3143 - 3151 - B380 - 1342 - C000 - 0185". I looked up the error online and was not able to find any information about it. I tried patching again and it went through without error. However, directly after the update I began experiencing an error I never
 had before, where it would give me an "unreadable disc" error when I tried to play a game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried both of my games and both games got this error. I could tell the disc drive itself was still working as the dashboard would correctly show which game I had in. I was also able to download the games to the hard drive fully, but that did not change
 the error. I went online and followed every step Microsoft recommends to fix such errors. After those failed to work, I researched the internet for quite a long time and noticed that many other people experienced the same issue after the "2.0.12625.0" patch,
 but no one had posted how they resolved the error. At that point I noticed a Wikipedia article was saying there was another update coming out soon that would do something to disc drives, so I opted to wait till then to see if that helped at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When the "2.0.13146.0" patch was released, I patched to that and tested if I could now play my games. Unfortunately I still received an error, but the error changed with the patch from "unreadable disc" to "unsupported disc." I spent more time on the
 internet trying to figure it out then finally gave up after most searches lead to things dealing with pirated games, which mine simply are not. Without finding an answer, I then put in a repair request online and shipped my console to Microsoft.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; This week while checking emails Microsoft had sent me during the "repair," one of the links I followed showed me that my warranty had expired January 1st, 1900 (previously it was some time in September 2011) and that my system was not available for service.
 At first I thought this was some error on the site, but after a day or two of still getting the false warranty information I searched for it online. I found out that that was Microsoft's way of saying the warranty was voided during service for tampering. I
 was pissed but at the same time optimistic this was wrong since I know without a doubt I haven't tampered with the system in any way. I decided I'd hold off on getting angry until I could confirm when my Xbox arrived back to me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I got my Xbox delivered today, and just as I had feared there was a letter attached to my Xbox saying they found evidence of tampering and that they will no longer provide repair service. Looking over my console, I can see Microsoft placed several small
 red stickers that look like arrows on the system, but I don't know what those represent as I see nothing else there that they could point to. I can also see that they have torn off most of a sticker that was on the back of the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Needless to say I'm feeling a lot of negative emotions right now about this situation. I'm still having a hard time getting my mind around the fact that Microsoft can essentially break the product I purchased from them via required update (admittedly
 probably not intentional), then refuse to fix it for no legitimate reason so they can get out of warranty obligations. My Xbox went from the factory sealed packaging to sitting on my desk and hadn't moved an inch until it was sent in for repair, yet they claim
 tampering? Sorry, but no. There's no chance I tampered with it. None.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; When I calm down and get the time to sit on hold on the phone, I do plan on calling Microsoft but according to people with similar experiences, they refuse to do anything about it due to their policies. In the meantime I'm hoping that posting here will
 get me some help from either Microsoft workers with more integrity or helpful customers with suggestions on what to do from here. I plan on exploring all reasonable options restlessly until they fix this situation, but obviously I don't want to pursue non-class
 action litigation versus a corporate giant, something they probably know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. Please no trolls.</p>

<p>Sigh, need to add this to the mess now. I just put my Xbox back on my desk and hooked it up, booted it up to see if I had everything plugged in right and found out that not only did support not fix my Xbox, they broke it even further. Before sending it to
 them, my Xbox could do everything except play games. Now when I boot up it brings up a black screen that says "System Error. Contact Xbox Customer Support." in several languages. Down at the bottom it says "E 55". The light on the power button is now red as
 well. I can't even believe this is happening.</p>

<p>Something isn't ringing true here. For one I'm fairly certain the console never tells you what version the patch is at any point during the update, you just get prompted for an update and it does it's thing. A class action suit is asking for trouble, for
 one when they open the console up in court if modifications are found then you're going to find yourself with a large bill very quickly and no way of showing you didn't make the modifications.</p>

<p>I never said the patch window itself said which patch it was, maybe it did or didn't I can't remember that, but I know from doing the research which patch I was patching to in each event based on dates and I included it because it's relevant information.
 Not sure why you made that assumption.</p>

<p>you're much better off appealing to fellow consumers for answers. in my experience, xbox support has gone very downhill over recent years and it seems that current practice is to figure out what you did wrong just to tell you you're SOL and they cant help
 you. in the event that it is in fact an issue microsoft should fix, they'll either pitch you suggestions that remove their liability and require you to pay for the solution, or they'll flat out not tell you the next step in fixing your issue. again, that's
 my experience. over a month ago my Fable 2 disc went faulty and posted my issue <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/8/t/50710.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (I actually figured out it was the disc that was faulty with the help of xbox support staff) but once it was revealed that the disc was faulty all I got as far as a "solution" was "pay for resurfacing or buy another copy". which, although unreasonable
 and unhelpful in my opinion, was margianally better than support staff on "xbox.com" telling me to "contact the disc manufacturer" which would be microsoft. I have yet to receive any kind of useful solution or suggestion to my issue, and have not been given
 any kind of information as to how I can obtain a replacement disc, let alone how to contact microsoft to obtain my replacement if, in fact, these "support" forums are not considered an acceptable form of contact.</p>

<p>OP: While I am sympathetic to your issue (and believe me, I am) you aren't going to get any help here regarding this issue. You'll probably get folks quoting the Terms of Use and definitely other users inciting riots and whatnot, but the truth of the matter
 is any issues with your repair need to be taken up with that department of phone support. Again, I'm terribly sorry for the frustration, confusion, and everything, but please ring them up and see if you can get your issue sorted with them. Thanks.</p>

            Thanks for the advice, but no luck. I tried the Wlarp repair all but it did not complete. 1st try 55%, 2nd try 15%, 3rd try 65%. The only change was Windows Live Mail dropped off the start page but it is back on now. I also tried disabling anti-virus and
 both Firewalls, no change.<br />

            I subsequently used task manager to end the 3 attempts at repairing WLM as all 3 processes had failed to terminate. Then I re-ran the "Repair All" and it completed successfully. But WLM
<u><b>still</b></u> does not work. I would re-install WLM but I do not want to lose a years history.

Scroll as needed. Event ID is 1001.<br />
<br />
Edit :<strong> when my computer had SP1, it said Chkdsk in the middle column. Now, with SP2 installed, it says Wininit. I could be wrong. If&nbsp;so,&nbsp;I stand corrected.<br />

<p>Hi Fransmullers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. IF the games are not backward compatible you will not be able to access them on the Xbox one. You can check the
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list of backward compatible games</a> to see if any of the games you own are on it.</p>
<p>

<p>Be sure to check the ready to install tab and that it's filtered correctly.&nbsp; &nbsp; You can filter it to just show 360 games.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<br />
You've asked several questions and I will attempt to address them in order <br />
<br />
First, unless you are having a problem with a particular device, it is best not to mess with the drivers. I recommend you set your update settings to notify you of any updates but, do not automatically download and install. Go through the updates listed as
 available and choose to install the security related updates only. <br />
<br />
When you open add/remove programs look at the top of the window. There should be a box that you can check or uncheck for showing Microsoft updates. I leave mine unchecked. It is possible and even likely that an unsuccessful update will reappear in the update
 list and install. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Do not uninstall any updates that are already installed. If you want to free up some drive space consider removing any programs you do not need or use. Since you have recently installed a lot of updates I would suspect you have a lot of restore points that
 are not needed. You can delete those and free up some space. The best way to do this is to clear all but the most recent restore point. This ensures that you have atleast one good restore point. Follow the directions
<a href="http://www.winxptutor.com/srclear.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HERE</a> to perform the task. This will also delete any unnecessary temp files.

            <p>First, thank you, Can I just clarify that I understand all the valuable info? 1. Unless a hardware or plug in device is not functioning properly, I shouldn't try to manually search and download drivers. Just make sure I have set for automatic updates (especially
 security) on ones I have now, Correct?</p>
<p>I should basically turn off my ability to to see the windows updates by checking the box in Add/Remove Programs, if not, unsuccessful updates may continue to try to download and install? I have checked out my update history and did have a few failed, but
 never had any problems. Later I went back and tried to reinstall and it was successful. Is this something I shouldn't have done?</p>
<p>My main issue is the slowness, programs not responding and desktop icons randomly changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Micrsoft Fix it. The Icons issue cannot be fixed.</p>
<p>Some issues do relate to&nbsp; not enough memory, I delete what I am sure about (NOT MUCH) but am afraid to delete anything I don't know, because I'm sure it will destroy everything! Restore points are being affected, there isn't enough room, so they are not
 done as often. </p>
<p>I also run "Eusing Cleaner" for registry keys ect...clean up, but I'm not sure what to check there either.
</p>
<p>Want to know best part???? I have no back up. Man, instead of Paralegal school, computer sciences may be a more productive way to go!&nbsp; Thanks again for your help.</p>

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Sorta. I am referring to Windows updates. You can change the way you are notified of updates.

 are in add/remove programs. Windows will inform you if an update did not succeed. When that happens it should automatically reappear in the list of suggested updates (the little yellow shield in the system tray). If you go back and install them then all is
 good. If you don't all is good as well. The will reappear as stated.</span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My main issue is the slowness, programs not responding and desktop icons randomly changing.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Micrsoft Fix it. The Icons issue cannot be fixed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is the first you have said about this. Click start &gt; Run &gt; type msinfo32 &gt; Press Enter. Post the results in your reply. Also tell me what, if any, security software you have. For example, AVG, Norton, McAfee ect...
<br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Exactly what do you mean your icons are randomly changing. Please describe it as best you can. You can also take a screen shot if you wish and upload it to

</p>
<p>Some issues do relate to&nbsp; not enough memory, I delete what I am sure about (NOT MUCH) but am afraid to delete anything I don't know, because I'm sure it will destroy everything! Restore points are being affected, there isn't enough room, so they are not

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">You use the term memory but, I believe what you mean is your hard drive space. Memory is your ram. Different day for an explanation on that or you can Google it.
</span><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Your restore points are not being affected by the lack of space. If it were, you would get an error of low disk space. Nevertheless, when a new restore point is created an old one is removed if the hard drive space reserved
 by windows for system restore points becomes full. </span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also run "Eusing Cleaner" for registry keys ect...clean up, but I'm not sure what to check there either.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Get rid of Eusing. I have used it myself on several different computers over the last few years and every single time it ends up deleting something it shouldn't have. Of course I do it experimentally. In your case is a matter
 of cleanup. If you want to use a reg cleaner use <a href="http://download.cnet.com/ccleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Ccleaner </a>and <a href="http://www.glaryutilities.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Glary Utilities</a>. Both are good and both are safe. I have never had either of them delete a necessary item.&nbsp; When deleting reg entries with Ccleaner you will be prompted to make a
 back-up of the entries. Always choose yes. Glary automatically saves a backup.<br />

<p><strong>Migrating from Windows 7 directly to Windows 8.1 will require that you reinstall your applications. The setup wizard will only preserve personal files and settings.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you want to preserve your installed programs, you should first upgrade to Windows 8 then upgrade to Windows 8.1 through the Store for free.</strong></p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Before upgrading to Windows 8.1</strong></p>
<p>- Make sure you apply the latest updates before upgrading.</p>
<p>- Try switching to a wired connection if you are downloading over Wi-Fi</p>
<p>- Disable/uninstall any third party Antivirus you might have installed prior to updating.</p>
<p>- Do a clean boot.</p>

<p>2. You have not installed all pending Windows Updates. You can find details <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/why-can-t-find-update-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>If you are having issues with installing Windows Update we recommend you post for help with that issue.
</p>
<p>You may also attempt an automated fix by running the Windows Update troubleshooter</p>
<p>3. You need to sync your App License; you can do this by:</p>
<p>* On the Start screen, tap or click Store to open the Windows Store. </p>
<p>* Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Settings.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, and then click Settings.)
</p>
<p>* Tap or click App updates </p>
<p>* Tap or click Sync licenses </p>
<p>4. The Windows Store Catalog is not refreshing correctly. </p>
<p>To refresh the catalog, try pressing the Windows and R key together to open the run box, type WSReset.exe and hit Enter. Reboot and check the Windows Store again.</p>

<h2>            Window Store App Tiles and Icons disappeared from the Start Menu after Explorer freeze and forced reboot</h2>
                    <p>My HP Envy x360 laptop had some issue with Windows 10, it froze the entire operating system and forced reboot, it happened like 2 times, and after that, the issue is not present anymore, but in the last forced reboot made ALL the default Windows Store Apps
 disappear, my app tiles are completely wiped out, Groove, Photos, News, tiles are not present anymore as you can see in the picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa11be16-f4eb-4886-a308-6686613b7c85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa11be16-f4eb-4886-a308-6686613b7c85" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>They don't even are present in the Applications Folder Tree anymore, but they're not uninstalled you still can use it normally if you open an file whose those applications are associates such .mp3 and pictures, but their icons are not shown in the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>What i've tried:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Run chkdsk before normal boot in Windows 10, no errors found.</li><li>Checked the Event Log, nothing relevant found.</li><li>Tried the solution posted by Kiran Kishore in an similar issue in this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/app-tiles-disappeared-from-windows-10-start-menu/5d8abf5b-f73b-45f1-9d80-b988cd6da49a">
answer</a></li></ul>
<p>None of those solutions worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Side issue:</strong> My Windows 10 boot screen tells me i have 9 seconds to omit the disk check, even i've did the disk check before, the message still pops up but is always skipped even i don't pressed any key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you.</p>

<p>Hi The Crusher,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the issue specific with a specific application or with other applications as well?</p>
<p>There is no such feature in Windows 7 to keep the application open even while the computer is in idle state.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you check the event logs when the application closes automatically.</p>
<p>Event logs are special files that record significant events on your computer, such as when a user logs on to the computer or when a program encounters an error. Whenever these types of events occur, Windows records the event in an event log that you can
 read by using Event Viewer.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Event Viewer.‌ If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click an event log in the left pane.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click an event to view the details of the event.</p>
<p>Check the link: <strong>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?:
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</strong></a></p>
<p>Provide the error code or error message for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            BIOS error</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few months ago my computer came up with an error message of BAD_BOOT_CALLER. I called my computers support center and fixed it, but a few weeks ago it came up with the same error and kept doing it to the point that every time I logged on it would come
 up. I chatted with Microsoft support and it seemed to work. A few days ago windows updated on my computer, and it started to bring up the error again every time I would put my laptop to sleep for a few minutes(e.g. put my laptop lid down). I would come back
 to it and as soon as I opened the lid it would give the error. I went to the support and found that the update might be affecting it so I uninstalled the update, but it is still doing it and I cannot seem to get a person on the chat to talk to about it. Has
 anyone ever had this happen, and if so did you get it fixed and how?</p>

<h3> edalfon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezing for 2-3 secs every 10-15 secs after last update</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded to windows 10. At first it was fine, but after the last update (early December) the system is incredibly sluggish. It basically freezes for 2-3 seconds, every 10-15 seconds rendering my laptop useless (or at least extremely annoying
 to use). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the culprit was some old software that perhaps was incompatible with Windows 10, so I decided to start fresh and I reset the system (Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security -&gt; Recovery -&gt; Reset this PC) and installed windows 10 from scratch. This did not
 solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked the performance tab in the Task Manager, and it does not seem to be a program running in the background and consuming system resources (e.g. while writing this, CPU usage is rather constant&nbsp;around 2% and the system keeps freezing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried setting the performance options&nbsp;to "Adjust for best performance" and it did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to solve this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. My laptop is a Dell XPS17, powered by an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2630QM @ 2GHz processor, 8GB of RAM and running Windows 10 Home (64-bit operating system)</p>

            <p>Thanks for your answer. I did both steps (safe mode and then clean boot) and none of them solved the issue. The system still freezes (it seems to be everywhere and not related to a specific program/application, for example, when I open start menu or scroll
 through all apps, it freezes for a while every few seconds; similarly, using lightweight apps such as notepad, it freezes in the same way. Even in the login screen; to enter the password, I start typing and it does not respond immediately, but after a few
 seconds it suddenly records the password I just typed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do?, should I just go back to Windows 7?</p>

After a (rather lengthy) full system scan using Windows defender, the system is clean but the problem persists.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
After checking for new windows updates, it says "Your device is up to date. Last checked: Today, 6:53 AM". As for the updates, it only found new windows defender definition (1.213.1255.0), which usually updates every other day.</p>

<p>x86 is 32bit which is what your computer you say is built for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to know if it can run 64bit <strong>architecture.</strong></p>
<p>Your question is about the "bit" versions, <strong>not the editions.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You check with your computer manufacturer to see if they support and supply 64bit Windows 7&nbsp;drivers for that model number.</p>

<p>x86 is 32bit which is what your computer you say is built for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You want to know if it can run 64bit <strong>architecture.</strong></p>
<p>Your question is about the "bit" versions, <strong>not the editions.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You check with your computer manufacturer to see if they support and supply 64bit Windows 7&nbsp;drivers for that model number.</p>

            I'm not sure what you're asking. I *think* you're asking whether a 32-bit computer can run 64-bit Windows. If that's correct, the answer is no.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sorry for the late reply. </p>
<p>Please go to Control Panel then click on System and Security then click on Administrative Tools then open services.</p>
<p>Now in Services find a service called VAIO Event Service, make sure that the service has started in the status column. If not then right click on it then select Start .... and also right click again on it then go to properties then in General tab in Start
 up Type make sure that automatic is selected then click OK then try function keys see if they are working? If not then restart your PC and try function keys again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Above Helps!</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please make sure that the service has started if you can change the volume using Fn key and F5 and F6 then it could be either another program conflicting with it or your buttons has stopped working not sure what could be the cause! Your Fn key
 is definitely working but not sure about F5 and F6!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried changing brightness in power options? Can you do it from there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you change brightness settings via Windows Mobility Center in Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Windows Mobility Center&nbsp; ---- What can you change from here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also try clean boot:</p>
<p>Go to msconfig (type in search box in startmenu or run in xp then press enter) then prepare your PC for clean boot by disabling all start up items and none windows services (do not disable VAIO Event Service) then restart your computer. See if it make a
 difference? if it did then you have to find out which ones caused the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please let me know your VAIO model?</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After little bit of research, I found this solution online.</p>
<p>Please understand that I do not guarantee if it will work for you too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read following threads in the following website:</p>
<a href="http://windowsforum.com/threads/cant-adjust-display-brightness.5924/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowsforum.com/threads/cant-adjust-display-brightness.5924/</a>
<p>
</p><p>From above you will find following solution other people have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Hardware and Sound &gt; Device Manager<br />
Once the Device Manger box opens expand the "Monitors" tab<br />
Left Click and uninstall the monitor listed<br />
Then select the Scan for Hardware Changes Icon <br />
then the adjust display brightness should reappear. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not %100 sure that it will solve the problem but it look like it has worked for some people.

<p>Hope above helps!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The button or icon for "Scan for Hardware Changes" is under menu bar, First button or icon from right ... it is under Help menu .... If you go over the icon or button, it will show "Scan for Hardware Changes"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also go to Action menu then select "Scan For Hardware Changes".... This might be easier...</p>

</p><p>After inserting an audio CD into the PC's CD drive, you have to click the <span>
Rip CD</span> Button. When you rip music from a CD, you're copying songs from an audio CD to your PC. During the ripping process, the Player compresses each song and stores it on your&nbsp; drive as a Windows Media&nbsp; Audio (WMA), WAV, or MP3 file. I suggest you to
 refer the article and check if it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As&nbsp;none of those methods are not working let's rebuild&nbsp;Windows Media Player Library. Check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R </strong>to open&nbsp;<strong>run</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Type in run&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player,</strong> and then click
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. <strong>Select </strong>all the files in the folder, and then click <strong>
Delete </strong>on the File menu.<br />
&nbsp; <strong>Note</strong>: you do not have to delete the folders that are in this folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. <strong>Restart </strong>Windows Media Player. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: Windows Media Player automatically rebuilds the database.</p>

            <p>I completed both of these methods but it still doesn't work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have music in my Windows music folder and have been trying to get them into WMP.&nbsp; The only way I have been able to do this is to check them and "Add them to windows media player list."&nbsp; This puts them in a playlist and then they start transferring in.&nbsp;
 Isn't WMP supposed to search for music on my computer and automatically add them?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The music is successfully added to&nbsp;WMP after doing the above.&nbsp; BUT....then after a day or&nbsp;2 they have disappeared out of WMP!&nbsp; They do remain in my Windows music folder.&nbsp; What the heck!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if this matters but I was previously using iTunes....got frustrated with it and decided to use WMP.&nbsp; I deleted iTunes but it's still in my recycle bin.</p>
<p>

    <title>Clarification on what switching out hardware does to the License - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clarification on what switching out hardware does to the License</h2>
                    <p>This seems to have been asked in a few different ways and I have seen some threads come near to a resolve but it just seems cloudy to me. So yes there may be similar threads but I would appreciate clear and concise answers to the following questions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no key system for Windows 10 and therefore licenses are linked to hardware in some manner (statement - clarify if wrong). This licence is stored within the Windows store and therefore Windows 10 can determine from that if it can be run or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Question One) The component which is being stored in the Windows Store, is that linked to a Microsoft account? Is it linked to the email that you enter when reserving the license? (I did not receive email confirmation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Question Two) If the same Microsoft account is used when performing the upgrade on multiple devices are they all linked to that account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Question Three) The license inherits the rights of the previous license, one of the rights of a retail license is "Includes transfer rights to another computer". If the license is tied to hardware is this possible? Or does it work on the basis of a Microsoft
 account has a pool of licenses in the store and chooses one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Question Four) If multiple license types are upgraded such as three retail versions and two OEM versions and a transfer of two of the retail versions to a completely new hardware is required, how does one ensure that the correct license is used on the new
 hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Question Five) How many transfers of hardware for a license are possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Question Six) If a retail version is upgraded and if for a PC that does not use a Microsoft account and then a complete hardware change is required, how is the licence transferred?</p>

<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The product key stored in the Windows Store doesn't necessarily mean a Microsoft Account is required since its a possibility you might not have one. Its possible Microsoft is just using it as a backup mechanism.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OEM :</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>This will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous based qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<em>With Windows 10, you can create your own recovery media and back up the pristine state of the operating system and preinstalled software. If things go wrong and you are unable to refresh or reset your device successfully, you
 can boot the device using recovery media and reset to the prior pristine state.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>You can also initiate a clean install by doing the following:</p>
<p>You can do a clean install a couple ways.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + i</p>
<p>Click Update and Security</p>
<p>Click Recovery</p>
<p>Under Remove everything and reinstall Windows, click Get started</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>

<p>Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power icon on the screen</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</p>
<span>

</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</p>
<span>
<p>

</p><p>Click Reset</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</em></p>

            <p>I have read all of that previously, but there are still some points which are ambiguous.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>This will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous based qualifying license"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That question and answer throws the whole thing and I am not the only one who may be misreading it. Is it referring to changing your motherboard between reserving a upgrade and installing Windows 10, changing your motherboard after the upgrade,
 or, as it is after the OEM key section; changing your motherboard when the upgrade license inherited from an OEM key. The retail version would inherit the right to transfer to a new machine and therefore a new motherboard but this contradicts that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A further question that I have is that I currently have six Windows 7 keys that are valid for the upgrade and three Windows 8 keys. Only four of those Windows 7 keys and one Windows 8 key are installed on computers. How would one go about ensuring
 that they are all upgraded? Would one have to use each of those keys on an installation instance and then select the upgrade; bringing into question the tying to hardware question and therefore transfers and new hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do thank-you for the response however I do not think that the information supplied answers all of my questions. Is there any information on when we will receive hard facts on the licensing system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Programs cant&#39;t connect to the network</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My&nbsp;Problem:</span></p>
<p>I have&nbsp;Windows 10 (Version 1511) and, overnight, some programs that require access to the Internet to run, they just don't open (because they "have no access to the Internet").</p>
<p>For example, I can open and browse on Microsoft Edge, but, if I try to open Chrome or Firefox, it says I have no Internet connection. As it happens with other apps, like Steam or even the Mail (Microsoft App), I presume it also happens with&nbsp;any other program.
 However, I can run all the programs offline, as long as they have that functionality (Following the example above,&nbsp;I can run Steam in offline mode).
</p>
<p>I can't update Windows Defender because it requires access to the Internet (the error 0x8008005 pops up)&nbsp;and Windows SmartScreen can't run either...</p>
<p><strong>The only thing that I know it runs is Edge</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solutions that I tried:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Check&nbsp;the computer's access to the Internet: It's connected to Wi-Fi with a reasonable signal strength.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Turn off the Firewall and run the programs: it didn't solve the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Run some "netsh"&nbsp;commands in the Command Prompt: didn't work.&nbsp;- Run the network troubleshooter: couldn't find the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me solving this issue! </p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps that you have tried. Since we don’t support Chrome and Firefox, you need to contact them for the issue. However, I would suggest you to clear the cache and clear browsing history of both the browser and
 check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>The error code “<strong>0x80080005</strong>” indicates that there is an Access Denied issue with the security descriptors of the
<strong>Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS).</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to manually reset <strong>the Windows Updates Components</strong>, restart the computer and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows Key + X</strong>&nbsp;on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</span></p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for answering so fast!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked Windows Update for any available updates, before and after I typed the commands in the Command Prompt. I quote the message I got: "Some problems occurred while installing updates, but we'll try again later." And bellow, the same&nbsp;error code "0x8008005"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I typed the commands in the Command Prompt and this happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1 - Stopping BITS, Windows Update Services, MSI Installer and Cryptographic:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>net stop wuauserv </strong>- The Windows Update service&nbsp;was not started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>net stop cryptSvc </strong>- The Cryptographic Services service was stopped successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>net stop bits </strong>- The BITS service was not started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>net stop msiserver </strong>- The Windows Installer service was not started.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2 - Renaming Software Distribution and Catroot2
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;Nothing showed up after entering both commands (but I don't know if that's normal)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step&nbsp;3 -&nbsp;Restarting BITS, Windows Update Services, MSI Installer and Cryptographic:</span></p>
<p><strong>net start wuauserv </strong>- It was not possible to start the Windows Update Service</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- System error 10106</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- It was&nbsp;not possible to load or start the requested service supplier&nbsp;<strong>net start cryptSvc&nbsp;</strong>-The Cryptographic Services service started successfully</p>
<p><strong>net start bits </strong>- It was not possible to start BITS</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- A specific service error occurred: 2147952506</p>
<p><strong>net stop msiserver </strong>- The Windows Installer service&nbsp;started successfully&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess I still have two problems to fix? <strong>Windows Update</strong> and
<strong>BITS.</strong></p>
<p>I cleared the cache and the browsing history of both browsers and it didn't work... I uninstalled both and tried to reinstall&nbsp;but, this happens:</p>
<p>- Chrome:&nbsp;While running the setup, it tries to connect to the Internet and it doesn't succeed. A message suggests to add the GoogleUpdate.exe to the&nbsp;list of Firewall permissions. I did it and tried to run the setup again and the problem remains.</p>
<p>- Firefox: an error pops up while the setup is running (downloading Firefox)&nbsp;and says that the download was interrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now?</p>

            I had a similar post, where it took several tries to connect - I was able to sync some folders, but in looking at the server learned that some of my email was only available from my client and those email seem to be gone.

            Since installation I have not been able to get mail to sync.&nbsp; Error code 0x8501001d.&nbsp; I am trying to sync an existing Outlook email account.&nbsp; The folders show up but no mail no matter what I try.

            <p>I am using the Mail App.&nbsp; After much searching and trying different things I discovered that my user profile was somehow corrupted.&nbsp; I created a new user and linked the app to my Outlook account and it worked.&nbsp; So I deleted the default user and set up all
 of my accounts and other apps again and it works fine.&nbsp; The only good thing was that files from the default user were saved to the desktop.&nbsp; Unfortunately I was unable to find much (any) real information on switching from default to another user.&nbsp; That could
 have made the process easier.&nbsp; The structure is not quite the same as it was in past Win versions.&nbsp; It works now but WOW.&nbsp; I would thing the upgrade process could identify a corrupted user and at least flag it if not fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I ran the troubleshooter several times and several ways during the process.&nbsp; It always found no problems.</p>

            For anyone that has the same problem.&nbsp; When you create your new user initially don't delete your old account.&nbsp; Create the new one but don't link it to your Outlook account.&nbsp; Once you have apps etc working in your new account delete the old one and then
 you can link the new account you made to Outlook.&nbsp; That way if you need to look back at the old one you can get settings and such from it.
