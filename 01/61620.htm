<h2>            Games crashing to desktop, BSOD, various other problems since building computer about a week ago</h2>
                    <p>This is quite a long post but I'm getting increasingly desperate and frustrated and I feel that all this may be relevant.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently built a computer from scratch for the first time using these parts:</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
GA-F2A88XN-WIFI motherboard</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
AMD Athlon X4 860K 3.7GHz Quad-Core Processor</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Seagate Barracuda 1TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
XFX Radeon R9 380 4GB Double Dissipation Video Card</p>
<p>Team Dark 8GB RAM (not sure about details, other than it's blue)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had nonstop problems since turning it on and trying to install Windows 10 (onto out of the box fresh parts). For the first dozen or so times i attempted to install windows, it would crash and BSOD, giving me random error messages including but not
 limited to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>IRQC not less or equal</p>
<p>Page fault in non paged area (with various .sys in parentheses after)</p>
<p>kmode exception not handled</p>
<p>dpc watchdog violation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything to get windows 10 64 bit to install properly, including updating BIOS, but it would always BSOD at the "Getting files ready for installation" step, at various percentages. After downloading some Windows 10 install drivers, using another
 PC, for my particular motherboard and putting them onto a USB flash drive, my computer would not detect the files as valid drivers when I selected them. I had to uncheck the box that hides invalid drivers, or whatever it said, to get them to show up in the
 first place, and even then my computer BSODed repeatedly at random percentages throughout the "Getting files ready for installation" step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, after removing one of my RAM cards (which i'm not convinced had any effect), it successfully made it through the installation process, only to crash at the screen that allows you to set WIFI options. The next time i made it to this step, I skipped
 this part and somehow managed to make it to make it to the desktop. After downloading every driver I could think of, I'm still running into problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first I noticed is a problem with my headphone plugins, for which I made a separate post a day ago. When first turning my computer on, my Realtek HD audio manager will give me a notification that it detects that I've plugged headphones in, but it will
 not give sound through them and in the manager window it will tell me that I've plugged nothing in despite the previous notification and the display on the right side of the manager window indicating an audio output slot is in use (a green circle). The solution
 given in that post was to type troubleshooting in the windows menu search bar, open the troubleshooting menu, select Hardware and Sound, then Hardware and Devices, and initiate troubleshooting. After doing this, it begins to put sound out through my headphones,
 but the Realtek HD audio manager still shows the same information, that being the middle of the window telling me I have nothing plugged in despite giving me notifications and displaying a slot in use on the right side of the window. Additionally, I have to
 run this troubleshooting every time I turn the computer on from a shutdown/restart or be left with no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, while playing games I am still being given BSODs soon after starting a game, with many of the same error messages (IRQC, kmode, etc.) as when I was trying to install windows, along with a few unfamiliar ones. Games also frequently crash to desktop
 after just a few minutes of playing. The most bizarre crash, however, has been one where my PC simply freezes completely while a very loud intermittent screech can be heard in the headphones. None of these crashes appear to happen while I'm watching youtube,
 browsing the internet, making downloads, or leaving my computer on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the length, but it took a lot of time and money to assemble this thing and I've scarcely had a few moments of actually being able to use it for gaming, which is the whole reason I bought it. Please help.</p>

            I might resort to purchasing windows 7 (all my friends use it), but that possible solution is cold comfort when I (probably foolishly) spent $120 on windows 10. I don't have the kind of income where I can just flush that down the toilet with no psychological
 effects.

            <p>Hey, thanks for the pics. So, it's a mini-ITX board. Yeah, I don't see any problem with your hardware installation except I don't know if you have applied the thermal paste properly on the CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried installing 32-bit of the Windows 10?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also wanna try removing the wifi card and the GPU and use the on-board graphics and ethernet cable for the internet while installing Windows 10. There may be some driver issues on those 2 hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then check if there's any difference in Windows 10 behavior without those 2 hardware. If everything is ok, then install the GPU and the driver. Then install the wifi card and the driver and see.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you ever figure out the root cause of this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same motherboard as you and have all the same BSOD messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else going through this same issue, my findings were that either RAM or a faulty driver was to blame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used memtest for a few hours and switched out the RAM completely and even put in a new CPU to no avail, so I knew the RAM/CPU was OK. Currently wiping the HDD by using DBAN and even that crashed with a kernal panic! Looking up this issue revealed again
 pointing to a driver issue. The LAN/WIFI driver popping up a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current best guess is the on board LAN/WIFI driver is corrupted. Hopefully DBAN will complete now that I have disabled LAN in the BIOS and once windows is re-installed i'll disable it from device manager to see if this prevents further crashes.</p>
<p>

            <p>The retail license is the best value. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>
</span></span></span>
<p>

    <title>headset not recognised on xbox one wireless controller - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            headset not recognised on xbox one wireless controller</h2>
                    <p>i got an xbox one this christmas and a xbox licenced turtle beach headset. When i plug the headset in to the controller it in does nothing - when i press the x and scroll across to the end (or second to the end) one, it doesnt come up with headset and i
 also did what it said in the manual: go to settings, devices and kinect, devices and accesories, xbox one wireless controller and then to the volume but it wont allow me to - it is grayed out so i cant click on it. meanwile, when i plug it in to my PowerA
 wired enhanced xbox liscenced xbox one controller on the same console, it works perfectly without even having to fiddle about going in settings and when you press the x and scroll to the last or second to last one you can adjust mic monitioring, headset volume
 and more. is this a problem with the controller or something that can be fixed as it is obviously not the headset when it works fine in the other controller. also, ive tried to update the controller multiple times to see if that is thde problem and it says
 its up to date so it cant be that.</p>
<p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Xbox12321,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the headset. First off the turtle beach are not licensed by Microsoft, they are a third party headset that are compatible with the Xbox. There have been issues with third party headsets not being recognized on the controller/console.
 Make sure first that the controller is completely up to date. Can also <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/wired-headset-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
try the troubleshooter</a> to see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>If your store will accept the Xbox One back for refund or return given that it is non-functional for your gaming purposes in less than 2 weeks, then package up the console, controller, all applicable cables etc and then take it back to them with your receipt
 and explain that you are unable to use the Turtle Beach headset.</p>

            <p>Lawrence, thanks very much for your reply. Sorry for confusion I caused, I am not trying to boot anything at this stage. What I am trying to do is download W10 installation media onto a USB drive plugged into my W7 PC so that I can install W10 on to a laptop
 which happens to have no OS on it. According to Microsoft, I should be able to do this using their download tool. When I run the tool, I get to the stage where I select USB option, but then it does not recognise any USB plugged in - there is nothing wrong
 with my USB, formatted correctly and working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating because I had W10 working on the laptop, but it would not update properly so I tried the 'Reset my computer' option. It started to download the OS, then just stuck at 1% download and I was forced to power off and now have no OS at all.
 Any ideas, I would be very grateful of any suggestions.</p>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>Col</p>
        </p>

            answers to your questions:<br />
<br />
1. I did not make any changes. Also, I have this problem for months now.<br />
2. Im trying to download all the updates that piled up in that time (around 50).<br />
3. trying to download via the built in windows update (start-&gt;all prograns-&gt;windows update). is there even a different way to do this? even if I try to access this through browser it directs me to this method.<br />
4. I have ESET NOD32 antivirus.<br />
<br />
Well I have tried all the methods above and I had several errors with them but at the end nothing works. the main thing it seems is a problem with the windows update service which I cant seem to stop properly.<br />
There is a problem with the windows update database and components.<br />
<br />
again, after trying all the solutions above, nothing helps<br />

<p>Start - Run</p>
<p>Type : MSConfig&lt;enter&gt;</p>
<p>System configuration window appear</p>
<p>click on Services tab - look at the bottom of the box and mark Hide all Microsoft services</p>
<p>Then click Disable All - That will disable every services listed</p>
<p>Apply the change - and Restart</p>
<p>Once logged back in, Do a Windows Update...</p>
<p>Hopefully it will work for you to</p>
<p>After the updates has been applied - Redo the MSConfig procedure to enable everything on your system</p>
<p>Good lick</p>

You may disable the ESET NOD32 antivirus installed on the computer and check.<br />

            If you have over 20 updates try installing them in waves (like 2 or 3 at a time) . I had this problem after a OS install and selected a few at a time rather than all 50 of the updates simultaneously and it worked. It took longer but it worked.

            One possible solution: Just wait.
<div><br />
<div>This has always happened to me when updating a Windows machine since Windows 7. Windows 8 does this too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Basically Windows Update doesn't report progress on downloading (why it has a progress bar for it I have no idea), even though it actually is downloading. This has always been the case for me on multiple machines using both Windows 7 and 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>At some point it'll jump from 0% to 100%, then begin "Installing", where the progress bar will actually report on percentiles between 0 and 100 as long as you're installing more than one update.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have a good connection to the Internet (1MB/s+), and it's taken more than an hour or so, then it's probably actually stuck, but in my experience I've never had to do anything but wait.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck!</div>

<p>Publication Services — a new Windows service that enables client applications to publish resources so that they can be discovered by other computers on the same subnet. Each application can dynamically register and unregister individual resources that it
 wants published.</p>
<p>What specifically is bothering you concerning this Service?</p>

    <title>HELP&#33; Computer crashes during attempts to full virus scan - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunnysunnyday  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP&#33; Computer crashes during attempts to full virus scan &#40;MSE&#41; or defrag &#40;MS&#41; or CHKDSK C&#58; &#47;f</h2>
                    Please help!&nbsp; My computer soon crashes every time I try to run a full virus scan or use the MS defrag it came with.&nbsp; I have important work that needs backing up but I'm concerned that I shouldnt in case this is a virus.&nbsp; I would be really grateful for
 some help.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
<br />
Windows XP Home Edition<br />
Microsoft Windows<br />
Version 5.1 (... Service Pack 3)<br />
<br />
Current system:<br />
Microsoft Windows XP<br />
Home Edition<br />
Version 2002<br />
Service Pack 3<br />
<br />
Fujitsu Siemens Computers<br />
Intel(R) Core(TM)2 CPU<br />
T7200 @ 2.00 GB of RAM<br />
<br />
Current disk defragmenter info:<br />
C:&nbsp;&nbsp; NTFS&nbsp;&nbsp; 112 capacity&nbsp;&nbsp; Free space 47 GB&nbsp;&nbsp; Free space 43%<br />
(Was only 15% free space at very start of problems, before I deleted or reduced old files)<br />
<br />
Antivirus:<br />
Originally Norton 2006, now uninstalled and replaced with current Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
<br />
Browser: firefox version 3.5.9 (Have IE too but don't use)<br />
<br />
The story so far:<br />
<br />
FIRST PROBLEM: STANDBY/HIBERNATION/SCREENSAVER CAUSING CRASHES?<br />
I came back from a long holiday and turned my computer on.&nbsp; It soon wanted me to update to the latest Firefox (must have been 3.6?).&nbsp; It may have also updated my windows automatically.&nbsp; Then every time the standby/hibernation/screensaver came on (not sure which
 was the culprit), the computer would crash- I would just get a grey screen when I tried to get back on by moving the mouse.<br />
<br />
'RESOLVED' BY:<br />
I restored the system to a few saved points back from before I had agreed to install the new firefox.&nbsp; I also stopped the computer going onto standby or hibernating.&nbsp; I couldn't work out how to turn the screensaver off.&nbsp; The standby/hibernation/screensaver
 stopped crashing the computer after this, and I was careful not to upgrade to firefox 3.6 again just in case, staying with the version I was on but still accepting upgrades (now on 3.5.9).&nbsp; I have still been accepting the automatic windows upgrades though,
 because I was told I should do so.<br />
<br />
UNRESOLVED PROBLEM: ANTIVIRUS AND DEFRAG CRASH WHENEVER RUN<br />
So, I now had a more useable computer.&nbsp; I tried to virus check but the virus check (Norton 2006) would crash every time I tried to do a full check.&nbsp; I analysed in the MS defrag tool that came with my computer and saw that I only had 15% space free, so I tried
 to defrag.&nbsp; The defrag also crashed each time, usually at 3%.<br />
<br />
26th January:<br />
CRASHED ON THESE FILES:<br />
-defrag crashed on A0044502.rbf<br />
-(I noticed the name was similar to the one the virus check crashed on before)<br />
-defrag then crashed on another of a different file type but I didn't note it down (tmp.edb?)<br />
-defrag crashed on C:/system volume information/_RESTO~1/RP320/A0045026.rbf (I think virus check then crashed on this one too)<br />
-virus scan crashed on A0045030.rbf<br />
<br />
I did run cmd chkdsk_/f as told to by a friend.&nbsp; Did it 3 times and screen went too quickly to see what writing said before it booted up.<br />
<br />
-defragged again, it crashed on A0045107.rbf<br />
<br />
SPRING CLEANING TO FREE UP SPACE:<br />
I then had to finish some work urgently, so did not come back to trying to fix this problem for weeks.&nbsp; I just didn't let the antivirus scan and didn't try to defrag, so had no crashes.&nbsp; When I had time spare, I went through removing unnecessary programs, deleting
 unnecessary old work files and reducing large graphics work to smaller sizes.&nbsp; By the time I had finished my urgent work and could return to the problem, I had 43% space free.<br />
<br />
Wed 8th April:<br />
RETURNING TO ATTEMPTS TO RESOLVE PROBLEM:<br />
-I uninstalled Norton 2006 and then installed Microsoft Security Essentials to see if this would pick up any viruses.&nbsp; Quickscan revealed none.&nbsp; Full scan crashed each time unfortunately.<br />
9th April:<br />
-CHKDSK C: /f either crashed or was working incredibly slow (1/2 hour on same file) both times I tried to do it.&nbsp; Both times it crashed on 66% of verifying file data (4 of 5)<br />
-SFC typed in run: the black box flashes up but then disappears so fast you can hardly see it.&nbsp; Nothing else happens.&nbsp; I tried a few times.<br />
-I rebooted the computer into 'safemode with command prompt' and tried SFC /SCANNOW, and got the following error:<br />
"Windows File Protection could not initiate a scan of protected system files<br />
The specific error code is 0x000006ba [The RPC server is unavailable]."<br />
-I rebooted in 'safe mode' and typed SFC in run.&nbsp; Same thing happened as happened before in regular windows.<br />
-I rebooted in 'safe mode' and tried a full MSE virus scan.&nbsp; After an hour of working, it crashed on this file: C:/System Volume Information/_restore{5C5FC002-5FB5-4560-96DA-E32D8569FB2E}/RP320/A0045038.rbf.&nbsp; This happened just after I clicked on a tiny notepad
 document with my notes in, although I'm not sure if that's what actually did it or if it was already stuck.&nbsp; I managed to pause and unpause it just before it crashed.&nbsp; The full virus check was almost finished, guessing 80% done in the green bar.<br />
-I tried to defrag in 'safe mode', which soon crashed on C:...A0070595.MSI<br />
All these April crashes just involved the screen appearing to freeze because the virus check or defrag was not moving on from the file it said it was on... then when I'd try to stop it, the screen would freeze completely so I would have to manually shut down.<br />
<br />
Please help me resolve this problem!&nbsp; Should I be backing up my work?&nbsp; If I back it up and there's a virus, then my external hard drive backup could become infected.&nbsp; But if I don't back up, I could lose a lot of work.<br />
<br />
Thank you so much.

<p>Adobe Speedlauncher is a&nbsp;legitimate&nbsp;program, whereas orangefirefox.exe shows up as being a worm infection on a google search.</p>
<p>It is a bit unusual that Kaspersky would freeze even in Safe Mode.... maybe running a chkdsk might help to get past the files that AV programs and defrag crash on:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265</a></p>
<p>You could turn off System Restore:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405</a>&nbsp;and this should get rid of any restore points and then hopefully no more crashing when scanning, but make sure you turn it back
 on again!</p>
<p>However sometimes I come across systems that have had so many infections that in the end from all the damage that has been caused it is best just to do a reinstall.</p>

</p><p>So, if your address bar history does not clear now with Win 10 even though you have IE set to "clear on exit" and it looks something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61abcd45-71ab-42e9-9658-5c53f834c9fb" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click on/touch the File Explorer icon or "PC" and you should get something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c1c8c83-80f1-4c52-9cf3-252ebeb84fc5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on the bar&nbsp; as indicated in red above (make sure the letters PC are not in blue or the boundary of the bar is not in blue otherwise you will get another menu!)</p>
<p>You should end up with this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9949976d-1f7b-4eed-af86-555c65fc45ee" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select option 4, go back to desktop address bar and the result should be this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6a4525b3-99c6-41f0-837d-9a74dfa0c980" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards and best wishes.</p>

<p>Hi Barrel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. This could happen if there was a temporary disconnection to the internet, there also could be an issue with the OS. We recommend trying a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset</a>. Make sure to select reset and keep games and apps. Before doing this make sure you know the credentials to the accounts on the console. As they will be removed from the console. You will not lose any save data, if you have been connected
 to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

    <title>Cannot run any exe file after setting registry default - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot run any exe file after setting registry default value&#61;exefile</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having problems running some specific exe files so I found on this site the suggestion to check if the default value for the.exe files was set to "exefile".&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed it was not so I input exefile. The other default values were ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT NOW I CAN'T RUN ANY EXE FILE! not even regedit, cmd prompt or powershell. Not even from the win+X menu. This means I can't go check what is
</p>
<p>inside the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i can still run apps by opening files: for example i can open VLC by opening an mp3 and choosing open with from the context menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I additionally reset the application association to the default hoping it would help but instead all it did was rendering all my app icons as white sheets. So now I can't even tell one exe from the other!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. Any suggestion on&nbsp; how to solve this without resetting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp; a lot</p>
<p><br />

<p>Things are getting a little awkward. You now need to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask a friend to create a bootable Windows Repair flash disk on his Windows 10 PC, using the command RecoveryDrive.exe. Do NOT copy the system files.</li><li>Plug this disk into your PC.</li><li>Turn on your PC, then turn it off as soon as the spinning circle appears.</li><li>Repeat Step 3 three times.</li><li>Select "System Restore" from one of the menus that will appear. You do not need a password.</li></ol>

            Hi CarlPeterson5 
<br />I am Wilfredo an Independent advisor And I'm here to help you!!&nbsp;
<br />How you doing today?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />Thy this options
<br />
<br />Opcion 1
<br />
<br />Windows Key + A Key or click on Notifications icon 
<br />When you open the Notifications bar
<br />Click on the button saying Airplane Mode to turn it on or off.
<br />
<br />
<br />Opcion 2
<br />
<br />Open Start Menu
<br />Click on Settings
<br />Click on Network and Internet to open related settings
<br />In the left pane, you can see Airplane Mode 
<br />Click on Airplane Mode in left pane and then move the switch, in right pane, to right so that it shows OFF under Airplane Mode; the pane also displays all the available wireless networks, including Bluetooth and WiFi, that are now turned off automatically and greyed out
<br />
<br />Opcion 3
<br />
<br />Airplane Mode switch is stuck, grayed out or not working
<br />If Windows 10 is stuck in Airplane Mode, here are few things you may want to try if you face issues. Before you begin, make sure that if your device has a physical Wi-Fi On/Off button or switch, it is set to the On position.
<br />
<br />1] Try pressing the Fn+Radio Tower key. it’s between the F12 and the PrtScr key.
<br />
<br />2] Maybe something is interfering with its functioning. Restart Windows 10. Do not log in. At the login screen, you will see a Wi-Fi icon in the lower right side of your screen. Click on it and see if you can turn on/off Airplane Mode.
<br />
<br />3] Unplug everything, including the cables, power cord, USB, etc. Remove the Battery. Power down the device. Wait for a minute. Put the battery back, power it on and see it has helped.
<br />
<br />4] Open Device Manager. Under Network adapters, see if any WAN Mininiport has a yellow mark against it. If so uninstall and reinstall it again.
<br />
<br />5] Type regedit in Taskbar search. Right click on the result and select Run as administrator. Navigate to the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class
<br />
<br />Right click on Class and press Find. Search for RadioEnable. Make sure its value is 1. If not, change its value to 1. If RadioEnable does not exist it, create it.
<br />

<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+I &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Airplane Mode &gt; See whether it allows you to toggle it Off.
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work, Device Manager &gt; Locate Network Adapter &gt; Right Click &gt; Disable

<h2>            After installing Windows 8 the mute button on the keyboard no longer works</h2>
                    windows 8 64-bit. After installing this, the mute doesn't work via the keyboard. It flips on the icon to the screen, but flickers a couple times. Almost like it is sending multiple events and canceling itself out. Also, the option to hide volume changes
 from the screen does not work. It always shows.

<h2>            Network and sharing centre shows unknown - the dependancy service or group failed to start.my connection is a Lan.Iam getting internet on desktop but my windows app says iam not connected to internet.</h2>
                    <p>Hello </p>
<p>I am using windows 8.1.</p>
2 days ago all things worked fine. But the next day my internet connection(LAN) gone. Actually my McAfee internet security subscription ended the same day. I&nbsp;was not knowing anything about it. so I troubleshoot the network I got see some DCHP there. I enabled
 it. then it created much more problem like getting so many networks when I restart my pc. so I disabled it. then I lost my LAN settings and in my network and sharing centre it is showing that the network is unknown and the dependency service or group failed
 to start. Then I re configured my LAN settings. Then I got internet in my desktop browsers but my windows apps keep saying pc is not connected to internet including internet explorer app. Also there is a yellow mark on my network symbol, though I am getting
 internet on my desktop. So I decided it is firewall problem because since two days my pc has two firewalls(McAfee and windows firewall)&nbsp;&nbsp;off. so i decided to turn on windows firewall as my McAfee subscription ended but when I try to on windows firewall it
 is not enabling and I could see a message that these settings are being managed by vendor application McAfee personal firewall.so in action centre when I turn on windows firewall some time both are off and some times&nbsp;McAfee is turning on saying your pc is
 not fully protected. but the problems remain same. my pc could not recognise network, I get internet on desktop and apps says nooo, please help me

            <p>Hi Kranthisena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have mentioned that you see a yellow mark on the Network symbol but you are able to connect to Internet, you could face this issue due the McAfee Firewall. Please write to us with the following details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) what is the make and model of your computer? </p>
<p>2) What is the exact error message you get&nbsp;related to Internet connection when&nbsp;you use the&nbsp;Apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can install two security&nbsp;applications on your computer but only&nbsp;one&nbsp;firewall will work&nbsp;at a time. I suggest you to uninstall McAfee from your computer and then check if you still face this issue. You can follow the steps given in the link below to remove

    <title>Print Spooler Pipeline Service locks printing repeatedly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ye old great one  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print Spooler Pipeline Service locks printing repeatedly</h2>
                    <p>I am working on a Windows 10 system at work (against my will) and I am having constant problems with Print Spooler Pipeline Service creating corrupt temp files and then locking up printing until I kill the spooler service, manually delete the files out of
 the print cue, and restart the spooler service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is extremely annoying, and of course the spooler locks up without creating an error message, so then I have to try to remember what documents I was trying to send to be printed on a different floor of the building and resend them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got sick of it, took ownership of the printspoolerpipelinesvc.exe file and moved it to a "disabled_problem_children" folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has to be a better way of solving this problem than using the frontal lobotomy method, although with Windows 10 that seems to be the only way that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not, never have, and never will use xps format for anything.</p>

            It seems that after removing this program printing is much, much faster as well. &nbsp;Where it used to take 30 seconds for a job to spool now it goes through within a second.

<p>It worked fine for an hour, then died (quietly, with no errors).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most annoying thing is that I am using network printers, I can't determine what purpose this file has other than to create corrupt temp files and then lock up on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been a persistent problem for months where every couple of days the print cue locks up (without an error) and simply quits working. &nbsp;The machine was a out of the box fresh install of windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running on a private network, all printers are assigned static IP addresses.</p>

<p>I am the in office "I make things work person." &nbsp;I do a little bit of everything. &nbsp;Fixing the network one day, delivering the next, troubleshooting Exchange auto-detect issues with a website hosted on a linux server the next. &nbsp;Then simply writing insanely
 long excel spreadsheets to calculate out discounts the next day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally feel that 10 is a travesty. &nbsp;This is supposed to be a work computer and they made it difficult to get rid of many things that should never be allowed within a secure network environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run 7 at home, its stable, castrated, and does exactly what I want it to do with a minimal number of bug-a-boos. &nbsp;My general rule when I build a system for myself is to remove almost all of the pre-installed mush before it even gets to first boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This one has been a nightmare, I can't even determine what the Print Spooler Pipeline Service is trying to accomplish. &nbsp;It seems that the only thing that it is good for is creating corrupt temp files in the spooler folder and then quietly dying in the background.
 &nbsp;No error message, and suddenly I have to kill the spooler, kill the spooler pipeline service, manually clear the spooler folder, and spend twenty minutes figuring out what had printed before it dies and run it through again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wasting more than the cost of the new computer a year in wasted time because of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have disable XPS support on the machine, and as far as I can tell that is the only aspect of printing that this file should be handling. &nbsp;Do I have to do something severe like write protecting folders to keep windows update from reverting changes?</p>

<p>The problem persists, interestingly this week my computer is fine and my office mate's computer is the one screwing up and locking the print cue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kill PrintSpoolerPipelineService</p>
<p>Manually delete all files out of System32/Spooler/whatever printer it locked up</p>
<p>restart printspooler service (From services)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am tech savvy, I have no problem fixing this on the computer, but eventually I am going to take a day off, and be out of cell phone range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of yet I have not actually determined what purpose the PrintSpoolerPipelineService actually serves. &nbsp;I have seen some notes of it being involved in the printing of XPS documents. &nbsp;I have XPS support disabled on my computer, it still pops up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Printer drivers reinstalled.</p>
<p>XPS Support removed</p>
<p>Checked registry for strange dependencies</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intermittent problem that occurs quietly and does not produce an error, because an error console would just be too much to ask.</p>

            Thank you for the information.<br />
<br />
Based on the information you provided, it's possible that the issue is caused by an outdated driver. You may install the latest driver directly from your printer manufacturer's website or ask assistance from their support team in installing the right driver
 for your device.<br />
<br />
Should you have further questions, let us know.

<p>It would seem to be an unusual problem for Windows to install an outdated driver by default, but as it turns out Windows installs an outdated driver by default, and if you tell it to look for a newer driver, it cannot find anything. &nbsp;This of course means
 you have to download the "improved" driver from HP that has all of the spyware, monitoring software, feedback mods, and other assorted useless **** that you need to immediately remove if you work in a secure network environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grrrr, sloppy programming and implementation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, download the new driver, un-check everything on install (you have to click through to find the check marks to un-check). &nbsp;Remove everything that it dumps on your desktop, remove everything it drops into services, kill all added tasks. &nbsp;Hope for the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still waiting to see if this works as a solution.</p>

<h2>            Missing Sounds And Audio Devices Icon on Control Panel</h2>
                    I recently went to change the systems sounds to ones I made, but the icon on the control panel (Sounds and Audio Devices) was missing. I have no way of getting to what I need now.

<h2>            VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR blue screen after automatic Windows Update &#40;Nvidia GT650M&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop with an Nvidia GeForce GT 650M video card and Windows 10 x64 running for months now, but after an automatic windows Update which happened on 15/11/2018, my computer now generates a blue screen and error message "VIDEO_SCHEDULER_INTERNAL_ERROR",
 and reboots.</p>
<p>As far as I have seen it installed a package called "NVIDIA Pilote 3D Vision 388.73" and "NVIDIA Pilote graphique 388.73" packages with this update</p>
<p>
</p><p>... issue is that the computer just reboots sometimes after 1 minute, sometimes after 2 minutes and doesn'lt let you time to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if it is possible to prevent windows to automatically install this package / driver through Windows Update ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have even re-installed Windows from a USB key and all is fine but as from the moment Windows Update reinstalls this package the blue screen is there again !</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I'd suggest updating your graphics drivers. This will probably fix the error:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/139907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/139907</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help, here are the steps to uninstall an update:
<br />
<br />-Click Start and type Update.
<br />-Click "View installed update history".
<br />-Click "Uninstall updates"
<br />
<br />You can select the update to uninstall here.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support after following these steps! Thanks!

<p>If I have seen correctly after I have reinstalled Windows yesterday I am not at 1809 yet.</p>
<p>For the de-installation, I think this is not possible to uninstall Drivers correct ? All what appears in the list of updates I can uninstall are the standard Windows updates, not the driver packages ?</p>
<p>Also I do not have time to do this in a normal Windows session, as the blue screen is appearing afetr 1 or 2 minutes so not letting me time to do to the control pannel to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and in "Error loss" (Mode sans echecs) mode, I do not think I can uninstall drivers ?</p>

            Hi,
<br />If Vijay's method of hiding the driver update isn't helping, Use Safe mode to rollback the driver and stop the updates in Safe mode.

<p>Thanks a lot&nbsp; ... I did a re-installation of my computer again, as safe mode doesn't allow me to access the list of recently installed updates (the windows disappears directly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will close this post now, as I have put my computer in the trash and I am looking at the possibility now to go to Apple MacBook.</p>
<p>I am really tired with those windows updates issues and when you look at forums you only find that.</p>

<h2>            Not receiving Skype contact requests</h2>
                    <p>I'm not sure since when, but I just stoped receiving contact requests.</p>
<p>I'm using Skype for Windows 7.41, for Android 8.20.76.3... and all with same behaviour, 4 different devices, same outcome.</p>
<p>How is it possible? Of course I checked the username and asked multiple users to try...</p>

<h2>            When is it too old to play games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all, im a mature gamer with late teen children. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 3 or 4 of my old friends have decided to stop gaming and sold there consoles, but I still play and would like to know what other peoples views are on gaming and age. &nbsp;Ive been playing games for the last 30 years and I dont see myself as too old to
 game and I miss the fun that we used to have. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Has anyone gone through this too?</p>

<p>I'm in my 40s and have been gaming since the atari. </p>
<p>Can't keep up with the kids online. My kill death ratio &nbsp;is like comparing my shoe size to my age.
</p>
<p>But as long as I'm enjoying it I'll play. </p>
<p>For some strange reason though even though my TV is on the wall I'm sure it's getting closer.

<p>I feel like a young one here at a modest 33 but I've been gaming since I was about 6. &nbsp;There is never 'too old' for a hobby you enjoy and anyone who says otherwise is not worth the time of day.</p>
<p>I don't see my self stopping (bar breaks for example I just had about a year of due to work stuff and didn't have much time) however I still kept on the ball with gaming news ect because it's my passion in life. And I chose a perfect time to get back into
 it with Black Friday X1 deals:D However I feel you on the people who leave gaming with age. I only know a few old mates who still game but even they have slowed down alot buying maybe a couple of games a year at most..where as I tend to buy everything lol</p>
<p>The only difference between me at 18 and now is I don't care so much for online games and I prefer more singleplayer then I once did.</p>
