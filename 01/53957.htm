<p><span>Hi andy1954,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<div>
<div>
Urlmon.dll is used by Windows for&nbsp;object linking and embedding, and it is used primarily by web browsers. Seems like the file is either corrupted or deleted.<span><br />
</span></div>
</span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Run System File Checker (SFC) scan. See if it finds any corrupted system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: SFC Scan</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>This command will immediately initiate the Windows File Protection service to scan all protected files and verify their integrity, replacing any
 files with which it finds a problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this for details.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In case SFC scan doesn’t repair the files, follow the steps given in the link above on how to repair those corrupted files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Repair Internet Explorer</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above method fails to work, try to repair Internet Explorer by following the steps from the article below.</span></p>

    <title>Dead Rising 2 Coop Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> altair2223  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead Rising 2 Coop Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing coop in DR2 with a friend some days ago, while we were playing he lost connection to xbox live, he rarely does, after that, when he sends me invites to play just after i accept the invite a message shows up&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;"An error occurred while connecting
 to the other player. Returning to the Main Menu." we have been trying to play since then, reciebing the same message, when i try to be the host, the problem is, that i can´t invite him, the option is not available and he cant join manually, it doesnt matter
 if we disconnect and reconect to xbox o8ve, the message keeps showing and i am still unable to invite him, this only happens with DR2,we an play other games online such as fifa or halo, none of us have any DLC.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

<p>Altair, hopefully you both have the latest updates as I know that DR2 had at least 1 if not more, so assuming that you do give this a try - hit the home button (center of the xbox controller) and go to the friends menu. Find your friend and hit "Join Session
 In Progress" while he is playing, of course one of you has to answer the call and just to be safe set both of your preferences in game to "friends only". &nbsp;To do this go to Options&gt;Gameplay&gt;Co-op Privacy, and you can choose the mode of Co-op you want.</p>
<p>Public: You are open to anyone online joining your game. (You will have the option of accepting the request or not via in-game Transceiver message).</p>
<p>Private: No one may join your game session.</p>
<p>Friends Only: Only someone on your friends list will be able to join your session.</p>
<p>If all else fails, start a party and invite party to game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

<p>Well we have the update, the thing is that, even changing those privacy settings, when i try to join his session the message pops up instantly, and i dont know why but i dont have the option to invite him and he cant choose the "Join Session In Progress"
 option. if i invite him to the party, the invite party to the game option is not available</p>

<p>Altair, can you confirm what you and your friends NAT settings are with this game? &nbsp;If they are Strict or moderate that may be the issue, but we won't know till you confirm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at this article from Microsoft support and it will explain what you need to do to check and fix this issue -

<h2>            Windows 8.1 My Mouse Double Click When i one Click, somtimes</h2>
                    <p>sometimes when i one click it double licks, i tried switching mouse to other mouse that was working, but older same things so its not Mouse issue, it has to be OS Bug/Error, it shows when i when i mark txt holding mouse down &amp; in a game Mages Staff Attack,
 light attack 1 fireball mad attack 2 balls, med means holding mouse down a bit, after 3th or 4th med attacks it does automatic light attack, that issue started resonantly, so my question is WTH is going on &amp; Why &amp; what should i do?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>for a bit of time it acted weird with my Firefox to, double click when i just wanted to mark bookmark with 1 click, same with left &amp; right mouse, i feel like OS is lost its mind considering other weird thing in my OS to :D</p>
<p>
</p><p>also there is that that when i move mouse on to Geforce Experience icon on toolrbar it shows last update 24.02.2016 9:52, but i did manual check 9:30 + sometimes my Antivirus Automatic Scan Delays 1hour or more, isn't that + what i mentioned before sing
 of OS instability? </p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that mouse is not working properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be due to hardware conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the Hardware Devices troubleshooter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;An automated troubleshooter is a tool that can find and automatically fix some problems with your computer. These troubleshooters aren't designed to fix every problem, but they're a useful tool to
 try because they can often save your time and effort.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “Troubleshooting” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the “Troubleshooting” window, click on “View All” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on
<strong>“Hardware and Devices"</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “<strong><em>Next</em></strong>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>

<p>Alienware X51 R2</p>
<p>Alienware usp Keyboard &amp; Mouse, when switching usp holes it showed its DELL mouse, but pic on mouse is alienware</p>
<p>Keyboard &amp; Mouse drivers, windows default, i think</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>hardware and devices scan did nor find anything wrong with my mouse, mouse options seemed to be normal to, but considering that Troubleshooter found problems with Win update &amp; was unable to fix what it found, i think even troubleshooter is not functioning
 properly cause i haven't noticed anything wrong with win update, only the false error reports about update failed awry day, but there are no updates awry day &amp; once per month i get important win update &amp; week or weeks later optional updates, so win update
 has to be okay</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tested with other old mouse same issue, but i changed mouse settings, i changed that right click does what left click did, switched right &amp; left, then there was no double click sometimes, that hints that issue is with mouse usually, but there was same
 issue with other mouse, &amp; when i used it last it did not have that issue, so it has to be something is OS? well the issue appears when i have to make click hold &amp; click hold 2 or 3 times &amp; after that comes small 1 automatic click, in windows its a double click,
 today is second day with that issue, there was no updates within this 2 days</p>
<p>
</p><p>my mouse is usp mouse, can it be usp issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>i reduced double click speed, maybe that helps a bit <br />
&amp; it didn't help<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>i switched in to different usp, but why did it install the drives again if they are in my PC already? or is it just saying its installing &amp; its really identifying the hardware? i did it to see if that changes anything</p>
<p>
</p><p>weird thing is when i switch left &amp; right click then no double click </p>
<p>
</p><p>ok new i reduced double click speed to zero to test how that works</p>
<p>didn't help much, reducing sensitivity </p>
<p>
</p><p>BDW that sometimes is pretty often</p>
<p>
</p><p>also in paint when i make the box smaller or larger i have to hold mouse button down &amp; sometimes it releases it, like when i take my finger away from mouse button &amp; when i make smaller it means i will leave a mark if i had pencil mode on, u know where u
 paint or how to say it, maybe i try new mouse soon, if i can't find solution</p>

Couldn't display "xxxx.PIC" because a suitable graphics importer could not be found</strong> when I click on a PIC in My Pictures? I must need to do something, as I am sure that it used to work. A few months ago I reinstalled Windows XP and started fresh on

<p>==================================<br />
Maybe I don't understand the question...but if .PIC is <br />
the actual extension...that's the problem...rename&nbsp;it <br />
to xxxx.JPG and see if you can open it.</p>
<p>Also you could try the following command to force a <br />
reinstall of Windows Picture and Fax Viewer:</p>
<p>Go to...Start / Run and type<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (or copy/paste):<br />
<br />
regsvr32 /i shimgvw.dll<br />
(yes, the space after the 2 and the space<br />
after the i is required)<br />
<br />
Press...Enter...<br />
<br />
You should see a dialog box that says:<br />
DllRegisterServer and DllInstall in shimgvw.dll succeeded</p>

<h2>            Never ending loop - Windows Update fails and reinstall failing too...</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Like many others update has been failing for several months now. I have tried to troubleshoot them using various articles but to no avail. I have then tried to reinstall Windows 10 and this also fails! I continue to get back to the blue screen asking to
 select a keyboard or it hangs while trying to uninstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to reinstall from Settings and then Recovery. I have tried to reinstall by hitting the reset this PC button and also even managed to download the iso to USB and tried to reinstall from usb - this also fails getting back to the keyboard install
 screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now getting warnings that soon the version I have installed&nbsp; (Windows 10 version 1607) will not be supported for new patches etc - This is worrying me a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas/tips how I can resolve this serious issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is my latest setuperr log - some strange and hard to troubleshoot messages that happened as update was kicking off (I think)</p>

            Hi Kevin.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by downloading and  installing Media Creation Tool from this link and then choose to Upgrade This PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If Version 1709 causes problems go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If problems persist you can also roll it back within 10 days at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery and block it using the Hide Updates tool or another method here to wait to see if it matures:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now, with problematic Updates being withdrawn and rewritten while a half billion PC's are being rescanned constantly to sort them all out.  So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:   <a href="http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=Windows%2010" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search....</a>
<br />
<br />If Updates cause problems you can find out which one by checking at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and uninstall them there.  
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat that has lately caused some disruption, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />As a last resort, you can set a Metered Connection or disable Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br />
<br />Finally,  remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Enforcement action for &#34;inappropriate content on my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shot illuzionz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enforcement action for &#34;inappropriate content on my account&#34;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just received a message from Xbox Live that enforcement action is being taken because there was "inappropriate content" on my account (bio, account pic, etc.), however I can absolutely 100% garuntee there was not. Is this just something you can abuse to get people banned, and is there a way I can appeal this? While this only affects my account for one day I still find it inconvenient that I cannot edit my account picture or name because of a fake report. Also I'm kind of confused as to why anyone would even ban me for this in the first place if there's clearly nothing wrong...</p>

<h2>            Heavy lag and weird bip sounds.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will make this quick and fast as i am tired, and go more into details tomorrow if you need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since a few weeks ago, my MSI GT72 2QE dominator pro is freezing for 5 secs, and then i just cant click anything at all, and when i move my courser it says "bip bip bip bip bip" for every 0.25 sec i think. Also when i try to click something (i just cant)
 then it also just says "bip". The course is lagging heavily, and it is like a program is trying to start itself a billion times, and then windows&nbsp;prevents me from doing anything, and just fires off warning "bip" sounds. Just 5 min ago it happened, and now
 i am both worried and tired of it, as i bought this pc a month ago. Every driver should be up to date. I have really no idea what is going on. But what i saw these 5 min ago, is that some service/program called "<span>Managing of&nbsp;desktop window" (I think it
 is on English), starts using a lot of CPU (about 17% on i7 4720HQ with Hyperthreading on). Of course if I turn that off, my desktop is not working, and then I have to restart the laptop by holding down the button 8 secs....</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It would be REALLY nice with some answers to what is going on, if you need something, ask, and ill give you it tomorrow. I am not a complete newbie to pc's so I should know what you are talking about :D</span></p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the window 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you are facing performance issues after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding as an initial recommendation, please check for the amount of hard disk space remaining, as the available free space is also responsible for Windows to run at optimal level of performance. Also, e<span><span>nsure to install any pending
 updates and also update all device drivers from Device Manager.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please follow the below methods and check for the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the slow down.</li></ul>
<span><span>1.&nbsp; </span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp; </span>To disable any 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Try Autorun and disable any start-up programs you don't need.</li></ul>
<p><span><span><strong>Download Autorun: </strong></span></span><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the <strong>System Maintenance</strong> troubleshooter. and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type&nbsp;troubleshooting in the search bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select&nbsp;View all&nbsp;on the top left corner.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further assistance, please do let us know and we would be happy to help you further.</span></p>

                    Since upgrading to Windows 10, I have found a few bugs in the GUI of the system. The Start Screen/Menu does not appear to function at all, on my system (Pavilion 141ea), the start screen does not function at all, all methods of opening the menu do not
 work, and any attempts to restart the task do not work, rebooting the machine doesn't neither. Along with this, the task bar doesn't function, right click functions do not work, notification centre doesn't work, the only things that do work are the short cuts.
 I am extremely disappointed with this issue, as it was present in the preview builds, and was mentioned in some of the feedback from other users. I'm starting this discussion for any other users experiencing this issue, and hopefully we can find a temporary
 fix while Microsoft take my feedback into consideration and fix this issue. However, on a positive note, when it was working when I first installed Windows 10, I did like the option to change between the screen and menu styles, bu

            <p>I have an Asus fliptop with a touch screen and wanted it specifically because I wanted to try the tile interface. I had it for a few weeks and about a week ago it quit working and I cannot get it to reappear. I tried several things, had my husband try the
 complicated steps from a Microsoft answer and nothing works. Apparently, this has been a bug for quite a while as you can find people with this problem way back to January of 2015.
</p>
<p>My best guess is it occurred when I decided to activate Cortana - from that point on I was no longer able to see the start screen aka tile interface. Which pretty much means if I ever get it back I will NEVER use Cortana.
</p>
<p>Up until this happened I was pretty impressed with Microsoft 10, now I find it EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING.

            That is interesting.&nbsp; I have This problem and I Had not used Cortana until I reinstalled windows 10.&nbsp; That does not necessarily mean this is the problem but I will try resetting My PC and when I Boot up for the first time I will opt out of using Cortana.&nbsp;
 If it works I will get back to You.

<h2>            Frustrated with xbox updates</h2>
                    <p> This is just a rant,</p><p>Anyone else is frustrated with XBox One updates and game updates? My system spends more time updating and today with limited band width this can take forever. Then to add insult to injury after updating 4+GB updates for Xbox One, then when you try to play a game it needs a 30+ GB update, and that is not the only one!!! If this is the new trend for gaming Microsoft may start loosing customers.</p><p>Thank you I&nbsp;will get off my soapbox now</p>

            <p>its the 21st century and technology is so unreliable we need numerous regular updates from everything. especuall windows 10 and sometimes those updates stuff up your settings and programs you run on your computerm after one update hauppauge capture kept crashing but hauppauge rolled out an update which fixed microsofts mess. after another update it had changed my sound settings and privacy settings to allow it to record my typing patterns. it was for sure set to off but after the update it set itself to on. its even annouing when you have to restart you pc after the update more time wasted. especially when your average 1tb hdd laptop takes 3 minutes to boot and have loaded everything. luckily my high end desktop takes only 5 seconds to boot. it feels like were being spammed with updates and in certain countries spam and unsolicited mail is illegal.&nbsp;</p>

EXCUSE ME (WAVES ARMS IN THE AIR) EXCUSE ME, I WANT AN UPDATE, I WANT TO UPDATE, I'LL JUST TELL THE SERVERS TO DOWNLOAD AT 1kb/s as Microsoft sits back and has a lol at us.

It's downright annoying having updates. Microsoft should release updates during business hours their time, not at 12 - 2 a.m. in the morning their time when it's around 9 p.m. NZ and 7 p.m. Aust

<h2>            How to merge an Admin and a standard account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title:- admin logon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to upgrading to win 10 I had an administrator account on this system.&nbsp; I was advised by the system to create a standard account which I did.&nbsp; Now when I log onto the system with either account I cannot access some directories which the administrator
 could access.&nbsp; How can I merge these two accounts back to be just an administrator account so I can once again access every thing.&nbsp; The show all files is enabled and I also do not know that if I delete the standard account that I could loose all the updates
 and info that has changed since the upgrade and creating the standard account. Help!!!!!</p>

            <p>Your lifetime credits earned is the total amount of credits you have earned since joining the program. It includes credits that are still pending as well as any that have already been deposited. If you check the MyRewards section of the site for your statement it will list the amount of credits you have pending. If the amount of pending credits is smaller than your lifetime credits, then you've already had deposits. Your statement will list when any deposits took place and you can check for those deposits by looking at your returns at http://commerce.microsoft.com</p>

<em>retrieved</em> from...help please?

            This issue has come up at multiple sites in addition to microsoft.com and none of the proposed solutions have worked for me. In my case the file statistic.ark, as well as all other files in the Solitaire related directories, relate to the problem. I can
 deleted all of them including uninstalling and reinstalling solitaire and my old statistics continue to come back. I am suspecting that an encripted registry entry or a file with a name unrelated to solitaire in name has something to do with it but without
 guidance from someone who knows at Microsoft can provide a useful answer here. However, we all know that that will not be happening.

<p>This worked for me many times until an update changed so that your scores would be downloaded back into the game.</p>
<p>So you now need to turn off your internet connection then carry out the procedure above. Once done reboot the machine still with internet off and when it has booted back up play one game of whatever patience you play and will cause the app to recreate the
 above statistic.ark file but now it will not get over written by the cloud version. Close the program and re-instate your network connection and carry on playing but you now have reset scores and games played etc. I hope this helps if you were having problems.</p>

</p><p>To test i downloaded the Forza Horizon 3 demo and it downloaded and installed with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done as other people have advised (resetting Store, etc) but nothing works.</p>

            My download won't go past 6.38. I too can also download other apps including the demo, without issue. but my store has been screwed up for the last few days and wouldn't even open. I had to reset my windows for my store to even open without crashing.

            Yeah, thinking its a UK server problem. Currently using a vpn to download from the us server and sitting at 24 GB and still going without issue so far.

 for about a day, I also need it to do my work. My connection is stable, any other download works too. There are over 200gb of free space on my hdd. I tried wsreset and several other potential fixes, with no success. I have spent over 100€ on the game over
 time, so not being able to install it anymore is unacceptable. Please do something about it.</p>

<h2>            Removing Real Player Cloud</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 8.1 and have spent a great deal of time attempting to remove all Real Player files from my computer. I've succeeded for the most part (uninstalling it from Programs was the first step but that did pretty much nothing), at least in disabling
 everything in Task Manager and deleting as many files as possilbe in Program Files but there are still two that refuse to be deleted because the message I get says they are still running in Windows Explorer: 1)&nbsp;rpcloudview.dll, which is located in C:\Program
 Files (x86)\Real\RealPlayer\RPDS\Bin64 and 2)&nbsp;rpcloudview_res_en.dll, which is located in&nbsp;C:\Program Files (x86)\Real\RealPlayer\RPDS\Resources. As far as I can tell, there are no other Real Player Files on my computer, although Real Player Cloud still shows
 up as an icon under "Devices and Drives" and several Real Player files show up in Task Manager under Services but as I mentioned, I have disabled them. Does anyone know how to remove all remaining remnants of
