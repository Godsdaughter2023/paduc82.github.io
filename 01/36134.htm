            Are you sure they are on the SD card? It may have reached its space limit, and that's why you don't see the other pictures.<br />

<h2>            Is there a way to disable automatic split screen&#63;</h2>
                    So I've updated to windows rt 8.1, and now EVERY time I open an app from an already running one (in full screen) it splits&nbsp;into 50/50 screen with both apps running. While this feature is great, I would like to open a PDF file from the internet app (for
 example) and have this cover the entire screen without it automatically splitting into two. That was how it worked for me on the previous windows version, so I am hoping it'll work that way in 8.1 as well,&nbsp;while still&nbsp;let me manually decide to split the screen
 when I want to...

            <p>Hi Camilla,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way you can disable the Split screen (snap view)&nbsp;in Windows 8.1. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to avoid the apps using the 50/50 snap view, do not drag the second app when you have an open app on your desktop screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the snap view is already set on the desktop, please drag the second app&nbsp;to the&nbsp;left &nbsp;corner so that only on app is showed.&nbsp; Close all the open apps and then once again try to open a app which you want and check if occupies the entire desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>That's the thing here we cannot not enable the snap view, it's automatic. If I open a link or a pdf, it automatically assumes that I want it side by side with the app I'm using. IT'S WRONG. I usually want it full screen. Please give me an option to not automatically
 open things in split screen/snap view mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with desktop vs metro, touch vs mouse: Windows 8 focuses on simplicity, snap view should be an option because full screen is the best experience, that's all.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm considering switching back to 8 just for this.</p>

            Me too.. I am considering going back to windows 8. The split screen is great, but should be a choice not automatic.. Please suggest they fix it, so it does not automatically do it. Or a way to turn it off would be great....

<p>your reference link is from the times of windows 8.0, things have changed in 8.1 and that is exactly why people are talking about it. you clearly don't know about the system and haven't read this topic with enough attention to understand the problem.</p>

<p>Once again, can someone at Microsoft give us a solution to this problem?&nbsp; Automatically splitting the screen on small touchscreens is VERY counterproductive.&nbsp; We have been waiting for a proper solution for 8 1/2 months!</p>

            <p>I went back to Windows 8 and I can't believe how much better it is to not have the 50/50 split screen by default. I haven't&nbsp;upgraded to 8.1 yet, it's been months. I miss some bug fixes and features like the Facebook app or smoother scrolling or even IE11
 but having everything full screen is too much of a bliss for me to upgrade to 8.1. Clicking the middle of my screen to push an app away every single time, no thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I absolutely don't understand the reason to force people to split screens, it goes against everything the Metro design language is made for IMO. Again, we're not against the split screen feature, we just want to turn it off because some of us don't use it.
 Choice, can we have that please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it going to be solved in the next update? Are you guys listening?</p>

<p>Not true. I would never activate it, if I had my choice. I only use desktop, but at least once a day the stupid thing splits with a mere mouse touch. VERY, VERY annoying.<br />

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you will have to check the Store on the Xbox 360 to see if there is an tvmucho app or not. Apps that are available can be different per region. I myself can't find any information regarding such app.</p>
<p>So the easiest way is to check the app store section on the 360 console itself.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. The arrange by is set to Folder. It seems Windows installed an update I think and now "my" is no longer in front of Documents, Pictures, Videos, Scans and then created a new file NORMAL (C:) which contains all my photos which are labeled
 with a long string of alphanumeric characters. They are no longer in the subfolders I had created in My Pictures, which means that my photoshop software can no longer find my photos that I had organized by folder and year. I have over 14,000 photos on my computer
 that have to now load everytime I open the Pictures folder.&nbsp; I need help restoring my computer back to yesterday before this change took place.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just checked my windows update history and the last one was 01/13/13 so I guess it wasn't due to an update.&nbsp;What else would create new folders on my hard drive - a virus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only other thing I did was update an iPad to latest software. Does anyone think it could be something to do with Photostream application. It doesn't have anything in this folder though.</p>

            <p>Well, it had to be an update because the same things happened to me - everything in the Adobe folder that was put there by the Adobe downloader disappeared - well it did reappear but no longer in My Pictures - shuffled over to My Documents which is a mess
 - one long dump of folder names and file names - I cannot find things from years ago, and I cannot find my photos now.&nbsp; I had everything in folders and sub folders and knew EXACTLY where everything was.&nbsp; Another update today I guess has made it worse when
 I click on the explorer icon in the bottom tray instead of bringing up a window with my remaining folders in My pictures, it brings up a widow that it covered 3/4 by .....NOTHING except a cartoon drawing of a computer monitor.&nbsp; I cannot see any of my folders
 - I cannot function! I needed to find a photo to attach to an on line discussion - but I was unable to do so, The same thing has happened to My Documents - I can NO LONGER SCROLL DOWN THE LIST BECAUSE THE LIST IS HIDDEN BY THE SAME STUPID WINDOW&nbsp; except that
 instead of a computer monitor it is cartoon of a document.&nbsp; This is INSANE! What kind of users do you think we are?</p>

                    I recently received an "Upgrade key" for Windows 8, and was hoping to apply it this weekend. I have a product key for XP Media Center Version 2005, but my original disc is
<a href="http://www.imgur.com/N8yLzdl.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">pretty beat up</a>. My hope was to reformat my PC, reinstall XP MCE, and then upgrade to Windows 8 so I can start fresh. I've looked high and low and cannot find a (legal) way to obtain a replacement for the installation
 media. I would even be willing to pay a reasonable amount for a digital download of the .iso, assuming I would be able to get it from a reputable source.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know where I might be able to obtain a copy of this software?</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

<p>Do you know if your system has a recovery partition installed and if it is still intact? What is the make and model number of your computer? If it does, you could recover it to factory setting the go from there.</p>

            <p>There are no longer any reputable sources carrying Windows XP given the amount of time it's been off the market.&nbsp; Your PC manufacturer might still have copies of the restore/recovery disc set but other than that you are likely out of luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been having some problems trying to connect to a VPN</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get this message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Error 720 a connection to the remote computer could not be established. You might need to change the network settings for this connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been following this guide:&nbsp;http://www.oyam.ca/blog/2011/11/windows-miniports/</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I come stuck at the part where it says - from the "network adapter" list choose MAC bridge miniport.</p>
<p>I cannot see this as an option for the process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Secondly, I have t read on in the guide to the second portion about reinstalling the miniports.</p>
<p>My problem is that I am following this guide:&nbsp;http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/182.how-to-obtain-the-current-version-of-device-console-utility-devcon-exe.aspx</p>
<p>

                    <p>Auto repair could not repair it as well. This started to happen perhaps 2-3days ago. I shut my computer down and when I tried turning it on it goes to a blue screen and then auto repairs tries to fix it twice. After a while it will say it can't fix it and
 gives me the option to restart or go to advance settings. I clicked on advance settings to continue to windows 10 still. I then updated windows 10 next 2 days I encounter this blue screen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only noticed this started to happen after installing Autodesk Maya could that be a reason?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Natural Wireless Mouse 7000 and Receiver v1.0 Model&#58; 1053</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000, Model: 1117 and I have lost my receiver for it. I managed to find a Microsoft Wireless Mouse Receiver v1.0, Model:1053 from a Wireless Optical Mouse 2000, I am trying to connect my mouse (the Natural
 Wireless Mouse 7000) to the receiver specified above and the receiver doesn't even find the mouse, when the driver for the receiver is installed, after installing IntelliPoint it appears to have connected the Wireless Optical Mouse 2000 and it says it has
 good signal and good battery, but on pressing the connect button on both the receiver and the 7000 mouse nothing happens.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: I do not have the Wireless Optical Mouse 2000. I have Windows 7 Professional on 64-bit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, my question would be, is it possible to connect my Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 7000, Model: 1117 to the Wireless Mouse Receiver v1.0, Model:1053? Is there any chance that I can reset the default mouse of the receiver, either by software, or by hardware?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Surface Pen tip and button not working, incorrect Surface warranty info</h2>
                    <p>Hello from Greece. At 26/11/2016 i bought a surface pro 4 online from a greek shop named E-SHOP (http://www.e-shop.gr). At about two weeks ago the nib and the button of the pen stop working. The top button and the led are ok. I release the connection from
 the surface and made it again through bluetooth but still the problem exist.&nbsp; Before calling the shop i signed in&nbsp; in my microsoft account in order to find some help. When i register my surface (with the serial number) the microsoft system said that my machine
 is out of warranty (expired 15/03/2017)!</p>
<p>When i contact to the shop and ask about the pen problem an the warranty they suggest me to send the pen with the surface in order to check it. For the warranty they said "It is ok you have 2 years of warranty".</p>
<p>Im very upset about this and i want to know what can i do in order to fix the warranty problem ( what if a bankrupt of the bussiness?).
</p>
<p>1. Should the shop communicate with microsoft to fix the date of warranty?</p>
<p>2. Should i ask for a replacement or refund?</p>
<p>3. Should i mention this as a fraud?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 hours ago, when i was trying to find a solution through the UK microsoft support web for my surface, microsoft asked me for 29 pounds in order to chat with the support because they see my product is out of warranty!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>

            <p>First, remove the battery, wait a few seconds then replace it. This will restart the pen and may resolve the problem.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Your rights will be determined by Greek law, and may also be modified by EU law. Most likely, any claim you have will be against e-shop. E-shop may, knowingly or not, have sold you a previously used or reconditioned device which had been registered with
 Microsoft. It is possible that Microsoft's system incorrectly shows the device as previously registered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most sellers are unable to repair devices they sell, even though they are responsible for the warranty obligations. If you make a warranty claim they simply pass on the device to its manufacturer's warranty department, so it is usually best to deal direct
 with the manufacturer to avoid delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft's Surface devices are glued with hot melt adhesive so cannot easily be dismantled for repair. If you make a warranty claim, Microsoft will replace the device with a remanufactured device. If possible, claim direct against the seller and get a replacement,
 new device.</p>

    <title>Sculpt keyboard on Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> streko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sculpt keyboard on Windows 7</h2>
                    It saddened me when I had to replace my Comfort Curve 2000, but eventually found this Sculpt Keyboard. Since I've had it installed, I've had problems - which have been progressively dissipating. My current frustration with this keyboard is that the Microsoft
 Keyboard program doesn't recognize it installed on Windows 7 Pro. I've removed and reinstalled, swapped ports, updated software and drivers, but still to no avail.<br />
<br />
One of the main features is the alert to when I have CAPS Lock enabled - as there are no lights on the keyboard itself. The Ease of Use option (Within
<b>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Ease of Access Center\Make the keyboard easier to use</b>) audio sound is the only option I currently have aside from downloading external programs, but I found these to be slightly lacking or debilitating.
<br />
<br />
Please tell me there's something I'm doing wrong or that there's another way to get the on screen notification working without having to resort to 3rd party programs.<br />

            Hello,<br />
<br />
I don't receive any specific error, though there are no options available within Microsoft Keyboard - it simply notes "No Microsoft USB Keyboard Detected."<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1: </b>I've run the Hardware and Device Troubleshooter, but there are no errors found.<br />
<b>Method 2: </b>The keyboard responds to keystrokes and its functions, so this troubleshooting doesn't apply. The issue remains that it is not producing any responses to the Microsoft Keyboard application.<br />

            Added update:<br />
<br />
Using either InteliType 8.2 or Keyboard &amp; Mouse Centre (both 64-bit, as I have a 64-bit OS), neither detect the keyboard even if I swap USB ports. USB detects and installs the device, but treats it as a generic keyboard.<br />
<br />
Message from Keyboard &amp; Mouse Centre:<br />
<br />
No Device Detected<br />
Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center cannot detect a Microsoft device connected to your computer.
<br />
This may be because Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center does not automatically detect and configure PS/2, Bluetooth, and some USB devices.&nbsp;
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a supported Microsoft device, plug the USB connector into a different USB port on your computer.
<br />
If this does not work, check Troubleshooting device setup.<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have a Bluetooth device, you must first set up the Bluetooth connection.

<p>I thought Resident Evil 5 was stiff, but RE4 honestly just really takes the cake.</p>

<p>Maybe it'll take a while to get used to, but when I'm dying in the village in 1-1 on the lowest difficulty setting, it just really doesn't make me feel good.</p>

<p>If only this game could let you make your own controls. </p>

<p>Well, if it makes you feel any better there are only two difficulties and I would call them hard and harder. It does take a while to get used to the controls. I had to switch the scheme a few times, finally resting on the Type II scheme. It's still a bit
 off, but that's mainly for the fact that the right analog stick isn't used for movement.</p>

<p>Yeah, would have to agree type II was the easiest for me to get use to. Finally getting my groove back. Just cleared chapter 1 and feeling pretty confident now. I just hope all the switch back and forth between BF3, GoW 3, then going back to RE4 doesn't
 take away my ability to handle the controls comfortably.</p>

<p><b><span>Windows Update Error 0x80071A91</span></b>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The error code 0x80071A91 translates to " Transaction support within the specified file system resource manager is not started or was shutdown due to an error.”
 Now I know that doesn’t mean much to the common user, but it gives us some insight as to the failure you’re experiencing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In an effort to resolve this issue I recommend you run the following command. This will in essence reset the File System Resource Manager (FSRM), and should
 resolve the issue with the failed updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not resolve you present update error please let us know. Also, keep in mind that if one update in a group fails all the updates will fail with one
 error code. Thus, it may be to your benefit to attempt installing those updates one at a time to see if the problem is restricted to a particular update.</span></p>

 and can be installed. I have run the Store Troubleshooter and all things have been fixed. Why are the Apps not installing?</p>

            From Start click on the little down arrow in the lower left corner. You will find your apps here, just right click and pin to Start. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Shrikar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me, unfortunately I got help from Dell support before seeing your response so I am unsure if it would fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of their staff had a look at the computer through remote access and reckoned there were multiple issues, not just with accessing the Microsoft servers for software updates and app downloads. He tried to fix that main issue through various ways but was
 unable to. They then sent in a technician this morning who did a system reset and so far it has been running well (apart from the annoyance of having to reinstall a lot of things again).&nbsp;I also did that SFC scan and no problems came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, they have suggested I might like to&nbsp;stay on Windows 8 and not&nbsp;update to Windows 8.1&nbsp;this time around&nbsp;as I suspect&nbsp;these issues came up after I updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for all of your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Tam,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows, your PC got a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer was stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running was exchanged for
 a diagnostics key. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you decided to go back to Windows 8 and would like to upgrade again, you may use the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation tool</a> to upgrade to Windows 10. You can either select the <strong>
Upgrade the PC now</strong> option if you want to upgrade right away, or select the
<strong>Create installation media for another PC </strong>option to create a bootable copy on a USB thumb drive and upgrade another PC, then click
<strong>Next</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A new option has been added to the setup screen for users re-installing Windows 10 on a previously installed and activated system. If your system has a digital license attached to it, Windows 10 will automatically be upgraded. You don't need a key (so skip
 if asked) since your hardware has a Windows 10 digital license from the original upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know should you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t open pinned files and folders from taskbar</h2>
                    I have pinned some folders and documents (mostly notepad and mp3s) to taskbar. I know i was able to open them by right clicking the app (file explorer, etc.) and then selecting file or folder and clicking on it. But in last few months i noticed that i
 can no longer do that. I just click and nothing. I've tried several tips and helps, but issue is still here. Do anyone knows how to to solve it or what causes it? Thanks for answer.

            Did you move the files to a different location? Can you open the files from the folder location? If you can open them from the folder, then unpin them from the taskbar, then pin them again.

<h2>            Blue screen of death error</h2>
                    Hi there, I have been having the bsod error also known as blue screen of death error for quite some time already. It normally last for a couple of days or even up to one week and then after a while later the bsod error just never occur anymore until a
 few months or weeks later, the error will suddenly pop up again. I really do not understand how to solve this problem, i have been trying to solve the problem by resetting my computer documents through factory resets but it just don't seem to work at all.
 I have been having this problem for a few months already and this error has been a major issue for me because whenever i am doing my work or playing computer games the error just pop up and afterwards my data are all gone. The error is : 0x000001d3 . I honestly
 have no idea how to fix my computer could any experts or professional advice me on what to do next to solve my computer problem? I would greatly appreciate that if you could help me with it.

<h2>            BitDefender Management Control has Stopped Working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i have been receiving an error message that says BitDefender Management Control has stopped working.
</p>
<p>Error Message: </p>
<p>As far as i can remember, i last switched on the Windows Defender that resides in Control Panel in Win7, just to see what it does.
</p>
<p>Now i know its some kind of Anti-Virus or Anti-Malware program that requires constant updating.
</p>
<p>But i didn't update then and i kind a left it like that, after that i have been receiving this error constantly.
</p>
<p>I tried Google but there are way too many topics which really doesn't make any sense or i zeroed in: on forum to find a solution.
</p>
<p>I hope there is some solution this. Hoping for some solution. </p>

<p>Thank you for showing concern with regard to this problem.</p>
<p>I had restore my pc to just be done with useless and meaningless errors. I wasn't able to find a solution</p>
<p>in the Google. It seems not many people have this problem.</p>
<p>Today this error has started showing up again. I do not doubt PUP has any thing to do with it.</p>
<p>As i download very rarely, Windows Defender is switched off too.</p>
<p>But before this problem there was another error that poped up; it contains the log report.</p>

<p>Only Rogues have the ability to pick locks and chests. Depending on the level of the locked chest or door you need a certain amount of points in your Rogue's Cunning attribute to unlock them (Simple = 10 Cunning to Master = 40 Cunning). Some weapons and
 armor pieces can boost your cunning rating in various ways to help you unlock things without having to sacrifice attribute points into cunning.</p>

    <title>Win 10 update problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevin-vanderhoef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 update problems</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Switch 10 Tablet. (Comes with windows 10) It is basically No User Serviceable Parts Inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, understand The Battery is Hard mounted, and cannot be removed from the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No hard warechanges can be made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 3 months of trial and error, I finally got the tablet running with enough Virtual memory from its internal SD chip which is used as both primary hard drive (C:\) and Core memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a 32 Gig chip. Firmware is a 4 gig Compressed file. Virtual memory is set at 2 Gig.</p>
<p>Unpacked, the Windows 10 Package Occupies another 18 Gig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a bit of Experimentation I managed to reduce the core to a total of 14 Gig.</p>
<p>a little over 9 gig consisted of 3 browsers, Microsoft Mobile Office, Kingsoft Office, 4 games for Xbox live, and so on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an external 32 gig sd chip as a secondary hard drive, It ran, and could charge the battery while running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along comes the anual Windows 10 Update.</p>
<p>Which apparrently moved my Truncated Software package into a recovery file, and reinstalled the Basic Windows package, and over wrote the Virtual memory in the process.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It Crashed due to lack of memory.</p>
<p>Tried to restart with the Recovery file. Not enough memory. </p>
<p>Used a USB Cable to acess the SD Chips, I could acess the external SD Chip, but not the Internal SDchip...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing worked however, was the Factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon set up the new acer/windows Core Package, and Firmware now take up a total of 26 gig.</p>
<p>After removing the Extraneous included software it sists at 16.9 gig plus the Firmware File.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, a little research, And I find that the Intell Power Control interface (witch is HardCoded, and can't disable, or delete) is in conflict with Micosoft's ACPI compliant Battery control driver, and will not let the Battery Charge while Windows is active
 (Turned on, Sleeping or, Hibernating).&nbsp; So, I delete the driver, Shutdown completely (hold the powerebutton in till the indicator goes out), Cool down, and restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works The battery starts charging for about two minutes. The Microsoft driver reinstalls, and it's back in conflict.</p>
<p>I try the disable option, it charges for two minutes, Windows re-enables the driver, and it's back in conflict.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I need to keep the MS ACPI compliant Driver disabled and it's Frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, thats about a 100 Hrs, @ $90/hr Billable, That I won't be able to collect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(still can't disable MS Edge, or Cortana either)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

<p>You dont mention what version of Trend, whether its a new installation, whether its been updated or whether the problem existed before.</p>

<h2>            Media Player Won&#39;t Open - Event Viewer Blames MSVCR80.dll</h2>
                    
<p>Oddly, when my non-admin user is logged in, Media Player works fine, but as admin, it won't open when trying to play .wmv files off of Microsoft.com.&nbsp; It will open and play my sample videos though.<br />
<br />
Event viewer said:<br />
<br />
Faulting application wmplayer.exe version 11.0.6002.18111 time stamp 0x4aa91411, faulting<br />
module MSVCR80.dll, version 8.0.50727.4053, time stamp 0x4a594c79, exception code<br />
0xc000000d. fault offset 0x00014bal. process id 0x1894 application start time</p>
<p>The Event ID was 1000, Task Category was (100), Keywords:&nbsp; Classic<br />
<br />
I thought to maybe reinstall this file, but can't find a download for that particular version.&nbsp; I already did a sfc/scannow.&nbsp; It found corrupt files that could not be fixed.<br />
<br />
Suggestions please?</p>

<p>It's still me just with my real account.</p>
<p>Seems that while using Internet Explorer, xbox.com grabbed my Microsoft Messenger hotmail address (it was open in the background) and decided for me that I didn't have an xbox.com account so I didn't get the usual sign in screen, I got the sign-up screen.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>Now I still can't sign out of the wrong account on xbox.com in Internet Explorer even running with add-ons disabled and turning off anything I can find that could be "autofill"</p>
<p>BUT!</p>
<p>I Can Sign In, and Out of the right account, this one, with GOOGLE CHROME!</p>
<p>How's that for you? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Looks like I'll be surfing a Microsoft's site about a Microsoft console using CHROME!</p>
<p>Too funny!</p>

<p>I have the same issue and I'm sick of it. I wanted to try to use my newly created outlook.com account and ditch Gmail altogether. I may not be able to do it, but I signed into my outlook account on the xbox website and now I can't sign into the correct account(Gmail)
 with all of my progress and avatar and such. Really annoying. My girlfriend had the same issue on her iPad when she signed into her bing rewards account. I also have the issue at work because I can't sign out of the browser there (which isn't so bad because
 I get points for searching at work haha. Anyways, for some odd reason the browser remembers all of this stuff.
</p>
<p>I'm going to try clearing all history from the browser and seeing if that helps.
</p>
I just realized how old this post is. I'm assuming you've worked it out by now.

<p>I am on Classic Skype 7.40 (and I have made sure all update had been done). I work on a laptop, my sister on a desktop.
</p>
<p>I have also tried to remove my sister from my contact list and re-invite her but I still get her as 'offline' after she has accepted my invitation and she has confirmed that on her screen it indicates that she is 'active' (online).</p>
