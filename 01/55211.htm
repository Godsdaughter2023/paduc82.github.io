<h2>            My Windows displays blue screen automatically</h2>
                    <p>hi.</p>
<p>recently in processes i saw svchost*32 and i thought as before this is a virus or damaged file/process and i stopped that then a blue screen displayed and always when i'm working with my computer, it shuts down and shows that automatically and sometimes
 when i shut down my PC it will displays.</p>
<p>now how can i fix it? is there anyway to run that svchost process again?!</p>
<p>this is the problem:</p>

<p>Hi hamidreza120,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Svchost is a system process that hosts multiple Windows services in the Windows operating system. Once it is disabled or stopped, then it may affect other services on your computer, and may cause errors, such as blue screen errors. In this case, I suggest
 that you perform the helpful steps from this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17074/windows-7-resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Resolving stop (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</strong></a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how this goes for you.</p>

<p>It is extremely unlikely that the svchost process is the cause of a problem on your system - but sometimes folks think that becasue they don't understand how it works - or why do they see so many running in Task Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to look in Task Manager, Processes tab you would see several to many svchost Processes running and that is normal:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36098317-fca8-436e-96f7-a2efb50901f4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36098317-fca8-436e-96f7-a2efb50901f4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Behind/Under each of those svchost Processes important Windows Services are running.&nbsp; There might be just one Service running or there might be several Services running under each svchost Process so it is usually not a good idea to terminate them.&nbsp; Each
 svchost Process is "hosting" some Windows Services.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to right click one of the svchost Processes and choose Go to Service(s) you would see what Windows Services are being hosted by that particular process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It WOULD be a problem is one of the svchost Processes seemed to be running amok consuming large amounts of CPU or memory but as you can see in the example most of the time the svchost Processes are consuming zero CPU so that is a good thing.</p>

Marque Lor</a> the Microsoft engaged "expert" should do next is demonstrate some expertise by being sure the system is configured to generate crash dump files, prompt for some fundamental system information, and then you upload some recent crash dump files
 where they can be analyzed.</p>

<h2>            Windows7 losing &#34;pinned explorer shortcuts&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I make extensive use of the "pinned" option for my Windows Explorer so that I can quickly navigate to various Network drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This works really well and it is so much faster to navigate to the directories I&nbsp;use frequently.</p>
<p>However, Windows7 has the annoying behaviour of losing all my pinned shortcuts for Windows Explorer every so often.</p>
<p>Has anyone else encountered&nbsp;this issue with losing all their pinned shortcuts for Windows Explorer?</p>
<p>Cheers,<br />
BeeJay.</p>

            <p>Hi Everyone</p>
<p>After this happened to me a couple of times, I just started keeping a current backup of all the files in The AutomaticDestinations and CustomDestinations folders.</p>
<p>I created 2 sub-folders in the My Documents folder, for my user&nbsp;profile,&nbsp;named:</p>
<p>BU AutomaticDestinations, and BU CustomDestinations.</p>
<p>Once a week or after pinning/unpinning any items in any of the Jump Lists, I simply copy the contents of the AutomaticDestinations and CustomDestinations folders&nbsp;into the appropriate BU folder.</p>
<p>If I lose anything in any of the Jump Lists, I can simply replace the contents of the appropriate folder with the contents from the BU folder and everything is restored.</p>
<p><br />
Regards</p>

    <title>MY TOP 10 ISSUES WITH XB1 AND ADVANCED WARFARE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ayemac  say:</h3>
<h2>            MY TOP 10 ISSUES WITH XB1 AND ADVANCED WARFARE</h2>
                    
<p>I’ve always liked the XBox series starting with the original then the 360 and now the One. Each one has introduced new interfaces and features and, as creatures of habit, they’re not always welcomed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the XBox One, I feel like there are too many changes that don’t add value. Some are downright inefficient, while others may be much easier to access – and I just may not know exactly how to do that yet. I’m listing my beefs with the new setup and am
 curious if others experience these or have issues they want to vent. My hope is that MS reads these and LISTENS to the end-users – those who buy the machines. If it’s Activision/Sledgehammer’s issue, then hopefully they take note as well. I’m not joking when
 I say this – it makes me want to buy a PS4 to see if the experience is (gasp) better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It should be noted that I primarily play COD: AW, so some of my issues may be specific to that game. Comment away!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>For the original $500 I spent and the fact that it’s a much more robust console than the 360, I don’t like how long it takes to start up, log me in, and start the game. I think I read where there is an option to make it sleep rather than shut it off.
 I would think this baby would *<b>boom!</b>* turn on and be ready to rock.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Even though I sign in prior to starting AW, often I get prompted by AW that my profile is not logged in. Instinctively I hit the B button to back out, and it automatically throws me into the resizing of the screen and adjusting the darkness levels –
 as if I’ve never played the game and am new to it. The only way I can see to get out of this is to reboot, which brings me back to point 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Joining the party is a mess. I solely play games to hang out with my friends. The “party” has historically been the up-to-eight member party chat. The “game” has historically been just that – the game itself. Sometimes I want to join the game and not
 the party or vice versa. Why would they call the game the party now?? I get it and can around it, but others say, “I just sent you a party invite,” when they really just sent a game invite. Don’t confuse the two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If I’m friends with someone, why can’t I join their party or game? The game in AW states that it’s set to private and won’t let anyone join. The reality is that my friends are just sitting there waiting for others to join their game before going into
 a public match. It’s not private. If they’re already in a match, it allows you to join, but then subsequently states that it’s full. Both the party and game allows invites but does not allow others to join. The 360, by contrast, allowed this to occur – you
 could not only see if a public match was open (had an open slot to join), but if it was full it wouldn’t even give you the option to join (grayed out). In addition, you could join the party at any given moment (assuming it didn’t already have eight people
 in it). This inviting to the party and game single-handedly wastes all of our time. If you push the XBox button too soon, it wants to snap to the home page. Then it wants to shut the console off. Then it shuts off the controller. Then if you select the world
 icon in the top, left-hand corner to go to messages and accept the invite there, it works about a third of the time. Ugh. Useless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Sometimes we can get into parties and games; sometimes we can’t. Invites are sent often and time spent trying to accept over and over and over by all parties involved are fruitless. This is just reinforcing what I’m stating in item 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Why is everything s-l-o-w? Similar in line with item 1 above, the entire GUI just runs incredibly slow. Moving left to right or hitting the XBox button to snap, unsnap, etc. is just painful. The 360 wasn’t that fast either – but at least that was expected.
 Years ago when it came out we thought it was lightning fast. Then, as time went on, the 360 appeared slow by comparison. The hope was that when the One came out that it would…snappier. It’s not. In fact, it seems as slow as the 360 in response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A general reboot of the XB1 seems to fix most issues, but why? WHY should I ever have to reboot if I can’t see others online, can’t join a party, can’t join a game, etc.? “Hold while I reboot m console” is a common theme with us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Getting from Point A to Point B seems laborious. On the 360, you could generally hit the home button and get to any tab you wanted or needed. Need to join a party? Click the button, select Friends, and join the party. Need to check active downloads?
 Hit the button, scroll to the left once, and view active downloads. Everything is so deeply buried on the XB1 that it’s tedious. I wanted to set myself offline momentarily and had to RESEARCH it to find out how. I wanted to download a Gold free game and had
 to dig DEEP to get locate it. I wanted to record an action shot from a game on the DVR (I’ve since disconnected the Kinect), and by the time I found out how to do it the game time had lapsed. MS: If it’s not intuitive, then REDESIGN IT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My bandwidth is fast enough that I’ve often noticed an advantage in game play. Now I see one to two bars in the AW interface, and the user at the top often skips/glitches across my screen. His kill-cam shots show no skipping whatsoever, which leads me
 to believe that Activision has set this up to be more enjoyable by those with slow speeds. You’re telling me the guy with the slowest connection who skips across the screen has the highest score by far? BS. This is not a fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The controller is a step back. I read all of the comments about the awards it was receiving, and I have to admit – there are some things I like about it. Overall, though, I think it’s a miss. The kicker is that I can’t determine if it’s truly the controller
 or the slow, unresponsiveness of the XB1 itself! Hitting B or the home button or a trigger to shoot, for example, often give little to no response. I thought maybe I had a faulty controller, so I bought another one – same thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;What are your complaints? Let your voice be heard and let MS and Activision take note!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't have any complaints and MS doesn't read this section of the forums.</p>
<p>Actually, scratch that, I have two complaints, 1) Stop making FPS games....or... people should stop buying them. &nbsp;They're overdone/stale/old/boring. &nbsp;2) People need to stop buying all of these rehashes.</p>
<p>Lastly.... it sounds like you aren't quitting apps when you're done with them which is what is causing the slowdown. &nbsp;I experience none of those issues, granted, I avoid all Call of Duty games like the plague.</p>

<p>party system is a little touchy, most of the time it works perfectly for me, but like the other night, i was partying with 3 friends in Warframe, and had a hard time getting into the same game and finally got into the same lobby, then 1 guy could hear me
 and my other friend in party chat, but i couldn't hear the other friend and my other friend couldn't hear me, after about 20 minutes of everyone rebooting we ended up just game chat.</p>
<p>personally would have thought that the party system would be solid by now, but it is what it is, MS has been making a lot of changes based on the feedback site and i'm sure once things settle down a little more, these issues will be resolved.</p>

<p>Walk in say "xbox on" &nbsp;BOOM there it is on and game ready to pick up where I left off. &nbsp; Want to record something say "xbox record that" &nbsp; seems pretty intuitive to me. &nbsp; Never ever had a problem joining parties or game chat myself so cant comment on that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;Other problems you list are known faults with AW. &nbsp; And lastly no slowness on my UI that I can comment on. &nbsp; My One is like a Ferrari compared to my 360's Ford Mondeo.

<p>I'll make an effort to respond to OP properly:</p>
<p>1. Yes, setup the console to go into Standby mode rather than cold-off. &nbsp;Problem solved.</p>
<p>2. Set your profile to auto log in. &nbsp;I suspect you're starting the console and it's restarting your last game - which effectively starts before you log in. &nbsp;Doing (1) above should resolve this issue - to be honest though it's more of a COD (Activision issue)
 - it's not the first time Activision have produced a shoddy product.</p>
<p>3. The X1 still has "party" and "game" separate - sounds like Activision are confusing the matter. &nbsp;Assuming you don't have a Kinect - the next best way to handle parties is by "Snap" feature (double tap the home icon on the controller and take it from there).</p>
<p>4. Again, sounds like an Activision/COD issue - rather than them being in a private game why don't they just wait in the lobby as they get the invites sorted. &nbsp;Also could be a NAT issue.</p>
<p>5. Slow down - organise your chaos. &nbsp;Let someone invite - wait for invite - hold home button to join. &nbsp;Simple, stop running around like headless chicken.</p>
<p>6. Totally agree with you. &nbsp;I have mentioned this before in other postings the UI is very very slow - and I suspect it has to do with network ping (I'm in the UK, where are you?)</p>
<p>7. Instead of rebooting - and since most of your problems appear to be COD related - try restarting COD (by choosing "Quit" it actually restarts!).</p>
<p>8. No offense but it was designed to work with the Kinect - it'll take MS time to make the interface suitable for luddites.</p>
<p>9. This isn't the first game that's tried to balance out gameplay for players of different ping rate - I think it's a fair thing to do, maybe they need to do more work, or maybe the guy with the slow ping really was that good.</p>
<p>10. Totally disagree - the controller is the best by a long shot. &nbsp;Just accept that you're in the minority and MS can't please everyone. &nbsp;Maybe there's a 3rd party supplies doing X1 controller more to your liking?</p>

<p>First, the only problem I have with my X1 is that sometimes when I turn it on it goes from open to moderate NAT. It's always been open since day one.
</p>
<p>Second, the only problem that I have with Advanced Warfare is the lag when playing online. I have an excellent internet connection with 100mb down and 12 up so I know it's not my connection. What happened to these dedicated servers I kept hearing about while
 the game was in development? Apparently it uses peer to peer and dedicated when it should be all dedicated. This would definitely eliminate the lag that people experience. Again, it's a great game, but the lag really need to be fixed and dedicated servers
 need to be put in place.</p>

<p>It's the PING you want to check - download/upload speed matter not at all.</p>
<p>Dedicated servers will NOT remove lag. &nbsp;Slow ping is slow ping no matter what you do.</p>
<p>Dedicated servers is more about making sure there's no host (with an unfair network ping advantage) and no stability issues (host decides he doesn't like losing so he turns his/her X1 off).</p>

<p>My ping only drops when somebody else has a bad connection and they wind up lagging everybody else out because they are trying to take signal strength from everybody. Dedicated servers would definitely make a difference. There would be no host and you wouldn't
 have to rely on peer to peer. Everybody's connection would be equal and the servers would kick the people out that had little to no signal strength.</p>

<p>No - that isn't necessarily how dedicated servers work.</p>
<p>The dedicated servers are hosted all over the world. &nbsp;If you end up playing when it struggles to match you with players in your region then you'll end up getting "sent" to a distant host, hence your ping would be bad.</p>
<p>Everybody's connection can never be equal (unless you are all EXACTLY at the same distance to server and using same hardware/ISP).</p>

<h2>            window 10 why do my application get suspended after closing and reopening</h2>
                    So when i first start my laptop i can open all application right away no problem but i f was to close the application like google chrome and try to reopen it wont open for at least a couple of minutes, and ion the resource monitor it would say the program
 is suspended to bypass the couple of minutes i would have to right click and resume process, I am wondering if there is anyway to avoid this problem, since i never had this problem until a couple of days ago.

            Hi Livehai.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting or reinstalling the app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features  under Advanced Settings.  If Reset is not present or doesn't help, then Uninstall in same place, restart PC, then reinstall from a fresh download.
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help and you have other system problems, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 7 weather gadget changes location by itself - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 weather gadget changes location by itself</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using the weather gadget in Windows 7 since its release with no problems. I have two of them on my desktop, one for showing the weather for Kecskemét, Hungary, the other for Szeged, Hungary.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But a few weeks ago, the Kecskemét one changed by itself to Hetényegyháza, the Szeged one to Algyő. Both are small towns just next to the cities I want to show the weather for. At first I managed to change them back, but after a few days, it changed itself
 again, and now if I search for my cities, it returns these small towns instead of them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What could cause this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
                </div>

            <p><span><span><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
</span><font>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</font><br />
<br />
Try the following methods and check if weather gadgets work fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This may be caused due to the corruption of the gadget.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>To do so:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Right click on the gadget.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. Go to Properties.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. At the bottom of the window you will find a tab to Restore Gadgets Installed with Windows, click on it.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This will restore it back to the default setting. This should get your weather Gadget working.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may try these steps and check.<br />
a) Right click on the gadget and click on options.<br />
b) Type the location in “Select current location and press enter.”<br />
c) Press OK.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>If the issue persists then you may uninstall and reinstall the Weather gadget and check if it helps.</span></span></span></p>

<p>You're on the right track.&nbsp; When you're in the Personalization gallery with all the themes, click the Window Color link at the bottom, then click<em>Advanced appearance settings...</em> to access the Windows 95-XP style appearance settings, which should
 be the familiar dialog you're looking for.</p>
<p>Before you do, I have a suggestion that may yeild better results for you.&nbsp; If you like how everything looks, but just need the UI elements to be larger (larger font, toolbars, etc), try this:&nbsp;type<strong>DPI
</strong>into your Start menu, then choose the link that appears, called "<em>make text and other items larger or smaller</em>".&nbsp; This setting scales UI elements without causing blurring or blockiness, and preserves the high fidelity that the new display style
 is designed for.</p>
<p>Of course, if you are not impressed with the results of the DPI setting, you can change it back and use the old method instead.</p>

            Hi Dwi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I would manually upgrade to the latest version by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>, choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now. This is the most stable method to change versions and avoids buggy Windows Updates and Upgrade Assistant.  
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't run the Upgrade, this can mean your install is corrupted and would have problems.  What we've found in Windows 10 is that everything depends upon the quality of the install.  You can follow the  illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to wait then if it is pushing itself you can block the Version Update until the next one and then try installing it the same way.  The latest version 1903 should be released any day now:  
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />I would suggest to review this artcle:
<br /><a href="https://wccftech.com/windows-10-may-2019-update-official-list-of-blocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://wccftech.com/windows-10-may-2019-update...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft blocks updates if your computer may be impacted by known issues. 
<br />
<br />In this case it seems it is mostly likely either one of two things:
<br />1. You have an external USB or SD memory card in your PC. If you do, then try to remove any of them and try the update again.
<br />2. If you have an old version of anti-cheat software from games intalled. In this case you should update all your games and then try the update again. If it still doesn't work you may want to fully uninstall the games you do not play anymore to see if it was one of them. 
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

            Hi Dwi
<br />
<br />That error you are encountering is generally caused by some USB advice (flash drive, external drive . . .etc) this was well reported to be the problem by the Windows Insider community.
<br />
<br />If you do have USB devices connected to your PC, disconnect those and see if the update proceeds . . .

            I would suggest going through the guided walk through for fixing windows update errors.

<br />
<br />
<br />The other thing I would try is to try to update through the update assistant:

            Any method to Upgrade to the latest version should keep your files and apps in place, but you should still have your files backed up at all times if you value them at all.  At the end of this post I'll give simple ways to do this.
<br />
<br />If you get the version Update via WIndows Updates or open the Media Creation Tool download page and click on the Update Now button, it uses the Upgrade Assistant which is buggy and frequently wrong.  It has told hundreds I've seen that they can't Upgrade when they actually can.  It mistakes files in the Download folder as installed apps.  So I would avoid it and buggy WIndows Updates altogether by installing the Media Creation Tool, opening it and then choose Update this PC Now, or create the bootable media or download the ISO to open/mount and run, which directly Upgrades without the Update Assistant or WIndows Updates.   
<br />
<br />If you have problems then follow the extra steps here to Overcome Version Upgrade issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the install is problematic I will work with you to try to fix it an optimize it to run as good or better than before.  I can also help you do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But you can also always roll it back in Recovery Settings or in Repair Mode. 
<br />
<br />BACKUP YOUR FILES:
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder in Onedrive using Folder protection, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>   You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I am running Windows XP on the VMware Fusion Platform on my Mac.</p>
<p>I am trying to download and run AutoCAD on this PC platform. Every time I try, I get the following error after installing the basic program and then running the entire setup:</p>
<p>"can not update some system component now. &nbsp;Please reboot the machine and try again."</p>
<p>I have gone through this loop about 8 times, turning off my firewall, removing my firewall altogether, trying some AutoCAD trouble shooting tips, etc. &nbsp;I've spent at least 12 hours trying to get this to work and a simple reboot is certainly not working.</p>
<p>When I go to check my programs I do have an AutoCAD program installed but it does not appear to be complete for me to actually run AutoCAD. &nbsp;I have also written AutoCAD I can not tell if it is an AutoCAD or windows issue. &nbsp;Please help as running AutoCAD
 is the reason I got the VMware and Windows XP for my Mac...</p>

<h2>            How to remotely control a Win10 laptop from a Win7 laptop using Wi-Fi peer to peer &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I want to use Remote Desktop Connection on a Win7 laptop to remotely control a Win10 laptop (Surface 4 Pro) over peer-to-peer Wi-Fi ("ad hoc").</p>
<p>After some quick research, it turns out that the Win10 machine has to support Hosted Network (http://woshub.com/how-to-create-a-wi-fi-access-point-on-windows-10/), and that seems not to be the case for the Surface 4 Pro built-in Wi-Fi adapter....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary of the requirements:</p>
<p>- Surface 4 Pro machine runs some software and needs to be remotely operated during a few hours; the machine will be physically unreachable during that time, but within reach of Wi-Fi (a few dozen meters, clear sight). Wired access is not possible.</p>
<p>- Machine that will be used to remotely control the S4Pro is a Win7 Pro laptop.</p>
<p>- No Wi-Fi AP/router/hotspot is available and setting one just for this is not desirable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options ?</p>

    <title>How do I change User folder name on C drive on Microsoft Vista&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ashleychic  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change User folder name on C drive on Microsoft Vista&#63;</h2>
                    Hello. My father bought me a laptop a year ago and when he started everything, he was the administrator. I want to change that since it's mine. I went to the control panel and changed the administrator.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When you start up the laptop, when you try and enter in you have to click on the name and picture. That's my name.&nbsp;
<br />
When you open start, my name is there on the right with it's own content of contacts, desktop, documents, downloads, favorites, links, music, pictures, saved games, searches and videos.
<br />
<br />
The problem is when I open my C drive and go to Users, there's a folder with my dad's name and public. If you open my dad's name, it has content of contacts, desktop, documents, downloads, favorites, links, music, pictures, saved games, searches and videos.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I tried to change it again via control panel and just trying to rename the folder. Neither of those worked.
<br />
How do I change everything to my name? Is it even possible? <br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.

            Your dad apparently just renamed his user account with your name. As you have discovered, y<span>ou cannot change a user account by just changing the name. Just changing the name will make a cosmetic change only and not affect the
 underlying files/folders in the profile. If this is important to you:<br />
<br />
1. From an administrative account, rename the account to what it originally was. Then create the new Standard* user account named the way you want and at least one extra Administrator account. Call the latter "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like.<br />
2. Log into the new Standard user account once so the profile files/folders are created and then log into CompAdmin.<br />
3. Now go to Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Advanced&gt;User Profiles&gt;Settings**<br />
4. You will see where you can copy user accounts. Copy the old account to the new one from there. Use the Browse to select your new account (C:\Users\newaccount).<br />
5. Log into the new correctly named account and make sure all your stuff is there and that it works the way you want. When you are satisfied, you can log out and into CompAdmin and delete the old user account from Control Panel&gt;User Accounts.<br />
<br />
*Running as a Standard user is best practice for security purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. You don't want to run as an administrator for your daily work. Keep CompAdmin for your administrative account and use it only for elevation
 and emergencies.<br />
<br />
** If you don't want to bother copying the old misnamed account settings, you can skip this bit and just copy your data to the new user account instead.<br />
<br />
If you wish to log into your new, correctly-named account automatically, do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

<p>For the past few hours I've been trying to connect to Xbox live, but it just loads for a few minutes, then says the usual message when your internet isn't working. However, my internet obviously is working, and the test connection thing shows that it connects
 to all of it fine... I have no idea what to do, considering nothing like this has happened before. I've tried unplugging everything, restarting my router, and still it doesn't work. It was working perfectly fine, then I left for a few hours, and when I came
 back I couldn't connect. I know I'm not out of membership or anything, because I should have atleast another 6+ months.</p>
<p>If anyone has any ideas or a solution, I'd greatly appreciate it...</p>

<p>I have tried the repair computer option in the safe mode menu.</p>
<p>The computer is functioning fine somehow, but I'd prefer these issues to be rectified.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things I've noticed</p>
<p>Cannot pin items to the start menu or the taskbar</p>
<p>All of the Sony Vaio software tools don't work</p>
<p>ie - &nbsp;Vaio Care brings up error saying VAIOShell has stopped working - I've uninstalled Vaio Care and reinstalled a new version direct from the Sony website and it didn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>When the PC startsup (and everytime I try to run VAIO Gate) I get a Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library Error, that says:<br />
Runtime Error!</p>
<p>Program: C:\Program Files\Sony\VAIO Gate\Vaio Gate.exe</p>
<p>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled it and reinstalled a new version direct from the Sony website, but it didn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into services and tried to start the Windows Firewall, but it gives me a service-specific error code 13.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer isn't running slow or bringing up any issues, but I know it can't be good that this many issues are on this laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot turn on Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Firewall fixes you suggested failed to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the link to turn the Windows Firewall on, it appears that the machine tries for about 10-20 seconds and then stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a few scans with the Sydtem File Checker, but they haven't fixed the issues. Replacing the broken dll's with good ones doesn't seem practical as there is so many, according to the sfc logfile report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run Windows Security Essentials, Spybot and Malwarebytes in Normal and Admin modes in both normal environment and safe mode. None of them find any spyware or viruses (Spybot found some files the first time I ran it, tracing cookies - about 2-3 from
 memory).</p>

            <p>Ok I've created the disc and it works, but I have not progressed yet as I'm worried I'll lose my Microsoft Office Programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the program via work, where I paid a fee and I was directed to a microsoft link to download files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go ahead with this repair install, will I have to reinstall Microsoft Office as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other curious thing, I used KeyFinder to show me my Windows Product Key (as the sticker with this info on it on the bottom of my laptop has the last 10 characters smudged off.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was a bit concerned as to why the first 15 characters that I could see on the sticker were completely different to the first 15 characters being shown on KeyFinder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the KeyFinder program on another computer and it matched correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I have two different product keys and which one is correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought this laptop with Windows 7 (sp1) pre-installed. and that has never been changed or modified to any other version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm concerned that If I go ahead with the repair install and I get asked for the product key, that it won't be accepted, and that will not help me in any way.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get the product key detected with the help of any third party software, Microsoft cannot guarantee if the detected key is correct. The details of the product key of a pre-installed Windows version reside with the system manufacturer or on the sticker
 pasted on your laptop. I am afraid you might need to contact the manufacturer in the case the characters of the product key are smudged off. You may also refer to the following link for further assistance.</p>

    <title>LSI MegaRAID drive disappears in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d clined  say:</h3>
<h2>            LSI MegaRAID drive disappears in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this problem has been breaking my brain for some time. &nbsp;I have Win 7 Pro x64 installed on a separate boot drive and have built a RAID 5 array on a LSI SAS 9261-8i &nbsp;to store my data. &nbsp;The raid controller is fine, always loads, reports no problem with
 the driver and the data array is always there following boot. &nbsp;I check the array with Directory Opus and all the folders and files are just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs when I try to perform file operations such as copy, move, or expand a zip fie, and most everything else. &nbsp;The operation will proceed for a few seconds and stop with a notice that the path cannot be found. &nbsp;The array will have completely
 disappeared from windows and won't be back until I re-boot. &nbsp;Even so, LSI's MegaRAID Storage Manager program still shows the 9261-8i controller as optimal! &nbsp;There's just no array anymore!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my firmware and drivers are current. &nbsp;My windows installation is recent. &nbsp;I have tried the controller in different slots, removed the battery and nothing changes.</p>
<p>I need help! Please!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jerry</p>

            on the bottom of the mouse there should be a power/connect button, hold it in for 3 to 5 seconds to put it into discovery mode
<br />the mouse should be seen in settings -&gt; devices
<br />if not click the + next to add Bluetooth or other devices

            check/replace the batteries.
<br />turn it off then on and look in Settings -&gt; devices -&gt; Bluetooth and other devices
<br />click the + next to add Bluetooth or other devices
<br />let it search and see if it finds it.
<br />try the steps under "still not working?" in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4023522/surface-troubleshoot-problems-with-your-bluetooth-mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/402352...</a>
<br />
<br />if still no joy download the mouse and keyboard center 10 from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/d/arc-mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/d/a...</a>
<br />see if that offers any insight

            I am afraid I am all out of ideas, I wasn't aware that microsoft made an arc mouse without the pairing button.
