            Hi John, Bigsplat is used by some software companies (usually game developers) to debug their software!
<br />
<br />When the Bugsplat window pops up does it refer to some software installed on your system?
<br />
<br />If so uninstalling that software will remove Bugsplat.
<br />
<br />There is also the possibility re-installing the software will give you the opportunity to reinstall that software without installing Bugsplat       
        </p>

            I haven't installed any programs (at least knowingly) that would use Bugsplat.&nbsp; I just want to get rid of it.&nbsp; How can I do so? I also am on Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade error 0x8007000d</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just got a new laptop yesterday. During the initial startup it said that it needed to do some updates. These were done with the Windows 10 Upgrade assistant. I'm not sure why it wanted to upgrade when it already has Windows 10 and is brand new. Anyway,
 the update failed with error code 0x8007000d. Also, when I tried to update with Windows Update, KB3172729 would not download and install all the way. I tried downloading the troubleshooting utility and running the dism.exe utility from the Admin Command Prompt.
 Are there any other suggestions or should I just take the laptop back to the store since I am still in the exchange period?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luke</p>

            It's Windows Installer 3.1 from 2005. Is this a very old copy of Sage that you are trying to install?

            <p>No. It's Sage 200 2011 version.</p>
<p>I had problems with IIS but I seemed to have got over that.</p>
<p>The installation continued and it stopped with the message cannot find Sage........KB......</p>
<p>I looked in the Windows Installer 3.1 folder which is where the error message said it should be but the folder was empty.</p>
<p>It looks as if I am going to have to contact Sage, but I'd wanted to try to solve it without them.</p>

            <p>Windows 7 comes with Windows Installer 5.0. I don't see why Sage would be trying to install an older version. It wouldn't succeed anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid you're going to have to contact Sage. It could be that your system is corrupted in some way.</p>

<h3> nextflight13  say:</h3>
<h2>            .Net Framework 3.5 SP1</h2>
                    <p>There is a computer that my church had asked me to look at, and this computer has Windows Vista Ultimate 32-bit (dont know which SP is on there because they had a hard drive failure, and they had someone come put a hard drive in and they dont do updates).
 The problem is when i looked at it, it showed that when the computer tried to install a update for .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 it had failed, and the even viewer show this problem had been going on for months. Then about two weeks ago, the computer was booted up,
 then freezes up and shuts off. I was wanted to know are the two evens related, or should they be tackled on problem at a time?<br />
<br />

<p>You have two (2) options at this point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPTION A: </strong>Purchase then donate a brand-new [Win7] computer to your church. Hold a fund raiser if need be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>OPTION B: </strong>Assuming you have a set of OEM disks that came with the computer when it was purchased or there's a hidden Recovery partition, backup any/all data then format the hard-drive &amp; do a clean install of Windows Vista.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See the (my) ANSWER post in this thread and follow those instructions (<em>to-the-letter &amp;
<u>in order</u>!</em> ) to return&nbsp;the computer to a secure &amp; functional state: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/c44429fb-3f7c-4646-8529-5a97bb3cd0eb">
<font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/thread/c44429fb-3f7c-4646-8529-5a97bb3cd0eb</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need additional assistance with the clean install, you may begin <em>your own new thread
</em>in this forum &amp; ask for guidance: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system">
<font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these procedures are outside of your technical "comfort zone" - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the computer to a local, reputable and
<em>independent</em> (i.e., not a "BigBoxStore" or the Geek Squad!) computer repair shop &amp; let them do the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: The computer should NOT be connected to the internet <em>or any local networks</em> (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All of of the church's data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not
 already compromised.</strong></p>

            Thank you for the information. Yes I know how to do clean installs and all that nice stuff. Just needed to know from another POV on which item to tackle first, I go to school for networking. And the finance people "don't believe in online banking" so that's
 like the only good new out of the pot. Which would you prefer? vista or 7?<br />

            <p>The options to pin to taskbar only exist for desktop-based programs (like the built-in sticky note app that comes with Windows 7 and 8).&nbsp; You might want to try that instead of these other apps.&nbsp; To find the built-in sticky note app, just go to your start
 screen and type the word "sticky" and it will show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, having said that, a recent update is being delivered that also lets 3rd party store apps also get pinned to the taskbar.&nbsp;&nbsp; To get that update, press

To install windows, make sure that a partition on your boot disk has at least 829 megabytes(MB) of free space.<br />

            So, you are booting from the Windows 7 media and providing any device drivers (controller...) that may be necessary for an OS as old as Windows 7 to successfully see your hard drive and then choosing to erase everything/create new partitions?

 in Windows 7 that would cause this problem? It is nice to be able to change the PAINTS of a plane so that you have a change in variation when group flying etc. Any sugestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>Dual monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianmcintosh82  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual monitors</h2>
                    <p>have been running dual monitors for about a year. One monitor is HDMI and other is VGA. Both have run off same video card, HDMI monitor is a 24" and the VGA is a 19" monitor. Now both monitors show the same picture where as before the monitors worked in
 extended mode. Settings says only 19" monitor no 24" monitor. In settings under multiple says (Didn't detect another display). I have tried a different HDMI cables and VGA cables with no luck at all. even downloaded driver for 24" monitor still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer made sound of usb device being plugged in, at that time both monitors went blank played with cables and got picture back in duplicate mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for suggestions to solve problem</p>

<p>It is happening when CPU is up and running. Both displays work but second display that used to be able to extend to, now show a mirror image of first display (won't extend and isn't detected)<br />
</p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp; What error are you getting if any? </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>No error messages. Just that under display settings it no longer detects the 2nd monitor even though it's actively running a mirror image of 1st display</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>as Brian above, been happily running two monitors in extended mode since win10 over 12 months ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 1709, the dual monitor setup does not work, seems ok to start, run anything full screen (not windowed) on main screen then stops all video to second screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP intel core i7-6700</p>
<p>BIOS AMI A0.17</p>
<p>
</p><p>fix it please</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Rolling back update works. Update brings problem back.</p>
<p>

            I had the same problem with HP desktop, two monitors worked fine until Win10 upgrade Nov 2017, when computer would only recognize one monitor.&nbsp; Acer 21" VGA connection and Hannspree 21"&nbsp; HDMI connection.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was advised to go into Device Mgr find Video
 Card and revert to older driver.&nbsp; I found 2015 video driver, installed it and have been happily using both monitors ever since with NO problems.&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi qcinca,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Have you got the transceiver from Microsoft?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press and hold the Bluetooth button on the bottom of the mouse. If your device has a battery indication light, it will blink red/green to indicate
 the device is discoverable. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On your computer, open the Bluetooth software. The Bluetooth software is usually found either in Control Panel the Start menu. For more information,
 see Opening the Bluetooth software below. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Devices tab, click Add</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Follow the instructions that appear on the screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for a passkey, select No passkey. Microsoft Bluetooth mouse devices will not work with a random passkey.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may refer the following KB article for more information:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Connect a Bluetooth device that does not have or require a transceiver</span></span></p>

    <title>No Xbox One Remotes or Kinect adapters anywhere&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ckainn  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Xbox One Remotes or Kinect adapters anywhere&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I'm just wondering if Microsoft is planning on replenishing their stock of Xbox One remotes and Kinect adapters. I bought a new Xbox One Slim and Xbox One X this year (kids and mine)&nbsp;and I&nbsp;haven't been able to find the remote for months. I&nbsp;have only recently started looking for the adapters because until recently I&nbsp;was still using an Xbox One original and didn't require one. I&nbsp;don't use the Kinect much, but it's really nice for the voice commands when watching things. Anybody know if this is a normal thing or if there is an ETA&nbsp;on these items becoming available again?</p>

</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 3 with an LGC-LGC battery. &nbsp;I have been having issues lately with connected standby, and I can't figure out what the problem is. &nbsp;The reports say it all: I fully charge my Surface during the day, I pull it off at night and put it into
 my backpack, leave it in there all night, pull it out the next morning, and it is near dead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the sleep study report, it seems like the the culprit is "USB xHCI Compliant Host Controller" at 94%.</p>

</p><p>Expanding that, it doesn't quite make sense. &nbsp;Under that is the "USB Root Hub (3.0)", also at 94%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the four entries under that are all green, taking 0-3% each. &nbsp;I don't see how this adds up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hmm.....checking my Bluetooth adapter (which I unchecked the box "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"), the BIOS device name" is "\_SB.PCI0.XHC.RHUB.HS06". &nbsp;This is probably what the problem is. &nbsp;I'll re-enable that feature to see if
 that solves my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would suck if that's the problem. &nbsp;I disabled that feature because Bluetooth devices stop responding after a couple seconds of not being used. &nbsp;This means that clicking, mouse moving, and my Bluetooth gaming controller don't work for the first second
 of using them after this few seconds of power saving kicks in. &nbsp;It's frustrating. &nbsp;Disabling the feature completely fixed the mouse and controller startup delay, but it seems to be killing my battery.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Photos app missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On our Windows 10 home computer my wife and I each have an account. Whereas I can run the Microsoft photos app, my wife cannot. On her account, when viewing 'apps &amp; features' it does not exist. This is odd as the photos app must be a common app in the operating
 system. Appreciate any help in correcting this.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Photos app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.Windows.Photos | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            WordPad is a very limited word processing application, but it has some limited line spacing (1, 1.15, 1.5, and 2) control.<br />
<br />
In the "Paragraph" section of the toolbar, you should see 4 buttons in the top row: one with a left pointing arrow; one with a right point arrow; one with 4 dots; and one with up/down arrows.<br />
<br />
That last one (with up/down arrows) is the line spacing tool.&nbsp; Click on it and select 2 for double spacing.

 I was working yesterday after the update. The only thing that has happened since the update was when I tried to shut down the computer last night it wouldn't shut down so I went to update and recovery selected recovery then advanced start up and selected the

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps below to check the issue occurs in safe mode if not perform a clean boot please follow the steps below :</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example, if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers
 aren't causing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer the article below:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to do a clean boot and check if any third party apps are causing the issue.
</span><span>Placing the computer in a clean boot state can reduce software conflicts and help identify the root cause of the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer to the article below for steps to perform a clean boot.

<p>Haha really? I guess if it's true it could possibly be another way for microsoft to make money. Channel pays Microsoft to advertise their, Microsoft tells us, "Go watch this T.V. show on this network and we will give an exclusive avatar item and 0 GS couch
 potato achievement." At least I hope it would only be 0 GS. They've had gamerscore for way more worthy things like reaching the top Prestige in Call of Duty. Then again I think there is like a 3 GS achievement for like rock band for registering your rockband
 band on the rockband website. Anyways, seems kind of pointless. Wow you watched T.V., good job.</p>

<p>Keeps it the same? With ads already on the dash one would hope that any extra revenue MS makes from their members activities would go towards lowering or even obliterating Gold fees. It kind of goes against the meaning of the &nbsp;word achievement too doesn't
 it? I mean, as both gamers and parents we might be annoyed but just a tiny bit proud if we came home from work and found the kid/kids have not cleaned the house, tended the garden or washed the car, but have instead decided to sit in the basement all day playing
 some game, but have unlocked that really pesky achievement that you spent hours trying to get but failed! It's not the same if you return home to find them sprawled on the couch having watched tv all day, but have unlocked the "Now officially a slave to tv"
 achievement. Maybe that's just me though.....</p>

<p>Yes, keep it the same. Microsoft is a company out to make money to pay employees and keep the money moving. If my little bit of family gold plan cash goes for the service and security I don't care. I have to pay for my TV provider and it cost a bunch more.
 They show commercials and ads during a ball game or a show. Yet they never drop their price. I don't see why people seem to think it's ok to have ads on websites, TV and radio but not on the dash.If you get upset at the kids simply don't allow them to use
 it during those times. It's not that hard to do. </p>

<p>Never thought about it like that fyerball.... thanks for pointing that out. &nbsp;I was really just considering whether or not to renew my gold this summer. &nbsp;But you are right. &nbsp;If the price of a membership does not fluctuate that much than that might still be

<p>Erm, Microsoft is a company that makes BILLIONS in profit yearly, and that's after paying those employees. That's BILLIONS fyerball, this isn't a company that needs to flood our screens with ads to keep the lights on, they don't need to gouge millions of
 gamers out of a monthly fee for Xbox Live to make sure their pension fund is adequately funded. This is one of the largest, wealthiest corporations on planet motherfunkin Earth, everything they do is motivated purely by profit. And that's ok, a lot of people
 are willing to pay them money, they have some good products that I myself have paid for. I would have thought though that they might have looked at how popular Sony have become since PSPlus came on the scene and had a rethink about some of their practices.
 Membership fees being a big one, or at the very least removing the ads from Gold members screens. But that wouldn't be profitable. so that's not something M$ are willing to consider.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And you're speaking for your own country only when you're talking about the ads people have to put up with. On the other side of the Atlantic it's not as bad, Sky seem to be increasing the amount of ad breaks being shown in the last few years but that's
 because a lot of people are leaving them to go to non-subscription services. I watch some of the footie matches being shown on Fox Sports via internet streams and I'm always amazed at how many pop up ads appear during the game. If Sky Sports started doing
 that they'd lose a lot of their custom. Americans put up with it in my opinion because America has a sickness, the love of the almighty dollar. It goes right from the lower sections of society where someones life is taken for the sake of 20 dollars, all the
 way to the top, company directors whose only concern is the final figure on a balance sheet. Your tv network execs fall into this category, actual television content is only a filler between advertisements, then when a show is on they can't let you watch it
 in peace, gotta keep shoving ads down your throat. Don't even get me started on the majority of shows produced in the States, reality shows following the vainest, most self involved people this planet has ever seen, glorified on tv because the networks realise
 it's cheap to make and will bring the cash rolling in.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Microsoft has gone this way too, from trying to close up Windows 8 to third party programs so they can make more sales from their own marketplace, to continuously fleecing gamers (especially gamers from outside the US, who pay the same if not more in Live
 fees, but recieve a mere fraction of the content available in the US) through membership fees, arcade sales, rentals......what was the last thing of any worth you got for free from M$ fyerball? That wasn't earned through participation in the ambassador program
 or from being a mod? I'm not talking about silly little games like Happy Wars or Crash Course, some proper reward, like here fyerball, you've been a loyal and valued customer of ours for XX years, please enjoy this gift of 800MSP to get some content of your
 choice, thank you. I'd be willing to bet never, that's never happened. It's all about the profit.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I do get ads on my radio, but I don't pay for radio content so I'm good with that. I gave up paying for subscription tv because I believed that I was overpaying to watch ads and repeats, went to freeview, netflix and downloading/dvds instead. I do see ads
 all over the internet but using an adblocker add on seriously reduces the annoyance of them, and I rarely see ads on sites that I pay to get access to. And I refuse to pay for more Xbox Live membership due to its incredibly poor value for money when compared
 to competitors, why should I pay 7 bucks a month for party chat and multiplayer? Online gaming itself should be free, I've paid for the console, the game and the internet connection, why should I have to pay more to be able to fully play something I've ALREADY
 PAID FOR??? The ludicrous thing is that the only online gaming I've really done in the past two years has been in Battlefield 3, and correct me if I'm wrong but aren't those EA's servers I'm playing on? Tell me again why Gold is worth the money? Security?
 I'll assume you said that in reference to Sony being hacked. Yeah, Sony made a huge error on that one, but do you honestly believe it'll never happen to Xbox Live? I'd be willing to bet that it already has been attempted many, many times, I wouldn't even be
 surprised if one of those occassional blips we've been having with Live in the last few years was due to an outside influence. Xbox's day will surely come, and that'll be that security argument out the window.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>So keep on handing over what they keep on asking for fyerball, it's your money to do with as you please. I do feel sorry for those who are going to stick with Xbox though, just like Sky have increased ad time and subscription fees to deal with numbers falling
 away Microsoft will follow suit. You're going to be faced with more charges for less content, it's inevitable when it's all about profit.

<p>Sorry fyerball but what you implied was Microsoft are in business to "make money to pay employees and keep the money moving", this is not the case. A lot of the profit made by Microsoft goes straight to the largest shareholders and directors. This isn't
 a company that's concerned with you or your fellow consumers, so long as you keep forking over the moola that is. When this recession hit in the West, and I mean really hit, some of the more conscientious companies realised that they could afford to take a
 hit in profits in order to make it easier for their customers to still buy their products or use their services. Not Microsoft though, and I think they could well afford to at this stage. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I think one of the points fyerball made earlier is that your cable provider or internet provider are both billion dollar companies &nbsp;(check out comcast or AT&amp;T for example) and have massive amounts of ads per unit of time you receive a product. &nbsp;Yet we arent
 complaining about them jacking up prices every year or every contract period. &nbsp;Correct me if I am wrong here Fyerball. &nbsp;I have paid $60 for my membership the last few years and before that $50 for the previous years. &nbsp;So basically only having to have a one
 sixth increase once over 5 years is pretty good considering that my cable/ internet bill has gone up by one third the price over the last three years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So yes Microsoft is a billion dollar company where the execs are making a boat load. &nbsp;The same came be said for your cable provider company, your internet company, your cell company. &nbsp;</p>

            Most high end graphics cards come with display rotation built in and adjustable via Display Properties or via the Display Properties of the display icon in the Notification Area (to the left of the system clock).&nbsp; It is a nice feature if you want to read
 things more like a book on your laptop, etc.<br />
<br />
Some examples would be ATI, NVIDIA, Intel, Matrox, S3, XGI.&nbsp; These adapters may be built into your system and not always a separate card.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, this rotate screen phenomenon happens inadvertently from certain keystrokes (the cat walked on my keyboard).<br />
<br />
Pressing the Ctrl-Alt up arrow/down arrow will rotate the display 90 degrees at a time for some display adapters (like NVIDIA)<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work out, we will need to know your system make and model and see if we can look up the screen rotation shortcut keys for you.

    <title>question about the Xbox One Backwards Compatibility list&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            question about the Xbox One Backwards Compatibility list&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I was looking at the list of Xbox 360 games on the Vote for&nbsp;<span>Backwards Compatibility list and I saw there was a game series that don't show up. The game series was&nbsp;<strong>2K Sports's &nbsp;Major League Baseball.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;I looked under the "Hot ideas",
 "Top ideas", "New Ideas" and both options under Status and couldn't find any of the MLB 2K Sports games. I even try typing in the "Search Here" box for Major League Baseball 2K8 and MLB 2K8 and got result for games with one or two words matching words from
 my search or No idea found.</span>&nbsp;I was wondering if there any way to add the game series to the voting list or if there was a way to get a hold of the person who adds the games to the voting list, to get them to add the games to the voting list? &nbsp;.</p>
<p><br />
Thank you</p>

<p>Hey HockeyStar02,</p>
<p>If the game you want adding isn't there, you need to suggest to add it for Backwards Compatiblity under the Gaming &amp; Achievement category instead. :)</p>

<p>Hi TheJackah,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for the reply. I will post my topic there but first, can you help me and tell me where to find the Gaming &amp; Achievement forum category? So, I can post this in a forum under that category.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>You just share it here: <a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/forums/251647-gaming-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
xbox.uservoice.com/.../251647-gaming-achievements</a></p>
<p>Just make the idea title like: "[Game Name] for Backwards Compatibility" then in the description also include that you submitted it there because it was missing from the Backwards Compatibility category.</p>

<p>Hi TheJackah,</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you for the reply. Thank you for the forum link too. I was totally looking in the wrong place for the forum. I just got done submitting the 2K Sports Major League Baseball series for the list and hope they add it. &nbsp; Thank you again for all your help.</p>
