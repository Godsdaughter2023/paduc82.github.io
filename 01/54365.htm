<h2>            Microsoft Wireless Transceiver Model 1423 Now Only Works on ONE Port</h2>
                    I have a wireless Microsoft Mouse Model 5000, and a wireless Microsoft Keyboard Model 5050.&nbsp; They connect to a 2.4 GHz transceiver which plugs into a USB connection on my Surface 4 running Windows 10.&nbsp; The Surface is on a Microsoft Docking Station.&nbsp; When
 I first set things up, all was well.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a month,&nbsp;I could not connect to the two&nbsp;Bluetooth devices.&nbsp; So, I changed to a different port, and I was able to connect again.&nbsp; Then, after a couple of more weeks, I was unable to connect and tried a&nbsp;yet another&nbsp;USB
 port.&nbsp; I am now down to <strong>ONE</strong> working USB port.&nbsp; What happened, and how to make it work with all ports?&nbsp; Thanks.

Just to clarify, when Barb suggested u unplug the dock, she meant ac power not the sp4 plug. &nbsp;Also, have u tried other usb devices in the usb ports that have stopped working such as a flash drive? &nbsp;If no usb devices work u have a faulty dock and possibly a
 bad transmitter which is killing the ports.

<h2>            Windows does not automatically connect to wifi</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Windows won't auto connect to wifi for my DISABLED father's PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talk to me as if you were helping a 62 year old disabled man because that is who I am asking for. After building him a PC with Windows 8 on it, I am unable to make the wireless PCIe card connect to our home's wireless automatically. I used both USB adapters
 and a PCIe card, so I know the issue is solely within Windows 8. Every time the computer boots, it just says that connections are available. We have everything set up to automatically connect but it just won't happen. My father has to type in our wireless
 key every time he logs in and he can barely use a keyboard. There is no option for him to speak the numbers into the PC because for some reason, M$ won't allow that in the wireless manager. But regardless, this should not be happening. I have seen many posts
 about this issue and M$ must just give us the middle finger because that is what it feels like. I want someone from M$ to handle this issue personally. He can barely see either, so don't give me some command prompt nonsense. Fix it for us or help me find a
 third party wireless manager that will work. Next time you people release an operating system, and the head of development even breathes like he is about to say Metro, you need to tar and feather him in public.<br />

    <title>HOTMAIL ACCOUNT LOST PLEASE HELP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exposedfire9  say:</h3>
<h2>            HOTMAIL ACCOUNT LOST PLEASE HELP</h2>
                    
<p>Good afternoon,</p>
<p>Upon signing into to my XBOX Live account on my Xbox 360 about a&nbsp;week ago I was greeted with an error message and prompted to input my email + password. However I was unable to log in and was directed to go to the live website to resolve some problems with
 my hotmail account.</p>
<p>When I attempted to log in to my hotmail account I was told something along the lines of &nbsp;'It looks like some else may have been using your account', and&nbsp;then was&nbsp;directed to attempt at verifying my account, either by phone or through filling out&nbsp;a security
 form.</p>
<p>The telephone&nbsp;number they have on file is now years old and no longer used, so&nbsp;my only option was to&nbsp;fill out their security form.&nbsp; I&nbsp;was able to supply&nbsp;my name, DOB, postcode, security question answer, a couple of old passwords, the last 4 digits and exp.
 date of my filed credit card. However there&nbsp;were other boxes on the form&nbsp;that I had to largely&nbsp;leave empty (subjects of recently sent emails, contacts etc), due to this account being now solely for the purpose of my XBOX live account and not sending email.
 And perhaps&nbsp;as a consequence of this; everytime I have&nbsp;attempted to recover the account using the form it has come back saying I have 'not provided enough information', even though I have provided the data as listed above.</p>
<p>This is very frustrating to me as I have been an XBOX live customer for around 6-7 years and held the same account from the outset. Also the hotmail account that it is tied to and currently&nbsp;locked, I have held for over a decade. I have tried and tried to
 provide as much info as I can to retrieve my hotmail account but&nbsp;to no avail. I even contacted microsoft about the email account who came back with the stock response of 'try to fill out more detail on the security form...'.</p>
<p>Now, what is not important to me is the hotmail account, I can deal with losing that. But what is,&nbsp;is my Live account. I have 6-7 years worth of downloads,&nbsp;hundreds of £s spent on games + add-ons.</p>
<p>What I would like to know is;&nbsp;is there anyway&nbsp;of retrieving my Live account?&nbsp;Or maybe&nbsp;moving my account over to a new email address&nbsp;seeing as it looks like I may&nbsp;have lost this hotmail forever. Also if there is any body who has&nbsp;been in a&nbsp;similar position&nbsp;that
 could give me any advice on this, I'd be grateful.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>There is only one option left to try, please follow the steps on this trouble shooting page, at the end if all options fail, like filling out the recovery form it will show another step you can try.</p>
<p>It will show what information you need and after that &nbsp;you need to contact Xbox Support via <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I think when filling out a &nbsp;form to recover your password, and when some information is incorrect it will be automatically rejected by the system. What I do recomend is filling out the form again and trying this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full Name: </li><li>Date of Birth: </li><li>Postcode: </li><li>Security Answer: </li><li>1 Password (One that has been previously used, with certainty) </li></ul>
<p>While it may not seem like enough information, anything incorrect may just prevent it from being accepted by the system to recover. I recovered a profile through the same process just a few days ago, my first attempt was failed even though I entered in as
 much information as I could even though the Security Answer was correct.I think guesisng additional information may impact your success in recovering your account.</p>
<p>Please let me know how you get on and reply back to me. If this didn't work can you please confirm if you have the Console ID/Serial number to hand that first created the Account for Xbox LIVE associated with the affected E-mail address? (I do not want that
 information, and should not be posted on here, it'll be for my next step for resolution advice)</p>
<p><br />
Something else that you can try is to submitting a form to the Microsoft Windows - Accounts Team:<br />
Click
 here to submit your online form.</p>
<p>Please include the following in this support request form:</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief description of the problem (Verification issues) </li><li>The affected MicrosoftAccount </li><li>Contact E-mail (For them to get back to you) </li><li>Detailed description of the problem </li><li>Send message </li></ul>
<p>Looking foward to your reply!</p>
<p>Regards,<br />
Daniel</p>

<p>Hi thanks for your replies. WPAK: I am now in contact with XBOX support, and have a ticket raised on their system. I have to contact them once I have my XBOX 360 ID number to hand at which time it will be raised to the advocacy team.</p>
<p>Thanks Daniel for your suggestions. I suspected your esplanation of the system throwing back any attempts at account recovery containing incorrect details may of been the case. I did enter some passwords that I wasn't 100% certain were associated with the
 account. Also I tried using my new address, as well as my own and 2 different credit card details so maybe this is where I am going wrong.
</p>
<p>I have already reached my limit of account recovery attempts for today so unfortunately I cannot attempt your suggestion.</p>
<p>Hopefully having my ticket raised to the 'advocacy' team may be fruitful. </p>
<p>I have one quick question about the process though: I had to provide the agent with my last account recovery attempt code, which I suspect may contain incorrect details, (eg. a different postcode as that on file) will this impact my prospect of recovering
 my account, or will I get an opportunity to explain my situation to whoever after the ticket has been escalated?</p>
<p>As you may understand, I feel lost as the Microsoft customer support structure to me seems like a gigantic autonomous labyrinth.</p>

<p>Not good news so far I'm afraid. </p>
<p>I was originally told that someone from the advocacy team would contact me within 72 hours, that was on 1st Ocbober, it is now 8th October and still no reply.</p>
<p>I did re-contact support via chat to get an update on the weekend and they told me that the advocacy team had infact tried to contact me, but didn't get a response. Upon enquiry of the email address to which they responded, I was told a completely different
 address to my own. D-: </p>
<p>I wasn't explained to the reasoning behind this error, but anyway, mistakes happen so I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I was told that I'd *definitely* be contacted by the advocacy team within 24 hours to have my account unlocked.</p>
<p>24 hours goes by, and still no email as promised. Yesterday, I once again contacted support. I was told that my case would be dealt with on 7-8th October.
</p>
<p>As of time of writing this message my case has still not been dealt with. Today I conacted support again for an update, still it is 'being worked on'. I am not holding out hope that they are going to be sticking to there own deadlines.</p>
<p>I am very disappointed with the quality of Microsoft customer service so far. </p>
<p>Very disappointed :-(</p>

<h2>            Help with profile switching</h2>
                    
<p>Is there a shortcut to switch between active profiles when there are more than one signed in? &nbsp;I've been playing on my profile/gt online and my xbox will sometimes switch to my wife or kids profile if they are signed in at the same time. &nbsp;Is there something
 I'm doing to cause this or is it a bug? &nbsp;Anyone else have this happen?</p>

<p>I've noticed if anyone has a controller in their hand and you go back home, it changes to the one it sees holding the controller. Other than that, not really.. You can switch profiles back pretty easy, though.</p>

<p>Put it on manual sign in. This is what I had to do to stop it auto signing in my wife. Then is all I do is when I turn on my xbox Is say "xbox sign in dufful" and it signs me in. No more auto sign ins of others.

<h2>            Windows Update broke video and monitor drivers&#59; can&#39;t adjust resolution past 1280x1024</h2>
                    
<p>On October 5, I installed two, optional, Windows Updates. One for the nVidia 6600GT and the other for the Samsung 2494SW monitor. Upon restart, the computer booted up in 1280x1024 resolution and did not recognize the monitor past (Default Monitor). -<a href="http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/display_settings.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/display_settings.png</a></p>
<p>I tried installing the latest Windows 7 nVidia drivers from their site and while the installation completed, when I restarted at the end of the installation, it still booted in 1280x1024 with no options for the correct 1920x1080 resolution.</p>
<p>I looked in Device Manager and noticed two very strange things - <a href="http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/device_manager.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/device_manager.png</a> :</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a problem with the nVidia 6600GT </li><li>There is no Monitors tab (it should be between Mice and other pointing devices and Network adapters)</li></ol>
<p>The nVidia 6600GT's error was:<strong> Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)</strong></p>
<p>Obviously it hadn't completely stopped the device because the graphics card was still working and I was still getting picture. I looked at the driver details for the 6600GT and it says it has the latest driver, 8.17.12.5896. -<a href="http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/6600gt_properties.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/6600gt_properties.png</a></p>
<p>I've tried updating the driver (no updates), disabling the device (it just turns back on and installs the driver) and uninstalling the driver (same as disabling the device). All to no avail.</p>
<p>I've also tried to install the Samsung 2494SW's drivers, but it doesn't recognize a display adapter for which to install the monitor drivers. -<a href="http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/2494sw_driver.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.verityhw.com/uploader/files/1/2494sw_driver.png</a></p>
<p>If I select SyncMaster 2494SW (Digital) and hit OK, it gives me an error of invalid parameters, another empty error, then it says the driver installed correctly; which is obviously not the case.</p>
<p>I'm all out of ideas here and any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            Never rely on Windows Update versions of drivers, especially the video card drivers.&nbsp; You may now have to "roll-back" the nVidia drivers in Device Manage and then download the correct ones from www.nvidia.com

<p><span>Hi MrCodeDude,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a possibility that the new graphics card driver available from Nvidia may not be working.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you uninstall the current driver for both monitor and the graphics card<span>Make sure that the&nbsp; "<strong>Delete the
 Driver Software for this device"</strong>&nbsp;check box is checked while uninstalling the driver for both the devices.</span></span></p>
<p><span>After uninstalling the drivers for both the devices restart the computer for the basic drivers to get installed automatically and check if the issue
 persists.</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you install the legacy drivers for both the devices using the software CD that came along with
 the devices.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></strong></p>

                    <p>Dear community, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I write emails in three different languages, Dutch, English and Spanish. That is why I have all three language packs installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However in the outlook mail app (windows 10) on my laptop, whenever I write an email, and set the right language under -options- it switches back to English when I use backspace. I do want to have all the languages installed, but only use one at the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is seriously annoying. Please help! </p>

<h2>            Audio cuts out when my microphone turns on.</h2>
                    <p>Whenever i try to go into a call on skype with my friends or whenever i try to communicate in a game or something, my audio cuts out immediately. I can't hear the other person, nor can i hear external things like youtube. I checked the volume mixer, and
 the device is detecting audio, but not transmitting it to my headphones. My drivers are fully up to date and it does this on every headphone, whether plugged in or bluetooth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The headphones that the problem first occurred on were a pair of bluetooth Beats-X that have worked with my Surface Book 2 in the past for calls and audio.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF you can help me, thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business disconnects</h2>
                    <p>Hey all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1</p>
<p>For some reason I am being disconnected all day from Skype. &nbsp;As soon as it drops,, it reconnects just fine. &nbsp;(It just did it). &nbsp;Now when this happens I can miss conversations which is not good. &nbsp;Nothing else on my system or home is having connection problems.
 &nbsp;I've made a text file of a command pinging my modem and router. &nbsp;Nothing shows up. &nbsp;What could this be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 2</p>
<p>Can't close chat windows. &nbsp;Just lose some of the interface. &nbsp;This is rare that this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a46b59b-62a5-46ea-8af2-931a274dfa0f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a46b59b-62a5-46ea-8af2-931a274dfa0f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 3</p>
<p>I can't see any more conversation. &nbsp;I can see the little orange dots and I can type all I like but it never shows up. &nbsp;This could be happening during a disconnect.</p>
<p>(disconnected again)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c92178b-db41-4d07-b548-c34534627661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c92178b-db41-4d07-b548-c34534627661" /></a></p>
<p>Here's another example</p>
<p>You can see I said Good Morning to Kim. &nbsp;She wrote "Good Morning How are things at your end of the world?"</p>
<p>I don't see it in the chat window and I can type but when I hit enter, it does not show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bc5e335-cdbb-455e-92a9-f0a3abff243a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1bc5e335-cdbb-455e-92a9-f0a3abff243a" /></a></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Ryan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problems you listed may be caused by disconnection. You could try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete your sign-in information and try logging in. If it doesn’t work, please follow step 2.</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f36de99-f5a4-435a-a446-a8579c72d0f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f36de99-f5a4-435a-a446-a8579c72d0f6" /></a></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Control Panel&gt;Control center&gt;Programs and Features&gt;Choose Microsoft Office 365 (Skype for Business)&gt;Right click ‘change’&gt;Online Repair&gt;repair.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To further troubleshoot, I need to confirm the following information:</p>
<ol>
<li>The detail versions of the Skype for Business and operating system.</li><li><a href="https://testconnectivity.microsoft.com/#&amp;&amp;+1yWdX3coNDhgZS0b0motjqIC5ztKhTs6rw5I18YcmiRms30aMSIfvx0b1pW/xsmPIPjAAnhrxfbit7S7ehhsZxAJ+dw94WqGq0kYpFD93gqyV0+KqPcbrITc8ZVqJGZYgRySdj6W9uDqz0grdMMEhv/cadpUjw1G+OEEj//pulCyhY+Ge03UW37c1OdkY8ZYmAG8w==" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Test
 your account</a> with the network where Skype for Business disconnected and share the test result via
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/privatemessages/list">PM</a>.</li><li>Have you ever changed the settings of firewall?</li><li>Test whether other accounts can login to Skype for Business and work normally.</li><li>Use another device and log in with your account to check whether the issue exists.</li></ol>
<p>In addition, regarding “home” in “Nothing else on my system or <span>
home</span> is having connection problems.” Do you mean another network?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Hans</p>

    <title>Screen warm on surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ek-mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen warm on surface Pro 4</h2>
                    I recently purchased a surface Pro 4 i5 4 GB RAM and have noticed in the first few days that the screen gets quite warm when I use it. It's not so hot that I can't touch it but warm enough to be quite noticeable. Microsoft support said it could be from
 Windows updates. However, it completed updating to build 1607 a couple of days ago and still became quite warm on the screen when I used it after that for fairly light tasks – writing in word, some Internet browsing, and hand writing some notes. It does cool
 down when the screen goes off and I'm not using it. Is this normal for the surface or could this be a sign that I have a defective unit? I'm asking because I'm trying to decide whether I need to return it or not. Thank you for your help.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Common reasons for a Surface to be quite warm is that a program or background process is running with a high CPU. Open Task Manager and look for a process using over 50% CPU. Uninstall or change background app permission in privacy. Or you can try the steps
 provided below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and tap or click <strong>Search</strong>.</li><li>In the search box, enter <strong>task manager,</strong> and tap or click <strong>
Search</strong>.</li><li>In the search results, tap or click <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click <strong>More details</strong>.</li><li>Tap or click on the <strong>CPU</strong> column to sort processes by those that have the highest CPU.</li><li>Identify process names that have a CPU higher than 50%. The process names are related to both currently running programs as well as background processes running in Windows.</li><li>If the list contains running programs that have high CPU, try closing the program to see if it resolves the issue.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<p>We'll be waiting for the results. Don't hesitate to reach out to us if you need further assistance.
</p>

<h2>            Windows Logon Sound</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I got Windows 8 Pro. When I checked the Windows/Media directory, I noticed that there was a logon sound present in one of the files (Windows</p>
<p>Logon.wav). When I&nbsp;looked around&nbsp;the sounds option from Personalize, I realized that&nbsp;there was no logon sound event available . Can anyone give me</p>
<p>a reason on why there is no logon sound event present to use the logon sound file&nbsp;and&nbsp;why such a file exists at all in that particular directory?</p>

            Yup. Now look under Program Events under Windows. There doesn't seem to be a Windows Logon Event to use the file from the Windows/Media Directory. Curiously enough, there are other sounds as well (ex. Caligraphy) but their respective themes does not exist
 from the Personalize tab. I wonder why MS would include such files with no particular use in the system.

 playing the song. The track bar does not move unless I rapidly click on the play/pause button which is also the only point I here the stuttering of the song as though it is playing for the split second that it moves. I have tried resetting the program, setting
 it to default hundreds of times, and deleting the "CurrentDatabase_372.wmdb" file to see if it was a corrupt pathway, but nothing works. I don't know what else to do.<br />

            Hi!<br />
<br />
Try this FixIt: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/AudioPlayback/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/AudioPlayback/en-us</a><br />
<br />
If that doesn't help I suggest you try un- and reinstalling of WMP.<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />

            Unfortunately, it is not that simple, I have tried this and it does not find the problem. I have tried reinstalling and all that, but after that did not work I moved on to the above solutions I also tried.<br />

            Unfortunately, that is the only way to "uninstall" and "re-install" WMP on the win7 64 bit that I know of, and I have done this many times already. I have not found any other solutions other than this and the ones I listed above. Which is why I am posting
 to find out any other ideas. It does not seem to be anything that effects iTunes, but the only problem with iTunes is that most of my WMA audio files are protected, and so they are not added to the iTunes library. And that is a problem since all the WMA files
 I have make up about a quarter of all my music, which in total is about 4400 files.

            Well the first one I did not find, the only check box was for disabling all sound effects on the enhancements tab, so I checked that and it had no effect, and the SRS WOW effects were already off, so I turned it on to no effect.<br />
<br />
Just to clarify with any one reading the post. I am having problems with the WMP not playing the music I select when I go into my music lists. I have been able to get it to work occasionally, but as soon as I exit out, pause, or just let it play for a while
 the music will not play immediately after pressing the play button and the button will have the "pause" icon as though the song it is on was playing, yet it is not and the track bar at the bottom is not moving at all unless I rapidly press the play/pause button.
 In doing this I CAN hear the music for split second intervals as I am hitting the button, but I end up having to just keep reloading WMP until it works again. And this can take 10 or more times just to play a few more songs before it goes on the fritz again.<br />

I would suggest you to run Windows media player settings and library trobulshooter.

            Ok. So I tried the first one. And the report showed that the WMP library is corrupted. I then opened the WMP program to see if it worked and found that the music would play. But then I closed it out and loaded WMP again and it started doing the same thing
 as before. <br />
<br />
I then tried the second. And it had no effect. I tried both about ten times each and got no further than where I was.<br />
<br />
I do thank you for the ideas you gave. <br />
<br />
I received two errors. The first was the message saying that the "WMP library is corrupted" and that it recreated the library. Did not work.<br />
<br />
The second was for the WMP settings. I did the fix like the first and got a message that said the "configuration settings might be set incorrectly". Applied this fix. Did not work.<br />

Is there a way to get WMP to throw me an error message when it starts to have a problem with playing media, even if it is very slight?<br />

            I know that since it is not throwing me an error right now or has ever, that it is reading and functioning as though the media player was fine. But the fact that the music will not play and yet have the play/pause button not change and show as if the song
 was playing, tells me something is getting hung up somewhere.<br />

            <p>The game is not working because you are running it off a CD. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the fix at another site. Make sure you have Civilization IV Beyond the Sword then update it to the latest version of 3.19. That version eliminates the need to have the CD in. I no longer have the administrator login issues.</p>

<p>Hello Motamarri,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to post here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From your description, I assume you are using an Office 365 for Business account. May I know the reason about why you don't use the latest Office suite which can be downloaded from the office portal
 with your Office 365 credential? It is strongly suggested you use the latest Outlook 2016 and Skype for Business 2016 for the best usage.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you also can try repairing the Office suite via the below link:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/repair-an-office-application-7821d4b6-7c1d-4205-aa0e-a6b40c5bb88b</span></a></p>

<p>Hope the above information helpful.</p>

Lots.&nbsp; Some free.</p>
<p>I'd suggest Google searches.</p>
<p>Not really a Microsoft issue.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>You also might want to include the type of documents (file types, etc. ) and exactly what type of editing you are planning on doing.&nbsp;</p>

<div>The documents are scanned onto the computer to JPEG, is it possible to scan it using a different software.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Basically what i aim to achieve is to be able to access and munipulate the words in the document. Whats made this difficult is that the documents at hand have&nbsp;different&nbsp;fonts, differnet styles and graphics.</div>

    <title>How an Age of Empires online should be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clusios  say:</h3>
<h2>            How an Age of Empires online should be</h2>
                    
<p>I am Age of Empires fan and that’s why I’m writing this. Because the game topic has a lot of potential and the game directors don’t know how to exploit it.</p>
<p>When I played Age of Empires online I knew that it was going to fall, I think they should had taken another path to complete its evolution and success. If you want a nice game you should forget about “free to play”, DLC or any other way where you have to
 pay constantly after get the game, this greatly ruins the project. If you want to avoid the piracy, you should get servers where the people play only online after pay the game.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain briefly according with my consideration how an AoE online can be a great game.</p>
<p>(Sorry about my english, it isn't my main language)&nbsp;</p>
Introduction
<p>The only thing I want is to provide new ideas to see one day a true AoE where you can fight for honor.. You know great medieval battles of armies made ​​up by you and your allies to achieve domination. The gamers need a game with addictive ideas.</p>
<p>The idea is not to invade the user with details that aren’t interesting or they are not providing so much to the game.</p>
<p>The aspects of the game start from Age of empires II, since it is a neutral and simple game without many additions.</p>
<p>The focus of the game would be wearable items for units, heroes, diplomacy, customization for your city, team battles, finding unique resources and a great online experience.</p>
Units
<p>The idea is not to create archers; it is to create villagers that can become archers through training in the archery. Not to create horsemen, it is to create units that can ride a horse.</p>
<p>The possibility to breed animals like wolves, dogs, elephants, horses, eagles, etc.</p>
<p>You should leave behind the sets of units like in AoE III, because joining your units with your friend’s unit it would look like a great army.</p>
<p>There would be more skilled units and I’m going to call them heroes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Heroes
<p>The heroes abilities would not be very fancy, but striking enough to distinguish a hero from a common unit. For example, an accurate archer who shoots multiple targets quickly, a knight with a huge sword that hits multiple enemies at once, a light swordsman
 with the ability to dodge attacks, a scientific expert in dynamite, an intrepid horseman, an excellent builder, a stealthy assassin, etc.</p>
<p>Each civilization would have its own unlockable heroes. They wouldn’t be so powerful to center all the game on this, but good enough to want them on our side.</p>
<p>A hero could be created in training or he could be forged by experience in the battlefield.</p>
<p>Once a hero has died, he could revive by waiting time and paying for his healing.</p>
Resources
<p>Create crops, animal farms, orchards for food; it would be the most important resource which is required to create villagers.</p>
<p>Separately from the known resources such as gold, stone, wood, food; you would have resources that they would have some extra little benefit, such as a special stone that would allow us to make better quality swords, this would be by forging.</p>
Forging and wearable stuff
<p>Wearable weapons and armor for units would be created. We would decide that quality of armor we equip our army depending on the resources we have.</p>
<p>All the forged items would be stacked inside a structure (warehouse or blacksmith) to dispose of it when the units are ready to use it.</p>
<p>Some objects may be created specifically from a mixture of different objects. If we put a special item on a unit, he can become a hero easier on the battlefield because he can destroy more enemy units.</p>
Diplomacy
<p>It would be an essential part of the game which would help us to play as a team with our online friends to exchange resources and join forces on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Requests for agreements with the enemies would be created, for example ceasefire by some minutes. A civilization request an agreement and the enemies can accept it or not. You could even have arrangements to meet in battle at a certain time.</p>
<p>Agreements with our own allies could be also created. For example, every x minutes provide resources.</p>
Ages
<p>I would put the game at a certain age in order to focus on more fun and interesting details. In return it would have evolvable features.</p>
Buildings
<p>There would be units that can make special buildings, such as a great merchant who can found a great market that provides gold to the civilization.</p>
<p>Users should be able to have some decoration and utility structures to create their own city or fortress; Such as bridges to cross rivers, paved roads, statues, etc.</p>
<p>Each structure may have 2 or 3 designs, so they would look different in the city.</p>
Wonders
<p>Wonders should be used to provide several advantages, such as training villagers in different disciplines, creating special objects, providing resources, etc.</p>
Game objective
<p>There is nothing wrong with the game focusing on a single target if it is very fun. Users would be behind all they would be the kings giving orders. Then the goal of the game would be to find and kill the enemy king. Something like it was regicide in AoE
 II.</p>
<p>As king you could go to the battlefield under an agreement with the enemy and risk your all out. So you can train as king on the battlefield to gain skills.</p>
Graphics
<p>We must stop the childish graphics as was the Age of Empires online and focus on more honorable graphics.</p>

<p>I'll admit right out that I didn't read all of that. I just want to point out that what makes a game good to you might not appeal to another gamer. There's nothing wrong with hoping and wanting to get the game you like, but others also want the game that
 they like.</p>

<h2>            link to web site not highlighted &#40;blue&#41; in windows live email &#40;windows 7&#41; so I can click on to it&#63;</h2>
                    How do I go to a web site contained in an email that is not highlighted in blue. I click on&nbsp;it (black) and nothing happens.&nbsp; If it were blue I think the page would pop up&nbsp;

    <title>Zoo Tycoon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murdertramp17  say:</h3>
<h2>            Zoo Tycoon</h2>
                    
<p><a href="http://www.gameinformer.com/games/zoo_tycoon/b/xboxone/archive/2013/08/20/cleaning-up-the-world-39-s-largest-zoo-takes-teamwork.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gameinformer.com/games/zoo_tycoon/b/xboxone/archive/2013/08/20/cleaning-up-the-world-39-s-largest-zoo-takes-teamwork.aspx</a><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Up to four junior zookeepers can work together to build the largest zoo on the planet and manage an impressive collection of animals.<br />
<br />
If cleaning up Elephant poo gets your motor going then Zoo Tycoon may be the series for you. While the game will require you to dispose of large amount of animal waste, the game is also a serious simulation manager for zoos. Players build their zoos from the
 ground up, adopt new animals, and make sure their visitors remain happy.<br />
<br />
We jumped into a multiplayer game at a pre-Gamescom event in Germany where we got to team up with a few other players and make changes to a sprawling animal habitat. Expanding your zoo is easy and simple; you pick a new habitat from a list and chose where to
 drop it, then the game automatically fills in the trails and auto-generates things like trees and benches for visitors to use. Players can further customize these areas by picking the kinds of plants, pavement, and decorations featured in that zone, but games
 who aren't interested in the fine details don't have to do much work to get a zoo up and running.<br />
<br />
Managing your animals happiness is a big part of the game, which we found out when we explored our Grizzly Bear habitat. Our bear Hubert wasn't enjoying his accommodations, but a breakdown of his needs helped us pinpoint the problems. He was hungry, dirty,
 and lonely, so we bought him a small pool to clean himself in, installed a treat station full of fish, and adopted a baby bear named Thunder for him to play with. Now Hubert is as happy as a clam. The clams, however, are still upset. Looks like we'll have
 our work cut out for us when the game releases on Xbox One and Xbox 360 later this year.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1, slow keyboard</h2>
                    So I just upgraded my Acer W700 to Windows 8.1 and for some reason, typing is&nbsp;pretty much impossible. I can type an entire sentence then I have to wait around 30 seconds for it to input. The device is fast all over but my keyboard is so laggy I don't even
 want to use it. This is with the onscreen touch keyboard by the way. Please help. Thanks. :)

            <p>They usually indicate the backup status of the file using a backup program such as Norton.</p>
<p>There is usually the option to turn it off in the backup programs settings.</p>
<p>Also see <strong>More Help</strong> just under your post.</p>

            <p>HI</p>
<p>As said by Lead3 usually caused by Norton / Norton360 backup..</p>
<p>Try this and see how you go...</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start Norton 360. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <b>Settings</b>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Depending on your situation, do one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To turn on Backup Status Overlays, under Quick Controls, check <b>Backup Status Overlays</b>.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To turn off Backup Status Overlays, under Quick Controls, uncheck <b>Backup Status Overlays</b>.
</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Click <b>Close</b>. </p>
</li></ol>
<p>FYI...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Green icon with a check mark</b> - This status indicates that the file has been backed up, and it changes to blue icon with arrows if you modify the file.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Blue icon with arrows</b> - This status indicates that the file has not been backed up, and it changes to green when Norton 360 automatically backs up the file during idle time.
</p>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>Gray icon with a slash mark</b> - This status indicates that the file has been excluded from backup. Norton 360 displays a disabled backup status on a file when you exclude the file from any of the Backup Sets.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Regards</p>
<p>GT4U</p>
