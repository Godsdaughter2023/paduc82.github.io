            It is a sensor to detect falls, if it detects that the laptop is falling it "safes" the drive until it stops detecting the fall, then reenables it.&nbsp; The objective is to protect the hard disk from damage.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Touchpad won&#39;t work properly after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    After I updated to Windows 10 my touchpad was not working at all, I could not find the cursor. Eventually I found in my settings that my touchpad was disabled. After enabling my touchpad I then found out my touchpad isn't responding to clicks, and if it
 does respond to clicks, its only in certain places on the touchpad. I also cannot right click because of this problem. It is extremely frustrating and almost impossible to do anything. Does anyone have any possible solutions?

<p>My laptop is an Asus Eee PC model number 1101HA. It has Windows 7 Starter Edition installed in it.</p>
<p>I was downloading 3 Asus updates. When it finished downloading, it said i need to restart. So i clicked restart later. And everything disappeared and&nbsp;a blue screen&nbsp;came on&nbsp;for a second and it restarted. It said to put in the boot device but i didn't have
 it at the moment so i just turned it off. when i turned it on again, this message came:</p>
<p>Disk read error has occurred</p>
<p>Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete to restart</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do. The only setup menu which opens is the BIOS SETUP UTILITY. Is there any way I can get it working again without the boot disk, because i dont have an external DVD ROM to use the disc since my laptop doesnt have a disc reader?</p>

<p>You need to download and run the diagnostic program that your disk manufacturer makes available on his home site. If your machine has no CD drive that you can boot from then you will have to remove your hard disk, put it into an external USB case and connect
 it to some other machine to perform the test. If you have limited experience in these things then it would be best to take the machine to a suitable repair shop.<br />

            <p>Hi Hilary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you are in an interesting problem.Well if your problem is regarding hard disc drives,you can download the&nbsp;<strong>minitool partition wizard
</strong>software. After installing the software,open it and right click your slave drive , you will get the options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after you have change the settings,click&nbsp;<strong>apply </strong>on the upper-left side and then wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it works.</p>

            Hello Hilary ,<br />
I'm sorry to say so, but there is a very high chance that you already lost all your data beyond restoration. Most of WD external HDDs have integrated hardware encryption. That should mean that once you remove the HDD from the enclosure you can no longer read
 the information that was stored on it. Usually just inserting the drive back into the enclosure should make the data readable again, but you have already reformatted the drive. That drastically lowers the chances of getting the data back. The only thing that
 I could suggest at the moment is to look for a good data recovery company to try and extract the data for you. I'm sorry. You can check the list of WD data recovery partners here: http://products.wdc.com/support/kb.ashx?id=flwYz4&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope you manage to get your data back.
        </p>

            <p>Don't give up hope.&nbsp; Although TechpumpkinWD sounds like a Western Digital employee, you should consider the following.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In general, you can convert a basic disk to a dynamic disk without losing the data on it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, if you convert a dynamic disk back to a basic disk, you delete all of the volumes and thus lose the data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some third-party disk management utilities, however, claim to be able to convert from dynamic to basic without losing data.&nbsp; See, e.g.,
<a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/resource/change-dynamic-disk-to-basic.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.partition-tool.com/resource/change-dynamic-disk-to-basic.htm</a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know when Western Digital incorporated hardware encryption but it is likely to have been long enough ago that most WD external drives in use today are so equipped.&nbsp; The encryption is carried out by a chip in the enclosure, so if you still have the
 enclosure (and it's still functional), you can probably recover your files.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Normally, when you can see a drive in Disk Management but not in My Computer, all that you need to do is to use Disk Management to assign a drive letter.&nbsp; How does Disk Management describe your drive?&nbsp; You should have one (or possibly more) "simple volumes."&nbsp;
 If no drive letter is assigned, you should be able to right-click and assign a drive letter.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you can assign a drive letter and thus view the drive in My Computer, you'll be able to determine whether or not the contents are encrypted (if you can't access them, they're encrypted).&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If, as is likely, the drive is encrypted and -- I assume -- the WD enclosure won't recognize the dynamic disk, you have two possible options,
<strong>if you have the external enclosure and it isn't damaged</strong>:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Use a tool such as Easeus Partition Master Professional (linked above) to convert the drive back to a basic disk and then put it back in the WD external enclosure.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Go to a professional data recovery company that claims to have expertise in this area, such as
<a href="http://www.datarecoverylink.com/blog/bid/155666/Data-Recovery-of-Encrypted-Western-Digital-drives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.datarecoverylink.com/blog/bid/155666/Data-Recovery-of-Encrypted-Western-Digital-drives</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither option is free, although option 1 is obviously cheaper ... but riskier because you aren't an expert in this field.&nbsp; I should also be clear that I have no information about either the Easeus software or the "Data Recovery Link" company other than
 that revealed by the linked web pages.&nbsp; I can't vouch for either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only you can decide what your data is worth.&nbsp; If I were in your situation, I'd at least talk to some data recovery experts before doing anything further with the drive.&nbsp; The more "experimenting" you do, the more likely it is that you will irretrievably lose
 the data.</p>

            <p>Hi LemP,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as you suggested, I used a third party programme to convert it back to Basic without reformatting, it is now visible from both
<strong>Disk Management</strong> and <strong>My Computer</strong>. Problem now is that the file format is in RAW., and can't be opened in
<strong>File Explorer</strong>. I tried reinserting the HDD into the WD housing (if it is encrypted), but it fails to boot up, as indicated by the housing light. What can I do about this? I really don't want to lose all of my family photos in it, as&nbsp;I did not
 back them up.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I'm late to the party but you should have just used the <strong>Rescan Disks</strong> command on the
<strong>Action</strong> menu of Disk Management tool to remount the disk!&nbsp; This disk utility that you used did not properly understand dynamic disks and the
<a href="http://www.z-a-recovery.com/articles/dynamic-disks.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Logical Disk Mangager database layout</a>.&nbsp; The reporting of the RAW state indicates that the MBR of the disk or volume boot sector is now damaged, (contains inappropriate code) and now the disk is seen as being a basic unformatted disk,&nbsp; believe me, your disk
 is formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.z-a-recovery.com/articles/raw-filesystem.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">"RAW filesystem" message</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>YOU HAVE TO THREAD VERY CAREFULLY FROM HERE ON IF YOU WANT TO INCREASE YOUR CHANCES OF SUCCESSFUL DATA RECOVERY, ANY MISSTEPS COULD MAKE RECOVERY IMPOSSIBLE!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The single most important step at this point is to make a clone (sector by sector copy of the disk) to another disk and
<strong>WORK ON THE CLONE RATHER THAN THE ORIGINAL DISK!</strong>&nbsp; It is most likely that the original disk can be easily recovered but one mistake during the recovery attempt could make recovery impossible.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you use <a href="http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TestDisk</a> for your recovery attempt on the clone, TestDisk is a command driven tool, no user GUI so you will have to do your homework and read the documentation and familiarize yourself with the utility, ask on the<a href="http://forum.cgsecurity.org/phpBB3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 TestDisk forums</a> if you need help with the utility.&nbsp; What some may think that TestDisk lacks without a user GUI is more than made up for by being one of the most powerful disk recovery utility available and it's free!</p>

<h2>            7b BSOD on XP install, after first reboot &#40;but before install is done.&#41;</h2>
                    Where I work, one of our old.. old.. old.. programs requires us to run Windows XP. Getting it on modern hardware doesn't seem like it's going to be very fun, but the machine is a Dell--which seem to play nice--so I'm hopeful. Here's what I've done:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>* Taken SP2, integrated the Intel AHCI and Marvell (RAID Controller) drivers with nlite</div>
<div>* Boot the machine, and started the install. It gets through formatting drive, and copying the Windows dir</div>
<div>* On the first reboot--before it sets up the machine--I get a 7b BSOD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Will integrating the drivers directly with nlite not work? I could swear I've done that before. Or is it that I'm trying to install XP SP2?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Not sure about the chipset, but the computer has an i7 processor.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The marvell controller I'm using is from NewEgg:</div>

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes with a debugger.<br />
<br />
Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?<br />
<br />
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:<br />

<br />
If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop<br />
<br />
Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

<p>Sending an "unsubscribe" request to a spammer only lets the spammer know they have a "live" email. I'm not really sure what you mean by "attacked" but if your search function has become hijacked than your computer is infected.</p>
<p>Go through these general malware removal steps systematically:<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a></p>
<p>If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops
 are skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.</p>

Surely they installed software on your computer to have their search toolbar as your main search. Try to remove it from the Add/Remove programs and run through these cleaning steps:<br />
<br />
Click start &gt;&gt; Control Panel &gt;&gt; Double Click Network and Internet<br />
Connections &gt;&gt; Double click Internet Options, on the IE Properties window<br />
you will see these Options:<br />
General | Security | Privacy | Content | Connections | Programs<br />
| Advanced .<br />
<br />
Click on General Tab (1st Tab on the left) and you will see a Button called<br />
[ Clear History ..] click on it to clear your History caches, then click on<br />
[Delete Files..] to delete Internet Files created over the time, click on [<br />
Delete Cookies...] to delete your cookies left by visiting websites.<br />
<br />
= Then try to Disable the Add-Ons on your Browser somehow installed on your<br />
browser, On how to disable the Add-ons follow this:<br />
Click on Programs Tab and then click the Manage Add-Ons Button there Disable<br />
the None/Not Verified Plug-ins/Add-ons ( you need to Renable them one-by-one<br />
later and see which is the culprit or you can send them here in your next<br />
post) and click [OK] to confirm your Changes.<br />

<br />
Click on Advanced Tab and scroll down under the browsing option and uncheck<br />
this box:<br />

<p>It seems that you have associated your "C" drives Files Folders with another Programs Extensions being .pdb.</p>

<p>You could try&nbsp; going to the Control Panel &gt; select Folder Options and in the General Tab select Restore Defaults then Apply and OK.</p>
<p>This can be done for the View and Search Tabs as well.</p>
<p>Not sure if this will do the trick.</p>

<p>Are you doing any sort of software development and/or debugging?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because there are so many folders, your screenshot can't show the entire contents of C:\.&nbsp; Folders are typically shown first in a Windows Explorer window arranged alphabetically.&nbsp; Scroll through all of these and see if the "normal" contents of your C:\ drive
 are still there at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found too much information about the folders you're seeing, but this may have been the result of running some debugging routine on your C:\Windows\System32 folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click on a few of these *.pdb items, select "Properties," and include a representative screenshot of the "General" tab.<br />
</p>
<p>Open a few of these folders and report what you see there.</p>

<p>No, I'm not a software developer in any way.&nbsp; I process a few photos and use the internet mainly for mundane things like Youtube, Facebook and usual net surfing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 100s of these pdb files all in alphabetical order.&nbsp; I've scrolled through them and the 'program' files or the 'program x86 aren't there.&nbsp; I've attached the tail end of the list.&nbsp; Hope you can make some sense of it.</p>

A bugcheck (BSOD) is a mechanism to protect your PC from damage.<br />
<br />
It is also helpful to take a look at the dumps with the Debugging Tools for Windows.<br />
<br />
Please start the Windows Explorer and go to the folder C:\Windows\Minidump. Next, copy the dmp files to your desktop, zip all dmp into 1 zip file and upload the zip file to your Skydrive [1] and post a link here, so that I can look at the dumps with the debugger
 and to to see the cause of the crash.<br />

<p>the hotfix fixes a different issue:</p>
<p>0x000000FE (00000008, 0000000<strong>4</strong></p>
<p><strong>not</strong> 0x000000FE (00000008, 0000000<strong>6</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>Disable the power saving option of the USB Hub. Does it help?</p>

            The same thing happened to me.&nbsp; In addition, most of my USB ports would not work.&nbsp; Finally, when going in to my Device Manager, I would get one of the yellow exclamation marks next to "PCI Input Device" indicating that there was a missing driver.&nbsp; After
 trying virtually every other fix mentioned (i.e. virus scan, system file scan, updating drivers, restore points, etc) I finally found the solution.&nbsp; Since the only "PCI Input Device" on my system was a game port on my Sound Blaster Audigy card I took out the
 Audigy card (and used the motherboard sound chip).&nbsp; All of the problems went away.&nbsp; So either something in the sound card failed or a Windows 7 update conflicted with the sound card.&nbsp; Either way, when I removed the Audigy sound card from my system, the problem
 went away.

    <title>Is there a Windows 10 app for viewing my video folders&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kensympson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a Windows 10 app for viewing my video folders&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;As I was playing around checking features, I found a display of each subfolder in the My Videos folder. The icon for each subfolder appeared as a frame from one of the videos in the folder. When I clicked on
 the frame the folder contents would be displayed, with each video file represented as a frame from that video. When I clicked on the frame for the video file, the video would play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was not the standard representation for files as shown by Windows File Explorer. It was simpler (single-click instead of double-click to play a video), cleaner (non-video files, such as .THM files are not shown, for example), easier to recognize the
 video content from the frame. Since I was just wandering quickly around through the Windows 10 features, I now do not know how to find this feature again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me here?</p>

<h3> mathieuvanp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t change password to log in windows or add pin</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hoped the Creative update would resolve this but it didn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a year ago a surface pro 4. Made by Microsoft for windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quite fast my pin stopped working so I deleted it, which also deleted my facial recognition... However, at that time I didn't bother to much. However, now we are one year later and it's still not resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Surface Pro 4</p>
<p>logged in with Microsoft (Hotmail) account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First , I can't change Password:</p>
<p>Can't 'change' password, when I click on that button in sign-in options the little window appears but shows "something went wrong" (see attached image).</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1de3bf53-376d-458f-9758-1cb938f251e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1de3bf53-376d-458f-9758-1cb938f251e7" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly I can't change Pin:</p>
<p>When I click on the 'add pin" button, <strong>nothing happens.</strong>it just does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my password of my Hotmail account but now, this did not affect the log in password for my surface which does not make sense since it's the same Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please Microsoft, how can I finnaly install a pin and change password of my Surface?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please don't answer with a bot and read my questions. I do not need the link for "can't log in with pin" because I don't have one.</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>PowerShell</strong></span> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li><span>When Powershell is open, hover your mouse on the taskbar and right-click on the PowerShell icon. Then click on
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Copy and paste the following Powershell script:</span>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong>.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>Wait for PowerShell to execute the script.<span> Once done, restart your computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>

<h2>            Treated vary bad by customer support&#47; xbox repair problems</h2>
                    

<p>Srx: 1177764774ID</p>


<p>To whom this may concern:</p>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>&nbsp;I have been a loyal Xbox customer since there inception into gaming. I have been vary lucky that during my time I have not had to be introduced to the Xbox world of customer service. That changed over a month ago, when my power supply for my 6 month old
 Xbox 360 slim apparently went bad. I phoned into Xbox support, and started down what would be a long a frustrating road. I was a told that it had to be the power supply, that it would be a one in a million chance that it could be the counsel. My first frustration
 was that I had to pay for my broken product that was still under factory warranty to be shipped. I had several conversations with customer service over the last month, voicing my frustrations with the repair process. I received my email from ups stating that
 my damaged power supply had reached Texas. I gave it a week before I finally took more time out of my life to call in and inquire about the status of my replacement. After some time I was informed that Xbox had yet to receive my product, I strongly disagreed
 with the agent. She was then able to inform me that they did in fact have it and apologized for miss-placing it. I was informed that loosing damaged items was not the norm, and was referred to the super duper Xbox customer support team.</p>

<p>Alex:</p>

<p>This is where the story really gets good. I was then contacted by ALEX from the super duper Xbox Customer Advocacy and Exceptions Management Team. He offered several things to appease me for the extra time the error would further delay my replacement. I
 explained to Alex that the appropriate thing would have been to expedite the power supply shipment to me which was not done. I also explained that if it was indeed my Xbox that was the problem that I would expect a much faster resolution then waiting for it
 to be repaired.</p>

<p>The power supply arrives:</p>

<p>Eleven days later my power supply arrived at my home, and wouldn’t you know it the same problem. I called in and was told to ship in my Xbox. I then requested that Alex call me, and also emailed him. Shortly after this conversation I phoned back in and spoke
 to a supervisor. I was told that Alex would defiantly call me back shortly. I was also made to understand that I could still send in my Xbox without fear of making any kind of mistake in regards to the speed in which a remedy could be rendered. I sent in the
 Xbox, and was never contacted via phone or email by Alex. Alex did get around to calling me the next day, I informed him of all that had happened.</p>

<p>Negative Phone Conversation with Alex:</p>

<p>During this phone conversation Alex was extremely disrespectful, Rude, un-helpful, and showed zero will to understand. In no way did Alex attempt, in any fashion to aid me in any way regarding my concerns about my Xbox‘s repair and delays. He also showed
 no remorse or qualms with my growing feeling of disapproval regarding the way he was speaking to me.</p>

<p>What the Xbox means to my family:</p>

<p>I attempted to explain to Alex what exactly the Xbox means to me and my family, and the circumstances that surround the deep need for a resolution. These ranged from, my son reviving new presents for his birthday that required the Xbox. Also the fact that
 my son had been saving up for a new game (that has come out since the Xbox’s untimely demise) for over 6 months. Due to my physical limitations that I acquired while serving my country, the Xbox is more of a medical tool for me then it is just entertainment.
 I suffer form countless conditions that greatly effect my quality of life. The Xbox offers me a small escape during the sleep less nights, pain , and stress. Not to mention the ways the kinect sensor aids in the activities I can participate with my children.
 I in no way expect special treatment for being a disabled veteran. I do however expect a customer service representative that is responsible for customer advocacy to not openly disrespect customers, talk down to them, and minimize the excellent products this
 company makes.</p>

<p>Email with Alex:</p>

<p>In my last email to Alex I stated that “I believe Mr. Bill Gates would undoubtedly love the fact a wounded warrior receives such benefits from his Xbox. I went on to say that it was my belief that he should look in to hiring employees that share his vigor
 for his products. Alex does not understand the significance of this product to the customer. I received far better customer support from the initial support lever provided by Xbox. There I encountered countless men and women who understood or attempted to
 understand the stress, and frustration I was feeling. Alex made it vary clear that this level of support had no power and that on several occasions I was wrong to listen to supervisors advice. On this matter I explained to Alex that, as a customer you speak
 to a supervisor, and he tells you that you can safely send in your device. When eventfully contacted by Alex, to be told that you should not have followed that supervisors instructions, is vary frustrating. I compare this to a child asking his mother for advice,
 only to find out dad feels differently. In this instance this miscommunication is not the Childs, but the parents fault. Both the supervisor, and Alex are paid by Microsoft to aid customers, I don’t feel that I should punished because I did what I was told.
 Especially when I informed Alex that if indeed the original problem was the Xbox itself that I would expect a replacement.</p>

<p>Alex the untouchable:</p>

<p>During our unfortunate phone conversation, I made it vary clear to Alex that I did not appreciate the way he scoffed/snickered at the fact that I was a veteran that used the Xbox for medical purposes. I also made it clear that I did not appreciate the fact
 that he mocked my need to have an Xbox. I also made it vary clear that I wonted his supervisor, and after he stated that he did not have one, that he was it, that he was all I could get. I requested to no longer do business with him. During my 29 years on
 this earth I have never been disrespected on such a personal level. To have my time, and injuries I received in the military result in a snicker by a customer service rep, was unacceptable. To be told thanks for the ten years as a customer, sorry you don’t
 like what I have to say deal with it, and no you can not complain about me, is also unacceptable.</p>

<p>Where I stand know:</p>

<p>As I understand I am currently waiting for my Xbox to be repaired.</p>

<p>What I felt/ and still feel:</p>

<p>It is and has always been my feeling that accidents happen, mistakes will be made. My original problem (the power supply) was misdiagnosed, then lost for over a week. It is my understanding that the error my Xbox had is a extremely rare issue. So rare that
 just to start a repair process the agent informed me she had to lie to the computer to allow her to accept my device. Due to these fact’s compelled with what I feel make my case different.</p>

<p>I feel and always felt that a extreme conclusion had to me made, to accommodate the unusual circumstances that have plagued my repair process. I understand that I ideally should have not sent in my Xbox as instructed by customer service, and waited for Alex
 to call. Even though I was assured it was ok to do and that Alex would call me that day, not the next. I do not feel, and I do not believe that there is no remedy in this case other then to make the customer wait for a repair. This repair will eventfully put
 me over two months without my Xbox, this outcome is unacceptable.</p>

<p>What I feel is fare:</p>

<p>All I know is that this company has procedures that have to be followed. All though I do not like these procedures, I can respect them. At some point things happen that procedures can not anticipate. This is one of those instances. I am sure that Microsoft
 does not intend for my experience to happen, or for a customer to be disrespected. At this point I am waiting, and I am unsatisfied with your service rep (Alex) and with the flawed and error filled repair process I have experienced. It is my deepest hope that
 whomever reads this also feels that a grave injustice has been done as I do. It is my hope that somebody above Alex, attempt to make him understand the deep level of anger he has caused me, and show him how to better serve your customer. As I sit here I have
 requested In writing not to be contacted by him again. I have a scheduled time to be contacted by his office today 6/25/2012. It is my belief that it will be Alex again, due to his insistence that he was all the help I would receive, and that he would not
 allow me to speak to any one else but him. I will continue to ask that I not wait for my Xbox to be repaired. Rather that on this Wednesday 6/28/2012 when my device is scheduled to be delivered to the repair center or even sooner, that a new Xbox be shipped
 out to me ASAP by whatever means possible. It is my feeling that not only shipping me a new Xbox by the fastest shipping possible, but also to upgrade the replacement Xbox would be appropriate for the way I have been treated.</p>

<p>My fear:</p>

<p>For ten years I have been a loyal customer to this company. I have never had to use your customer service department, but from what I know of it I fear the worst will happen. I don’t think my daily efforts to educate Alex or escape his handle on my case
 will happen. Short of this letter reaching someone who can make a difference in the ongoing treatment I am receiving. Most likely Alex will continue to make me wait for my Xbox to be repaired. All though he has stated he will expedite the shipping back to
 me after the repair. Which is generous but does nothing to make up for all that has been done wrong. I wish that due to the way I have been treated that I could no longer be a supporter of this company. That would cause me great finale loss, and I don’t wont
 to switch to Sony. I hope someone can alter the course of this ongoing repair and grievance towards Alex. Thank you for your time and consideration on this matter.</p>

<p>Sincerely</p>

            <p>I'm truly sorry to hear of your bad dealings with support. &nbsp;I can't say as I know how you feel as I live in Canada and have never had an experience like this in my dealings with support here.<br /><br /></p>
<p>What I would suggest, and I know that you don't want to hear it, is to call up support again and ask to speak directly with a supervisor. &nbsp;Be sure to give them all the details you did here along with any reference numbers you may have so they can track this person down.<br /><br /></p>
<p>You've also got the option of contacting a separate branch of support on Twitter - @xboxsupport to see if they know what's going on with the console.<br /><br /></p>
<p>A final option may be to send a pm to one of the Misters/Miss that frequent the forums here. &nbsp;They work for Xbox and may be able to help expedite your issue.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Mister Gwyther, Mister Fitzer, Mister Barakus, Miss Kleo are just a few. &nbsp;You can send a pm to any one of them by clicking on the envelope icon under a post and adding their name.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding, but that was the worst part of it this guy was the supervisor. He was apparently as high as I can go. When I stated that I wasn't pleased with him and I wonted a supervisor he refused. He said that he didn't have one, and that he was
 as good as I would get. &nbsp;Everyone below him has been great, but this guy is in control of my fate.

            <p>In other words, he doesn't want to get in trouble. &nbsp;Unless you're the CEO of a company, you have a supervisor. &nbsp;As I said, try posting about this either to support on twitter or pm one of the Misters/Miss to see what they say about it.</p>
<p>They do work for xbox and not support so they can get to the bottom of this quite quickly.<br /><br />I did pm Mister Fitzer for you.&nbsp; You should receive a message from him soon.</p>

<h2>            Frequent x0116 BSOD Video_TDR_Error with nvlddmkm.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hello, This is my first time posting here, so please excuse me if I forget to do something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting frequent BSODs in Windows 7 Ultimate edition. These problems started about 2 weeks ago. I have searched the issue on the internet, and tried as many of the troubleshooting steps as I could. I have a two month old GTX 970 video card, and it was
 running fine before the crashes started. I get the crash when I'm playing games, or (much rarer) at the desktop. Some programs seem to trigger crashes more frequently: Skype, Visio, and firefox. I mostly get crashes when I have 2 windows snapped, but not always.
 When the crash happens, my monitor says that no video is detected and goes into standby mode, and the BSOD pops up before the monitor can restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my system specs:</p>
<p>Motherboard: ASUS p8p67 Deluxe</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i5-2500k @ 3.5 GHZ (I originally had it at 4.2Ghz, and it would run stable for hours and hours of gaming. I lowered the overclock after about a week of these crashes to try to fix the crashes)</p>
<p>GPU: Gigabyte G1 GTX 970 (not overclock)</p>
<p>RAM: 8GB (2 x 4GB) G.SKILL Ripjaws X @ 1600</p>
<p>Power Supply: Raidmax 630W</p>
<p>Hard Drives: Samsung 850 256gb (used as boot harddrive), Seagate Barricuda 1TB, Sandisk 128gb SSD</p>
<p>I have check for the most recent drivers for those, as well as other devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at temperatures, even while under heavy load, the CPU rarely gets above 65C and the GPU never gets above 55C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling the video drivers in safe mode (awlays using Display Driver Uninstall), installing older drivers, lowering my card's factory overclock, turning off windows transparency, and more. I have updated all of my drivers (I believe). I
 have submitted a help ticket to Gigabyte, but I have not received a response yet. I have changed program settings, ran MEMTEST86 and FurMark, used SFC and DKSCHK and tried to repair windows using a .ISO on a flash drive. I was able to run FurMark once with
 no errors, and a few days later I ran it again and got the BSOD, although I believe that was a coincidence, as I ran it again later for 10+minutes with no crashes, and the GPU temp never going above 70C. I do not want to fully reinstall Windows because I have
 valuable data and programs I need for school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran SFC, I got the message "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some (or all) of them"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have driver verifier on and running (for about 5 hours, since earlier today), and I noticed that for my most recent BSOD that I could not locate a dump file for it. My monitor went into standby so I could not see if the BSOD code was any different.
 I have not turned it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used WhoCrashed, BlueScreenViewer, and Windbg to analyze my dump files, and they all point to nvlddmkm.sys as the culprit. I am fairly knowledgeable with computers, but I want someone else to look over my issue, in case I missed something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=A5F7E8FE65B71A3E%21125</p>
<p>Here is the .rar contaning memory.dmp, the most recent dump from C:\Windows\minidumps, my msinfo32.info file, and my CBS.log. Please let me know if I should run other tests or upload more information. Thank you very much for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: If there is an unknown device, it is my Bluetooth Controller. I had uninstalled and disabled it (since I don't use bluetooth), and recently re-enabled it to see if maybe that was causing the faults. I have updated the drivers for it.</p>

            After disabling driver verifier (I had only that 1 crash with it on), I restarted my computer and was playing World Of Warcraft, when my screen goes black and the sound locks up (as always happens with the 0x116 BSOD). Except this time my computer didn't
 restart itself. I pressed the power button, which did nothing. After waiting a few minutes, I had to hold down the power button to force shutoff my PC. There was no disk activity when I shut it off, and no dump file was created.<br />

            <p>Hi Shivam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. Here is the additional information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.The error code I get is 0x00000116. I cannot see the actual BSOD screen because my monitor resets and the video card doesn't send any video.</p>
<p>2. I'm not quite sure what you mean by "recent changes". I downloaded and setup AdventureWorks2012 for SQL Server the day before the crashes started, and I might've updated my video card drivers to the most recent version around that time (I can't remember
 if I updated before or after the BSODs started happening).</p>
<p>3. The last hardware change I made was installing my new video card (the GTX 970) about a month before the crashes started.</p>
<p>4. This computer is a custom build that I made a little less than 3 years ago.</p>
<p>5. I had Malwarebytes free edition and Webroot SecureAnywhere premium installed before the crashes. I uninstalled both to see if that helped, but when I still got crashes, I reinstalled only Webroot.</p>
        </p>

            <p>I am still crashing in a Clean Boot state. I unstinstalled and reinstalled the graphics drivers in the clean boot state, using Display Driver Uninstaller to remove the drivers. Strangely, my system stopped writing crash dumps for the past few crashes, which
 I believe is related to when I reset the paging file. In the Virtual Memory settings, it says that my C:\ is custom set to 8000 - 16000MB, while my F:\ and G:\ drive are system managed, and my computer has a total of 22GB of virtual memory, while the recommended
 amount is 11GB. I also checked the system Startup and Recovery settings, and under System Failure, "write an event to the system log" is checked. Because there is no crash dump, and the screen resets, I cannot see what error code I'm getting when the system
 crashes, but I assume it is the same error I have been getting before.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: After crashing again today, I now get dump files again. The crash was the same 0x00000116 error</p>

            I'm not sure exactly what specific solution it was, but I am getting the errors less and less frequently. Now, I will have my computer restart within about 10 minutes of the first time I boot it up for the day, and then no more (I shut down my computer
 each night and turn it back on in the morning). When my computer restarts,&nbsp; I cannot see the screen, and no dump file is created. When the computer boots back up, everything runs fine. I did install the new nvidia drivers, using Display Driver Uninstaller
 in safe mode to remove the old drivers.<br />
<br />
After doing the <span><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/resolving-stop-blue-screen-errors-in-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">“Resolving Blue Screen errors in Windows”</span></a></span></strong></span>,
 I did not have a restore point that was from before the crashes. I did everything else though. The Action Center said no solutions were available. Windows update had some failed updates from&nbsp; 8 months ago (way before I ran into any errors), and no new updates
 to install. I ran ChkDsk on all 3 of my harddrives, and it found and fixed errors on two of them. The memory Diagnostic found no errors. SFC /scannow found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Should&nbsp; I attatch the CBS .log?

            I swapped out the graphics card with an old one I had (MSI 660ti Power Edition), and have had no problems, even after I changed all of my settings back to normal and did things that would usually crash the old card (turned window transparency back on,
 run multiple windows snapped together, turned up graphic settings in games). I submitted an RMA request for the card through Gigabyte's website<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since SFC /scannow found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them, I would suggest you to run Startup repair of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair can detect and fix certain types of system problems that might prevent Windows from starting, such as missing or damaged system files. For more information, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/startup-repair-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Startup Repair is designed to start automatically if certain system problems are detected, but you can also run the tool manually.</p>
<div>
To run Startup Repair using preinstalled recovery options
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Do one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows
 logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span><strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong></span> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight
<span><strong>Repair your computer</strong></span>, and then press <strong>
Enter</strong>. (If <span>Repair your computer</span> isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator has turned them off.)
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select a keyboard layout, and then click <span><strong>Next</strong></span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p>On the <span><strong>System Recovery Options</strong></span> menu, click
<span><strong>Startup Repair</strong></span>, and then follow the instructions.
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            It has been about 2 weeks since I swapped out my new card for my old one, and I haven't had any issues. I did not do the Startup Repair because I hadn't had issues. Since the issues were fixed, I suspect that the fault was in the video card hardware. If
 the problems happen when I get my replacement card, then I will try the Startup Repair.<br />
