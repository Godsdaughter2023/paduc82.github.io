<h2>            I&#39;m having trouble updating to Windows 10.</h2>
                    I have just decided to update to Windows 10. I hadn't used my tablet in about a month when I decided. When I went to use the app found on the task bar to reserve my update, it wasn't there, so I&nbsp;downloaded the updates that had come out during the time
 I wasn't using my tablet. That didn't work, so I used the troubleshooting tips here on&nbsp;this website. I used the command prompt and from what I gathered I had all the necessary updates. I currently have Windows&nbsp;8.1 and&nbsp;there were no other issues that I could
 find.&nbsp;Any other suggestions?

<h2>            usb&#47;battery question</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought the 4gb xbox Kinect.&nbsp; What are my best options for adding more space for game saves, etc....external drive or usb stick?</p>
<p>My son and I are not hardcore gamers so what would be a safe amount of gigs to get for it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, is it a good idea to buy the charge and play kit and forget about the disposable batteries?&nbsp; I have regular rechargeable batteries at home, but I don't know which would get drained faster realistically.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>If you are not interested in playing game demos or downloading most things off the Xbox LIVE marketplace than just use a USB stick to save everything or use the internal 4gb memory. If you plan on downloading Xbox LIVE arcade games or games on demand I recommend
 getting a hard drive.</p>
<p>Play and charge kit works well other than the battery not lasting that long before it needs its next charge. Regular batteries last longer but its a pain having to make sure you have some for your controller.</p>

You are only able to use a maximum of 16Gb per USB device anyway. &nbsp;You can have a maximum of 2 USB sticks for a total of 32Gb, that will be more than enough for you. &nbsp;Get one USB stick, and if you fill that, simply get another.</span></p>

<h2>            No Microsoft Store &#61;&#61; No support &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Looking at a lot of posts here it seems like if you can take a faulty product to a Microsoft store there is a good chance a competent and empowered employee will replace or resolve the problem immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If however you live in a country that only has one store that is 10hrs away in another state you are out of luck. The word "support" seems to be applied as more of a comical oxymoron for those of us who have to call the 13 number or access on line help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have 2 "escalated" cases for faulty Surface Pro's. The longest running one has been going for over a month. One agent I spoke to recently told me that my case had never been escalated despite 3 or 4 emails from multiple other agents advising
 me that the case was escalated. He told me that I had been lied to! The other case is for a DOA surface that has been waiting 2 weeks for Microsoft to send a return shipping label! This was purchased from Microsoft Store online so they own the entire supply
 chain. I also paid for expedited shipping because I needed the laptop in a hurry, but I can't get a replacement for over 4 weeks!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other joy I have is no matter what series of button presses I try when contacting support they advise me that I have called the wrong number, then they give me the number I have called!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me there is something I am doing wrong and that Microsoft are actually able to provide support for their hardware??</p>
<p>

            <p>Just got my first update on the Dead On Arrival Surface pro 4 ordered from the Microsoft store with expedited shipping - 2 weeks later. Here is the output of 2 weeks of Microsoft's hard work!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that according to Microsoft once they receive the faulty surface back (which they don't ship priority) they still need another 2-3 weeks to "process" the return. So over a month to return/replace a faulty product. Keep that in mind when making
 your purchase decisions..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Quoting Microsoft support via email 16/5/16</p>
<p>
Were still waiting for the update from our back end team regarding with the return shipping label. I apologized for the inconvenience.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Should you have any further question please do not hesitate to contact us either by replying to this email or by calling us on 800-267-785.<br />
Thank you for your interest in our products.<br />

            <p>Here we are just over 1 week on. I have managed to get a return shipping label for one of my broken surface pro's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though I paid for overnight shipping when I purchased this, the return shipping is not express and seems to be the cheapest tracked option available.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was required to deliver the surface to the post office (no pick up, again despite paying for express door to door), the post office advised that no additional packaging (not even a satchel) &nbsp;was paid for by Microsoft so they could either send it as is
 (in the retail box) or I could pay for additional packaging.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My remaining broken surface is with an "Escalation Analyst" from the "Microsoft Global Escalation Services" department. This department is clearly having the same difficulty generating a shipping label as the last email I received from them was on the 18th
 of May assuring me that&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;A shipping return label is being created and will be sent to you soon allowing you to ship the device."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone tell me who can I escalate to beyond the incompetence of the first 10 ranks of Microsoft "support" ? There is simply no way I can continue to deploy or support the deployment of these products in our environment, they are at best a consumer toy
 with no support.</p>

            <p>I think the problem is that you went through support for a replacement. Next time I'd advise returning the DOA unit for a full refund to where you bought it from, and ordering a brand new replacement. Also be sure to order your surface from a reputable vendor
 with a reasonable return policy (Costco in the US is great! 90 days no questions asked). Unfortunately, by going through Microsoft support, they'll probably just send a refurb that was returned to them for one of the conditions you are currently troubleshooting
 for on the other devices. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Dell Business now stocks the Surface in some territories and back them up with Dell Business support, so if you've had good luck with Dell Business support in the past, you might consider ordering your products from there rather than MS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately in both of these cases the surfaces were purchased from Microsoft directly under the assumption that this would result in a superior level of service and support. As has been demonstrated the opposite is true.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>You are absolutely right that if I had simply purchased via a bricks and mortar retail store I could have returned directly with no problems (I now really wish I had done that). This would have covered the DOA purchases but still wouldn't cover me for the
 ones that die 6 months in (which is the current outstanding case).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting to know Dell are stocking them, have always had good results from their service and support (although the products were often uninspiring!)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>So 5 days ago I received an email from Jorbie K who seems to have taken over from my previous "Escalation Analyst" Ameet. Jorbie has reassured me that</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span>This is Jorbie with Microsoft Global Escalation Services. I am contacting you today to inform you I will be taking ownership of your case."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It would appear that was Jorbie's last known words. Microsoft I am not sure what department I need to report a missing person to, but you should alert your internal CSI team that Jorbie is missing and I fear the worst. The only logical conclusion is that
 something terrible has happened to Jorbie.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not certain if this level of incompetence can be achieved naturally, is someone orchestrating "support" to maximise pain and suffering? Have you accidentally outsourced support to a competitor who really want's you to lose customers?</p>

<h2>            free on-line games load but won&#39;t play or seem to be invisible</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have a new computer (Acer) with windows &amp; professional used for home use only. The free on-line games such as text twist, t t2 and bejewelled all worked great up until a week ago. Now everything seems to start as usual, the ads run, the game seems to
 get ready to start and then everything shows up except for the game itself. It is as if the game is there but I just cannot see it. If I close the game it says 0 points and play again option appears but if I select it the same thing happens. I am not at all
 computer literate so exploring fixes is not easy for me. I did system maintenance and compatibility tasks but the computer says there is no issues and everything is up to date. I really do not understand this at all. Please help. This system is only a month
 old. The java is 32 bit and I seem to think that I saw something about 64bit somewhere but I am unsure of that as well????

<h2>            Ark Survival Evolved To Get Split Screen For Online and Local Coop</h2>
                    
<p>Though a Preview Title this game still moves from strength to strength.</p>
<p>The upcoming v731.0 patch will bring you couch coop for both online play or local private coop.</p>
<p><a href="http://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/1468-xbox-patch-notes-current-v7300-and-upcoming-v7310/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://survivetheark.com/index.php?/forums/topic/1468-xbox-patch-notes-current-v7300-and-upcoming-v7310/</a></p>
<p>Start in your underpants and survive on a tropical island inhabited by dinosaurs, mammoths, sabre toothed tigers, giant birds and more.</p>
<p>Scavenge food and water because if you don't eat and drink you'll die.</p>

<p>Thanks for the heads up. I've been waiting for this update. I've played the PvE and pvp servers, had fun and frustration on both; but playing offline with a friend (gf/bf) or whoever, having the ability to scale the ratios on taming speed, harvest amount,
 etc AND the ability to pause :) it's now a game that casual players can enjoy. No more rushing to the bathroom and back should something attack while you're on the can.</p>

            I had the same problem, that's what worked for me:
<div><br />
<div>My mistake: Trying to deny access to all the users a part from administrators i had checked the box "Users" and deny all access.&nbsp;</div>
<div>But I foud out that teven being the administrator, I am also considered a "user", so even if the administrator has full rights, if he's also included on the users list he wont be able to access anything.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Similar mistake can be made by checking "Everyone" when setting the rights.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Solution: just go to the properties of your folder and allow full access to "Everyone" and &nbsp;also to "Users". I hope it helps.</div>
<div><br />

<p>It does not matter which administrator account you use.</p>
<p>An inability to access a file after seizing ownership is often cause by file encryption. Right-click the file or folder, click Properties, then Advanced to find out.</p>

    <title>Server Error &#47; in Application when attempting to purchase - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Server Error &#47; in Application when attempting to purchase backwards compatible games in Microsoft Store</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I changed my Microsoft account from child to adult by un-adding then re-adding to the family as an adult account. I did this because I am over 18 but still wasn't allowed to purchase any backwards compatible games from the Xbox One Microsoft store.
 Since then, any time I attempt to purchase a backwards compatible game, I get a pop up error message:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19fce389-792b-473e-9b5f-eea8fdd60222?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/19fce389-792b-473e-9b5f-eea8fdd60222?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Once I encountered this issue, I attempted to purchase the game through the Microsoft store on my computer only to receive the same error message (This screenshot is from my computer but is identical to the one on my Xbox One). My friends have confirmed
 for me that they do not have this issue when attempting to purchase games like this. I don't often purchase backwards compatible games and could have a friend purchase them for me through game share instead, but it is an inconvenience and I would like to have
 the system operating properly instead of having to move around issues that shouldn't be there. Is there any way to help this?</p>

    <title>UNABLE TO ACCESS HTTPS SITE AFTER WINDOWS UPDATE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dab2020  say:</h3>
<h2>            UNABLE TO ACCESS HTTPS SITE AFTER WINDOWS UPDATE</h2>
                    <p>About three weeks ago my Windows 10 professional ran some major updates. After that I am unable to access https://0.0.341.0. The only number that is true here is 341, the rest I replaced with 0. However, I am able to reach .250 subnet on the same network.
 I have checked the SSL and TLS options in the advanced option of the internet explorer and they are checked. Regardless of which browser I used I am unable to connect. The message from Edge browser is: can't connect securely to this page site uses outdated
 or unsafe TLS security setting, your TLS security settings aren't set to its default. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are multiple possible reasons why you are unable to access HTTP sites after the Windows update, from incorrect timezone to unregistered DLL files. To assist you with your concern, let us try to perform these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Make sure that the Timezone is set properly. To do this, go to <strong>Settings</strong>
<strong>&gt; </strong><strong>Time &amp; Language</strong> &gt; <strong>Date &amp; Time</strong>, then click on the
<strong>Time zone</strong> drop-down and choose the correct option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Flush the DNS cache by launching the <strong>Command Prompt window as an administrator</strong> and type
<strong>ipconfig /flushdns</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Re-register the following dll files. To do this, pull up <strong>Run</strong> by pressing the
<strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>R </strong>key, copy and paste the following one by one and press and
<strong>Enter</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>regsvr32 urlmon.dll</li><li>regsvr32 wintrust.dll</li><li>regsvr32 initpki.dll</li><li>regsvr32 dssenh.dll</li><li>regsvr32 rsaenh.dll</li><li>regsvr32 gpkcsp.dll</li><li>regsvr32 sccbase.dll</li><li>regsvr32 slbcsp.dll</li><li>regsvr32 cryptdlg.dll</li><li>regsvr32 shdocvw.dll</li><li>regsvr32 mshtml.dll</li><li>regsvr32 browseui.dll</li><li>regsvr32 jscript.dll</li><li>regsvr32 vbscript.dll</li><li>regsvr32 oleaut32.dll</li><li>regsvr32 softpub.dll</li><li>regsvr32 urlmon.dll</li><li>regsvr32 actxprxy.dll</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Reboot computer if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p>

            The clock and the Time Zones are correct. I flushed DNS, and then re-registered all the .DLLs. I rebooted the computer and the issue persist. Coincidentally, my Surface Pro ran a huge update this morning and after that I am experiencing the same symptom.
 Prior to this morning I was able to access Https://0.0.241.0. So it is now clear to me that Windows update broke something. How do I roll back the updates?

<p>I had a Microsoft Support person remote into my computer and for 2 hours he couldn't fix the issue and he gave up. Coincidentally, my Microsoft Surface which has been working fine ran a Windows 10 update last week and right after that update it started happening
 on my Surface. This is clearly a Windows 10 updates. The good thing is that I was able to revert the update on the Surface but not on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to revert the Windows 10 Fall creator update but can't find a way to do it. When I go to the recovery, I don't have "Go back to the previous version of windows 10" . I get the following options:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Keep my files</strong></p>
<p>Removes apps, and settings but keep your personal files</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Remove everything</strong></p>
<p>Remove all of your personal files, apps, and settings.</p>

<div>there is a reply that states:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"I have music in my Synology Diskstation NAS showing up fine in my windows 7 and</div>
<div>windows 8 music Library and I haven't noticed any issues (yet). Make sure you</div>
<div>enable indexing on the synology shared folder. In the diskstation software,</div>
<div>click on control panel &gt; Shared Folder &gt; then highlight the music folder and</div>
<div>click edit. click on the file indexing tab and make sure the enable file</div>
<div>indexing box is checked. You should be able to add the music folder to your</div>
<div>music library in windows without issue (in my case I added it via the ZUNE</div>
<div>control panel)."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't know if the above will work for you or not. Linux shares can't be</div>
<div>indexed by Windows and THAT is the issue. You might post in that forum as well. </div>

            <p>I tried re-indexing the NAS and also updating the NAS software. The surface still doesn't pick it up through the music app. Still saying can't be added because it can't be indexed. I tried the simple flac player app as well. Was able to get it to see a file
 but not play it. I can navigate to the drive through explorer and click on the music files but nothing happens. What gets me is that my xbox 360 can see my drive, play the music, build play lists (but can't save them) through the system music player (not the
 xbox music app) without any effort on my part to make it work. It just works. And my fancy new Surface can't match that 5 plus year old piece of MS hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm also bummed there's no Synology music app, which would solve my problem entirely (I use this on my Android devices with no problems). Swear I looked at a Windows phone in the store and was able to find DSAudio for the phone. Apparently not available
 for Windows 8.1.</p>

I'm finding the same issue with my ReadyNAS's (both NV+ and 104). &nbsp; I would have thought there would have been a transparent windows app functionality included in the Windows OS for this and not an issue with hardware (NAS) that follow the transfer protocols.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I want to browse with my phone 8 and can, but not my surface 2. I want the Windows Experience :)</div>
<div><br />
<div>"&nbsp;Linux shares can't be indexed by Windows" &nbsp;The files can be read.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>By the way. I have no problem performing the functions from the Windows desktop. I can easily see the network, find the video files and execute a play.</div>

            <p>This problem is really obnoxious. I have old Zune software that can access my DiskStation just fine (with no indexing by anybody) and file browsers can of course see all the files, but the Music app on Surface RT (and apparently Surface 2) simply will not
 add a folder that can't b indexed. One of the primary reasons you buy a Surface is to use it as a media device. It seems to me quite incredible that any media app on a Surface would have such an absurd restriction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I did enable indexing on the DiskStation and it appeared to have no effect, but strangely while I was typing this message the "Music" app software did start adding my DiskStation music library despite the fact that it said it was not going to
 do so due to the inability to index. So I don't know what happened. It is possible that while I was typing the DiskStation finally indexed my music folder (it is only one of many folders on the DiskStation) and that the Music app finally recognized this. But
 then others here are saying that the DiskStation indexing is Linux indexing that Windows wouldn't recognize. But that's kinda strange since Windows recognizes the DiskStation as an NTFS drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would be interesting to se some comments on this.</p>

            <p>Nothing can be added to Windows media libraries unless it runs on a Windows Server that has Windows Search indexes on it or is copied to your local PC. This is a Microsoft design-decision I suppose, but really annoying just the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly on Windows 8 and 8.1 tablets with little storage. Since the Metro UI only accepts media libraries as source, it effectively means that you cannot use a NAS as source for media files at all. This includes if you run the Metro versions of VLC
 and other 3rdparty apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never thought I'd see the day when Windows was more restricted than Apple/iTunes, but unfortunately that day seems to be here.</p>

<p>that's not entirely true. apps can have access to whatever network+local folders you can get to.</p>

            Yes, you are correct. The technically correct way to phrase it, is that they can only use network folders that are indexed by Windows&nbsp;Search, which unfortunately adds up to the same thing.

            <p>So .. I had to re-initialize my Surface because something messed it up over the two years we've had it. The re-initialization cleared a lot of stuff in the apps despite what MS says about it saving your settings. Anyway so I had to go through this nightmare
 again of trying to get Xbox music to see the stuff on my network drive. After forcing the Music Library to see the drive at all by faking it out using a symbolic link using a technique described here</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?t=39548" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://forum.synology.com/enu/viewtopic.php?t=39548</span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up staring at an empty collection when I remembered that the first time I encountered this, Xbox Music just started building the collection for no particular reason. This time what stimulated it was that I put a single piece of music in one of the
 Surface-resident folders where it was looking. As soon as I did that, it triggered something in Xbox Music and then it started loading the collection. Or it could be that after sitting open for long enough it just starts loading anyway. Who knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway ... this whole thing really sucks. But if you waste enough hours on it, eventually something just happens. I guess I'm starting to see why Microsoft just isn't making it in the consumer-product marketplace. Maybe I should stop thinking about getting
 a Windows Phone if it's gonna have ridiculous stuff like this in it.</p>

<p><span>Hi bailey22,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Could
 you please check whether the white (audio) cable is plugged in properly?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check the video and audio capturing settings in the EasyCap 2.0 software?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to re-install the drivers for your device in compatibility mode and then check if you’re able to get the audio. Some of the
 end users have resolved this issue by installing the driver using the Windows 7 Compatibility mode. Visit the link below to know how to run a program in compatibility mode.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Steven, </p>
<p>You want to delete some files and folders. I will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may boot the computer in safe mode and check if that helps.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error code that has appeared when you’ve tried to play a DVD may be caused by an incompatible or faulty device driver or conflicts with an upgrade that was installed. Here some methods that you can use to resolve this issue:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> troubleshooter</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> logo key + <strong>R </strong>to open the <strong>
Run </strong>dialog box.</li><li>Type <strong>control </strong>in the <strong>Run </strong>dialog box, then hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> item, click <strong>Configure a device</strong>. Provide an administrator password if prompted or provide confirmation.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Check BIOS settings and chipset drivers.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check the <strong>drive </strong>if it’s <strong>activated in the BIOS</strong>. BIOS systems may vary by device. If you’re unfamiliar on how to verify the drive settings on your device’s BIOS, we suggest that you
<strong>contact the manufacturer of your device</strong>.</li><li>You may also verify with the manufacturer of the computer of the drive came with it, or if it was
<strong>purchased separately</strong> by the manufacturer that the <strong>chipset drivers
</strong>for the device are <strong>current</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong>: <strong>Update </strong>or <strong>reinstall </strong>
the driver.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>logo key + <strong>R </strong>to open the <strong>
Run </strong>dialog box.</li><li>Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> in the <strong>Run </strong>dialog box, then press Enter. Type the password, or select Allow, if you’re prompted for an administrator password.</li><li>In <strong>Device Manager</strong>, expand <strong>DVD/CD-ROM</strong> devices, right-click the CD and DVD devices, and then select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>OK</strong> if you’re prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device.</li><li>Restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're just here if you need further help.</p>

<p>I did #1 and #3.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I still get the error code 0x87E10BC6&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>With #1, I didn't have anything called "Configure a Device" so I tried picking something close to that.&nbsp; But, I didn't have any action to take, so I don't see how that could have done anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked to see if there were any updates to my PC last night or today, and there were none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night and all other days prior, I could play DVDs with&nbsp; no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same thing happened a few years ago and it turned out that the problem was in a Microsoft update and it took about 2 weeks and lots of people complaining before our DVDs would run again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I have gotten an update to my PC and it not show when I check for updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you Microsoft?&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for your help.&nbsp; Any&nbsp; more ideas?</p>

<p>I did NOT contact the manufacturer of my device to check the BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this PC for a few years.&nbsp; It played DVDs daily until the other day.&nbsp; So, I don't think this idea applies to me.&nbsp; The DVD player came with the PC, all brand new when I bought it.&nbsp; Nothing new has been installed by me ever..</p>
<p>
</p><p>New Development:&nbsp; I tried another DVD player and I was able to play DVDs with it.&nbsp; So, what happened is that suddenly a few days ago the Windows DVD PLayer that came with the PC suddenly stopped working and I started getting this error code instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly suspect that this is due to some Microsoft update that recently was installed.&nbsp; This happened last year, so that is why it is my suspicion.&nbsp; My PC is totally up to date with Microsoft updates as of 2/12/18.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am correct, you should hear from many more users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you let Microsoft know about this?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi iCLUTCHxBrOWNie,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
HomeGroup is a concept available only in Windows 7 for sharing libraries and printers on a home network. In order that the XP and Windows 7 computers can connect to each other, it is important that both the computers are on same workgroup.<br />
This makes it possible for computers running different versions of Windows to detect and access each other. Remember that the default workgroup name is not the same in all versions of Windows.<br />
<br />
To find or change the workgroup name on a computer running Windows XP<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In System Properties, click the Computer Name tab to see the workgroup name. To change the name, click Change, type the new name in Computer name, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
To find the workgroup name on a computer running Windows Vista or Windows 7<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open System by clicking the Start button, right-clicking Computer, and then clicking Properties.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The workgroup name is displayed under Computer name, domain, and workgroup settings.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Menu fonts too small</h2>
                    <p>I just updated Windows 10 over night....(today is May 11) I don't see well and need to increase the size of the fonts on the menu's and drop down's etc....Prior to the update that was rather easy and simple on the display setting screen in Control Panel
 .....but that has disappeared with the new update. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent the last hour or so looking in the settings for those adjustments to no avail....I need to know exactly where those adjustments are located, &nbsp;the instruction &nbsp;need to be simple and step by step.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all the screen above is not like the one that I have I do not have the slide all I have is a drop down menu that increases the size to 125%</p>
<p>
</p><p>When that happens everything increases in size including Icons on the desktop. which is not what I want to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do the same settings as prior to the update....where I could change the font size for menu's and other similar items, and also have the menu items be in "bold" type....This way the menu items are much easier to read.....Where did those adjustments
 do? &nbsp;If eliminated why were they? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>Change only the text size</strong> option was turned off in Windows 10 Creators Update. Unfortunately, the setting was not supported throughout the entire system. For example, it didn’t work with the Start menu, Cortana, Edge and some applications.
<br />
<br />
For an alternative method of changing your text size, you can use the <strong>Scale and layout</strong> options within<strong> Settings &gt; Display</strong>. Use the dropdown under
<strong>Change the size of text, apps, and other items</strong> to make things bigger or smaller.<br />
<br />
If you’d prefer your text, apps, and other items to be even bigger or smaller, click the
<strong>Custom scaling </strong>feature to go outside the ranges that Windows recommends for your hardware’s screen size and resolution.<br />
<br />
If the text looks fuzzy or blurry when you use custom scaling, this might happen if the custom size is not set to a 25% increment. For example, if your custom scaling is set to 157%, try changing it to 150% or 175%.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Microsoft recommends keeping your display resolution set to the “recommended” value. If you use custom scaling to go outside the range that Windows recommends, some text, apps, and other items may become unreadable. If you’re not able
 to read the screen well enough to restore your display settings, try starting Narrator by pressing the Windows logo key + Enter. Then press Tab to navigate through the interface until you find the right option for restoring your display settings.</p>

<p>This really is rubbish.. Not you personally of course but removing a very handy feature instead of finding a way to make it work.. Ok so it does not work in certain apps. Find a way to make it work or exclude those apps from being affected by the increased
 text size. You're one of the biggest tech &amp; software companies, pretty sure someone can figure it out. Making EVERYTHING bigger is not an acceptable solution when you need all the screen real estate you can get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will use the registry hack but I should not have to.</p>

            <p>Hello Soumyadeep,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that if the System Image is not corrupt/broken, the Re-image Your Computer wizard will walk you through seamlessly</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the few major reasons for&nbsp;error message 'system image restore failed' will be<span> if you created the recovery set while at build 10240 but attempted to restore it while using Version 1511 of Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, we need to consider how </span><span>old is the System image. Also, what was the build of Windows 10 when you created the same?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the updated status for us to be able to assist you further.</span></p>

<p>Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive.
 Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.<br />
<br />
Open Start, type: CMD<br />
Right click CMD<br />
Click Run as administrator<br />
<br />
Type each of the following then hit Enter<br />

ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old&nbsp;<br />
rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore<br />

<br />
When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.</p>

Troubleshoot Windows Update Problems in Windows 10 Using These Five Tips<br />
<br />
https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/23-troubleshoot-windows-update-problems-in-windows-10-using-these-five-tips/</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Microsoft Office...</p>
<p>
Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features&nbsp;<br />
Scroll down to Microsoft Office<br />
Select it<br />
Click Change<br />
<br />
Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.<br />
<br />
Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.<br />
<br />
If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.<br />
<br />
The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.<br />
<br />
Then wait while the repair process runs.<br />
<br />
You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.<br />
<br />
You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.<br />
<br />
Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.

<p>I have been attempting to resolve a problem with my No 4 computer updating to Windows 10. The update that is giving problems is version 1709.</p>
<p><strong><span>The error code is 0xc00000fd</span></strong></p>
<p>I have read and attempted all the methods suggested in various forums. I have also tried the Installation media route, all with no success. I have also contacted the Microsoft Support Team to overcome the problem. The support team have now made two attempts,
 using the installation media creation tool, to update to 1709 but both attempts have failed at precisely the same point.</p>
<p>The failure is at the end of the process when Windows is updating after installation. The message at the 26% complete point is:-</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Modern Setup Host has stopped working</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Windows will close the program and notify you if a</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Solution is available.</span></p>
<p>The computer in question is a Dell XPS 8900 Desktop PC</p>
<p>Intel Core i5, 2.7Ghz, 8Gbyte memory, 1TB Hard Disk</p>
<p>What I want to know is where do I go from here? It has taken me 4 complete Days of effort so far. Just what do all those other people do who have a similar problem and are not as able as us?</p>

            Hi this is the same person as the posting but maybe on a different account as i was on my sons laptop as it is that having the issues, it is an acer notebook not sure of model and has happened 3 or 4 times, the machine came with this version of windows
 on it so it wasnt an upgrade (less than 6 months old) he has told me he didnt install anything in the time leading up to it first happeneing and he is the only user set up on it, i was asking to see if it was a common fault or something possibly caused by
 a windows update before taking it back to where we got it from.

            <p>Pretty much what it says - as for any more specifics, you have to look at your situation.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Is the network connection between you and the server up?</p>
<p>Are the ports necessary for proper communications between that system and the server open as they need to be?</p>
<p>Do you have all the configuration done properly per the server administrators instructions?</p>
<p>Is the application you are trying to configure supported by the server you are trying to connect to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>... and so on.&nbsp; Essentially you have to look at your specific situation to troubleshoot where the problem is and why said system (the one you are sitting in front of) is not communicating with the server - especially if you are able to communicate with said
 server in other ways/on other systems.</p>

            Hi Devathman, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver
<br />
<br />
<br />If the above does not work, you probably have an AMD ATI graphics card
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section 
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />
<br />Select any device, and then click Action - Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Windows should load a good driver for your ATI graphics card 
<br />
<br />Then, go to Start - Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security, 
<br />
<br />Click Search for Updates, and install any available updates       
        </p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. 
<br />
<br />Yes, there is a problem with the latest Windows Updates. 
<br />
<br />Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - double-click the adapter - Driver's tab - use Roll back driver. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work or is unavailable do the below.
<br />
<br />Updating to the latest video driver or possibly reverting back to an older version usually corrects the issue. 
<br />
<br />Download the latest and any other older driver you wish to try from the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and also check the actual video device maker (such as Intel, Nvidia or AMD/ATI). Do not install yet. 
<br />

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try performing a system restore before this problem occurred. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955, KB4048954 (Windows 10 1703)
<br />
<br />Microsoft issued an update for several versions of WIndows 10: KB4048954, KB4048955 that has caused issues with display drivers. If you know the make and model of your computer, you can try manually reinstalling the driver from the manufacturers website for your video driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />KB4051963 and KB4055237.
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />

                    <p>When position of "Start button" be corrected in Windows 7? </p>
<p>Start Orb is too raised (when using small taskbar icons). Why not release a patch, for so many years this situation?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted&nbsp; with support Chat and the specialist created a case, code 1400281908</p>

<p>Where that is good and all, feature changes (including aesthetics) for Windows 7 became an impossibility at this time:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>January 13, 2015 -- end of mainstream support.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After that date, r</span><span>equests
 to change product design and features were off the table and any standing requests would have just been left behind.</span></p>
<p>At this time -- the change you are looking to have made is not going to happen and, functionally,
 it makes no difference and it can - and has been able to be changed in a variety of ways with free products.</p>

<p>Not my "decision", my "suggestion".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peer-to-peer volunteer-based public international web forum.&nbsp; The suggestion was just one of many possibilities (as I said) and no - not all of them (especially classic ones) will 'stick up' - which I, and millions of others, liked or were / are indifferent
 about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 was feature supported from October 2009 (general release) until January 2015.&nbsp; 5 years and 2 months.&nbsp; It is still, thru January 2020, supported in terms of security patches.&nbsp; 10 years and 2 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The look and feel would have needed a lot more requests than a couple, even more than 2 years and 10 months ago, when it was possible it might maybe happen (albeit unlikely.)&nbsp; Classic is still an option.&nbsp; You can even make it look like Windows 2000. You
 just have to (and had to) go third party for some options.</p>

<p>I am glad you understand that you are asking for a aesthetic change on an operating system that ceased eligibility for such requests in January 2015 and that the update you are requesting is so 'minor' and had been so widely accepted (obviously) without
 complaints for so long, nothing likely would have been done about it that far down the line anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, if the raised orb disturbs you, your choices are to find a third party modification that does not have the orb at all (is more a "classic" start bar or even a more "modern" start bar) or upgrade to Windows 8.1 or Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe this:</p>

 with other problems in windows 7, which I noticed. </p>

It's a pity that service pack 2 for Windows 7 was not planned for release.</p>
