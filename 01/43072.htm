<h2>            Windows 7 Search not doing exact match in quotes</h2>
                    <p>I typed name:"-1.mp3" in the Windows Explorer Search box and it brought up accurate results but then a bunch that didn't match my quoted search.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc3dd981-cc41-4891-8f3c-837769e26fb9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fc3dd981-cc41-4891-8f3c-837769e26fb9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Notice "01 - They-1.mp3" is the last result that contains my search term (everything above it did); the rest don't (everything below that didn't).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what glass ball can I divine to figure out how Microsoft is thinking when I do a quoted exact name search? (And if you're going to just leave a link instead of explaining it, please make sure it has the answer and isn't generic or require a degree in
 computer science).</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use the symbol "~=" when searching for exact match. This symbol means "match anywhere in the searched property". To search for all files with "-1.mp3", you can use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>name:~=-1.mp3</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes for us to assist you further.</p>

            <p>Kernel debugging through Ethernet NICs requires certain low-level platform support. Currently, Windows requires that these NICs be attached via PCI/PCIe for this debugging solution.</p>
<p>In most cases, simply plugging in one of these supported NICs will allow a robust kernel debugging experience. However, there may be cases where BIOS configuration details hinder the Windows debug path. The following set of platform requirements should be
 considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>System firmware should discover and configure the NIC device such that its resources do not conflict with any other devices that have been BIOS-configured.</li><li>System firmware should place the NIC’s resources under address windows that are not marked prefetchable.</li></ul>

            <p>I had a similar problem after installing Windows 8 upgrade from Windows 7.&nbsp; After much searching the Internet, I think I finally found my problem. While this may not be the same as your situation, I figure it may be worth a try.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Go to Device Manager, select view, and on the dropdown, select&nbsp; "show hidden devices", then look under "Network Adapters" to determine if there are adapters which you might not need and are causing your problem.&nbsp; These were not all showing under the Control
 Panel Network and Sharing Center items.&nbsp; I was particularly interested in two items, Microsoft Kernel Debug Network Adapter (which was disabled already) and Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter (which was enabled but not showing under Control Panel)&nbsp; After
 researching the Internet, I found Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter was not being used and could be disabled with no problem, so I disabled it.&nbsp; Since then, I have had no Error Code 1001 error in my Event Viewer.&nbsp; Apparently this adapter was some way
 interfering with DHCP.....I'm not techie enough to know how or why.&nbsp; But, I no longer have continual and frequent 1001 errors.&nbsp; Hope this helps you or someone reading this thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; I only disabled them - I did NOT uninstall them.&nbsp;

<h2>            &#34;An app default was reset&#34; message is spamming</h2>
                    <p>Hello!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been having some issues for the past few weeks, with "An app default was reset" error messages popping up in piles at the bottom right of my screen. It's the same error message every time, but with different file formats being mentioned in each of them
 png, jpg, bmp, gif, and pdf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://take.ms/o8mJM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been doing some searches for this error message, but never really found any good solutions to this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are anyone else here familiar with this issue, or by any chance know if I can do anything about it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These error messages keeps popping up and blocking parts of the screen, and very often when I need to click a button located just underneath it. It takes time to close all those error messages popping up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say they show up perhaps 1 to 3 times a minute, but seem to perhaps happen mostly if I do something related to images.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips or help would be much appreciated. :-)</p>

            <p>Hi Henning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and we will provide the assistance required to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Can you provide us the screen shot of the&nbsp;issue?</li><li>Can you provide the full error message?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I would suggest that you check if you have any pending updates for your computer. If so disconnect all external devices other than mouse and keyboard, install the updates and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that you are facing this issue mostly when you open images, I would suggest that you use a different app to open the images and check if you receive the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Brian!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing the same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for sharing and replying to my thread :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked your link, and I don't have WinZip installed, but I do have UnRar. I uninstalled it just to be sure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have "MysticThumb" installed, which is a piece of software that will display thumbnails properly in Windows. Like Photoshop PSD, and so on, so I updated this one as I didn't have the newest version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, there's changes, though. All the error messages above seem to have disappeared, but new ones have appeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it's kicking on: html, htm, jpg, wav.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, they seem to be fewer than before, and doesn't happen as often. So, looks like I'm on the right track, at least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would be cool to get rid of this issue once and for all, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no idea why this started happening, though. Perhaps third party software got some issues after the latest Win10 update, and if we've changed the file&nbsp;association on specific file formats, it's broken and keeps kicking in?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Henning<br />

            <p>Hi Brian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you log into Safe Mode with Networking and check if the issue arises in this mode as well. To log into this mode refer to&nbsp;the article
<strong>Get to safe mode and other startup settings in Windows 10 </strong>provided in the link below</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/get-to-safe-mode-and-other-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist in the above mode, place your computer in&nbsp;Clean Boot and check if issue arises in this mode as well. A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts
 that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To learn how to troubleshoot in this mode, click on the link below</p>

<h2>            Win7 updates error code 643 for kb 973688</h2>
                    Win 7 error code 643 for Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack 2 for x64-based Systems (KB973688). Must have tried 10 times at least. All I get is the error code and it can't install the XML&nbsp; Core Services. Have tried system restore,but
 that has not helped at all.&nbsp; If anyone has a fix please let me know. Also how can I delete the extra failed to install in "Update History".&nbsp; One thing, it says XML Core Service 4.0 Service Pack 2.&nbsp; I don't show having Service Pack 1?<br />
Thanks

<br />
A1. What "Microsft fix it program" program (e.g., <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB971058</a>)? I didn't mention&nbsp;a "fixit"&nbsp;in any of my previous posts in this thread.<br />
<br />
A2. Then&nbsp;one assumes you&nbsp;must not have deleted the contents of...<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; %windir%\SoftwareDistribution\Downloads</strong> &lt;=this folder<br />
<br />
...per Step #2 in my second reply to this thread.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, if you'd completed all of Steps #1 through #4&nbsp;in my second reply to this thread, Windows Update should no longer be offering KB973688.<br />
<br />
A3. It's entirely possible that the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
System Update Readiness (CheckSUR) Tool</a> had already been downloaded &amp; run my Windows Update.<br />
<br />
TIP: Read the Symptoms section of <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973688" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973688</a>. <br />
<br />
Do you (1) have an application installed which "uses Microsoft XML Core Services (MSXML) to process XHTML files"
<br />
<br />
If you cannot answer YES to all three of those conditions, you do not&nbsp;need to install KB973688, and Steps #1 through #4&nbsp;in my second reply to this thread should stop Windows Update from offering it.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I can't make it any simpler than that. Yes, it's a little complicated but it's not "rocket science" either. Best of luck.

<h2>            So every other day Windows 10 doesn&#39;t like to shutdown correctly</h2>
                    So, every other day, Windows 10 shuts down but, it'll shut down noticeably&nbsp;faster and doesn't fade out like a regular shutdown does but afterward restarts instead. I can shut down after it restarts. HOWEVER, recently used programs and files can become
 corrupted and/or unusable, I.E. documents, games, game saves, etc. I've spent over an hour googling this, to no avail. This is my last cry for help before I either switch to Linux&nbsp;or downgrade to Win7. And I know how much Microsoft loves to track and sell
 my information (Why do you need my IMEI number? The only thing you could use it for is to track me and my data, hmmmmm)

            <p>Could be a reaction by your hardware to Fast Startup which is actually a hybrid hibernate meant to start up and shut down Windows 10 faster.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try in Settings&gt;Power and Sleep&gt;Additional Power Options&gt;Choose What Power Button Does&gt;Change Settings currently unavailable to disable Fast Startup.&nbsp; Restart and test PC shutdown and startup several times over a few days.&nbsp;

            So almost exactly&nbsp;a month later I've encountered this problem again. And I think I've pinpointed the problem. So every time I started to receive&nbsp;these improper shutdowns, it happens when one of my hard drives is starting to get full (90G free of 1 Terabyte).
 Along with that before I shut down I get general bugginess with applications and files. Like corruption, refusal to start, etc. I have plenty of space on other drives (about 1 terabyte of free space in total) and I have plenty of RAM (16G) which at idle with
 a bunch of apps open is about 5G/16G used. I've turned off the feature which allows windows to use drives as a backup RAM of sorts to help the longevity of my SSD. I did a scan on the drive with little space left with the error checking tool and it came back
 clean. If I could get a straight answer of what's going on, that would be lovely. God knows what's being corrupted by all of this.

            So I moved my page file back onto my C:/ Drive (It might have been on my other drive because my main drive (C:/) is an SSD and it put it on my HDD to help the longevity of my SSD) but when I was shutting down today my computer froze. After a quick google
 search, the first result seems to have my answer: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/win-10-hangs-on-restart-and-shutdown/d4a61f7f-9b71-4600-b191-681b56b09e1e">
Win 10 hangs on restart and shutdown</a>. The OP said they&nbsp;fixed the problem by removing their mouse Bluetooth adapter. I have a wireless internet and Bluetooth&nbsp;adapter. When removing it I noticed that it was quite hot. I cooled it off by putting it in front
 of a fan for a while and instead of putting it in the back of my machine where boiling hot air shoots out (Keep in mind I'm running a gaming machine) I put it in the front. Went to device manager and updated its driver and retried startup repair and was able
 to get into startup repair. I did a repair on my startup files and got the message along the lines of "startup repair wasn't able to repair startup files" or something like that. A quick google search told me that typically that meant my boot files are functioning.
 I'll try my system in its current state and see how it goes. If all else fails, I'll probably just reinstall windows at the point (It's been 3 years since I installed it (Plus I upgraded to Win10)).

    <title>Installing USB Hard Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry flatto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing USB Hard Drive</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to add an external hard drive to my twelve year old son's Xbox One.&nbsp; I have tried three different USB external hard drives.&nbsp; All were USB 3.0.&nbsp; One drive was 2 TB and the others were 1 TB each.&nbsp; One of the hard drives was a U32 Shadow 1 TB drive
 that supposedly was already formatted for using in the XBox.&nbsp; In all cases, my son plugged them into the USB port and nothing happened.&nbsp; They were not recognized.&nbsp; We powered the XBox One all the way down and rebooted and still nothing.&nbsp; Looking on the Internet,
 I saw a post about formatting as FAT32 so that the Xbox would then reformat it when it detected it.&nbsp; I have Windows 8 running on my PC so my choices were NTFS or exFAT.&nbsp; I tried exFat and we attached it to his Xbox after powering it down and rebooted and still
 nothing. I then downloaded a utility to format the drive as FAT32, reformatted it on my computer. We attached it to his Xbox after powering the Xbox down and rebooted and still nothing. Thus, we have tried both NTFS and FAT32 with no success.&nbsp; I did a quick
 format on the drives if that </p>
<p>I am not sure what left to try at this point. I know that the Xbox needs to have the June 2014 update to recognize an external drive. My son says his Xbox is fully updated. I assume it is but not sure how to check. I assume that the Xbox will install all
 updates automatically so if my son updated the Xbox after the June date, the June update would have been installed automatically.</p>
<p>Suggestions please. Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Hi, j! I'm sorry to hear you're having this problem. First off, to check the console version, press the menu (old start) button, then go to settings. From there, go to System, and the current console version will be under Console Info. The version you are
 looking for is anything 1406 or later (1407, 1408, etc. switching to 15's in January.) The latest console version is 1502.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, have you tried plugging the hard drive into a different USB port? Sometimes a certain port might not work. Sometimes a drive just isn't compatible with X1, but I can't imagine that's the case here, since the U32 Shadow is actually
 specifically marketed as being for Xbox One. The fact that multiple U32s have not worked indicates to me either a port/cable issue, or perhaps not the correct System Update version.</p>
<p>Let me know!</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. &nbsp;I had a chance to get on the XBox while my son was at school today and I was working at home. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;I checked the system and did not explicitly see the current version even though I went to Console Info. &nbsp;However, it said that there
 were no updates for the machine and the last update installed was February 9, 2015 so assuming that the updates are cumulative and you can't skip one, I assume it does have the June 2014 patch. &nbsp;All three of the hard drives I used had their own cable so a
 common cable could not have been the issue.</p>
<p>I ended up returning the U32 Shadow drive as when I plugged it into my computer, it was "flaky" and jiggling the cable caused the drive to disconnect. &nbsp;I have a new drive, Digistar 1TB Xbox drive that should be here tomorrow that I will try. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn’t show up on the X=Box, I will try the other USB ports to see if that makes a difference. &nbsp;What format does the Xbox use for the drives – NTSF, exFat, etc.? &nbsp;Would it help if I formatted the drive on my PC before plugging into the Xbox. &nbsp;This
 has me frustrated as it should be simple to add the new drive as it should be “plug and play”. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;</p>
<p>My son is far more upset as he has Evolve and another game that he wants to install but there is insufficient room on the internal hard drive to do so. &nbsp;He refuses to uninstall any of his existing games from the internal hard drive.

<p>LOL! I know it doesn't make sense, but I know exactly how he feels - I actually picked up a 3TB so I wouldn't inevitably have to play Sophie's Choice deciding which ones to delete! :-)</p>
<p>On your question about file systems, the Xbox One uses an NTFS file system, which is the same as a Windows PC, however all hard drives have something called a Master Boot Record, which is what the system uses to recognize the drive on startup. In other words,
 you could format the external drive on the PC, &nbsp;but it still wouldn't be recognized by the Xbox, because the MBR will be set to PC. There is a tool to manually switch the MBR without reformatting, but that's really only useful if you want to use the drive
 on both an Xbox and a PC. You're better off letting the Xbox do the formatting from scratch.</p>
<p>And to answer that question, yes, the Xbox is designed to recognize it and reformat it as soon as it gets detected - since the Shadow was acting weird, I bet that was the problem. (And if it turns out that 3 consecutive Shadows were unreliable, that will
 be the biggest possible testimonial against them! :-)</p>
<p>Good luck, and keep me posted on how it goes!</p>

<p>It seems again and again anytime i see this issue it's on generic drives not big brands like Seagate/WD/Hitachi etc. &nbsp;One has to wonder if indeed the presetup boot record or perhaps a software issue of some sort with these smaller brands is causing the issue.</p>

<p>I found an same problem when i tried to setup my Seagate Expansion Desktop 4 TB.</p>
<p>The problem that the console didn't detect the drive.</p>
<p>After alot of searching I found the problem in the disk itself. Seagate makes the entire drive as 1 partion. With diskmanager on my PC i deleted it from the drive (READ THE WARNING BELOW!!!). Plugged it back in the console.. Problem Solved :D</p>
<p>WARNING: Diskmanager is know to fool new users of the program. Triple check if you are deleting the right disk!!!! It's really simple to choose the wrong disk and delete the drive of your pc!!!</p>

<p>Absolutely true, Razor - you have to be extra careful with partition management programs, as well as a program out there that lets you adjust the Master Boot Record (to switch between PC and Xbox 1 Mode) because if you accidentally choose your PC's on-board
 Hard Drive when making a change, you can effectively brick your PC! :-o</p>

                    Hi, as the title say. Cortada do it? Or will there be a future update for Cortana to do this? If setting an alarm through voice command is possible, how about having it auto-shutdown the pc on your given time and date?

<h2>            &#40;AMD - Other hardware, Storage Controller - AMD SATA Controller&#41; What is this update for or do &#63;</h2>
                    Just wondering what this update is. Obviously I can see that it is optional so I'm assuming I don't really need it. I would just like to know whether it&nbsp;is worth downloading. Also in the comments section for this download I've seen that it seems to be
 causing people a lot of issues which makes me think that it may well not be a good idea to try (and download) it. Thanks for any feed back.

            <p>Hello Rudi,</p>
<p>I understand and empathize with your concern. There's no way to predict who will have trouble with it and who won't. The absolute safest course is not to download, under the adage of "if it ain't broke, etc.".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do want to try it, I'd create a backup of your computer (hasten your regular backup schedule,&nbsp; you do have one right?!?). Then create a restore point before you download, and then download just the one update. In other words, and just for this one
 file, download it by itself, no other files so you can isolate and restore the system without the download should something go awry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know what you decide.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>As the title states my ESO plus membership renewed automatically and yet is showing as not active in game. I raised a ticket in game and was told to contact Xbox support, seeing as they're currently closed I thought I'd ask if anyone has experianced this
 and if they've managed to get around it.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hey, Mikey637! For users that are in the current preview, there are some purchasing issues that are known. This is likely the case for you. I suggest submitting feedback through your console, checking out if others are having this issue in the Update Preview Forums, and then reach out to <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Support via phone or chat</a> to find out if there is an issue with the charge. They may need to refund you so that you can make the purchase again. Thanks for understanding!</p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The run32dll.exe is a Windows application that helps in using DLL files. The run32dll.exe might be used by various applications which might need associated
 DLL files to function. If you get an error message stating that this process is not running, then either the application file could be corrupt or some other third application might be conflicting with this service and preventing it from launching successfully.
 I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</font></font></font></p>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>The genuine version of rundll32.exe is saved in the following location: C:\ Windows\System32\rundll32.exe (where C:\ is the drive where windows is installed).
 I would suggest you to double click on the file from this location to try manually starting the application. If the file can’t be started, then it is possible that the file is corrupt. In this case, I would suggest you to run a System File check. System File
 checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Refer to this article:</font></font></font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your response. This was helpful but the&nbsp;problem turned out to be bigger than just the rundll32. Both Windows 8.1 Pro and Office Home &amp; Business 2013 needed to be reinstalled. I am back up and running now.

 I have gone through the instructions for a Clean Boot and successfully completed that. However, the install problem still exists. I'm hoping there are a few other things I can try.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Victor Rocha,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Skype contacts are tied to your Skype account and can be accessed across different devices as long as using the correct account to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the scenario above, it is possible that you are signed in to a different Skype account which would explain why the contacts are not there. Please make sure to sign in using the
<em>credential when you initially created the account.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>See the steps below to check how many Skype accounts do you have under your Hotmail account.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Go to this <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</li><li>Enter your email address and select&nbsp;<strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>We'll show you all the Skype accounts associated with that email address.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for you Response Aljon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I think I wasn't cleared enough.</p>
<p>My hotmail account is ******************</p>
<p>My skype account is also **********************</p>
<p>Now that everything is Microsoft I can't access my old skype account because it uses the same email and when I access it now</p>
<p>it has only a few contacts link to my email account....&nbsp;</p>
<p>does that make any sense to you?</p>
<p>I know it is a bit confusing....</p>
<p>

<p>Hi <strong>Victor,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to access the <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">diagnostic link</a></strong> I have provide above? If yes, how many accounts shown?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you happen to see multiple accounts under the same email address, try accessing each and every account because one of the most common scenarios with missing contacts is being signed in to a different Skype account.</p>
<p>

Something is seriously wrong with this.  I just got this system from a sale 'used' and from a factory restore.  I tried to adjust the settings on the computer to change the start screen background. I get blasted with the message to "Refresh" the system.  



NOWHERE in that message does it say that I will have to reactivate. 



So you are wrong, it doesn't tell the user everything that will happen. 



In fact, I'm hearing horror stories of all kinds of unexpected things happening from "refreshing". 



WTF does it even mean to "refresh" the system.  This is all very misleading. 



I just want to change the damn background image or colors, and not get involved in talking with d!cks on the telephone. 



Why the feck does any deleting of information have to occur just to change a damn background? This has got to be the worst fumble I've seen for years in a windows release. 



I have yet to "refresh" my computer because I'd rather not delete ANY DAMN THING. 



But I guess there is no way to c

            <p>Yep, I guess I've joined the group now.. I've literally only a few minutes ago refreshed my computer because at first I tried to system restore to a previous date (literally a month behind) and everything was going fine, yes I did have to wait a fair bit
 just for it to switch off and on again. But when it did finally turn back on and was going through the normal process it then suddenly kept coming up with a message saying that there was an error and that it would restart the computer for me (very kind of
 it). So I waited again while munching on some food and it kept doing the same thing... the same process of switching on and me waiting and then the message appearing again and again and again until it gave me two options to either refresh the computer or wipe
 the whole thing. Now I don't know about everyone else but I figured to myself "well why would I wipe it for.. it'll delete everything on the system, so I opted for the refresh and after another 30minute wait it actually loaded up and yes all my files were
 untouched as it stated, but yet all the downloads I had made photoshop etc (which is not the cheapest thing in the world...) had been wiped (I accept that part may have been due to my own error).. but then it had also deactivated the mcfree and office software..
 which was already pre-installed on the laptop.. which I felt was a little concerning as that is surely the only use anyone has for a laptop...other than the internet... which makes my laptop pretty damn useless right now.. except for posting the feedback onto
 this site.. so 10/10 for that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I'll have to suck it up and brace the operator... I'll let everyone know how it gets on as I'm sure everyone will be clinging to screens awaiting for my response back.</p>

<h2>            DNS look up fails how do I fix it &#63;</h2>
                    I have intermittent success logging onto internet explorer.&nbsp; When I can I and try to link to another site I nearly always get a message&nbsp; about DNS failed or unable to connect.&nbsp; I have Norton anti-virus and wonder if it is connected to a firewall? Any ideas
 / solutions gratefully received as it's driving me mad !

            <p>Hi Ele_756,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to clear the DNS cache and see if that fixes the issue. Clearing the DNS cache forces DNS to query a DNS server rather than using information stored in the
 cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the "Start" button .</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the search box, type "command prompt."</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the list of results, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>At the command prompt, type
<b>ipconfig /flushdns</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Then type <b>ipconfig /registerdns</b> and press
<b>Enter</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That should do it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above method does not help, you may contact the Internet Service Provider (ISP).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Startup password. I think I have been scammed!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I stupidly allowed remote access to my computer by somneone&nbsp; who claimed to be from windows support. They have configured a password to be entered before I can boot up my XP PC. Can you help me remove it? I was given the password number which is asked for
 before I get into the user account page,(where I already have a password) &amp; this does work, but I can't find how to change or remove it. Thanks.</p>

                    I have downloaded tv shows from Netflix.&nbsp; I'd like to delete the commercials.&nbsp; I have trimmed the beginning commercials, but can't figure out how to delete segments in other places.

            <p>Hi Docentdan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. We understand that you want to remove the commercials from the video. Let me help you with that. What you need&nbsp;to do is to split the segment of the commercial then delete that part and save the video on Movie
 Maker. This is the same suggestion provided by Skier-hughes. If you are not aware on how to&nbsp;do this, you may follow the step-by-step instruction below to accomplish this task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Open Movie Maker and import the video that have commercials. To do this, please follow the instruction in this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/movie-maker-import-photos-videos-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article.</strong></a><br />
2. After importing the video on Movie Maker, slide the timeline all the way to the right by pressing the plus key(
<strong>+ </strong>). <br />
3. Once the video has been expanded on the story board, go to <strong>Edit</strong> tab<br />
4. Select the starting point of the commercial then press <strong>right-click</strong> and select
<strong>Split</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Select the ending point of the commercial then press <strong>right-click</strong> and select
<strong>Split</strong></p>
<p>6. After separating the commercial from the video, please select the segment of the commercial and press
<strong>Delete</strong> button to remove it on your Storyboard.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Save&nbsp;the project as movie&nbsp;by pressing these keys, <strong>ALT</strong> &gt; <strong>
F</strong> &gt; click <strong>Save movie </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Choose your desired settings for the movie</strong>.<br />
</p>
<p>Should you have further questions or clarifications, please let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Leonard.</p>

<h2>            safe mode does not work. windows might have a rootkit virus engineered by someone</h2>
                    <p>hello my operating system or window might have a rootkit or registry problems i do not know how to fix. Safe mode does not work if i want to scan a virus or malware software under safe mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My network are often attacked. Sometime when i turn on my computer after a day or two off and i log in to windows the WIFI connection would&nbsp; stop automatically as if someone stopped or intercept my network whilst my computer is switched off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing this problem for quite long. Update would sometime stopped or missing some update files. Is like someone is controlling my PC on its own or engineered my PC so that i don't have full authorization or an attempt to easily invade my
 operating system or to control. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give advice please. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My WIFI is set so it doesn't join automatically, but sometime it still does join on its own. Its like the windows interface does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 10 Home, Version 1709 OS Build 16299.248</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this issue I am also having some privacy or security issue, sometimes with chrome or internet explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello Roy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you with your concern, I'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you recall any recent application you've downloaded and installed on your computer prior to this issue?</li><li>Are you getting any sort of warnings or messages?</li><li>It would be best if you can send us a screenshot of the privacy issue you've encountered on the said browsers.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I'd recommend that you run the <strong><em>Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool</em></strong> to make sure that all possible malicious software is removed from your computer. Refer to the steps in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/890830/remove-specific-prevalent-malware-with-windows-malicious-software-remo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Melchizedek, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions, no I don't recall downloading or installing a recent application prior to this issue. But a long while ago i might have encountered a Trojan malware from a phishing websites i visited. But i assume its all gone after a computer
 reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything looks clear now on the main windows interface page no error no warning signs. Except on safe mode i get a run time error warning. uun<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d1ff41b-f425-4274-acda-9079f8422f45?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d1ff41b-f425-4274-acda-9079f8422f45?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Only on safe mode i had this pop up error warning about C++ Runtime when i click start, then setting then Network and Internet, then clicking WIFI.

            Thank you for letting me know. At this moment, I'd recommend running the System File Checker. It's a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. Refer to the steps below:
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1. Click on <em><strong>Start</strong></em>, type in <em><strong>Command Prompt</strong></em>, right-click on it and se</span></span><span><span>lect
<em><strong>Run as administrator.</strong></em></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Enter the command below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><em><strong>sfc /scannow </strong></em></span></span><span><span>(note the space between "sfc" and "/").</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope to hear from you soon.</span></span></p>
