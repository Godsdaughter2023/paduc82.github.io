    <title>Single Certificate for multiple client devices for an EAP-TLS system - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Single Certificate for multiple client devices for an EAP-TLS system</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am designing a system to include multiple laptops&nbsp;connected to a Server&nbsp;via an EAP-TLS capable Access Point.</p>
<p>So I want to configure the system for EAP-TLS WAP security.</p>
<p>There are a couple of use cases in the requirements where having unique certificates in the laptops is very inconvenient and problematic.<br />
<br />
Can someone please tell me if it's at all possible to put a single certificate on all of the client machines? I understand that this is a little less secure but&nbsp;happy to live with it.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The client devices will have Windows 10 and the Server Windows Server 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help.<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>
<p>Pradeep&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Question:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if the keyboard is in French, can you not change the settings on the surface pro for US English keyboard?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>using an English keyboard, I can currently change settings between French and English via the computer lower right corner menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if that can be done using an English keyboard, I am assuming it can also be done using a French one as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Ron,<br />
<br />
<br />
There are several reasons why you are experiencing issues with the Control Panel. To isolate the issue, kindly answer the questions below:<br />
<br />
1. What is the build of your Windows 10?<br />
2. What is the exact error message that you are getting?<br />
3. Can you send us the screen shot of the blue circle that you're getting?<br />
<br />
Update us with the result.<br />
<br />

            I, too, cannot utilize my "control panel". It opens up but then that blue circle just keeps spinning and I am unable to get anything to open. I am desperate as Microsoft just did an automatic update 2 days ago and uite a few things have happened including
 this. &nbsp;However, my volume has gone from roaring to a whisper and I must get to my sound control. I've kicked it up to 100% and it is just a whisper. &nbsp;HELP !!! &nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reasons why your Control Panel is not working properly is due to corrupted .cpl file. To know more about this issue, we just have a few question:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which version of Windows 10 are you using?<br />
</li><li>Can you provide us a screenshot of the issue?</li><li>Is the issue the same when booting your device in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>?</li><li>What are the steps that you've done so far to troubleshoot the issue?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response. <br />

<p>Clark, &nbsp;Please forgive the inordinate delay in responding but I had cancer surgery along with all of the garbage that goes with it post-op. &nbsp;I am using&nbsp;Windows Home Version 10.0.15063. &nbsp;No, I have not taken any screenshots. &nbsp;When I attempt to view the Control
 Panel, when the screen opens up I can see the various contents. However, what should be my cursor is nothing but a small blue circle going round and round and round and then the screen disappears. &nbsp;When it disappears, so does my task bar but one by one the
 systems all reappear. &nbsp;When I go to Control Panel via the "run command" I have the same screen appear but no circling blue cursor whereas with the "command prompt" I do see it. &nbsp;Regardless, the screen disappears with the same task bar issues. &nbsp;No, I have not
 attempted a safe start as yet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I use the shortcut key, I do not get to the Control Panel as I know it to be and am used to, I do get to a Windows setting screen which has most, if not all, of the features of the Control Panel. &nbsp;I just don't feel comfortable with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? &nbsp;Thanks, Sue</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about the performance of your device when opening Control Panel can be due to the changes in the configuration and/or software conflicts related to broken system files. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you've made changes to the settings of your device after installing the Windows Update.</li><li>The results after running Windows in safe mode based on the steps posted on the link shared by
<strong>Clark Ari</strong>.<br />
</li><li>The build of Windows 10 Creators Update (10.0.15063) that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. Version 15063 or the Windows 10 Creators Update have released build updates since its inception.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. In the clean boot environment, check if you'll still experience your concern when launching Control Panel. The link will also provide steps to isolate the possible cause of the issue. Once you're done troubleshooting, check the
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> section to revert your device to normal boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Join Xbox-live Gold</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to join Xbox-live gold but it doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>I start by signing onto my microsoft account wish my xbox-profile is on. So far so good. I press the "Join Xbox-live Gold" button and i'm sent to the page where i can choose between 1 month, 3 months and a year. I chose 3 months. But here is the problem.
 When I pressed "next" I am sent to another log in screen. I have tried to use the right accounts password and email but i'm just sent back to the same screen. This is really weird because if I use the wrong password then a message appears that I've used the
 wrong password. But if I use the right password it doesn't happen anything, I'm just sent back to the same screen with no message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me please!</p>

<p>If it's asking for a login email and password when you try to purchase Gold, you may be operating a child account with parental controls in place preventing you from making the purchase. &nbsp;The reason it's not telling you that you have an incorrect password
 is because the password is correct. &nbsp;The problem is you're using the child email and password to authorize itself to make a purchase, and that's not going to fly. &nbsp;You need to enter the parental email and password.</p>

<p>There is no native tool in Windows to do it. I'm happy to let you have a VB Script that I wrote exactly for this purpose, if you're interested.</p>

            Hi nhajji
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade (This is not Reset or Reinstall of Windows). Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

                    <p>After installing the latest Feature Pack for Windows 10 (1703), I have lost Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>This is not a problem in itself, since I actually do not use the program, but a 3rd party program uses WMVcore.DLL as well as my "Movies &amp; TV" app is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried installing Windows Media Pack via this link: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=48231</p>
<p>But I cannot and get this error message: The update is not applicable to your computer.</p>

<h2>            Change install download language for Windows 8 Pro Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I live in Bulgaria and was one of the "midnight birds" to buy Windows 8 Pro Upgrade download. My previous installation was in US English. However, for some bizarre reason, what ended being downloaded as an upgrade install is in en-UK. Not that I don't write
 "behaviour", but still I prefer the US versions.</p>
<p>So, the question is:</p>
<p>How can I download en-US Windows 8 Pro Upgrade installation / ISO?</p>

I'm not sure how you would do to be able to get the setup program to run through a proxy.

<div>I just connected through this free USA VPN&nbsp;<a href="http://us.newfreevpn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://us.newfreevpn.com/</a>&nbsp;and ran the setup and when the download had started I just switched back to my normal connection which is much faster and the download automatically

<h2>            Windows 10 activation Key not working after clean reinstall of Win10 on HP laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I wanted to format my laptop that I bought with Windows 8 and then upgraded to Windows 10. I used the Media creation tool and exported an .iso of Windows 10 that I then imported into a USB Stick using Rufus to make it bootable so I can format the entire
 HDD. </p>
<p>After the install, windows didn't activate automatically and it won't accept the same key I had before doing the clean reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or tips? Is there any other easier way to fix this other than reverting back to windows 8 and then upgrading to windows 10, AGAIN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Fail to install Toshiba Bluetooth stack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> teodorcostache  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fail to install Toshiba Bluetooth stack</h2>
                    <p>I installed the atheros and realtek bluetooth filter driver package,&nbsp;but when&nbsp;I try to install Toshiba Bluetooth Stack, the installation goes to 99%, then the bluetooth driver installation window appears, and stays at 25% forever. To get out of this situation
 , i have to click cancel tot the driver installation window. Then the stack installation says i should restart my computer for the changes to take effect. The drivers and stack are all ok - toshiba support site, 64 bits, destined for my laptop.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried installing the bluetooth stack with just atheros driver istalled, with just realtek deriver installed, and with no prior bluetooth driver install. The behavior is the same. In device manager a generic MS driver is instaled. I tried to uninstall the
 generic driver, and installing the atheros, realtek, or the stack (on sepparate atempt ofcourse). The MS default driver is always installing insted of the specified driver. And, ofcourse, with the stack, I get the above mention error, with no succesful driver
 instalation. I tried to update the driver from device manager, bypassing windows update, and pointing to the folder with the desired drivers, to no avail. The default MS driver is installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem that I want to adress is that altough I have bluetooth icon in system tray, and I can select different options, (don't know if it is functional, as i have no bluetoth devices), is that when i want to use something from the bluetooth software
 in start menu, all the bluetooth programs go into installing bluetooth driver. So if i double-click Bluetooth settings, the windows account control screen pops up. I click accept, and toshiba starts installing the same driver as mentioned above, with the same
 result - eternal stalling.</p>

<br />
There is probably a bug in version 8 of Toshiba bluetooth stack. Just download version 9 from toshiba support site and you will have Bluetooth stack working:<br />

    <title>In Split-Screen, both players get all game audio when using headset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raz0rback  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Split-Screen, both players get all game audio when using headset adapter</h2>
                    
<p><span>Albert Penello mentioned this in an interview a few weeks ago:</span></p>
<p>Q: How does the adapter handle split screen multiplayer audio?</p>
<p>A: It supports separate audio streams for single player multiplayer. Each player can hear
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">their own</span> chat and audio through their controller.</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>When playing call of duty in split-screen I hear all of the game sound from the other player along with my own when using the headset adapter. This was one of the main reasons I purchased the adapter. This means that while we're in different parts of a map
 I can hear footsteps and gunshots from the other split-screen player's game.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is a known issue?</p>

<p>The question is how did COD set this up...normally split screen doesn't split sound for right and left speakers.</p>
<p>I think its working as intended by COD.</p>
<p>You're taking his reply out of context, each player will hear their own chat and audio doesn't mean each player will hear only what on their side of the screen.</p>
<p>That would require two consoles.</p>

How do I replace&nbsp;only the&nbsp;video section&nbsp; but retain the audio in Windows Movie Maker?

I do not want the&nbsp; change in the video to impact the audio timeline - <strong>the audio flow should continue as it is now, but with a different visual.<br />

<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the storyboard/timeline, select the clip that you want to move.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
</span><span>Edit</span><span>, and then click
</span><span>Cut</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do one of the following, depending on the view that you are working in:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the storyboard, click the next empty cell.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>o<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the timeline, move the playback indicator to the point where you want to paste the clip.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
</span><span>Edit</span><span>, and then click
</span><span>Paste</span><span>.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work you may have to strip the audio from the video and cut the video into clips before and after where you want to insert the picture, then paste it into the timeline.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if that works out.</span></p>

<p>I am having this same issue with a VERY hard to get achievement on Terraria. It shows I have it unlocked with a gamerscore of 180/200 on one screen, then on the summary screen, I only have 166/200. So I still have an uneven gamerscore. It is driving me insane
 as the achievement's glitched in the first place and after trying to get it since September, I finally unlocked it and now it didn't properly sync. I played this while connected to a strong signal home wifi network. Can anybody help?</p>

<p><span><span>Hi</span><span>
<span>NIGEL51</span></span><span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Are you installing Microsoft Office Professional 2007 from a CD\DVD or downloading it from Internet?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are downloading it, first save the setup file on the desktop and then try installing the same. Now check if you get the same error.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also try the below mentioned steps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>When the installer pops up the error, ignore it. Don’t close or cancel the install, just let it sit.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Perform a Windows search for “proof.msi”. You may need to select the “Search system folders” option.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>In the results, you will see “proof.msi” located somewhere in the Windows temporary directory.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Copy, or write down, the path that is found.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Return to the installer. You should still have the error message present asking you to enter a location. In the box at the bottom of the error message,
 type or paste the path from step 4.</span></span> </li><li><span><span>Now that you have the path typed/pasted, delete the “proofing.en-us\proof.en\proof.msi” part from it.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>Press enter.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>The installation should now continue flawlessly.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that does not help then Microsoft Office public newsgroups would be the most relevant newsgroup for your question.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/office/community/en-us/default.mspx?d=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/office/community/en-us/default.mspx?d=1</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<h2>            Windows XP keeps installing 2 Intel Display Adapters Dell Optiplex 945 Windows XP SP3</h2>
                    <p>I know XP isn't supported anymore, so bear with me anyway.&nbsp; This is for a pc that is for operation processes on a manufacturing line,</p>
<p>and the software is not supported on later versions of Windows yet.&nbsp; Hopefully I can get that done later, but for now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2&nbsp; Intel(R) Q965/Q963 Express Chipset Family&nbsp; devices under Display Adapters in Device Manager.</p>
<p>I can only uninstall one of them in Normal mode, but can uninstall both in Safe mode, but always 2 come back.</p>
<p>I am also stuck with the VGASAVE driver active as one of them always has an exclamation in normal mode.</p>
<p>I have updated all drivers for this pc from the Dell site.&nbsp; I have repeatedly followed all pertinent steps I've found</p>
<p>regarding these symptoms online.&nbsp; Nothing so far has solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to avoid having to do a format and re-install as activation is a pain, and I can't afford to lose activation for</p>
<p>a machine used in a manufacturing environment.&nbsp; I went down that path with another pc and never got the activation to</p>
<p>work even with the automated telephone system.&nbsp; I have copied the activation files to a backup just in case I lose them in this process of
</p>
<p>altering drivers trying to get this system sorted out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to stem from a lack of resources for all of the devices.&nbsp; Windows XP doesn't allow me to modify the resources on so</p>
<p>many of the devices under system devices, that are showing multiple resource conflicts.&nbsp; Most of the devices with resource conflicts are motherboard
</p>
<p>resources and vgasave.&nbsp; The display adapter is affected, so vgasave comes into play.&nbsp; I also have two phantom PS/2 devices, keyboard and mouse,</p>
<p>that refuse to go away.&nbsp; It isn't malware as I've fully scanned the system with multiple cleanup utilities and nothing has been found.&nbsp; Besides, this</p>
<p>pc has operated beautifully until recently, and the only thing done is application of SP3 as a repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless anyone has a solution, based upon everything I've read, my only possible choice besides a complete wipe and re-install would be</p>
<p>to roll back to SP2 from SP3, then uninstall all of the hardware specific drivers, then apply SP3, then add back all the drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all in advance.&nbsp; Oh, and if only a Microsoft AI reply comes back, never mind.&nbsp; All of those I've read never got an okay vote...</p>

<p>What was recently installed or added that might cause this? IE add new program, add new device etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do down the full reinstall solution, make a full hard drive image with <span>
Macrium Reflect. This will allow to restore it if some does not go as planned.</span></p>

    <title>Windows XP Pro Reinstallation&#47;Lost Recovery Disks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> insane_one  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Pro Reinstallation&#47;Lost Recovery Disks</h2>
                    I have been trying to get the answer to this question for months... I am working on a computer for a friend who has lost their original recovery and/or Windows XP Pro OS disks. &nbsp;The computer is a Dell however, I have worked on HP's and have had the same
 problem. &nbsp;Obviously most all Dell and HP computers come with Windows Pre-installed and they have a Windows License/Product Key attached to the computer. &nbsp;The question is if they lost the disk how can I as a Technician reinstall it using their License/Product
 Key without their recovery disk? &nbsp;I would thing their is a Windows Operating System Disk that allows me to install Windows XP Pro and then during activation use their product key? &nbsp;Thanks for any guidance you can provide.....

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Usually OEM embeds their recovery software as a separate partition which computer owners can create a backup off (unless the drive has been reformatted). In this case, it's best to consult the manual. :-)</p>
<p>However, if you are unable to locate the recovery partition, then it's best that you contact the computer manufacturers for the recovery discs. :-)</p>

            As a technician who has frequently come accros the same problem on older PCs, you can easily order PC specific restore disks for generally under $30 at the OEM site (at least for HP) or at<a href="http://www.restoredisks.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.restoredisks.com</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 is not the only site out there, however, I've been happy with their service.&nbsp; Feel free to take the referral or not.

<h2>            UEFI&#47;GPT-based hard drive partitions default layout for win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have been currently looking in my laptop the default windows 10 partition layout which seems to be very odd in my case. well, i was recently reading an article here:</p>
<p>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/configure-uefigpt-based-hard-drive-partitions</p>
<p>
</p><p>and saw that the default partition layout for uefi systems, which is a way different case with me. here is my layout</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7538043-64fc-494e-9bf7-449024109cc3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7538043-64fc-494e-9bf7-449024109cc3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>As in my layout, the first partition is new volume f which used as storing user data&nbsp; and then i have efi, then C:), then oem which is why i am asking here, is it good or bad to have this type of layout.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>let me give more info now, i clean installed windows 10 a way months ago deleted some partitions and left the efi and some recovery partitions which was of oem recovery win8 backup. but after certain time i deleted that oem backup because obviously, why
 do i need win8 when we have win10 now. from which that F partition got stuck in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the good thing is everything runs fine in my system but sometimes randomly it just runs like hell slow and sometimes fast like a speed of light(not so fast, just joking) and the second thing is when i boot my laptop, the dell(manufacturer logo) boots twice
 to boot into system(let me explain this in the steps if you don't understand, at first the dell logo appears but with no loading, then it goes, then again dell logo appears and loading begins and finally i am in the system). the funny thing is that this has
 absolutely no effect on system(according to me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you help me with this if you understand what i am saying. i would greatly appreciate the help</p>
<p>
</p><p />

I received a code for a $5 gift card on xbox that would expire on November 30th so I used it 2 days later (received November 6th) and I never got the $5 to my account. In my recent purchases I haven't bought anything with money since before I used the code and in it the thing also said refunded.&nbsp;The code was sent by Xbox to the account I'm posting this with.&nbsp;</p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1iyNq.img" /></figure><p><br /></p><figure><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fimg-prod-cms-rt-microsoft-com.akamaized.net%3a443%2ftenant%2fxvi%2fentityid%2fRE1iwc9.img" /></figure>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;Darkhawk Ninja. Unfortunately, we are not able to help you since the gift card was not from Xbox Live Rewards and we can't see why your code redemption didn't work. We do see that a token for $5 was redeemed on the 8th, but can't investigate whether it made it to your Microsoft account or not. We do see that we made a deposit to your account for $5 on the same date, so the other support team may have confused that with the problem being with us. You need to reach out to Microsoft Support again. Sorry to pass you back.</p>
