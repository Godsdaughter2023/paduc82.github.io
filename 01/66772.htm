<h2>            Two Skype accounts&#63; I just want 1 and no stranded credit in the other.</h2>
                    <p>I seem now to have two Skype accounts. One is based on my Microsoft account and the other on my Skype user name. Can I merge these please?</p>

            You have to delete one. I spent 2 hours on the phone in 2016 and an hour with the virtual assistant a month ago and they couldn't&nbsp;resolve it. If anyone has an answer I await patiently.

<p>I started a new Skype account b/c I wanted to use the new one, not the old one.&nbsp; But Microsoft has shut me out of the NEW one and let me into the old one.&nbsp; If I had not wanted the new one, I would have added it.&nbsp; Can't they give us a choice rather than making
 this take hours and hours only to find out what you need is impossible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if privacy were not an issue, I would not have opened the new one. They need to stop using our names and our emails as part of our Skype names. Let us choose the name.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File explorer view layout gone since update yesterday</h2>
                    <p>Since windows 10 installed updates yesterday I have lost the layout section of the view portion of my ribbon in file explorer.&nbsp; This means I cant change the view to details, thumbnails, different size of thumbnails etc. The view I have is now only small
 thumbnails (too small to see the photos and select the ones I am looking for) or details. This is now done with two small icons in bottom right corner of screen. This is ****. On viewing the ribbon where in View there used to be Layout and choices there is
 now only a narrow strip saying layout and no functionality. Infuriating...</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The issue may be caused by an improper Windows Update installation. For example, a Windows Update installation interrupted by a crash may result in a corrupted system file. A third-party program conflict can also be the reason for

<p>
</p><p><span>To isolate your concern, we suggest that you perform a system restore. </span>
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restoring wonâ€™t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong>&nbsp;button, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Blue Screen-- &#39;Internal Power Error&#39; &#58;&#39;&#40;</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
I'm receiving a BSoD each time I try to hibernate / standby. It's an 'Internal Power Error' - I've tried the normal 'powercfg /hibernate /size 100' with no success. Running Windows 7 Ultimate 64-Bit with 4GB of RAM.
<br />
<br />
I'm an MCITP - Windows 7 Desktop Enterprise Support certified person so there's no need to simplify things for me too much! :)<br />
<br />
All help appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks! :)

<h2>            Airplane mode automatically activates</h2>
                    I recently purchased a windows 10 machine and noticed airplane mode automatically activates upon waking the device or upon restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;It automatically activates this&nbsp;mode and disables any other&nbsp;wireless capabilities until I manually change it back.&nbsp; Didn't
 have this problem with the upgrade to windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Just on the Home edition.&nbsp; Is there a solution for this problem?&nbsp; I noticed many others have similar complaints.&nbsp; Is Microsoft doing anything to address this issue?

 to do the thing I usually do, convert some of my NEF pictures in Nikon software and got this message.</p>

<p>all folders on my two disks same to be affected. I went through all steps I could google, nothing helps.

<p>I haven"t Install anything new. The only updates I could trace where windows definition update. I could not work out how to disable those yet.</p>
<p>I will be happy about any suggestions, apart from these that are coming up first in google search, because I trayed those solutions.</p>

            Hi Yoola.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />First see these fixes for Read Only:
<br /><a href="https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/windows-10-read-only-problem-has-a-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/forums/discussions/windows...</a>

<br />
<br />If nothing works then you can create a new Admin Local Account  in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People, sign into it, test it works properly, if so move your files over, test all programs run correctly:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Then when ready you can delete the old Account in the same place as above, and if desired change it to your Microsoft account as shown here: 
<br /> <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>.
<br />
<br />If this does not help you can rescue your files from the Repair Mode or booted Media Command Prompt where Windows has no say:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Then wipe the drive to do this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>thanks a lot for all this information. I did work it out now. It is a problem of the software I trayed to convert my files with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, it was interesting to look at some user on my user list (i am the only user and admin)..one looked very strange and I just deleted it. Hopefully, it was not some important account. :)</p>
<p>The time will show.</p>

            HI again -
<br />
<br />If you are the Admin and only User then there should be no other User accounts and I'd remove any that appear in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; Other People.  
<br />
<br />A PC is like your house in that you'd want to know anyone else who is living there and decide who and what you want inside at all times.  
<br />
<br />Let me know if there's anything else.
<br />
<br />Also when ready please mark the post which helped most as the Answer, to help others.  A rating is also appreciated.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Problems for older HP printers after the 1607 Release</h2>
                    <p>This issue has been around for a while but seems to be much worse after the Windows 10 1607 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use HP 6L printers on several computers.&nbsp; True, these are very old but they still work and they worked fine on earlier Window 10 builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the 1607 release, MS pushes out a driver called "HP LaserJet PS Class Driver" which does not work.&nbsp; I am now getting this driver pushed out multiple times each day.&nbsp; I have to go in and manually replace this malfunctioning driver with a driver called
 "HP LaserJet 6L" which then makes my printers work.&nbsp; After some time or a reboot, Microsoft unhelpfully&nbsp;replaces this good driver with the bad driver and the cycle starts all over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that updates are now mandatory and that I can no longer reject this update as I could with earlier releases of Windows 10, 64 bit Professional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Microsoft have any capability to acknowledge that they are pushing out a problem patch and no&nbsp;longer push it&nbsp;out?
</p>

<h2>            Error 0x80070057 when transferring .apk files</h2>
                    Hello, I am speedcreature. <u>My laptop can't seem to transfer files, especially .apk files, to my tablet directly.</u> This includes files of .docx, .xlsx, .pptx, and the like. I can always use a flash drive or my microSD card to transfer those files
 indirectly, but the method has become cumbersome and time-consuming. Is there any way I could
<i>transfer files</i> from my PC to my tablet <b>directly</b>? Thank you.<br />
<br />
P.S. My laptop's OS is Windows 7 Ultimate, and it has more or less <b>385 registry errors</b>.
<u>I do not have the means to repair them using registry cleaners, because I am short of money.</u> I would have to resort to more complicated means if I want this problem resolved.<br />
Also, my tablet's OS is Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich. I think that wouldn't be the source of the problem, but I hope that the above information would help in solving my problem.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can use Windows easy transfer cable to transfer the files from one computer to another computer.
<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1: </b>I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Transfer files and settings from another computer<br />
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/transfer-files-and-settings-from-another-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/transfer-files-and-settings-from-another-computer</a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<b>Method 2:</b> <span>
I would suggest you to run SFC scan. <span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />

</p><p>Hi Z3N1X, </p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to address your concern about uninstalling your game, you may consider the following troubleshooting suggestions:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try clicking this <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/autoruns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><strong>link</strong></em></a> in order to access hidden auto starting images that have been added to your system. This will also help you delete an auto-start configuration entry with the use of its menu item or toolbar button.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you were able to delete that program, try checking in the services view if it is indeed deleted. Follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong>. </li><li>Once the Run box appear, type <strong>services.msc</strong>. </li><li>Press <strong>Enter</strong>. </li><li>Check if the program can still be found. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result for us to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<p>I did a disk cleanup and deleted 1GB of previous windows&nbsp; installations but the game was not deleted still
</p>
<p>PS: I had windows 7 before and it was left on that version like that,that's why i said "previous windows installations"&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Spartan Ops or Firefight&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Do you like Spartan Ops or Firefight better? In Halo 5 I'd way rather have firefight, but more like ODSTs than Reaches. ODSTs seemed way more challenging.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Horde type modes don't do anything for me. I'd rather have missions with some kind of purpose, even if it's only "go here" or "push this button." I was never able to really get into Firefight, or Horde, or Nazi Zombies, or any of that.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That being said, it seems like Firefight is fairly easy to implement. Why not have both modes available in the next title? Or even as a title update.

<p>I much prefer Firefight, but like Jaximus said, why not have both modes.</p>

<p>I find Spartan Ops rather boring and after one chapter of an episode, I no longer want to play anymore.</p>

<p>Spartan Ops was a novel idea. Introduce a side story that keeps going on and keeps you engaged in what is going on with things other than Master Chief. However, they failed in the excecution. The same handful of maps over and over again except this button
 spawns over there instead? Not my cup of tea.</p>

<p>I'm a fan of Spartan Ops. &nbsp;Even though the maps repeat a lot I still find it fun to have an on-going storyline. &nbsp;I think it gives the game a lot more long-term playability!</p>

            Hi George,
<br />
<br />Insert the CD in to the computer.
<br />
<br />Depending on the type of CD it is it will Auto play .
<br />
<br />If it  doesn't, Open up Windows File Explorer ( Yellow Folder on the task bar)
<br />* Click on THIS PC
<br />* Under Devices and Drives you will see your CD drive
<br />* Click Open and it will show you the files it has on the CD.
<br />
<br />If its music files you can double click on it and it will open in an windows music player app that you have set as default.
<br />
<br />Sorry without knowing what is on your cd it is hard to give further advice on what action needs to happen.
<br />
<br />Happy to answer more if you reply what is on the CD.
<br />
<br />Thanks
<br />Julian - Independent advisor

<br />Open Windows Media Player (click your Start Button, then just type wmp and hit Enter)
<br />
<br />Then, insert the CD into your PC, that should appear in Windows Media Player and automatically start playing

                    I cannot for the life of me get my Windows 7 PC to successfully connect and REMAIN connected to my smartphone running Android ICS. I have tried and tried, and searched for answers, all to no avail. I've seen similar questions being asked on various sites,
 and they give similar answers about drivers and ports, devices, adapters, etc. I have tried all of these things. I bought a Sandisk adapter for the Micro SD card in my phone, and at least got the computer to recognize the card and let me browse it for only
 a few minutes. After that amount of time, or whenever I tried to exchange any files from or to either, t would freeze and tell me that there was no drive in that location. It's only an 8 GB card. I searched for any driver I could find as advised by the built-in
 troubleshooting software to no avail. My computer is completely updated, as is my smartphone. I have gotten the computer to recognize it as a storage device a few times, after which a window showed up stating that the drive ne

<p>This is a known issue and will never be fixed. Therefore, compact your folders manually. The counter will be reset to zero, and a manual compact won't hang.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.

<p>If you get it the habit of compacting before the 100th closing, (i.e. once a week, or so), you will never see the prompt again.&nbsp;

<h2>            Backup options&#58;  Just want to save what is updated &#40;added and deleted&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I used to use XP's Backup program but it seemed very convoluted and illogical. &nbsp;But maybe I didn't understand it properly. &nbsp;Here's what I want to do which I would think most everyone would want. &nbsp;I want the backup to reflect what has been both added and
 deleted since the last backup. &nbsp;So I go to Run and enter "ntbackup.exe" and this bring up a window called Backup or Restore Wizard. &nbsp;There is no Help section to explain the most important things we all need to know: &nbsp;The difference between the type of backups
 offered. &nbsp;Typical Microsoft design: Completely devoid of logic. &nbsp;Even this page doesn't display in my browser correctly! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On this page:&nbsp;https://support2.microsoft.com/kb/308422?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>it describes a little. &nbsp;But it leaves out the description of the types of backups offered. &nbsp;Unbelievable. &nbsp;Here they are:</p>
<p>Normal<br />
Copy<br />
Incremental<br />
Differential<br />
Daily</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would imagine I'm looking at either Incremental or Differential. &nbsp;How about "What has changed?" &nbsp;Is that not pure logic? &nbsp;If I deleted it I don't want it to be backed up. &nbsp;If I added it I want it to be backed up. &nbsp;Logic has eluded this company. &nbsp;And this
 is not the only company that makes backup software that is illogical in this area! That is very important to mention. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And obviously I don't want it to touch anything that hasn't been changed to minimize the work. &nbsp;So does either Incremental or Differential do that? &nbsp;Just saw (buried in this program) an explanation that most users wouldn't understand very well: &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Incremental it says "Backs up selected files only if they were created or modified since the previous backup". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Differential it says "Backs up selected files only if they were created or modified since the previous backup but does not mark them as backed up". &nbsp;I have no idea if either will do what I want. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted this under Files, Folders and Online storage having no idea if this is the best topic to post under. &nbsp;Your recommendations are most welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention I'm pretty sure I tried both and both didn't add or delete the proper files but maybe I had something set wrong. &nbsp;I'd love to get this to work properly so I don't have to bother learning another program outside of XP.</p>

            <p>I've seen too many reports of problems with the backup system available in Windows XP ("Windows Backup" or ntbackup.exe) to suggest that anyone rely on it.&nbsp;
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTBackup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTBackup</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, almost any backup system will implement at least three types of backup schemes:&nbsp; full backup (which is what it sounds like), incremental backup, and differential backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incremental and differential backups are similar.&nbsp; Both start with a full backup.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>An incremental backup creates backups of files that have changed (or are new) since the last backup.&nbsp; In this case "the last backup" includes prior incremental backups.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full Backup 1:&nbsp; backs up everything</p>
<p>Incremental Backup 1:&nbsp; backs up files that have changed or are new since Full Backup 1</p>
<p>Incremental Backup 2:&nbsp; backs up files that have changed or are new since Incremental Backup 1</p>
<p>Incremental Backup 3:&nbsp; backs up files that have changed or are new since Incremental Backup 2</p>
<p>etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A differential backup creates backups of files that have changed (or are new) since the last full backup.&nbsp; For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full Backup 1:&nbsp; backs up everything</p>
<p>Differential Backup 1:&nbsp; backs up files that have changed or are new since Full Backup 1</p>
<p>Differential Backup 2:&nbsp; backs up files that have changed or are new since Full Backup 1</p>
<p>Differential Backup 3:&nbsp; backs up files that have changed or are new since Full Backup 1</p>
<p>etc. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The main difference is that each incremental backup is smaller than the corresponding differential backup, but when restoring an entire system, you need the last full backup and
<strong>all</strong> the intermediate incremental backups but only the latest differential backup.</p>

<p>99.99% of users want to save what they added, keep what they didn't touch and for the stuff they deleted obviously those files should be deleted from the backup. &nbsp;So simple. &nbsp;Why is this hard to grasp I wonder? &nbsp;Why would anyone want to keep something that
 has been deleted? &nbsp;Maybe I'm just dense in this area. &nbsp;</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Maybe they didn't want to keep it after deletion...</p>
<p>Or just maybe they deleted it accidentally and,&nbsp;if it was then automatically deleted from the backup, they would have been out of luck&nbsp;trying to&nbsp;restore it. Is it conceivable to you that you would never accidentally (or even deliberately) delete a file and
 then find that you want it back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are planning for the eventuality of having to use a backup then you should also consider what the restore process is likely to be. Then you should test that restore process to</p>
<p>a) Make sure it works and that you know how to make it work</p>
<p>b) Make sure that it is practical for you</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your restore process going to be like if you need it after, say, 100 incremental backups?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you <em>need </em>it is not a good time to find out you only <em>thought </em>
you knew how to use it, or that you thought it was backing up files that actually weren't being backed up,&nbsp;or that you thought it was going to be easier than it turned out to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW I used NTBackup for years, a couple of my customers still do (even though IMO they shouldn't be). Regardless of the wrongs and rights of continuing the use of NTBackup what I can say is that on a mixture of backup to internal and (predominantly) external
 drives I have never encountered a corrupt backup. Having said that, I doubt that restores from "just in case" backups have been necessary more that 10-20 times out of tens of thousands of&nbsp;backups, maybe there were some corrupt backups in the ones that I never
 had to use for restore, I will never know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also used it to effect data transfer between PCs which, by definition, forces a restore. I have probably done this&nbsp;100+ times and never had a problem with the restore phase (though admittedly this has rarely, if ever,&nbsp;been&nbsp;acomplished via&nbsp;USB devices).
 IMO it is a reliable tool if you know how to use it and it is appropriate to (and compatible with) your environment.</p>

 is trying to help. &nbsp;But almost all the info is just legaleze to protect them. &nbsp;Please don't ever send Microsoft links. &nbsp;Totally useless for 99% of the population.

<p>
</p><p>If it was deleted accidentally it will be in the backup before that! &nbsp;If its recent you just input the info again as its fresh in your memory. &nbsp;The point of backup is not to do things like this at all for almost everybody. &nbsp;If the user is deleting random
 files accidentally they shouldn't be on a computer at all. &nbsp;This is not the point of backup software. &nbsp;Backup software protects the user against theft, fire and hardware breakdown. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As to the restore process, I've never understood this at all. &nbsp;If I backup writing.doc I expect to see writing.doc in the backup. &nbsp;Not some bizarre file type that I need Microsoft to open. &nbsp;This is another very odd "feature" of this program. &nbsp;If I want encryption
 I'll encrypt the thing. &nbsp;Is there a point to using a different file type?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&nbsp;What is your restore process going to be like if you need it after, say, 100 incremental backups?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand. I would only keep a few backups if I'm backing up every day. &nbsp;Maybe 2 weeks worth I guess. &nbsp;Or keep one longer every week. &nbsp;Nobody needs 100 backups. &nbsp;99% of the time people only are&nbsp; interested in the last one saved anyway!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; NTBackup - a couple of my customers still do (even though IMO they shouldn't be).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is interesting. &nbsp;What would you think would be preferable to using NTBackup?</p>
<p>Your other points make perfect sense to my basic computer skills. &nbsp;Very much appreciated. &nbsp;You are definitely one of the most valuable people on this forum.</p>

<p>You'll find both positive and negative opinions about all of the following products, but as far as I know, they will all do a good reliable job.&nbsp; You do need to test your backups from time to time, however.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Most of these are NOT free.&nbsp; If there is a free edition, it may or may not do what you want.&nbsp; I'm not familiar with the details; you'll have to do some research.&nbsp; Some of these include disk cloning or imaging capability in addition to file backup.&nbsp; Casper
 is primarily a disk cloning tool, but it uses what seems to amount to a differential cloning operation, so images after the first one don't take as long to create.&nbsp; The grand-daddy of imaging/backup is Norton Ghost, but Symantec discontinued Ghost some time
 in 2013.<br />

            One of the most important features of a backup program, and I would think they all do this, is to only pay attention to differences. &nbsp;If you have 2tb of data and only 10mb has been changed, that should just take a few seconds. &nbsp;Now if you don't specify
 that, and it copies over all 2tb, that's going to waste a huge amount of resources and time. &nbsp;Does anybody know if there a a specific word to describe this feature in the backup world? &nbsp;The bigger your drive the more important this gets. &nbsp;And would the program
 know something has&nbsp; been changed by when it was changed and compared that to the last backup?

<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>Then the backup program you are using is useless to you in the event of a disaster. Repeating what I said earlier</p>

<p>If I backup writing.doc I expect to see writing.doc in the backup.&nbsp; Not some bizarre file type that I need Microsoft to open.</p>

<p>You need to think about NTBackup as more like creating a zip file that can only be opened by NTBackup in order to effect a restore. Many backup programs work this way, not just Microsoft's offering and most (if not all) use their own proprietary backup file
 format.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>If I want encryption I'll encrypt the thing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It isn't encryption, its a backup file that contains all files that you requested to be backed up but condensed into one file. Because NTBackup creates a catalog of the backup as part of that backup file, it can always re-create the contents even if the
 file is taken to a completely different PC.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Is there a point to using a different file type?</p>

<p>NTBackup has it's own file format, just like Word, Excel and many other pieces of software including other backup programs.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I don't understand. I would only keep a few backups if I'm backing up every day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Evidently you haven't read and/or understood LemP's description of what the various backup types are. An incremental backup is no good for what you seem to think is the only reason for backing up, unless you have the base backup that the incremental backup
 applies to (and all subsequent incremental backups). Incremental backups without the first full backup are only any good for restoring the files that are part of that incremental backup. To effect total system recovery from an incremental backup you start
 with the initial full backup and then restore every incremental backup taken since that full backup. Or, to put it another way, the last incremental backup is useless for full recovery without every backup taken prior to that going back as far as the initial
 full backup.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>99% of the time people only are&nbsp; interested in the last one saved anyway!</p>

<p>I really think that it's about time that you&nbsp;started thinking that people that think like you are nowhere near 99% of PC users. Or maybe you should just stop using inappropriate hyperboles.</p>
<p>

<p>What would you think would be preferable to using NTBackup?</p>

<p>I am not going to tell you what package&nbsp;I think you should be using because I fear that I would just be making
<a href="http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/make+a+rod+for+own+back" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
a rod for my own back</a>. I feel sure that if (when?) you didn't understand it, you would just come back here and tell me I am idiot for recommending it. LemP has given you some options (none of which is what I use), I would suggest that you research them
 (and others). Having said that, I will make these points:</p>

<li>If time&nbsp;to make a&nbsp;backup is of no consequence and backup media capacity is also not a limiting factor, I see no real reason to use anything other than full backup (or partial full backup). However, having said that,
<strong><em>I </em></strong>am receptive to other people's opinions and will happily be educated by people with different IT experiences and/or environments (provided that they give valid and reasoned argument).</li><li>IMO, if you really are that infallible that backup will only be needed for full system recovery, then every backup you do should be a full backup, not incremental, nor differential (unless one of the restrictions in point&nbsp;1 applies).</li><li>IMO, NTBackup is a perfectly good program for backing up <em><strong>data </strong>
</em>stored on XP (and other earlier Microsoft OS), though&nbsp;not so for later OS where, although it can be made to work (in some circumstances), it is not supported (and certainly will not work for OS recovery).</li><li>If you want the restore to include the OS and all of its settings then I would not recommend NTBackup.</li></ol>

    <title>Xbox One Controller PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spikerzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller PC</h2>
                    
<p>I got a game that works on all my computers except one with the controller, it is American Truck Simulator, I have the version that was out on January 24th, I noticed my version on one computer was for October 29th 2015, it works perfectly on this game,
 my other computer has the January 29th version of this driver, it works perfectly, but the January 24th driver on my 3rd computer does not work for this game.</p>

<p>My question is, can I install a different driver on this machine? I looked all over the net for this and the only driver I can find is for 2014, that works but the Z Access don't in this game that great with this version, plus it is such an old driver, I
 could see other games having this issue.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, there is no way to install the driver from my other PC's, but if there is can someone tell me? I either want the newest driver or the one from the two dates I mentioned.</p>

<p>Yeah, I don't think you can do that..... I could be wrong though.</p>
<p>It's a bit strange because windows should automatically update the drivers, so they should all be the same I'd of thought. I take it you have checked for updates to Windows? I feel like I'm wasting your time now lol, can't find anything on the net.</p>
<p>I had a few issues with the wireless adapter at first, that was just a case of going into the registry and deleting the dodgy driver, then updating windows to get the new driver that wasn't broken. I'll keep digging around for you, not sure what else to
 suggest in the meantime.</p>

<h2>            Cod&#58; Ghosts Wrong Language&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I bought CoD Ghosts on games on Demand today but it seems like I got the wrong language.</p>
<p>I wanted to have the game in English and not in Frensh. Is there any way I can change the language over?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>You can't </p>
<p>Most triple A titles don't support changing languages in game</p>
<p>Most games are published in the supported language of your region</p>
<p>If you want English content for cod you must buy the end disk</p>

<p>well, &nbsp;I found the answer to my own problem by myself. &nbsp;I went to the list of Microsoft updates downloaded and installed on my computer and saw that the last two were about the time that the Outlook mail problems began. &nbsp;I uninstalled the two updates and
 after a little refreshing of information, I got my Outlook back to the way the software should work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>every update from Microsoft is obviously not a wise update. &nbsp;it is interesting that Microsoft would push updates that confuse their own software programs. &nbsp; my motto is, &nbsp;if it ain't broke, don't fix it.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Not Using Processor Cores Effectively - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> outsmart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Not Using Processor Cores Effectively</h2>
                    I recently installed Windows 7 Professional on my Core 2 Duo system (Latitude E6400 /&nbsp;Intel P9600, 4GB DDR2), but it seems like Windows is not using the two cores efficiently. When I had XP, if a process was very active it could only max out 1 core so
 other programs would still run smoothly on the second core. In Win7, I'm having programs max out the whole thing consistently and it grinds me to a halt.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to change processor behavior on Windows 7?

<p>I had similar&nbsp;problems with my Latitude E6400 as well, however it was a problem with the notebook's hardware that was fixed by updating the BIOS. What BIOS version are you using? (it displays when you boot the laptop up during the first screen with the DELL
 logo) It will be A12 or A14 or something like that. You can check on the dell website for the latest BIOS edition and if yours isn't up to date that might be the issue.
<br />
<br />
Just make sure you understand the risks associated with updating your bios, and make sure that you follow the instructions exactly as they are documented on the Dell download. If your unsure have a professional update the bios.</p>

<p>For some reason, the default Windows 7 Pro Installation configured use of only 1 core. To fix the problem, I had to run "MSCONFIG", then</p>
<p>"boot" tab --&gt; click "Advanced" --&gt; check "cores" option --&gt; enter "2"</p>
<p>Hopefully that solves the problem</p>

<p><span>This feature is only meant to specify the number of cores that are used during boot time. (so from when Windows starts booting just
 after the POST&nbsp;until just before you get to the logon.)<br />
<br />
I have read anecdotally that this may increase the performance of the boot up, I don't think this should have an effect on the way Windows 7 is using the cores on the computer.<br />
<br />
Since I have the same hardware I'm testing to see if there is a change in performance. and I'll post back with my observations.</span></p>

            Quite right, windows 7 is still maxing out both cores at once. I am very disappointed with Windows 7 so far, it doesn't seem to handle heavy processing very well

            There's nothing in XP to prevent a process from using more than one core, in fact usually this behaviour is desirable.&nbsp; This doesn't depend on the OS, but on the program that is running.&nbsp; If the process that is maxing out your CPU is part of Windows, then
 it may be that the process in question is single-threaded in Windows XP but multi-threaded in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, however, one or more processes running CPU-bound shouldn't grind you to a halt, unless perhaps they are running with a higher than normal priority.&nbsp; The active process gets a priority boost which should ensure it gets enough CPU time to
 at least present the user interface properly.&nbsp; So, there may be something else going on.<br />
<br />
Are you running anti-virus software?&nbsp; Is it Windows 7 compatible?<br />

            I am running ESET NOD32 which is windows 7 compatible, but have the same problem when I disable it. Programs like Google Chrome or&nbsp;MS Outlook&nbsp;regularly max out both cores at once. Mind you, I do have 40 windows open, but I do have 4GB of RAM and under
 windows XP, when a program needed a lot of resources it could only monopolize 1 core (50% of the chip) which was extremely efficient.

            <p>I'm really baffled by my system, example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Win 7 Enterprise, 64 Bit, 8GB RAM,&nbsp; Intel Xeon, 2 cores</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there's a process that needs full CPU, it will use 50% CPU, that's one full core, the second core is at 0-5%, but the system slows down to a halt, why Win7 doesn' use the second core for other processes and waits until the first core is available?</p>
