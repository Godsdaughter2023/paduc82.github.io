<h2>            My Realtek High Definition Audio microphone isn&#39;t working.</h2>
                    <p>It's built into my laptop and suddenly stopped working one day. It is set to default device, volume turned up, and says it's working properly, but when I do the speech recognition it says "Sorry, is your mic muted?" even though the volume is all the way
 up. It also won't catch anything in Skype with the test calls. Help? I have Windows 7 starter.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Was it working fine earlier?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The following are some of the reasons that may cause this type of issues:</span></p>
<p><span>1. The microphone&nbsp;may&nbsp;not be&nbsp;close enough to pick up your voice. Make sure that the microphone is positioned close enough and that you are speaking directly into it.<br />
<br />
2. The microphone is muted. Some microphones have an external control for muting. Make sure the mute control is turned off.<br />
<br />
3. The microphone input level is too low. Make sure that the microphone input level is set properly.<br />
<br />
<strong>To adjust the microphone input level<br />
</strong><br />
a. Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound.
<br />
b. Click the Recording tab.<br />
c. Double-click the microphone that you use for Speech Recognition.<br />
d. Click the Levels tab, and then use the slider to set the input level for your microphone.<br />
<br />
4. The microphone connections are not properly attached. Make sure the microphone wires are intact and unbroken. The connections to the computer might be loose, so unplug the wires and reconnect them, making sure they fit snugly.<br />
<br />
5. A different microphone is selected for use with Speech Recognition. If you have more than one microphone installed on your computer, the wrong one might be selected for use with Speech Recognition. Make sure that you're using the microphone selected for
 Speech Recognition.<br />
<br />
<strong>To change which microphone is used with Speech Recognition<br />
</strong><br />
a. Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound.&nbsp;<br />
b. Click the Recording tab.<br />
c. Select the microphone that you want to use with Speech Recognition, and then click Set Default.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Photos won&#39;t stay rotated when uploading to Ebay.</h2>
                    When I upgraded to Windows 10 in the fall, I had the problem with my rotated photos not uploading to Ebay that way.&nbsp; I went through the steps and now have the default app for the Windows Photo Viewer and haven't had any problems until this week.&nbsp; I haven't
 uploaded photos to Ebay since the 3rd week of December and now when I am trying to again, I am back to the same problem.&nbsp; I rotate them using the photo viewer just like I have been the past few months. and they won't load to Ebay that way.&nbsp; What has changed
 and what do I do now?

            Ok.&nbsp; I'm using Firefox and everything has been going fine after I upgraded to Windows 10 in the fall and downloaded the Windows Photo Viewer and set that as my default.&nbsp; I was trying to do business as usual and haven't upgraded anything and now suddenly
 it is not working again.&nbsp; I went in and made sure that the Windows Photo Viewer was set as the default just in case.&nbsp; I am able to turn the photos when I upload them to Ebay, but that means that I have to do it twice, once in the computer and again when I
 upload them.&nbsp; Very time consuming and frustrating especially since this hasn't been happening.

            Hi - DVD burning success depends on what program you are using to burn and what type of files you are burning - you also need to specify how you want to use the disc when it has been created... Fill in the gaps and someone will try to help.... Cheers,
 Ric.

            I'm on Microsoft Windows 10, burn a CD from previously stored music on my PC in Windows Media Player in my HP tower drive, the burned CD will be used to play the transferred music on a CD player etc.

<p>Hi - this is where the detail is important! You originally stated you are using new
<strong>DVD-R </strong>(not CD)...</p>
<p>So - is it a DVD disc (which won't work in a CD player anyway) or a CD disc?</p>

<p>OK thanks - now I know where to start looking... WMP has become increasingly unreliable in Windows 10 - MS is allowing it to wither away and I expect it will disappear altogether before too long. They're even ditching key aspects of Groove music.</p>
<p>Is your blank CD showing up in <strong>This PC</strong> in the DVD/CD<strong> drive</strong>? It should be showing 700 mb free space or something similar.</p>

<p>I'd try a different batch of discs for starters... How about other disc functions like playback of music CDs - is that all OK? Also - What make is the blank disc? Another thing that springs to mind... it's not marked 'for Audio' is it? This has cropped up
 before, where users have purchased blank discs that were intended for use with stand-alone CD recorders - these are not PC compatible.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello, Thanks for your advice, I did but in a dick from the pack at random, and it worked, but after trying 6-10 other CD-R none of them worked. So I know these disk's are old, so yes I will pickup some new ones this week. I assume because one in the batch
 worked that this is what my problem was. I'll get back after trying the new disks. Thanks

<h2>            Windows 7 windows explorer stops working cannot open folders</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 7 Ultimate with all updates. The issue is explorer just seems to stop. When it does stop it will stop in 2 different ways.</p>
<p>1. Programs and folders will not open, cannot even open the start menu.</p>
<p>2. Programs open, start menu opens, but cannot open any folders, click on start and then computer nothing happens, the Windows Explorer folder on the task will show folder when right clicked, but it will not open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no errors and when I look at the Action Center Maintenance nothing shows up saying there was a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing I can do is start the task manager and stop explorer and then restart it and then all is well for a while. I cannot determine what is causing this.</p>
<p>I ran the sfc/scannow and it says everything is OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reg cleaning, defragging, virtually everything I can think of and the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clues anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Jim:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Win 7 Home Premium (x64 machine)&nbsp;&amp; starting a couple of weeks ago, Win Explorer acts really bizarre:&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Very often</span> stops,&nbsp;freeze up &amp; shut down on its own;
<p>
</p><p>This has become very frustrating, especially when I have more than one window open, lose everything due to shutdown &amp; have to start over, &amp; over,
</p>
<p>&amp; over, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even my Start Menu has been acting weird: Selections won't open; Menu may close after clicking a selection, but selection doesn't open; Recent Items used to list recent docs, etc., with dialog box-option to remove an item&nbsp;from the&nbsp;list, but lately recent
 'Places' are listed instead&nbsp;(no recent 'Items' in list),&nbsp;with full dialog box &amp; all typical options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refuse to downgrade to Win 10. I suspect MS has purposely screwed with Win 7, hoping to force users into 'upgrade?' by dropping almost all Win 7 support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Menu 'Help' is virtually useless in that it won't expand into online support.</p>
<p>I posed this problem/question in another post on this site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck (we'll all need some), Hank</p>

<p>Hey Hank,</p>
<p>You described my issue better than I did myself. I have an I7 8 Gig 1T HD&nbsp; HP computer which is very fast and about 8 months ago is when I started having the issue. Also my computer seems to be very slow, I have to wait for seconds before a mouse click works
 sometime. I have tried everything. My Windows Exp report is&nbsp; 7.6, 7.7, 5.9, 5.9, 5.9 with my 1T HD with the 250G SSD it is 7.9, 7.9, 5.9, 5.9, 5.9 not really sure why the SSD increases the first 2 numbers but it does. Anyway NO reason for the computer to NOT
 respond. </p>
<p>I too refuse to downgrade to the invasive Win 10. </p>
<p>Yes we will need some good luck here. I am glad to know I am not alone. </p>
<p>Jim</p>

<p>Hi Jim:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, sometimes it's good to hear that someone else is having the same issues, not wanting anyone else to even have issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I posted another issue re: Help &gt; Online Help, at Start &gt; Help. It's under 'Desktop, Start, Personalization'. You should take a look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't help but suspect that&nbsp;these two issues are somehow related, with ties directly back to MS &amp; their effort to force-feed us Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">do not</span> think any one of us individual users&nbsp;is having near-identical&nbsp;issues due to garbage-in by us, as individuals. I do believe in coincidence, but not regarding these issues, they are much too similar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good to discuss the issues with you. I'm going to watch these threads hoping someone will have some suggestions to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't do this (issue-posting) much as doing so is&nbsp;usually futile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Day to You, Hank</p>

<p>Perhaps you have an afflicted Explorer Shell Extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shell Extensions are things that get added to Explorer by other programs you install and sometimes without your consent or knowledge.&nbsp; Many Shell Extensions are what pop up in a list when you right click something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time afflicted Explorer Shell Extnsions result in an error message like this and often when right clicking things:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa53d539-e22c-408a-8ce3-3afa164b2ba9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aa53d539-e22c-408a-8ce3-3afa164b2ba9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is easy to reproduce you could temporarily disable all non Microsoft Explorer Shell Extensions and see how things look.&nbsp; If things look better you can enable the non MS extensions one at a time or in little groups until the problem returns and
 then using a process of elimination isolate the problematic extension.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some instructions from another topic to get you started.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will just take a few minutes to disable all the non MS extensions, restart your system and see how things look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If thing are better you can fault isolate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is no change you can enable all the extensions again and look for other ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When Windows Explorer (not Internet Explorer) is misbehaving (especially when right clicking), start to suspect third party Explorer extension add-ons.&nbsp; You may also see Data Execution Prevention (DEP) errors.&nbsp; DEP errors are reported when Windows feels
 threatened by a program and Windows will shut down the threatening program.&nbsp; Windows should never feel threatened by Windows Explorer (or Internet Explorer) unless some add-on is the cause.<br />
<br />
Those would be Explorer extensions that do not belong to Microsoft.&nbsp; That means extensions that you added.&nbsp; Explorer extensions are usually okay and installing some applications will install Explorer extensions for you, give you a choice and sometimes they
 can be added without your knowledge when you install new software.<br />
<br />
Explorer extensions are sometimes added as a new right click option you see on folders and files (like scan this file, open this file, play this song).<br />
<br />
If there is a particular thing you do when Exploring that you know will cause the problem, that will help zero in on the problem and help you know for sure when you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
If you can make it happen anytime you want, make an adjustment and then there is no message the next time you do whatever it is you do, you have found and fixed it.<br />
<br />
First you need a way to see what Explorer add-ons you have installed now and a way to disable them (not uninstall them) so you can figure out which one is causing the problem.&nbsp; You may have lots of non Microsoft extensions installed you don't even know about.<br />
<br />
Download ShellExView from here to see which Explorer extensions you have loaded:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/shexview.html</a><br />
<br />
ShellExView doesn't install anything on your computer, it just runs and displays.<br />
<br />
After you launch ShellExView (double click shexview.exe) and acknowledge the security warning, adjust the column widths so you can see everything clearly.&nbsp; Under Options, choose to "Mark Non-Microsoft Extensions" and the non Microsoft extensions will be in
 light pink, but on some systems that is a hard color to see, so click View, Choose Columns and move up or move down the Microsoft column so it is closer to the top (Move Up) so you can see it on your screen without having to scroll left and right.<br />
<br />
Next, click the column header called Microsoft (it may be way out on the right side of the screen) to sort the display (by clicking the Microsoft column header) so all the non Microsoft extensions are at the top and easy to see.&nbsp; They will say "No" and be marked
 in pink since they are not Microsoft extensions, something like this: </p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6beeb67e-eecd-425a-9beb-420f442ef43c" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The non Microsoft extensions would be things you have added (non Microsoft) and are what you need to be suspecting.<br />
<br />
If you see extensions that do not have anything listed under Description, Product Name, Version, Company or have peculiar names that looks like they might be just random numbers and&nbsp; letters, you might want to look at those first.<br />
<br />
You can also Google the name of a suspicious add-on and see if there are any hits regarding Explorer crashes or DEP errors and what other people have done about it.<br />
<br />
You might Google something like:<br />
<br />
&lt;my-suspicious-add-on&gt;&nbsp; windows explorer crashing<br />
<br />
You have to fill in the name of your suspicious add on.<br />
<br />
See what kind of search results hits you get and look for solutions or situations that sound like yours.<br />
<br />
I am not a trial and error advocate, but I can't think of another way to do this...<br />
<br />
Right click and disable the non Microsoft extensions one at a time (or perhaps in little groups of 3-5) keeping a list so you can enable them again later if desired. The result of the change is immediate and no reboot is required.&nbsp; Test your (right click) failure
 condition.&nbsp; If Explorer starts to act normally, you will know that some extension you just disabled in that group of 3-5 is the culprit so you can start to enable them one at a time until explorer fails again.</p>
<p><br />
One user reported that there was a need to restart Explorer after each adjustment so to do that press Ctrl-E from within ShellExView.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you recognize any extensions that may have been added or downloaded recently, start with those first.<br />
<br />
Disabling an extension does not uninstall the extension - it is just disabled.&nbsp; You can always enable it again later, so keep track of things by writing them down.<br />
<br />
Disable them one at a time or in little groups (to make things go faster) until your right click does not generate an error, then reboot and test again to be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; That last extension you disabled would be the suspicious one.<br />
<br />
You can also just disable all the non Microsoft extensions, reboot, test your failure condition and enable them one at a time until you find the one that generates the failure condition.<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of extensions, you could disable them is little groups, 3-5 at a time instead of 1 at a time until your system starts to behave. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does behave, you will know that the problem is one of the extensions in that little group and you can enable those in the group one at a time until the problem comes back, then the problem will be with the last extension you enabled.<br />
<br />
The hope is that you will find the one extension that causes the problem and then you can figure out what to do about it - either uninstall it or see if you can get an update from the maker of the extension from their web page.<br />
<br />
I don't have your issue but I can when you disable/enable the extensions, the extension is immediately disabled, so disabling an extension does not seem to require a reboot but if you think you found the problem, I would reboot and retest anyway to really be
 sure the problem is gone.<br />
<br />
If you post up a list of your non Microsoft extensions, maybe someone will recognize it as a potential problem.<br />
<br />
If you find the offending extension that is the problem, please let us know what it is so I can add it to my list!

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade after reimage - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade after reimage</h2>
                    I recently had all the windows 10 icons and reserved my copy but due to some malacious software I restored my computer back to factory settings. Since doing so I have done all the updates but still have yet to see the golden ticket icon in the bottom right
 hand corner of my computer. Should I be concerned or just sit bak and wait?

                    I would like to start by saying I run Windows7 with IE10. Running on a Toshiba Satellite. Beginning 2 days ago I downloaded a few software programs for DJ mixing. Everything seemed fine. I then went to youtube to watch a few tutorials on how to use the
 software. I had about 4 screens open and my computer crashed. Upon restarting, I brought up the same tabs, and my computer froze again. But this time I was able to bring my processes up to see what was going on. Upon checking processes I notice that my Iexplore.exe
 was running extremely high. It usually only runs about 25k memory, no matter what task im doing, but it was running 200k+ at that specific time. I then ended all processes of Iexplore.exe and retried it. It would not go away. 1) When I run a normal screen
 of google browser or something simple, its already 100k memory which is 4x higher than normal. 2) When I go to more complicated screens like youtube or facebook it suddenly jumps to about 200k+ minimum. 3) I mainly use my comp

Being in the Insider program will cause your console to update more frequently since you'll be testing new features. The best thing you can do is turn on automatic updates, but sometimes if an update is mandatory and can't be delayed, you may see a forced update like that.</p><p><br /></p><p>_______________________________________________________</p>

<h2>            Windows Defender Security Center Battery warning</h2>
                    My laptop shows this yellow exclamation symbol on the Windows Defender tray icon, and when look to investigate, it states that the Health Report has found that setting my brightness to 100% shortens the battery life of my laptop. Since I use my laptop
 while plugged in almost all of the time, this feature is a bit useless to me. How do I disable this?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If you are referring to Creative Prodikeys 104Key Keyboard then it is compatible with windows 7.
</p>
<p>If you are referring to some other keyboard then I would suggest you to check it’s compatibility in windows 7 compatibility center or with the manufacturer.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 deactivated itself after I made some minor system changes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwinbarton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 deactivated itself after I made some minor system changes and won&#39;t reactivate.</h2>
                    <p>First a little background:&nbsp; I dual boot Windows and Linux, with my onboard ethernet adapter enabled I was having problems getting my wireless internet connection to function properly on Linux because software kept trying to connect to the internet through
 the ethernet connection (which isn't connected to anything) and only after it tried repeatedly and failed would it then go to my Wifi connection.&nbsp; I'm guessing the fact that I disabled the onboard ethernet adapter is the reason Windows 10 Pro deactivated itself
 (which doesn't really make much sense since the motherboard, cpu, and several other components never changed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Activation page in Settings I see an error message saying "We can't activate Windows on this device as the product key you entered doesn't match the hardware profile.&nbsp; If you recently repaired Windows or made significant hardware changes to this device,
 select Troubleshoot to try and fix the problem or go to the Store to buy Genuine Windows.&nbsp; Error code: 0xC004F034" with a link below that that says "Learn more".&nbsp; I ran the Activation troubleshooter and it gave me the following message "We found a Windows
 10 Pro digital license for this device running Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; To activate using this digital license you need to install Windows 10 Pro.", I ALREADY HAVE WINDOWS 10 PRO INSTALLED ON THIS MACHINE!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point during this whole mess I clicked a link on the Activation troubleshooter window (which was next to impossible to see since the link is in black text on a black background (really smart move there Microsoft)) and a window labeled Account opened
 and told me something like pick the machine I wanted to activate Windows 10 on, but for some reason the machine with the issue was not listed (my other computer that I recently retired was, and so was my friends computer that I had setup my user account on
 so I could sync some of my settings to it, but not my main computer that was having the issue!!&nbsp; The only other hardware changes I've recently made were to add more memory, resize my Windows partition after moving my Linux install to a separate drive alltogether
 (Windows 10 Pro is still installed on the same drive it was already on), add a few more hard drives (ones that I had pulled from my computer that I retired, and remove one of my video cards because I moved everything into a different case and I needed to install
 my pcie sata card again in order to support the additional hard drives (I've had this card in use before with this install of Windows 10.&nbsp; Other than that the rest of the system is still the same as when I initially installed the currently installed build
 of Windows 10 Pro in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling the Windows 10 Activation center, and once I explained my issue (that I was an Insider and had never had a printed license key for this copy of Windows 10 Pro), they forwarded my call to Tech Support, where after being put on hold for 20
 minutes, then talking to the support person and getting hung up on before they could finish telling me something, and then having to call the Activation Center again (since I hadn't been given the direct number to Tech Support during my previous call), and
 going through the whole explanation again, I was finally told that they don't provide support for Insiders (why couldn't the first person I spoke to in the first call tell me this?) and that my only option was to use the Insiders website to try to get support.&nbsp;
 So here I am hoping somehow to get my install of Windows 10 Pro reactivated.&nbsp; And seriously considering trying to go back to Windows 7 and washing my hands of the whole Windows 10 debacle, if it weren't for the fact that I have spent a great deal of time customizing
 the overall look and feel of my Windows 10 install, and that I actually do use a handful of the Windows Store apps, I probably would do exactly that and just install Windows 7 again.&nbsp; That or if I didn't use a number of programs that run only on Windows (and
 not under WINE on Linux) I'd consider going Linux permanently.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I have too much invested in both time and money in Windows software to just throw it all away.&nbsp; So hopefully someone can help me reactivate my install of Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Edwin Barton</p>

<p>Its working for me now.</p>
<p>Yes this has been a major problem for me as I use my Phone WiFi to use internet and it's a Ad-Hoc Network. Somehow my Wifi Dongle from "D-Link" is able to detect and connect to any Ad-Hoc network. This wnot possible with the in-built wireless lan in the
 laptop.</p>
<p>Earlier I had tried the longer route through CMD mentioned in the chains of responses here, but the WiFi network used to drop put very frequently. So I sticked with the WiFi Dongle solution instead.</p>
<p>Recently, I again tried to connect to the Ad-Hoc network hoping that some recent Windows Patch would have fixed the problem. Alas the same "Exclamation Mark" in the taskbar, saying I have limited connection and no link to Internet. Then I ran Network Diagnostics
 on the same to see if that brings out something new. The result was a message saying "DHCP not enabled for your &lt;Wireless LAN Name&gt;". I let the Diagnostic Tool do an autofix and "Mama Mia", no exclamation mark!!!!!, I am connected to the Internet now.</p>
<p>I tried restarting and reconnecting and it works fine now.</p>
<p>Let me know if this works for everyone.</p>

                    <p>When Microsoft uses the term "Public network", what does it mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the screen shot below</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This is from my 'Control Panel'-'Windows Firewall', taken a couple of minutes ago. Note that "Public networks" is "Not Connected", yet I'm able to browse the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I to conclude that Microsoft thinks that <strong>the Internet is not a public network?</strong> That would be pretty silly, wouldn't it? So, this brings me back around to my question:

<p>
</p><p>You wrote: <em>That's not describing the network specifically, it's more of a description of "how should Windows treat this network for security purposes"</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How Windows should treat the network connection is what I'm attempting (and failing) to figure out.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You wrote: <em>If you tell it that a network is "public" (like a coffee shop free wifi), Windows will treat it with higher security scrutiny and block some ports and communications.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I want one security setup. No "zones".</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>But I feel out of control because I'm not given any technical details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to make this easy. Regarding Inbound, behind what ports does Windows have listeners? Kindly scope all 65,535 ports when listing (but only the ports that actually have listeners of course).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent days on this and I don't think I've made any progress. If I may ask more questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1, Is there a bulk method to mark an extended selection of firewall rules as Action=Block?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2, If "(green checkmark) Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed", and all firewall rules are Enabled=No, does that mean that the firewall is wide open?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3, If "(green checkmark) Outbound connections that do not match a rule are allowed", and all firewall rules are Enabled=Yes, but all have Action=Allow, does that mean that the firewall rules are doing nothing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4, If "(red no-entry) Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked", and all firewall rules are Enabled=No, does that mean that the firewall is totally closed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5, If "(red no-entry) Outbound connections that do not match a rule are blocked", and all firewall rules are Enabled=Yes, and all have Action=Allow, why is the firewall blocking my browser?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Links are okay. Tips on Registry settings are okay too. Links to tips on Registry settings are okay too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Note that after many days searching and reading, I've not found any articles or forum posts that specifically address these issues.

            <p>I'll do my best to go point by point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What ports is Windows listening on?</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">You can run <strong>netstat -aon</strong> at the command line to see what ports are being used right now, and which program is using each one. It lists the PID (Process ID), which you can reference to the Task Manager (or run the
 command <strong>tasklist</strong>) to see the name of the program that's using the port. This also tells you which IP address the port is communicating with, so you can see where your network traffic is going.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. Is there a bulk method to mark an extended selection of firewall rules as Action=Block</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">You can shift+click to select a range of firewall rules and right-click/disable them.&nbsp; If the rules are "allow" rules, than this action of disabling them would effectively block the program from communicating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If Outbound connection is not matched to rule is allowed, does that mean firewall is wide open.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Yes, outbound connections are allowed unless they match a rule. Example,&nbsp;if you downloaded the Facebook app, it would be allowed to make an outbound connection unless you have an outbound rule that blocks it from doing so.<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Basically inbound is "deny unless there's an exception rule" and Outbound is "allow unless there's an exception rule".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Effectively yes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. That would mean it's blocking inbound connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. It shouldn't be. Are you connecting to a port 80 server?&nbsp; When did it begin blocking your browser?&nbsp; Is it listed in the allowed apps list like my Google Chrome here?</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8370efa1-0766-4988-bbfb-ba67087d062b" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also remember this firewall is app-centric.&nbsp; That's because it's far safer to allow an app than a port.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you add an app to the list of allowed apps in a firewall—sometimes called
<span>unblocking</span>—or when you open a firewall port, you allow a specific app to send info to or from your PC through the firewall, as though you drilled a hole in the firewall. This makes your PC less secure and might create opportunities
 for hackers or malware to use one of those openings to get to your files or use your PC to spread malware to other PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A port stays open until you close it, but an allowed app opens the "hole" only when needed. Generally, it's safer to add an app to the list of allowed apps than to open a port.</p>

            <p>Shawn, First: Thank you so much. I feel very privileged to get such help.<br />
</p>
<p>I've done an experiment that illuminates how firewall rules actually work, which, unless you made some simple errors in your reply to me, is slightly different from what you think. The difference is this: Disabling a rule doesn't mean that its connection
 is blocked. Disabling a rule means that the rule isn't applied. Whether that results in a connection blocked or a connection allowed depends upon what the default is.<br />
</p>
</p>

</p>
<p>Call these (left to right) A1, A2, B1, and B2.<br />
</p>
<p>A1: Default is Block. Rule is not applied (not enabled). Result is Block (browser does not work).</p>
<p>A2: Default is Block. Rule is Allow. Result is Allow (browser works).</p>
<p>B1: Default is Allow. Rule is not applied (not enabled). Result is Allow (browser works).</p>
B2: Default is Allow. Rule is Block. Result is Block (browser does not work).
<p>
</p><p>Note that when the rule is Enabled=No, the result tracks the default. But when the rule is Enabled=Yes, the result tracks the rule.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note that there are 2 degenerate cases: A3 (Block+Block) &amp; B3 (Allow+Allow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I'm going to skip being pedantic about what you wrote (some of it doesn't jibe) and get right to the mystery.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><del>The Mystery:</del></strong><del> Suppose ALLOW ALL doesn't exist. Nonetheless, if I enable all Outbound rules (that is, A2 done piecewise), the browser should work, but it doesn't.</del></p>

            <p>I have more info...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default for Inbound connections is to <strong>block</strong>. So by default, the firewall is closed. The default Inbound rules are
<strong>allow</strong> rules, so they partially open the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default for Outbound connections is to <strong>allow</strong>. So by default, the firewall is open. The default Outbound rules are
<strong>allow</strong> rules, so they don't do anything. Why are the Outbound rules
<strong>allow</strong> rules if they do nothing? Because the Outbound rules were designed for people who want to change the default for Outbound connections to
<strong>block</strong>. That's what I've done, but there isn't a rule that allows Windows Update. That's what I need.</p>

<p>Hi Slade35,</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to disable the security software if installed any to establish the connection.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure you turn on the Security Software once you are done with the test.</p>
<p>Also check if the firewall is blocking the connection.</p>
<p>Turn off the Firewall, and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>Refer the following links which addresses similar issue and follow the steps given:</p>
<p><strong>Unable to find dedicated server in Server Browser<br />
