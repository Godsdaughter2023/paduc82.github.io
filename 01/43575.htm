<h2>            Windows Update Error 80070003 KB3000850, KB3025417, KB2973201</h2>
                    <p>As usual with Microsoft product, those KB have been failing each and every day. Clicked on More Info and downloaded the Window Update Troubleshooter. It found issue with registry key, and some other system settings, and 'fixed' them. But, the fact is it
 is still not fixed and the same update error is just repeating itself everyday. What a frustrating problem with Microsoft product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Microsoft techie or support can fix this issue?</p>

            <p>Couldn't resolve the issue so I took the ultimate fix, ie. refreshing the Surface, restoring the PC to the factory settings but keep all of my personal data (eg. My Documents, Pictures, etc). To do this, go to your PC Settings, then select Recovery. I had
 3 options, and I chose to refresh and keep my personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, refreshing it actually cleared up lots of disk space. My free space was like 900MB out of 128GB. After refresh, I got almost 60GB free space. After installing all software I need, still have about 50GB left, with all of my personal data on
 disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very happy with the result, but still **** Microsoft software. Awaiting Windows 10 and hope it is a miracle.</p>

                    Windows won't update. <br />
My computer says I have 12 important updates ready to install but when I download them and restart my computer it says "configuring updates" and ges to 15%, then finally says it had a "failure to configure updates" and is "reverting the changes" then it starts
 up. It keeps doing this every time I restart and I just want my computer to work properly. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks

            <p><span>Hi,</span><span><br />
<br />
1. Which update are you trying to install?<br />
2. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Which anti-virus software is installed on the computer?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to check the updates history. Let us know the description of those updates.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Check the update history</span></b><b><span><br />

<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span><br />

Note: After trouble shooting put the computer to start as usual by performing step 7 from the above Knowledge Base article<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Manually try installing the updates from Microsoft Download Center.
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Visit the Microsoft download website, type the "KB" number of the update in the search
 box, and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the list of search results, click on the Knowledge Base (KB) article link to go
 to the download page. If there's more than one listing, look for a link that goes to the Microsoft Download Center.</span></p>
<p><span>c. If there are multiple versions on the download page, find the appropriate one for
 your computer. Click on the Download button, and save the update to your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When prompted, click on open to install the update.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b><span>
 An in-place upgrade is the final alternative before you have to reinstall the operating system. Note that it takes the same amount of time to do the upgrade as to reinstall the operating system. Also, some of your customized Windows settings may be lost through
 this process.</span></p>
<p><span>You may performing a repair installation will not damage files and applications that
 are currently installed on your computer. To be on the safer side, I would suggest you to backup your files before you go for repair installation.<br />

                    I have a laptop that came with windows 7 Home Premium x64. the hard drive crashed and I am not able to use the HP recovery partition. my friend uninstalled windows and reinstalled with a Home premium x64 disk he had, but when I try and enter the product
 code from the sticker on the laptop, it says its not valid. he suspects I may need to install the same build as on the sticker which is x15-53758

            The product key was validated by microsoft to be a correct product key for Windows 7 home Premium. but setup will not accept it. Thanks for the support, I was able to using some of this information to contact Microsoft tech support again and they generated
 me a new Product key using the computer ID and install disk serial. <br />
Thanks for your help<br />

            <p>I am sorry but that has been wrong for some time. You can download non DRM from the iTunes website and convert these to MP3 format fairly easily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However even if you have DRM media you can subscribe to extra facilities within iTunes and remove the DRM lock from those files. There is a charge on a per track basis.</p>

            So the only way my son&nbsp;can play ipod/itunes songs&nbsp;he purchased on his xbox&nbsp;is to buy software such as Tuneclone or pay Apple via itunes, as you described above, an additional fee to remove DRM? That doesn't seem right since my son has already paid for
 each song previously.&nbsp; Are you sure that there is not some other method to do this?&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

            <p>That is the entire point of DRM within iTunes it was a copy protection system that only allowed purchased songs to be played on an authorised computer and the only way a computer can be authorised is through iTunes which is not available for XBox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look at this article for a little more details <a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1711</a> but basically you need to subcribe to iTunes Match. This effectively backs up his library to iCloud for an annual subscription. I say "effectively" because it does not actually push the files up but just the fact that
 he owns the files. If he then deletes the files (after a local backup for safeties sake) the restore back from iCloud should then be of a higher bit rate non DRM version of the file. This is because iTunes Store no longer uses DRM on any current purchases.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You then need to convert the .aac file to .mp3, have a read of <a href="http://ipod.about.com/od/advanceditunesuse/ht/Converting-Aac-To-Mp3.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realise that this thread it somewhat old, but just in case anyone finds this thread, the other way would be to just plug in your ipod to the Xbox via a usb cable. The Xbox can then see the tracks on the ipod and play them from there.</p>

<br />
<div>Depends on the type of format you performed.&nbsp; If it was a quick format then it might be possible to recover the data that was on that drive.&nbsp; If it was a full format, then you're SOL as the data has been overwritten.&nbsp; Just do
 a Google search for free undelete programs, you'll get quite a few search hits.</div>

<h2>            Latency and packet loss issues</h2>
                    
<p>Basic info: (problem underneath)</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in? Wisconsin</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number: Motorolla surfboard 400 series</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number: Asus RT-AC88u</p>
<p>How many 360 and One consoles are connected to this router?:</p>
<p>Wired or wireless (for each console): Wired</p>
<p>Things you have tried: resetting/ hard resetting modem, router, and xbox. Switching cables. Switching between wired and wireless. Contacting ISP tech support (see below) manually opening ports</p>
<p>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown Yes</p>
<p>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type? No NAT error, constantly open</p>
<p>Any Error Codes you encounter: none</p>
<p>Who is your ISP?(Internet Service Provider) Time Warner Cable</p>

<p>I have 60 download, 15 upload internet package with TWC and everytime I run a speedtest on xbox, I always get about the same numbers, 60down, 6up, with a latency of 70-90 and packet loss anywhere from 0-4% nearly always 1%. I'm lagging out of games, especially
 halo 5. I've tried everything from resetting all devices to manually opening ports and nothing improves the packet loss or latency, I even got brand new cat6 wires for everything. I contacted the ISP and spent 2 hours jumping through hoops before the guy finally
 tricked me into closing the chat. He ran speedtests between the router and internet and I could see that I was getting 1-5ms latency on just about everything with no packet loss, except xbox which is stuck at 80ms ping and 1% packet loss. ISP tech support
 suggested the ethernet port may be bad on xbox, but if I switch to wireless, I have about the same numbers, albeit a bit smaller download and upload speed. What can I do to fix this problem? I really can't be lagging out of competitive games, especially if
 money or something is on the line, not to mention that lagging out of a game or making it virtually unplayable gives me a $500 paperweight and that's no bueno son</p>

            <p>If it's possible, can you bypass your router and wire your console directly with your motorola surfboard, and have us know the output of your console's network statistics test. More importantly, look at the packet loss. Under "normal" conditions, you should never see packet loss greater than "0".</p>

<p>I recently had this problem (TWC Business Class) (wisconsin) and it was resolved by picking up a 16x4 modem at best buy. &nbsp;NetGear is the most common modem. &nbsp;As a TWC-BC customer, I am not allowed to go the store and pick up a new modem, but I requested a

<p>wish to god xbox would just come out and say there is an issue with servers, and most of europes being bounced over to the &nbsp;US &nbsp;which is making online gaming totally USeless &nbsp; , up until 2-3weeks ago &nbsp; i had a stable connection and &nbsp;was able to play &nbsp;online
 &nbsp; mostly black ops &nbsp; no problem,</p>
<p>now im sitting with latency &nbsp;anywhere between &nbsp;165 and 185 &nbsp;at any one point, and online gaming is just a waste of time and seen my K/D ratio plummet . &nbsp;i get the occasional &nbsp;respite &nbsp;now and again to let me play &nbsp;online &nbsp;but nothing to write home about
</p>
<p>all the techy ones on here &nbsp; &nbsp;asking us to do this and to do that , &nbsp; but explain &nbsp;why &nbsp;my boy , who &nbsp; has a ps4 &nbsp; &nbsp; on wireless connection &nbsp;has never had anything like this,
</p>
<p>im wired &nbsp;up and &nbsp; i would be as well on dial up internet.. &nbsp; i only get &nbsp;17-20 meg BB &nbsp; at the minute but up until 2 weeks ago , even with &nbsp;the xbox, &nbsp;PS4 , &nbsp; laptop and even a few mobiles &nbsp;we &nbsp;could play &nbsp;online no bother .... &nbsp;</p>
<p>ran a ping test on pingtest.net &nbsp; using &nbsp;my laptop &nbsp;( wireless) &nbsp;upstairs and ping was &nbsp; &nbsp;28..

<p><span>Hi Mary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Troubleshooting connection problems can be a challenge because there are so many possible causes. Internet connection problems are most commonly
 caused by disconnected cables or by routers or modems that are not operating properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you try using Internet Connection Troubleshooter?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check the IP address when the internet connection exists and when it drops?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 happens when you try to print?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you receive any error messages when Magic Jack stops working?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: Use Internet Connection Troubleshooter
 when the connection drops</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type Troubleshooter and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the left pane, click on View all.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Internet Connection Troubleshooter and then follow the instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span>Check the IP address when the internet
 connection exists and when it drops</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; and then All programs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Accessories.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on command prompt and “Run as administrator”</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Hit
 enter after typing the following command</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Ipconfig /all</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Execute
 the same steps when the connection drops.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>: Power cycle your modem/router</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Power
 down the DSL modem by disconnecting the power supply line.&nbsp;Leave it unplugged for 20 to 30 seconds before reconnecting the power to the modem.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Power
 up the modem.&nbsp; Please wait for the Internet light to stop blinking before proceeding.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you’re using a router, then you can try
 resetting the router or check if you’ve any firmware updates for your router.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong><span>: Try updating your Ethernet adapter drivers</span></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below to know how to update a driver for a device. You need to select the device name as network adapter to update the drivers.</span></p>

    <title>Cannot save multiple monitor configuration with Windows 10 -- worked - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richard crabill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot save multiple monitor configuration with Windows 10 -- worked fine on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have two external monitors linked to my lenovo thinkpad pro laptop, through lenovo onelink pro dock. When I was using Windows 8.1 my onelink dock allowed me to work with two external monitors and toggle off the main monitor on my laptop. Now, with Windows
 10, I cannot save the settings on my laptop that allow me to view monitor #3. &nbsp;The option is there in device manager, but I get the message "your screen settings could not be saved...." I am doing nothing different than my configuration with my previous Win
 7 system. Any help appreciated.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From you description, I suspect that the issue might be due to incompatible <strong>

<h2>            Extra storage internal&#47;external</h2>
                    <p>So I&nbsp;needed to expand my storage capabilities as I have officially run out of space on my&nbsp;external hard drives and my internal xbox one hard drive.&nbsp;</p><p>PLAN&nbsp;A:&nbsp;Purchase a 4TB hard drive and swap out the internal xbox one drive..... Plan A fails. It would appear the xbox does not support an internal 4TB&nbsp;hard drive. Please do correct me if im wrong!?</p><p>PLAN&nbsp;B:&nbsp;Use 4TB hard drive as an external drive instead.... Plan B&nbsp;fails. The xbox will not recognize that the&nbsp;hard drive is connected. In the mean time I&nbsp;can connect all 3 of my original external hard drives with no issues. So it also appears the the xbox does not support a 4TB&nbsp;external drive either. Again please correct me if i am wrong!?</p><p>So what i want to know is this. Has anyone else had this problem?&nbsp;How did they get round it?&nbsp;What is the maximum size external/internal drive the xbox can handle?</p>

            NOTE: These procedures only apply if you have Windows Vista - they will not work with XP.<br />
<br />
Install the new hard drive in the system.&nbsp; Here are instructions on what to do: <a href="http://www.helpwithpcs.com/upgrading/install-hard-drive.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.helpwithpcs.com/upgrading/install-hard-drive.htm</a>.&nbsp; Format the drive from your current operating system and create a partition (one will do but you can make several if you wish - just make sure you leave enough space in the primary partition to
 accommodate your complete restore and some additional space for further updates and more programs - you don't need to make any additional partitions at all (I don't) - one will do just fine. If you have a recovery partition and want to save it, create a second
 partition of equal size and you can copy and paste the&nbsp;files over just before you format the old drive. To format Go to Start / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click on run as administrator.&nbsp; Then type in fomat (Drive letter)
 and enter. To partition go to Start / Control Panel /Administrative Tools/ Computer management / Disk Management and right click on the formatted drive. I'm assuming you have better than Vista Basic or Home Premium (you didn't mention your version - this process
 won't work on those versions because they can't do complete image backups.&nbsp; If you do, skip to the next paragraph now). Since it's so much bigger, do a complete image backup from the old drive to the new drive.&nbsp; Go to Start / Control Panel / Backup and Restore
 and select a complete system backup selecting the new drive as the target. Then do a restore of the image selecting the new hard drive as both the source and the target.&nbsp; Once the restore is complete you can delete the restore file/folder from the new drive.&nbsp;
 Then it's just a matter of setting the new drive as the master and the old drive as slave.&nbsp; See the following for instructions:
<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_6031_change-master-slave-designation.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_6031_change-master-slave-designation.html</a> but it's best if you check with your hard drive manufacturers and the documentation that came with them (since
 they're all&nbsp;different when it comes to changing these settings). When that's done, gp to Start / Control panel / Administrative Tools / Computer management/ Disk management and right click on the new drive to make it active (if it isn't already so marked and
 make sure it says System and Boot - though it may not do that until you complete the dual boot procedure which follows). You then want to set it up as a dual boot system.&nbsp; There are no printed guidelines for dual boot with both being Vista but here are the
 ones for starting with Vista and dual booting to Windows7 (just substitute Vista information where it calls for Windows7 information):
<a href="http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windows_vista_and_windows_7_vista_installed_first.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windows_vista_and_windows_7_vista_installed_first.htm</a>. Once done (and it is a long and complicated process and you will need to download other software to help), the system will boot to the new drive (you may have to initiate
 the boot yourself and you will have to select the boot option when booting) and then you can format the old drive from the new drive for use as additional disk space.&nbsp; You won't need an external hard drive to run backups and you won't need to re-install all
 your programs (or do any further restores from backup) - you'll be right where you were before with maybe one or two additional steps required (and this will be a lot cleaner than doing a clean install and running Easy Transfer (which is another option if
 you want and which I explain below) because this saves your programs as well as your data and settings.&nbsp; Go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools /&nbsp;Computer management / Disk Management and relabel the drives if necessary so that the new drive is
 called C: and the old drive is called D: (you may have to change D: to E: first and then change C: to D: and then change E: to C: - to change the drive letter just right click on it and select another letter) - all assuming that it didn't automatically relabel
 the new drive as C: when you changed it to master - I'm not sure if it would do that but just in case, you can do so yourself&nbsp;(you'll be able to tell which is which by looking at the size of the drives).&nbsp; When you're done you'll need to go to Start / Computer
 / System Properties and at the bottom you'll need to check if the system is still activated (because you changed the hard drive).&nbsp; If it requires activation, select the option to activate and run through the wizard.&nbsp; If you encounter problems, continue through
 the&nbsp;wizard until you reach a screen with a phone number and a bunch of codes at the bottom.&nbsp; Call the number and wade through the automatic prompts until you reach a human.&nbsp; Explain that you just replaced your hard drive and need to reactivate.&nbsp; You'll need
 to have your 25 digit product code handy when you make the call.&nbsp; She can give you a code to enter on the screen which will reactivate Windows and then it's done.&nbsp; Make sure you set up a backup process and schedule it to suit your needs - and it should be
 to a different drive or CD/RW in case the hard drive fails.&nbsp; If the system is still in dual boot mode, use the relevant sections of the dual boot procedures to remove the obsolete boot option.<br />
<br />
Just so you know, another option is to install the hard drive and format and partition it as above.&nbsp; Then backup all your data to the new hard drive.&nbsp; Then install Vista on the new hard drive (I assume you have a full retail version and not an upgrade).&nbsp; Then
 exchange master and slave as indicated above (you'll also need to make the new drive active and the system and boot drive - see the relevant parts of the dual boot procedure and the information in the prior paragraph) and reboot.&nbsp; Then do an Easy Transfer
 of information from the old computer to the new computer. Here's the procedure <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/easy-transfer.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/get/easy-transfer.aspx</a>.&nbsp; You'll need to install a download from the site to the old drive to make the process work - but it tells you how to do that.&nbsp; Remember, this process will require you to re-install all
 your programs.&nbsp; Then follow the drive relabeling and activation procedures in the prior process.&nbsp; And once again you're done (except for re-loading all your programs which you should do
 your data in your profile and then delete the backup you did to start this process (but you should still do a backup to a different drive or to a CD/RW and schedule it to occur periodically (as you see the need).&nbsp; If the system is still in dual boot, use the
 relevant sections of the dual boot procedure to delete the old boot option.<br />
<br />
It's hard to cover everything in one post here (it's not a simple procedure), but hopefullly the linked references will fill in the blanks where the explanations are not fully described. Post back if you have any questions.
<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck!&nbsp;

<h2>            Error&#58; must have Xbox 360 hard drive to play Destiny</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hello! So I just bought Destiny for Xbox 360 today, and I'm having an issue with getting it started up. Before now I've been using an external hard drive for my Xbox's memory for saving games etc. It has well above the required 20 GB that Destiny needs
 to play, but an error keeps popping up whenever I try to go into the game saying "You need an Xbox 360 Hard drive to play Destiny". Do I really have to buy a new hard drive for like $100 to play this game? Will my external hard drive just not work? Please
 help!</span></p>

<p>You may have to end up getting a Xbox 360 hard drive. I would recommend reformatting the hard drive, but you would need to back up your files somewhere.</p>

<p>Its not an issue with the hard drive, its the fact that it is usb. Destiny is looking for a hard drive and the Xbox 360 is not setup to recognize USB Hard Drives as actual hard drive just as USB storage. I would assume Destiny wants a hard drive due to transfer
 speeds, a hard drive would be faster than something on the the USB port on the 360. There are other 360 games that will not load to a USB connected device as well. You could get an older and cheaper hard drive(I assume you have one of the new models with internal
 hard drives because of the price you quoted). I use an old 120GB hard drive with my S model 360. It is not hard to do but I am not sure if I could post how to do that on these forums but it is something to look into.</p>

<p>Check ebay or other sites like that. Hard drives are DIRT cheap. I have a 120GB one that I thought would be worth some money. But they are about 5-10 bucks online.</p>

<h2>            After installing upgrade patch on StarCraft 2, can&#39;t load the game</h2>
                    i've had starcraft 2 for a couple months now. yesterday it had me do an update from the starter version. i went through the update and when i went to play a prompt came up saying that it requires a patch, and if i would like to installt he patch. i click
 ok&nbsp; and it acts like its trying to load the game, the screen goes black then flashes and the prompt comes back up. i have opened ports 80, 1119, and 1120 as blizzard has said those are the ones that need to be open to install and run the game. any ideas on
 what else i should try?

            <p>I would first do a System Restore back to before you attempted to install the Starcraft update.
<br />
<br />
To choose a System Restore point,<br />
<br />
Go to Start. Right click on computer. Go to Properties. <br />
On the left hand side, click on System Protection. <br />
Click on System Restore button. Click on Next. <br />
You should see system restore points when changes to your computer were made,&nbsp;I have several for when Windows Updates were installed.
<br />
At the bottom left, put a check mark in "Check more restore points."<br />
You should see more restore points. <br />
Highlight the one you have before you you were having the problem. <br />
Click next. This will confirm the restore point you want to install. </p>
<p>Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>
<p><br />
You should now be back before you installed the Starcraft 2 upgrade. <br />
Do you get an option to save or run the update? <br />
If possible, try to right click on the update and select, "Run as Administrator".
<br />
<br />
Let us know if this helps. <br />

<p><span><span>Since
 Windows 7 and Windows 2008 R2 everytime you open a console program, the system opens another process called conhost.exe, to apply windows themes and enable the drag&amp;drop functionality to that console window.<br />
Provided that I have themes disabled, that I won't ever use the drag&amp;drop functionality in console windows (I promise :)), that each of this process takes at least 2 MB of RAM and, most important, according to sysinternals process explorer each conhost.exe
 process has more than 2500-3000 context switches per second (thus reducing the performance of the whole system), I would like to restore the old behaviour of windows V</span></span><span><span>ista/</span></span><span><span>2008
 and disable conhost.exe entirely.<br />
Any ideas?</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks<br />
</span></span></p>

<h2>            My Start Menu will not work.</h2>
                    <p>My Start Menu will not work.&nbsp; When I hit the shortcut icon, I get the following message:&nbsp; "ServiceHostApp.exe" that this shortcut refers to has been changed or moved, so this shortcut will no longer work properly.</p>
<p>This started out of the blue.&nbsp; Last time I tried to use the Start Menu it worked fine.&nbsp; I did not install any new programs, nothing.&nbsp; I then installed new Windows updates, and still nothing.&nbsp; How do I fix this?</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span>Your contacts are tied on your account, as well as your credits, They are saved on Skype's servers so you can access them across supported platforms and devices when you log in to your account. It might be that you are logging in to a different account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sign out from the app and make sure to sign in using the credentials you used to initially create the account. If you created your account using a Skype Name, sign in using a Skype Name, same goes if you created the account using an email address or
 a phone number. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To determine whether you have multiple accounts, you can use <strong><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this link</a></strong>. Enter the email address of your account and click Continue. This will list

    <title>Multiple Skype for Business accounts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marc cottee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Multiple Skype for Business accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies if this has been answered anywhere else, but after weeks of trawling through mostly very old posts, thought I'd ask afresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My company uses Office365, and a Skype for Business account with PTSN calling for it's main contact.&nbsp; We have a contract with another company, and deliver services on their behalf, for which they supply us with a laptop and their company Skype for Business
 account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking at getting a Skype for Business desk phone - but does anyone know of a phone that would allow me to connect both machines and accounts to the one phone - or a gadget that would auto update the status of the accounts if for instance I'm
 on a call with either account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Marc</p>

            Hi Marc,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your posting. Your presence status in Skype for Business will set automatically to red dot with ‘In a call’ message for you based on your phone activity (You can get more information about presence status in Skype for Business by referring to
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/change-your-presence-status-in-skype-for-business-9b64eef5-47b8-46d8-a744-f490e6f88feb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>). Besides, you can refer to <a href="https://partnersolutions.skypeforbusiness.com/solutionscatalog/ip-phones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> to view and try the qualified or certified IP Phones for Skype for Business.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Otherwise, it is not feasible to login to multiple accounts in the Skype for Business client on one computer at the same time. Meanwhile, if it is inconvenient for you and you really want to use multiple accounts in the Skype for Business on the same computer,
 you can <a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
submit a feedback</a> and your comments would be valuable. Your time and understanding is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jay

<p>Hello Shashank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To help you resize or make the Taskbar thumbnails bigger, we suggest performing the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <em><strong>regedit
</strong></em>and click <em><strong>OK</strong></em>.</p>
<p>2. Locate this path: <em>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Taskband</em>.</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the right pane, then click on <strong><em>New </em></strong>and select
<em><strong>DWORD (32-Bit) Value.</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key</strong>: <strong>MinThumbSizePx</strong></li><li><strong>Value</strong>: <strong>Number of pixels anywhere less than 500.</strong></li></ul>
<p>4. Hold <em><strong>Ctrl </strong></em>key + <em><strong>Shift </strong></em>key and right-click on Taskbar.</p>
<p>5. Select <em><strong>Exit Explorer.</strong></em></p>
<p>6. Hold <em><strong>Ctrl </strong></em>key + <strong><em>Shift </em></strong>key +
<em><strong>Esc </strong></em>key to pull up Task Manager.</p>
<p>7. Click on <em><strong>File </strong></em>&gt; <em><strong>Run New Task</strong></em> &gt; Type in
<strong><em>Explorer.exe</em></strong> and press <em><strong>Enter</strong></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The</em><em> method to fix the issue will have Registry modification. Before you modify the Registry, make sure to back it up and understand how to restore the registry if a problem occurs. Please refer to this link:
</em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows.</em></a></strong></p>

            Hello i had the same situation as you. I tried many things as:<br />
<br />
-Running Windows update troubleshooter<br />
-Executed some DISM commands that i found on various forums as possilbe solution(s)<br />
-Executed some batch scripts<br />
-Contacted Microsoft support (they tried some things - with no success)<br />
-Deleted everything under C:\WINDOWS\SoftwareDistribution folder<br />
... Some more stuff that i can't remmember right now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
but nothing helped me, so i reinstalled my Windows 10 and after that update was installed successfully.<br />
<br />
One more thing! Before this update my Windows was some how slow, UI was freezing it was not easy to work on this system. But after update my pc is super fast, UI is very responsive - no freezing. Well, someone will say maybe that reinstalling pc solve my poor
 user expirience but before that my Windows 10 install was only one month old.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>If you are unable to install the updates, this problem may occur if one or more of the following conditions are true:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Windows Update database is corrupted.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Antivirus software is configured to scan the %Windir%\SoftwareDistribution folder.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) service does not receive a content link header.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A required system file is registered incorrectly.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the below mentioned methods and see if it works for you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>If issue still persists after running the troubleshooter, I would suggest you to
<strong>reset Windows Update components</strong> and for that t</span>ry to run the
<strong>fixit</strong> provided in the following article. If you had already tried the same fixit before I would request you to run the fixit again.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to check if you are able to access Windows Update services and also make sure that the following services are started. If it is not started follow the below mentioned steps:</span><span>&nbsp;

</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry about the delay. I was in hospital from the 11/11 t0 16/11 having a melanoma cut out of my leg. I tried all the different measures advised, no joy. After returning home yesterday, I downloaded a program, which locked up my computer. Done a restore,
 installed November updates, I couldn't believe it when KB3105210 also installed.</p>
<p>Tried to send info to you but mail manager kept rejecting the reply. Installed ver.&nbsp;1511 on my other computer, It seems to have scrambled that computer.</p>
