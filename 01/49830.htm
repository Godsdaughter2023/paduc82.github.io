    <title>HELP&#33; Context menus opening to the left. Known solutions don&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HELP&#33; Context menus opening to the left. Known solutions don&#39;t work with Win10.</h2>
                    <p>My context menus are opening to the Left instead of the Right. A very old and annoying bug that has been around since Windows 7. But for some reason, all the old "fixes" don't seem to work with my Win10 tablet (v1703.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal fix is to open "Tablet PC Options" and switch to "Left Handed" mode, but on my 32bit Win10 tablet, there is no such menu or option. The closest thing is "Tablet Mode Settings", and that only offers four options unrelated to how the mouse buttons
 work. No "Advanced Options" link on it either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second known fix is to execute a particular shell command. That didn't work either. Ditto for changing a particular Registry entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extremely annoying. Does anyone know of a fix? TIA</p>

<p>Thx for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My screen resolution is already at maximum (1920x1080).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a screen resolution problem. If it the familiar old "menus opening to the left" bug.</p>

<p>When there's not enough room for my context menus to open on the right, they open on the left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Personally, I don't care whether they open to the right or to the left, or even if they would open above or below. The only thing that matters to me is that they open.</p>

<p>This isn't a matter of screen real-estate. I could right-click in the middle of the screen and the context popup menu would open to the wrong side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A single popup opening the wrong way is only a minor annoyance. it becomes an inconvenience when there are submenus (which are triggered on the right but open to the left.) When you move your pointer across menus like that, they have a tendency to close
 before you can click them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a very old bug (see <strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/ef8647f8-2a83-4e30-91ad-68ce99eb54e3/rightclick-menu-opens-on-wrong-side?forum=itprovistahardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this post</a></strong>
 on MS site from April 2008.) It used to be easy to fix by simply telling the "Pen &amp; Tablet" app that you were left handed (back when a "tablet" was an input device.) But now, in the latest incarnation of Windows-10, all the old solutions to fix it no longer
 work (they did until recently. Now those options are gone.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think anyone has ever explained what causes it in the first place.</p>

    <title>Word 2007 Speech Recognition Double Space After Period. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robin___d  say:</h3>
<h2>            Word 2007 Speech Recognition Double Space After Period.</h2>
                    I originally posted this in the Office 2007 forum before being told to post it here:<br />
<br />
I have a problem using the Windows 7 speech recognition in Word 2007. When ending a sentence with a fullstop, Word automatically adds 2 spaces after the fullstop when I would like it to add only one. This seems like a trivial problem to fix, but I cannot find
 anywhere to do so. Typing with the keyboard does not autocorrect 'one space' to 'two spaces' so it seems to be an in-built function of the speech recognition software.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated, Googling has turned up nothing.<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined only with Microsoft word?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you facing any other issues with Speech recognition?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to set up the speech recognition once more and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><b>Set up Speech Recognition</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Set-up-Speech-Recognition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Set-up-Speech-Recognition</a></p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to run the system file checker scan and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “<b>Start”</b>, click All “<b>Programs”</b>, click “<b>Accessories”</b>, right-click “<b>Command Prompt”</b>, and then click “<b>Run
 as administrator”</b>. If you are prompted for&nbsp; an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click&nbsp; “<b>Allow”</b><br />
&nbsp;b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type the following command, and then press ENTER:&nbsp; “<b>sfc /scannow” (without the quotes)</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;[The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on System File Checker scan –<br />

<h2>            Retrieving an old voicemail message</h2>
                    I have only just seen in my old email address, a Skype voicemail message that was left in 2011, normally I would not pay interest to this but it was the day my mum passed away and I was traveling to be with her but I was too late... this message may have
 been from her as it was her skype account that was attached to the message... I still have the same account with the same login name etc.. but Skype has changed soo much over the years. Is it possible to retrieve the message???

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A voice message is retained for a period of 30 days on Skype server. If you haven't downloaded the message, I am afraid that you can't retrieve that.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Halo 4 connection problems</h2>
                    
<p>Okay so Im trying to get Xbox live going on Halo 4. It was a pain in the @@@ by the way. I had to download multiplayer off of Xbox live. It took like an hour.</p>

<p>Anyway, so I go the Infinity menu, then War Games and RIGHT AFTER I click on War Games, I lose my XBL connection. This happened like 6 times before I just gave up and played campaign. This didnt happen with any other games, this didnt even happen when I
 played campaign. My connection is fine, UNTIL I try to play War Games.</p>

<p>Does this happen to anyone else? &nbsp;</p>

            Hi James,<br />
<br />
<br />
The error message you're receiving seems to mean that your PC is having problems with a required device not present.<br />
<br />
Were there any parts of your PC that has been removed recently? How about changes made before your PC went into recovery mode?<br />
<br />
You've also mentioned that this happened for two times now, and even tried repairing it using the recovery media.<br />
<br />
We strongly suggest that you seek advice from your PC manufacturer to get an idea what might your PC be missing.<br />
<br />
You may share with us here how you will get to resolve this issue to help other who might be having the same concern as yours.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

 HP or Primo.&nbsp; Both printers were grayed out on printer page.&nbsp; Couldn't connect to either.&nbsp; Removed all programs, files, folders, drivers, etc for both and tried reinstalling.&nbsp; Always get error message that says "print proccessor does not exist."&nbsp; Changed cable
 on printer, same issue.&nbsp; Hooked printer up to another computer running 7 and the printer works fine.&nbsp; If I try to network to printer, get same error message.

            I had already tried this and anything else I could find on line but did it again, no luck.&nbsp; If I try to add any printer the error message "Unable to install printer.&nbsp; Print processor does not exist," pops up.&nbsp; I can't get past this step.
<br />
<br />
If I try to install Primo PDF (virtual print to PDF document), I get the error message, "Unable to install printer PrimoPDF - PrimoPort: - PrimoPDF : (1798).&nbsp; If I click OK on the error message the program finishes and appears on my computer, but when I try
 to print anything, an error message appears that says "no printers are installed."&nbsp; PrimoPDF does not appear in my devices and printers tab.<br />
<br />
My HP printer still shows on my Devices and printers page but has a yellow caution/exclamation point next to it and it is grayed out.&nbsp; There is no HP printer listed in my programs tab and nothing exists in program files folder associated with any printer once
 I uninstall the PrimoPDF and remove all associated files.<br />
<br />
When the problem first started I uninstalled the printers, removed all files and folders associated and tried reinstalling it and the driver, including removing all program files associated with PrimoPDF.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There is no option for me to remove the printer as currently listed and when you go to properties, all screens say the device is operating correctly.&nbsp; One of the options I get when right clicking my mouse is to scan with the printer.&nbsp; This function appears
 to work fine.<br />
<br />
Also if I change the printer cable, same results.&nbsp; If I connect the printer to another computer running windows 7, it works flawlessly.&nbsp; Based on these results and the fact that PrimoPDF also won't install/run, it has to be something going on with my windows
 7.&nbsp; I've contacted Dell as the computer is still under warranty but they say it is related to the operating system, not a hardware issue so they are no help.<br />

</p><p>I'm running a windows 10 laptop, and it is able to connect to the internet. I'm posting this post from it right now, so demonstrably the internet is working, and yet my computer thinks that it isn't connected:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1bfcfaf-97ab-491c-ad7d-521cd21aa7cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b1bfcfaf-97ab-491c-ad7d-521cd21aa7cf" /></a></p>
<p>You can see at the bottom it has that * symbol next to the wifi as if there is no available connection, and it claims "No internet, secured", although the internet works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been going on since September. Except then the sound card also stopped working, so I
<strong>did a clean recovery of Windows 10</strong>. The sound problem fixed, but the wifi problem still exists. Because of this, I&nbsp;<strong>can't get windows update</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/445e5c33-e292-4861-bdc8-3d443a11803d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/445e5c33-e292-4861-bdc8-3d443a11803d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows Networking Diagnostics is not able to repair the problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I also can't use DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong> because a connection is not recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already done a clean reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly my hardware is working because I am talking to you right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>A</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Run the Network adapter troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Network adapters
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not, you can try updating both your Network adapter drivers or uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter, click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will re-detect them and reinstall them.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>As said in the original post in the bold bit at the bottom, Windows Network Diagnostics does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already reinstalled the network drivers and it did nothing.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Re-installing Windows XP Pro&#58; Windows won&#39;t start -- WINDOWS&#47;system32&#47;config&#47;SYSTEM missing or corrupt</h2>
                    <p>Windows tells me to run Setup from original CD and then to enter 'r' to repair the problem. I never get the chance: either Windows restarts repeatedly, or it just hangs without giving me the chance to enter 'r'. &nbsp;A Windows XP Pro with SP3 iso file didn't
 help; neither did another copy of a Windows XP Pro with SP2 CD. What do I do now? How can I consistently enter Windows Setup, and how can I do a repair installation?</p>

<h2>            Surface 3 refuses to charge, even after two replacements&#63; &#40;And wifi won&#39;t connect either&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My Surface 3 just won't charge its battery when connected.&nbsp; We've done everything we could, including bringing it to the Microsoft Store twice, using their charger, did the "Remove Battery Driver then Windows Update", "Reset device" and all other kinds of
 tricks.&nbsp; But it still gets to decide whether to charge or not frivolously, and most of the time "Not Charging".&nbsp; It shouldn't be the charger, because it fails with both my OEM charger and the charger provided in the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; We even had
<strong>two replacement</strong><strong>s</strong>, both of which had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feels very surreal to me, because I couldn't believe the quality I'm seeing from a Microsoft product.&nbsp; What's going on?&nbsp; Adding salt to the wound, WiFi also won't connect to my wireless router either with 5GHz or 2.4GHz band (my other 15+ devices are
 totally fine).&nbsp; With waning battery and no Internet connection, this $400+ is now just a pricey piece of junk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Warranty status - we are so tired of going to the Microsoft Store again and again, and with a false hope of the problems going away magically. we missed the 90-day warranty this time.&nbsp; So this device went out-of-warranty.&nbsp; That's why I'm turning to the community
 for help:</p>
<ol>
<li>Any way I can get to talk to a MS representative to complain at least, without paying the ridiculous $29 complaint fee?</li><li>Did I miss anything obvious?</li><li>Has anyone experienced similar issues?</li></ol>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Microsoft does not provide any software for DVD to iphone converter.</p>
<p>However if you do a search on the internet using your favorite search engine, you might be able to find a software that will help you to get DVD to iphone converter which is compatible with Windows7. (Hint:&nbsp; DVD to iphone)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Please respond back with the status of the issue and let us know if you have any issues.<br />

    <title>Disabling trackpad when external mouse is active - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> editorsteve1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling trackpad when external mouse is active</h2>
                    <p>I have an ASUS laptop running Win10. The touchpad gestures sometimes accidentally activate and make a hash of my typing. I wish to use an external mouse and disable trackpad automatically when that mouse is active. Your advice says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to<span>&nbsp;Settings.</span></li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;Ease of Access.</span></li><li>Click&nbsp;<span>Touchpad.</span></li><li>Under Touchpad, toggle the switch on or off.</li><li>You can also uncheck the box beside&nbsp;<span>Leave touchpad on the when a mouse is connected</span><span>option to disable it when you use a traditional mouse.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Once done with the steps above, check if the issue will persist.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you no doubt know, these instructions are WRONG. There is no toggle switch under touchpad, and no option to toggle touchpad off when using external mouse.</span></p>
<p>I allow WIN10 to update. It is updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is the secret? And why is it a secret?</p>
<p>

            I am trying to call but skype tells me i need a subscription but they have had my payment for over two months now. I am getting a little upset with no way to contact a live person and i am thinking of dropping skype after many many years. Microsoft is
 useless when it comes to helping on Skype problems. They are just all messed up on their business ends.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/59b8052d-dda5-4961-85a9-8721d2b45fdd" title="fr41">
<p>
</p><p>If you purchase a Skype subscription previously and you received an order confirmation which means that it was successful, then you should be able to make calls. Getting a message that you need a subscription upon placing a call means that you might have
 signed in to a different Skype account or the number you are calling is not covered by your subscription. I suggest you to make sure that you are using the
<strong>Skype name</strong> (username) or <strong>email address</strong> (Microsoft account) that has your subscription. You can use the order confirmation as your Skype name us indication on that email from Skype.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low</p>
<p>level chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.</p>

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Problems with Photostory 3 on Windows 10 new installation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gloriayakes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Photostory 3 on Windows 10 new installation.</h2>
                    <p>Two out of three of my Windows 10 computers continue to run Photostory 3 without any problem. My husband was able to install it without a hitch on his Windows 10 computer. Unfortunately, the computer I need it most on (my teacher console in my classroom)
 will not let me reinstall PhotoStory 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This program has been an essential for me for many years in my tech class, particularly for my younger students who cannot yet handle more complicated programs. I need to be able to continue to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting the message that the program is not compatible with this version of Windows. When I performed my Windows 10 conversion, most things continued to work fine, but this program would not work. I checked compatibility settings and mode. Nothing
 seemed to work to get it to function again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many possible solutions I found when researching the problem. None has worked. I uninstalled the program because it was not working and now I cannot reinstall it. Every time I try, I get the message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Photo Story 3 for Windows cannot be installe don this version of Windows. Check the system requirements for Photostory 3 for Windows before trying to install the program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me solve this problem. I really do need to be able to use this program in my classroom.</p>

            <p>Also, someone somewhere asked how I did this Windows 10 installation. I have used the Windows Update method on all of the computers I have done this on since I have many programs and documents that needed to be maintained and a clean install would have been
 impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not had a problem with any of the other computers I have done, and that includes 38 other student computers in my computer lab. All were done using the Windows Update method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My lab console is somewhat different from my student computers in that is has an i5 processor rather than an i3 and it has more RAM; it is an HP computer vs. the Acer PCs I have for my students.&nbsp; I also use a dual monitor set up so that I can monitor my
 student screens at the same time as I am demonstrating etc.&nbsp; I have tried disconnecting my extra monitor and doing the install to see if that might help, but I got the same error message.</p>

<p>Hi wandawoman.ns ,<br />
<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;What happens when you open exe files?<br />
•&nbsp;Was there any changes made to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure that the computer is free from virus.<br />
<br />
<strong>A)</strong>&nbsp;Try scanning the computer using Antivirus software because this issue can occur if the computer is infected with virus. You can do a PC Safety scan by clicking on the link

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The attached DMP file is of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (3b)</strong></span> bug check.

<br />
<em>This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.
</em><br />
</em><br />
This error has been linked to excessive paged pool usage and may occur due to user-mode graphics drivers crossing over and passing bad data to the kernel code.<br />

</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>3. </strong>If you're still crashing after the above, enable Driver Verifier:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Driver Verifier:</strong></span></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What is Driver Verifier?</strong><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8/8.1, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows
 kernel-mode components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<strong>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</strong><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<strong>How to enable Driver Verifier:</strong><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
<strong>5.</strong> Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
<strong>6.</strong> Check EVERY box that is <strong>NOT </strong>provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
<strong>7.</strong> Click on Finish.<br />
<strong>8.</strong> Restart.<br />
<br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD. To expand on this a bit more for the interested, specifically what Driver Verifier actually does is it looks for any driver making illegal function calls. When and/if this happens, system corruption
 occurs if allowed to continue. When Driver Verifier is enabled, it is monitoring
<em><strong>all </strong></em>3rd party drivers (as we have it set that way) and when it catches a driver attempting to do this, it will quickly flag that driver as being a troublemaker, and bring down the system safely before any corruption can occur.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will detect it in violation almost straight away, and
 as stated above, that will cause / force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <strong>not</strong> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
If your OS became corrupt or you cannot boot into Windows after disabling verifier via Safe Mode:
<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
<br />
-- Note that Safe Mode for Windows 8 is a bit different, and you may need to try different methods:

<br />
<strong>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</strong><br />
<br />
I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier. I will usually say whether or not I'd like for you to keep it enabled any longer.<br />
<br />
<strong>My system BSOD'd with Driver Verifier enabled, where can I find the crash dumps?</strong><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
