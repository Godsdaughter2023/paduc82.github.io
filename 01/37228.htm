    <title>Skype double charging for monthly subscription to US and demands - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Skype double charging for monthly subscription to US and demands credit as well -</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I have a monthly subscription for calls to US and been using that for a months with no problem.
</p>
<p>Since I installed new Skype on my iPhone - Skype is asking constantly to ADD CREDIT to my account - even so when calls are made to US - I am adding credit - and my subscription is being charged as well. Simple " double dipping " by Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply - Skype is double charging me and furthermore , for me to make a calls to US is much more expensive now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monthly subscription is absolutely useless ( Skype is charging my credit card ) - when I am making calls and calls are dropping because not enough founds and I need to constantly to add credit to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Skype is charging me a money for making calls to US when I do have a monthly subscription ? I completely overspend so much more money on making calls , quality of calls is worse, calls are dropping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is easily " stealing" by Skype from a loyal customers</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wrote twice already to Skype in last 2 months &nbsp;- and received no feedback, no acklnowledgment &nbsp;and monthly charges for subscription which they are NOT honoring are still going to my credit card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am US journalist for major US TV Network based overseas - and ENOUGH IS ENOUGH by Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do demand immediate ratification of the problem and return of charges on my credit card for services which they are NOT providing. Otherwise I will use other avenues in media to bring that to the light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6e5af3df-9337-40b3-90df-1300ad38986f" title="Derek066">
<p>
</p><p>We understand why you are concerned. There is a possibility that&nbsp;you are signed in on a different account in your iPhone. Please note that if you already have a Skype subscription to call US mobiles/landlines, Skype will no longer ask you to add credit.
 The only time Skype will ask you to add credit is when you call a mobile/landline not&nbsp;covered by your calling subscription, or you already used up the minutes of your calling subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an expert, my best suggestion is for you to compare the Skype name of the account on the email you received from Skype regarding the subscription you have, and the Skype name of the account you are signed in on your iPhone. That way you will know if you
 are signed into the correct account or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not hesitate to reply to this post if the issue still persists. Thank you!

                    In Windows Mail, my sent messages are getting stuck in the Outbox. My Vista version is 32 bit, so I ran the 32 bit update and received the message that "The update does not apply to your system". I tried it a few times and still nothing. I even tried the
 64 bit update to no avail. Any ideas?

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />This issue has remain unresolved after a year of tracking it here:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/cant-open-device-manager-in-windows-10-blocked-by/70e3a320-6ffe-4df3-9a5f-b9611e864a5c?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />It was painful to read it all.  There are some fixes that worked for a few throughout the thread but the only sure fix is to Clean Install.  
<br />
<br />Folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you'd also like to express your opinion about this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. You can even click the Share button there to generate a link to your Feedback to post back here for others to vote up or add to it. But Microsoft will not see it here as this is a mostly volunteer-staffed forums where we try to solve your problems. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I haven't tried that yet,but i can. I found a link of yours so i would assume i just follow the steps?(even though it was with respect to windows 8) Also the an other suggestion, is that i preform a clean install. Although I'm assuming that this should be
 the last thing i use because I essentially wipe out my drive and install the os again, right?</p>

            There are a couple types of clean installs 
<br />
<br />Clean install - format the drive
<br />Custom install - format the drive but archives your old installation.
<br />
<br />The repair upgrade resolves broken operating system files while keeping your apps, files and settings.
<br />
<br />The steps in the following article shows you how its done.
<br />
<br />As for clean or custom install, see:

<p>I am having a similar issue.&nbsp;<a href="https://aka.ms/Dleicf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I've added my issue on the Feedback Hub</a> as well. This is happening on a Surface Pro 4 running Windows 10 Insider Preview build 16299.15. I'm running Cortana
 version 2.9.5.</p>
<p>I'm able to send SMS from my Windows 10 PC and have them send successfully to my Pixel, which leads me to believe it's an issue for Cortana on Android, not Cortana on PC. This is the first time I've tried setting up the Notification Mirroring service, so
 I don't know if it worked on any prior builds.</p>

<p>I have this issue as well. I cannot receive texts on my PC - but can send them from the same PC.</p>
<p>Here are notes on my setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Dell 3040 desktop running Windows 10 release 16299.98</p>
<p>2. Samsung Galaxy Note 8</p>
<p>3. All apps (Cortana, Edge, etc.) up to date.</p>
<p>4. A hard reset of Cortana on the PC did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>5. From the PC, I am able to send text messages perfectly.&nbsp; I can also use Find my Phone from the PC successfully.</p>
<p>6. From Edge on the Note 8, I am able to "continue on PC" successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, the problem is that I cannot receive notifications/texts on my PC from the Note 8 phone.</p>

</p><p>In order to receive text notifications on your PC from your Android phone, you must do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into PC Settings.&nbsp; In the search bar, look for Notifications &amp; Actions.&nbsp; In Notifications &amp; Actions, make sure that Mobile device (via Cortana) is checked.</p>

<h2>            Why does Windows 10 suddenly slow down to a crawl, partially freezes everything&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been using Windows 10 almost from the beginning of the upgrade, without too many problems. &nbsp;However, I have noticed that at times it will suddenly slow down to a crawl, partially freeze everything and I get the notice that "not responding" applied
 to everything I try. &nbsp;I even have trouble rebooting because the start menu is frozen. &nbsp;I have to shut down the computer manually and then restart. &nbsp;After restarting, the computer works perfectly but, I never know when the slowdown will start again.</p>
<p>What could be causing this? &nbsp;Is it possible that Microsoft is updating Windows without telling me that it is in progress?</p>

            <p>I may have found a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This deals with the Power Management</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&gt;Start&gt;settings&gt;system&gt;power &amp; sleep&gt;related settings&gt;additional power settings&gt;Lenovo power scheme&gt;change plan settings&gt;</p>
<p>Advanced settings&gt;PCI express&gt;Link state power management&gt;setting&gt; change to OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I saw something which deals with USB&nbsp; (my mouse and my keyboard are USB connected to machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Start&gt;settings&gt;system&gt;power &amp; sleep&gt;related settings&gt;additional power settings&gt;Lenovo power scheme&gt;change plan settings&gt;</p>
<p>Advanced settings&gt;USB settings&gt;USB selective suspend setting&gt;change setting to Disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also look at Internet Explorer</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Start&gt;settings&gt;system&gt;power &amp; sleep&gt;related settings&gt;additional power settings&gt;Lenovo power scheme&gt;change plan settings&gt;</p>
<p>Advanced settings&gt;internet explorer&gt;java script&gt;change setting to Maximum Power Saving.</p>

<h2>            removing onedrive from default file&#47;folder location .</h2>
                    <p>So I want my documents, pictures, icloud photos, etc. everything that I download to be saved to my pc. Then if I want to add something to onedrive I will do it manually. As of now the default location is onedrive. It syncs to my pc too but the path by default
 has onedrive in it. For instance c:\Users\xxxxx\OneDrive\Documents The x's represent the first five characters of my email account. Why can't I just download something to my pc without it being in Onedrive by default? This is a new pc so I'm trying to get
 it set up the way I want before I start moving all my stuff to it. I have almost 1.5 terabytes of music, movies, pictures, documents, etc. My old laptop came with windows 7 &amp; I upgraded to 10 &amp; it's not setup like that (onedrive default location). it's just
 the way I would like this one to be PC c:\Users\xxxx\Documents. It has onedrive and I put what files I want in there and keep the rest on my pc. This is so frustrating I don't know if I'm not asking the question correctly or what but I've been trying to figure
 this thing out &amp; haven't gotten anywhere. I'm not giving up though, so please if anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I hope I put this in the right category, if not let me know. Thanks &amp; cheers</p>

<h2>            Power Supply bloc, Xbox One</h2>
                    #Microsoft,
 My Xbox power supply bloc isn't working anymore over an electric spark. I can't believe, that only 2 years after I had purchased my Xbox One console, there is no possible options for me to get it repaired. after loosing 45 minutes on the microsoft chatting
 support, im being told that there is nothing you can do for me, that microsoft doesn't produce the power supply bloc anymore, that I should turn to distributor like Amazon etc.. to buy a new one. Where obviously after spending 50-70$, I have no assurance that
 the product will be 100% microsoft origin product. After all, it is written on your website to NEVER use other product than microsoft product. Your after sale quality is lower than mediocre, and now i've just realize that I have lost 500-600$ buying microsoft
 product, and should have listen my friends, and bought a #sony
 playstation 4 instead.

<p>To order a replacement power supply from microsoft please go here <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/devices</a> and register your console via serial number and go to "start a service order" and then select your power supply. Since it's out of warranty you will have to pay for the replacement power supply. It should be around
 $40 USD.</p>

<p>If they really did say they're out of stock then I'm afraid you will have to buy one on amazon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're in the USA here's the link to buy an original Microsoft branded xbox one power brick:

https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Original-Supply-Adapter-Charger/dp/B00LGBA1RY</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it says it's from Microsoft as the seller (and says it's official) it will be the real deal. If for some reason you receive a 3rd party one and that's not what the Amazon page says where you bought it, you can use the A-to-Z guarantee from Amazon to get
 your money back.</p>

    <title>Stuck on black screen in boot up of normal mode. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuck on black screen in boot up of normal mode.</h2>
                    
<p>Vista Home Premium 32 Bit SP2</p>
<p>Every time I boot up in normal mode I encounter the dreaded black screen with cursor. I do ctrl alt del to get task manager and in processes I end explorer.exe and then start a new task of explorer.exe which gets me to my desktop in normal mode. However,
 the internet and most other programs will not work.</p>
<p>I then restart and boot in safe mode where internet and most everything else works as expected in safe mode. I have tried startup repair and system restore. Running out of options...not very good with computers...spent last week reading many different solutions
 on here and google.</p>
<p>I am hoping that someone can give me some advice on what to do short of doing a clean install of vista. As I said, I can get on in safe mode and things work fine, it is trying to boot in normal mode that is the problem, and even once I get to the desktop
 in normal mode, nothing works right. I appreciate any help on this. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>You could alway put your existing hard drive in another computer as the non-boot drive (2nd or later)<br />
or put it in an external case such as a USB. Either of those would allow you to back&nbsp;up your filles and<br />
<br />
Do not format the drive which will erase everything! You will need to reinstall the programs.<br />

<br />
==================</p>
<p>Some System makers use Recovery Partitions as well as other methods to allow you to revert back to a<br />
completely fresh installation. So check with your System maker to see what options you have to do that<br />
- and it certainly can be done - just a matter of knowing the processes the System maker put in place for<br />
you. Remember you want redundant backups and to save your existing data if possible!<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular Windows and Safe Mode) is to<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe . Safe Mode is reached<br />
by repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up.</p>
<p>First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span></a></p>
<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=black+screen+of+death+vista&amp;btnG=Search&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=&amp;aqi=g1</span></a></p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it<br />
only has to be bootable).</p>

<p>These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a Vista DVD<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>
<p>ren Logs LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there are spaces between ren and Logs and Logsold)</p>
<p>REBOOT to Windows</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />

<div>Many laptop manufacturers provide a restore CD/DVD that will reinstall your Windows OS back to the way it was the first day you started your new laptop up.&nbsp; This also typically overwrites any data on the hard drive so make sure you back up your documents
 before you do this as well.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here are links to the one key recovery system that is used on the Ideapad - <a href="http://consumersupport.lenovo.com/us/en/UserGuide/Guide_list.aspx?CategoryID=607007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://consumersupport.lenovo.com/us/en/UserGuide/Guide_list.aspx?CategoryID=607007</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I think these systems also use a hidden partition to store your OS restore files �?? if your OS install that you did replaced that partition this may not work and you will likely have to contact Lenovo for support.&nbsp; There are links to that on the site
 linked above as well.</div>

    <title>Xbox 360 with a 1920x1200 Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> le bad kid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 with a 1920x1200 Monitor</h2>
                    
<p>Hey, everyone. I just started using the I-INC iF281D 28" monitor. It has a native resolution of 1920x1200. However, it seems that the Xbox 360 is unable to see that it is a 16:10 monitor. I already understand that the 360 does not have a resolution option
 of 1920x1200, and that's okay. I'm willing to use 1680x1050 as long as it is the proper aspect ratio, as it is. However, when I use this resolution, there picture is letterboxed on the top and bottom. I don't understand why, since the 1680x1050 is 16:10, just
 like the monitor. Here's another weird thing; when I select 1080p, the picture is NOT letterboxed like it should be. I don't understand why the 360 is confusing the aspect ratios.
<br />
<br />
Is this a problem with the 360, or the monitor itself? Like I said, I'm willing to use 1680x1050 or 1080p as long as either of them are displayed properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

<p>Try adjusting the resolution on both the xbox and the monitor it should display in full screen without the letterbox. I have my both my tv and xbox 360 set to 1080p and I haven't had any problems at all. I also think there is a black bar setting in the display
 settings. Check those too to see if that helps.</p>

    <title>Parser won&#39;t accept .json file&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rad-lad-in-plaid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Parser won&#39;t accept .json file&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've completed a request for my data, files, and other things to be exported from my old skype accounts. However, when using the in-browser skype parser to look through my unpacked .tar file, it comes up as saying there's nothing there. No conversations
 or files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't make any sense, especially not after every avenue I've tried to just be able to see the logs. I've been told that because of some of the previous versions of skype I've used, the new parser might not be able to read what's there. I feel like
 this even makes less sense to me, because why wouldn't a log reader be designed for people who want to view logs and older information?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have one other log reader simply called 'skype log reader' that I have had suggested to me along with the skype parser, but haven't tried it yet. I'd like to know why this one wasn't working and why the heck there's such a problem when I made sure to follow
 the instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  rad-lad-in-plaid
<br />
<br />Is this the process you are using?
<br />
<br />Download the Skype Parser and unzip that
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/skype-parser#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/skype-parser#</a>
<br />
<br />Open Index.html and follow the instructions on the screen to load the messages.json file and start viewing the exported chat messages

            This is, in fact, the log-viewer that I was mentioning; the one that didn't work. I'm afraid it still didn't work when I tried it again this time. The same message was displayed.

            I tried opening it in Notepad and it showed the second option, where no conversations where available. I'm not sure what to make of this, because you did say it should be readable (if not easily) and filled with text if it isn't corrupted. I'm not sure
 how the file could've been corrupted because I never had any abnormal skype issues before, so I don't know why they would only just be starting now that I want to access the data.&nbsp;

            I just dug through a few things and ended up finding the correct account. It works well and consistently with what has been detailed here (so thank you for the help) except for one pretty glaring issue. The logs contain information about things as basic
 as friend requests that weren't even accepted from people that I sent out, but the individual logs for talking with my best friend won't show up. All the messages from the person I talked to the most on skype (and last used skype with in 2018) aren't showing
 up in the log archive when the .json file is uploaded. What could have caused <em>
that</em>?

<h2>            XBOX 360 suddenly can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to a HD ready TV, only full HD</h2>
                    
<p>I have been playing with my xbox on my HD ready for several years, but for a couple of weeks a go I went to a friend of mine and connected my XBOX to a full HD tv.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Later, when i went home, the xbox wouldn't connect to my old HD ready TV again (?).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried different HDMI cables, and different HDMI ports on my XBOX. If I connect it to our familiy full HD TV it works perfectly. And I've tried other HD ready TVs as well,&nbsp;</p>
<p>and it doesn't work. The restart trick "Hold RT and Y" does not work. Lowering the resolution in "blind" is also someting I've tried, without a good result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems like my XBOX is stuck on full HD, what should I do?&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
This is under the assumption that when your Xbox 360 boots, it automatically signs into your account.</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn on your console </li><li>Press the Xbox Guide button on your controller once </li><li>Press the Right Bumper at least 2 times </li><li>Using your D-Pad, press down 3 times </li><li>Press A&nbsp; - <strong>you are now in Console Settings and just selected Display</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Now you have two options and this can be hit or miss - the first is to press A again which puts you under HDTV Settings. The following options under this section are:<strong><br />
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Optimal Resolution </li><li>480p </li><li>720p </li><li>1080i </li><li>1080p </li><li>1024 x 768 </li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively you can avoid that menu and use your D-pad and go down 4 times.&nbsp; Press A and that opens up Display Discovery.&nbsp; Press A again to Enable this feature.&nbsp;
</li></ul>
<p>One of these two steps will work.&nbsp; It's simply hit or miss.&nbsp; I would go with the first option and try going under the HDTV Settings.&nbsp; One of them is bound to work and that is how I was able to get back to enjoying my console after a weekend on a better HDTV
 than mine ;)</p>
<p><br />
Please let me know how this works out!&nbsp; - BOM</p>
        </p>

<p>The only solution is to reset the resolution. Try the following again (follow it carefully):</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove any discs from the disc tray. </li><li>Turn off the console. </li><li>Turn on the console.
<p><b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you are using an Xbox 360 Wireless Controller, turn on the console by using the Guide button on the controller. Make sure that you use the player 1 controller when you do this. The player 1 controller will have the upper-left light illuminated.</p>
</li><li>As the console starts, on the controller, press and hold Y while pulling the right trigger. The display settings are reset to the default settings, and then the console automatically restarts.
</li></ol>

<p>BigOut Machine, </p>
<p>thank you for your answer, but it did not solve my problem. </p>
<p>I don't think I'm doing it wrong, I've tried it at least 10 times. As I mentioned in my first post, the Y + RT reset does not seem to work for me. The XBOX just does not restart. The lights "spins" a couple of times, but it just runs as normal afterwards.
</p>
<p>While I was desperately Googeling this problem earlier today, I found that this is a problem for many. Reseting it blindly or doing the startup reset doesn't work, and it always results in a XBOX admin telling you to send the XBOX in for a repair.
</p>
<p>Any other suggestions though? </p>

<p>Well I would certainly not recommend sending it in for repair! &nbsp;Any chance you could bring it back to the HDTV that you were using before and then changing the settings (so that essentially you won't be able to see the console on that HDTV but will when
 you return home)?</p>
<p><br />
I need to reemphasize that I have done this blindly with my 360S and it is possible.&nbsp; I forgot that when you choose each resolution in the steps that I recommended, you have to press A to confirm if the settings worked.&nbsp; So in this matter you should do each
 resolution and when the screen is obviously still black, reboot the system, go back in and blindly select the next resolution, etc.&nbsp; I
<strong>guarantee</strong> you will get your screen back.&nbsp; I just completely forgot about the confirmation and the need to press A if the resolution worked.&nbsp; Except like I said, you cannot press A if you cant see the confirmation, nor would you want to.&nbsp; So
 basically your looking at 5 reboots maximum since we know that the first resolution choice failed.
</p>
<p>Be patient.</p>

<p>That was my thought too. Our familiy TV in the living room works, so I changed to 480p (?) while beeing connected on that one. But for some reason, I still get no signal trying to connect to the old one again. Tried it two-three times..
</p>
<p>What exactly should I set the resolution to? I just assumed to pick the lowest, but maybe I'm wrong?

<p>I would go with 1024 x 768. &nbsp;Have you also attempted using Display Discovery? &nbsp;You may want to select that with the HDMI cable disconnected first and clear your cache if you go that route.</p>

<p>I should have said, hold the power button on the front of the console UNTIL the lights flash several times. &nbsp;This should reset the video input. &nbsp;Try it first with your console connected to your HD ready TV and if that fails do it a second time while the
 console is not connected to any TV, then plug it in while still on after performing the said process.</p>

            Hi Sean,
<br />Microsoft uses digital signing as internal control mechanism. So there are no need in any other checksums tools (for system purposes). You may use any third-party tool to check control sums or ask a developer to digitally sign a package.

<p>So I beat GTA V weeks ago but the whole Michael going to the FIB doesn't make sense to me. So basically what we see Michael, Brad and Trevor go rob a bank. Goes bad. Michael gets shot. Brad gets killed and Trevor escapes. Trevor moves on with his life and
 thinks Brad is in prison and Michael is dead. I just want to know what Michael's original plan was? Was it a trap for Brad and Trevor to get arrested or just Brad or what? That's what it seems like but then I don't know why Trevor would ever forgive Michael
 and not kill him after learning the truth. I also don't know why Franklin would continue to hang with Michael after it's known that he's a snitch.</p>

<p>I think when that mission went awry, Dave and those other those other two shady FIB guys took this as an opportunity to blackmail Michael into doing some dirty work for them. &nbsp;Trevor did detest Michael for the coverup of Brad's death. &nbsp;He came close to killing
 him but he needed Michael's help for that last big heist and figured it would be best to let bygones be bygones. &nbsp;As for Franklin, he took the risk of letting Michael take him under his wing despite Trevor's warnings because he felt it was worth it in order
 to get big paydays instead of the nickel and diming that hustling with Lamar would bring.</p>

<p>I was just wondering what the original mission plan was. All three get caught? Brad and Trevor get put away and Michael walks? I understand why Trevor would been angry over Michael lying about him being dead and Brad still being still alive but eventually
 forgiving him but if Michael had planned to sell Trevor completely out to the feds I don't know why Franklin or Trevor would even agree to do a final heist with him or even not kill him.</p>

<p>After the job went bad, Trevor got away, Brad was killed, and Michael was caught. &nbsp;Michael was an infamous most wanted criminal, so the FIB faked Michael's death by switching him with Brad so they could be celebrated as taking down the infamous Michael and
 gain him as an informant on prior jobs and accomplices. &nbsp;Michael did the deal to get a fresh start for his wife and two kids, though he would learn he didnt like living as a law abiding citizen.</p>
<p>Trevor is apparently not happy when he discovers the truth, but has a long history and also wants to use Michaels skills to profit. &nbsp;Franklin wanted out of the gang hustles so latched onto Michael as a mentor, he also was not happy when he learned the truth,
 but had grown close to Michael and didnt want to give up the riches he had gained and go back to hustling.</p>
<p>This is the reason Franklin is giving a choice to kill Michael or Trevor for you to be the judge on who deserves it.</p>

<p>Yea, they didnt really explain, but when Michael was talking to the FIB agent, they spoke of how big a deal it was for the agent's career to be the onethat killed the infamous michael. &nbsp;They also talked about michael giving info in exchange for his fresh

<p>========================================<br />
I'm guessing you downloaded the photos&nbsp;from your camera?</p>
<p>It's possible for photos to become corrupted if the camera <br />
batteries are too low when they are downloaded.</p>
<p>I would try downloading the photos again to a different folder.<br />
If you have an internal or external media reader use it instead <br />
of connecting the camera to the PC via USB cable.</p>
<p>If you go to...Start / Computer...the camera or media reader <br />
should be recognized as a drive letter...you should be able to <br />
copy/paste or drag/drop the photos from there to a folder on <br />
your hard drive.</p>
<p>If the photos have been deleted from the memory card...the<br />
following freeware may be able to recover them.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As I understand, you want to login to Windows&nbsp;10 without entering a password.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would&nbsp;like to inform you that,&nbsp;<strong><span>&nbsp;if you are using a Microsoft Account, password is required and cannot be removed. However you can create a local account and disable the password prompt on login.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Refer to the below link to create a local account</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account</span></a></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to remove the password protection for a local account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Open the run box by pressing
<strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>R </strong>key, type <strong>netplwiz </strong>
and press <strong>enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>This should open <strong>User Accounts box
</strong>which will display a list of all users on the computer. From here you can
<strong>add</strong>, <strong>remove </strong>or see <strong>properties </strong>
of any user.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Select the <strong>user </strong>
from this list and uncheck “<strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong>” and then click on
<strong>Apply </strong>button.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now you will be presented with a dialog box which will prompt you to enter
<strong>password</strong>. Do so and then click on <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Also click on <strong>OK </strong>
in the <strong>User Accounts </strong>dialog box.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> it is not recommended to remove the password. Please remove at your own risk.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></p>

<h2>            Audio video gradually desyncing</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having an issue where while streaming anything, for the first ~30 minutes everything is fine, but then the audio gradually gets ahead of the video. Refreshing is the only thing that re syncs the two, but the audio immediatly goes ahead of the video
 again. If I shut down or sleep and then come back a while later they are in sync, but again only for a max of about 30 minutes. the issue occurs in chrome firefox and explorer and the netflix app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's absolutely driving me mad and I havent been able to find anything really useful online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone even have an idea of what could be causing the problem?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
