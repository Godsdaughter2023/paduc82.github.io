<p>Yeah, unfortunately I still can't get it to work. The option to roll back my driver is greyed out. When I try to update the driver it says I have the latest driver. Only thing I haven't tried yet is uninstalling. More help or thoughts would be appreciated!
 Thanks.</p>

<p>My early preference was Lydia. I bought the amulet, wore it in her presence, even took her to the chapel. She showed no interest (no marriage dialog options appeared). &nbsp;So I married Aela the Huntress. She's very nice, earns money while at home, and prepares
 nice home cooking. But, I suppose all the spouses do that.</p>

<p>I married Mjoll the Lioness in one playthrough, similar to Lydia in some respects. &nbsp;She did have an annoying follower of her own he had the gall to move into MY house with Mjoll. &nbsp;Was easy to fix though, just had Mjoll follow me to Dragonbridge (Aerin in
 tow) and blasted him off the bridge to the gorge below. &nbsp;(Tup: don't attack Aerin unless Mjoll is your follower, she has a psychic connection and will become hostile if anyone, including a chicken, sees you kill him, even if she is nowhere around)</p>

<p>Lydia is bugged, something to do with an unknown quest conflict. I too wanted Lydia, and was willing to wait for a patch to fix her, but then I meet Jordis (Joor - dis) The Sword Maiden after becoming Thane of Solitude. She isn't passive aggressive as Lydia,
 she actually sounds excited to accompany me and she is a lot shorter than 7ft tall Lydia. In my opinion she is prettier than Lydia and I came to enjoy her unique warmth and charm. Plus her being a one-handed fighter like myself was a plus.

            <p>Hi Matt,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually you might see this error if no valid Windows license was found for your device when upgrading to
<span>Windows&nbsp;10</span> or if you performed a clean installation of <span>Windows&nbsp;10</span>, which requires a new license to activate your copy of Windows.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you upgraded to Windows&nbsp;10 for free and ended up in a non-activated state, try following these steps:
</span></p>

<strong>Windows + R</strong> and type “<strong>slui 4</strong>”(without quotes) and hit enter.
</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Select the <strong>country/region

    <title>Windows update reverted display to MS Basic Display Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> b1ack5ky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update reverted display to MS Basic Display Driver</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 with a ATI Radeon HD 4800 series video card. Everything was working fine with my display until a recent update which caused my computer to start using the Microsoft Basic Display Driver. In Device Manager the Computer is still showing
 the correct video card. But when I go into my Display Settings and select Display Adapter properties, it shows that my monitor is using the MS Basic Display Driver (this doesn't even show up in Device Manager). Now I am stuck with low resolution settings for
 my large monitor. I cannot make the computer use the correct video card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried all the basics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Downloaded and installed latest drivers from video card vendor and monitor</li><li>Uninstalled and completely removed the video card and monitor</li><li>Rebooted the machine</li></ul>
<p>Still no luck to fixing. Suggestions? It has been working since my first day with Windows 10 until the last update.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Normally, this issue occurs when the drivers were being corrupted or updated after the recent update. Since you've already tried to install the latest driver, we suggest that you roll back to the previous driver and check if it helps to resolve the issue. To
 do this, kindly follow the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Double-click the device for which you want to roll back to the previous version of the driver, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Under the <strong>Driver</strong> tab, select <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after performing the suggested steps. </p>

<p>I just wanted to thank you! This is the only thing to have worked after several nights trawling the online help. My screen resolution is now back to normal after last week's Windows 10 update. I had tried so many "fixes" and this was the only one to have
 worked and was so easy to do! Now my photos look normal again and not horribly stretched! Thanks a million1</p>

            This keeps happening with each update sometimes rollback driver works sometimes I have to rollback the update. But why can’t Microsoft just stop pushing updates that destroy many users display drivers and resolve this issue?

<h3> alex cranswick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk usage discrepancy</h2>
                    <p>My C drive (SSD) is showing as full. If I look at the properties of the drive it shows 1.45GB free of 117GB. All my user data is shifted to a 1TB HD. If I look at the C drive directories (showing hidden) I have 12. If I use properties on the individual directories,
 I get Windows 30GB, Users 10GB, Program data 4GB, Programs x86 8GB, Programs 7GB. Of the remaining directories one is 10MB and the rest under 1MB.&nbsp; This come to approx. 60GB.&nbsp; I have run a health check on the SSD and it is coming back OK, so I am assuming
 for the present that the unaccounted space usage is not due to bad sectors.&nbsp; Is there any other reason why I should have lost half my disk space?&nbsp; I'm running 16Gb RAM - not sure where the page file is anymore on Windows 10.</p>

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

<p>OK, got a few utilities I wasn't aware of.&nbsp; One screen shot from Disc Management.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;From other utilities mentioned in replies, I have also looked at Storage use in the Systems settings, and got,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've got ~56GB in temporary storage.&nbsp; If I dig further into that I get ~2GB that I could remove, so that leaves me with ~54GB of temporary storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now downloaded WinDirStat and TreeSize and they are both showing me files within File Explorer temp directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And we seem to have the culprit in Nuance's OmniPage, which is an OCR app.&nbsp; I did a lot of scanning recently - not on 15-Jun, but round the time when the system started warning of disc usage on C:&nbsp; So assuming I can get either TreeSize or WinDirStat to delete
 files, I will clear out these temporary files and get back to more like 60% disc usage.</p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted all my results in reply to Greg's reply.&nbsp; Just in case you can't see that, between both your suggestions the answer seems to lie in temporary files created by Nuance's OmniPage which is an OCR app.&nbsp; As you say, Windows Explorer is not a great
 help as it would only show me the Temp directory and not what was in it.</p>

            Have you tried Disk Cleanup and CCleaner to see if it reaches these files for you so you can use it routinely?

<br />If not you can take ownership of the file if necessary to manually delete it:

<p>No.&nbsp; I don't usually have disc space issues. I did try the disk space clean up from Storage Management in settings, but that didn't find the temp files in question.&nbsp; I have configured the system so virtually everything is redirected to D other than the basic
 OS and major applications.&nbsp; Since the offending program was part of my printer installation, I suspect I may not have looked too carefully at what it was doing on installation. I was puzzled as I have a Windows 10 tablet running almost as many programs in
 just 64GB with no sign of hitting the limits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've cleared all the temp files out now and got back to 58 GB free of 117 GB.&nbsp; &nbsp;I will change that app to use the D drive rather than C, so if I do a lot of scanning again, I don't clog up C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, thanks to your suggestions, I have few more tools in the bag now to address any future issues along these lines.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t open &#34;app box&#34; or type in search box - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pattyt64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t open &#34;app box&#34; or type in search box</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 on my PC the night before last when it popped up saying I could. It seemed to be fine but I noticed the little purple box on the left side of the task bar would open the apps thing but when I clicked on any of them.. nothing happened
 (Mail, Settings, News, Cortana, etc.). Then today,, I clicked on that box and it won't open at all. Also my search bar will not allow me to type into it. I cannot find what I need because I can't search my own computer. Right clicking brings up a list but
 Search doesn't work when I click on that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling Windows 10 but that didn't help. I have no idea what to do as the app thing is a major part of the OS. I wanted to try Cortana and other things but now I can not open that box at all. And I need the search bar to allow me to search my
 computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me? I don't know if I uninstall 10, whether I will be able to reinstall it for free and even if that will fix the problem. As it is, my computer looks and runs like Windows 7 Home which is my old OS. The only change is that I have
 Task View box on my task bar now. I see no other changes because I can't get off my desktop and onto the nifty apps page that looks like 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew I should have waited... Anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I tried to roll back to Win 7 and it said I was missing something on my computer to do that. I tried to reset my computer and when the blue screen comes up asking me to pick a keyboard, I can't as my mouse doesn't show up and the keyboard doesn't work
 on that page so I can't so a thing. My only resort now is to completely reformat my computer and I hope THAT works.</p>

<p>Just search for free cd or dvd burning software. I would go to Softpedia or majorgeeks&nbsp;to look as they usually test free software for malware.</p>

</p><blockquote>Wow, tried several, they all were rejected by my Norton Antivirus, one didn't even boot up. So, maybe someone else will see this post and know how to make Windows Medial Player work.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</blockquote>
<p>You should not be running 2 virus and firewall programs. Defender will protect you as good as Norton. Norton is the worse there is. No wonder why you also can not do anything. Uninstall Norton.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Norton will reject just about every app there is. You have to allow it to install and run. Any program for that matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for someone knowing about WMP, LOL, if you can not open media player, drag a file to list and burn a CD then you have an issue somewhere. (Probably Norton)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can install Shark007 codec pack, oh no you cant, because you are running Norton and causing conflicts anyways running Norton and Defender. Get rid of Norton and change your PC experience from nonsense hassles and issues to easy very safe and secure system
 operations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you look in the options in RIP Music and Burn tabs.</p>
<p>Have you set your CD/DVD play settings</p>
<p>Have you checked the regional setting ion your CD/DVD player.</p>
<p>Does you CD/DVD player even work. Have you tried to play a CD</p>
<p>Is this a new windows 10 install or after update</p>

<p>Hi - as seahawk says the AV may be a contributory factor but many of these free softwares do have (or have had) malware associated with them. WMP is being left to wither on the vine by MS and problems with burning audio are frequently reported.</p>
<p>If you are not an apple hater try iTunes for Windows - it's rather a heavyweight program but it does a great job as a player, streamer and burner and has a built-in file converter. It
<em>should</em> download correctly but in view of the other problems you have experienced this may be to do with the November reformatting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.apple.com/uk/itunes/download/</a>&nbsp; (UK link select your region if necessary)</p>
<p>If you run into difficulties downloading iTunes don't persist - update here because there probably is an underlying issue that needs resolving. - Cheers, Ric.</p>

<p>Here is the thing. Pretty much every PC you buy with preinstalled OS comes with 3rd party basic burning software. I suggest to look in the all programs menu for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, Personally, Apple ITunes and Quicktime&nbsp;is a plague period. I would not install it whatsoever. There are so many free safe cd and dvd burning programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really need to uninstall Norton. It is a never ending problem and is no better protection than defender and you should never run 2 Virus firewall programs at one time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, disable Norton completely, download and install the free burner. The copy your CD either with Norton on or off and if on, allow the program to run when Norton warning comes up.</p>

<p>Maybe not. I know you can rip videos and encode on the fly streaming videos. I do not use VLC. I use to for conference video streaming but do not care for VLC.

    <title>Surface Records mp4 Files, But Cannot Play mp4 Files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Records mp4 Files, But Cannot Play mp4 Files</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I was recording on my Surface Pro 4, using the camera app. I have tested this before with short recordings and it has worked fine.</p>
<p>Currently whenever I record anything, it will only record in mp4 file format, which apparently none of my programs can read. This did not happen before as the photos app was able to allow me to view it right then.</p>
<p>Why would the included app record in a specific file format that no other app can open?</p>
<p>Is there a way to fix this assuming I did something?</p>
<p>I can see the files I have recorded (I tested both long and short recordings), but nothing is opening.</p>

<p>What programs were you trying to read the mp4 files with?&nbsp; Have you tried the VLC app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you are confusing the movie format which is mp4 with the picture format which is jpg.&nbsp; Your sp4 camera may be defaulting to movie format.

<h3> dpvhouse  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I clean my computer of contamination</h2>
                    My computer is running very slow and IE redirects me to other web sites. I contacted Lavasoft which provides my computer and internet security and I was directed to a tech that suggested all kinds of things were wrong with my computer and for only a few
 hundred dollars he could send me to the next level tech that would clean my computer and make it is good as new and protect it from the internet which caused the problems in the first place by hackers into my system. And I would never have these problems again.
 Is that possible? And do you folks have some suggestions for me.

Lavasoft used to be recommended - I don't recommend it anymore (for several years.)&nbsp; I'd get rid of that and replace it with something else.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
As for their suggestions (Lavasoft) and the statement about it "never" happening again.&nbsp; They used the word "never"?&nbsp; That should answer your question - if it happened now with their software already running on your system - really - NEVER?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<p>As far as AntiVirus (to replace Lavasoft and anything else you have) - the free ones are fine:

</a></p>
<p>&nbsp; (yes - they come with baggage - pop-ups to buy their full version.&nbsp; So...)<br />
</p>
You could spend ~60USD for two years of <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/home/products/antivirus-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSET NOD32 AntiVirus</a> (&lt;-- link) (not the suite - just the AntiVirus product) and that would be more than worth it.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>

<p>Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Restarting when needed.<br />
(You can uninstall one or both when done.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

Remove whatever is found.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
</p>
Restart the computer.<br />

The last suggestion I gave you was NOT a registry cleaner.&nbsp; I recommend never using a registry cleaner.&nbsp; Where did you get I suggested a registry cleaner and/or anything not free to use to clean a system?<br />

You should go through all my steps - it may get the function of the Eset Trojan cleaner back if you do.<br />

<h2>            Skype NOT WORKING AT ALL.</h2>
                    <p>My SKYPE failed to work completely&nbsp; for over a week now. Every time I telephone&nbsp; a land line in Hong Kong or, Singapore or Geneve , it failed completely to connect.
</p>
<p>We tried to contact "Skype Support"&nbsp; and that cannot be done because Skype Support will not let us contact them . They simply AVOID&nbsp; us by pushing us to Skype Community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have been using Skype for all our daily international calls for over 20 years&nbsp; . Skype has been&nbsp; a huge frustration with repeated failures of every kind</p>
<p>&nbsp;and increasingly freezing so very often that feels like they are treating us, to put it mildly,&nbsp; with disdain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help us. Once this is settled I swear I will leave SKYPE forever.</p>

<h2>            Getting WIndows blue screen error&#58; 124</h2>
                    Original Title: Win7 BSOD 124<br />
<br />
about 3 or 4 times a day i get the exact same 124 error, and all attempts at finding the cause or helping to solve the problem have been futile. at this stage, the only thing that seems to be certain is that it is a hardware issue, so if we go by hardware...<br />
<br />
CPU:<br />
i5 2500K overclocked at 4.65 Ghz. maximum temperature on load with BurnTest is 75 degrees.<br />
power saving features disabled<br />
voltage has been increased in case of stability issues, but BurnTest and Prime95 already ruled out&nbsp; stability being the problem with 30 minute tests<br />
<br />
RAM:<br />
1600mhz, not overclocked, stress tested<br />
<br />
Video Card:<br />
GTX 590 with all clocks ~20% overclocked. reduced the clocks since issues started. stressed with ATITool. no problem with stability and artifacts<br />
<br />
HDD:<br />
HDTune and SMART show no indication of hard drive being the cause<br />
<br />
PSU:<br />
1000 watts, high efficiency unit. shouldnt be using more than about 60% on full load anyway<br />
<br />
what is interesting to note, however, is that so far, i have not received a BSOD while encoding or gaming. every single time i would have had an IRC program open along with firefox, and sometimes winamp, OR i would leave the computer on idle to do something
 else, come back, and find it at the blue screen.<br />
<br />
the exact event viewer message is as follows:<br />
<br />
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck. The bugcheck was: 0x00000124 (0x0000000000000000, 0xfffffa80054dc028, 0x00000000be200000, 0x000000000005110a). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 102911-26379-01.<br />
<br />
off the top of my head, i cant remember if all of them have the same values between the parenthesis, but the error has always been 124, and 124 only.<br />
<br />
windows is already up to date with updates, and video card driver was updated after the issues started.<br />
<br />
the computer was built only a few months back, and was overclocked immediately. i hardly think that overclocking would show adverse affects now, instead of shortly after setting the new clocks and placing a load on the hardware. even so, the next time i boot
 up, i plan on temporarily putting the processor back to stock speeds, just for the heck of it<br />
<br />
additionally, i cannot think of anything that may have caused this to start. there is nothing that i could have been doing to have caused this...and i dont mean 'nothing' like the other idiots who cant tell a DVD tray from a cup holder. i literally mean that
 nothing has changed from my usual browsing of one forum, team fortress 2 gaming, and IRC sessions, nor have there been any newly installed programs, other than those that were used for for the diagnosis of this issue.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Over-clocking can easily be the root cause as it can damage hardware and even drivers can<br />
have a negative impact on an over-clocked system. 1st step I would take is to remove ALL the
<br />
over-clocking which should help to determine the cause which is likely to be heat and/or hardware.<br />
<br />
Over-clocking, especially since it increases the levels of heat on the components, can have the
<br />
same effect as running low quality oil in an engine. It will not immediately fail yet the damage done
<br />
can show up well before the normal lifespan is reached or even in-sight.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that heat related does not always mean excessive heat as it could be that a
<br />
component has become too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat.<br />
<br />
The most common heat related cause is the heat sink, the connection of the heat sink and
<br />
processor, and the compound between the heat sink and processor. The latter is particularly
<br />
suspect when a system has been over-clocked.<br />
<br />
=======================================<br />
<br />
Could be heat related - try using a small fan to blow into the air intakes to see if that helps.<br />
Does it just act like it loses power or does it shutdown in a normal manner?<br />
<br />
Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) -<br />
actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Remove the dust bunnies and clean&nbsp;the<br />
vents. Check that the fans work (before and after opening the case). If a laptop about all<br />
you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents (still can try adding a small fan as a<br />
test).<br />
<br />
This sounds like hardware so if the above does not help then you probably need the help<br />
of a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the
<br />
System Maker's Support.<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            hmm, so far, i havent received any further blue screens, so im approaching this with cautious optimism. the only thing i have done differently is lowered the FSB by 20 mhz...i seriously doubt that was the cause however, especially as i have already ruled
 out stability as an issue.<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I though my oil analogy would do the trick.<br />
<br />
The very fact that the 20 mhz change has helped actually points to over-clocking and the
<br />
possibility of some damage done to the system as the likely cause. BTW that directly
<br />
points to system instability relating to the hardware. <br />
<br />
Where you using extra cooling as part of your over-clocking setup? That certainly helps though<br />
it does not guarantee that there will not be negative effects on the hardware.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            I have a H70, so cooling is no issue. however, i have also stated that so far i have not had a blue screen under a full load, evident by my stressing of the CPU, RAM, and video card. i would understand why the blue screen happens if it was like this, but
 as these always happen at idle, with little to no load, and perfectly normal 40 degree idle temperatures, that is the part that confuses me.<br />
<br />
sorry if i sound stubborn in my non-willingness to believe it is from the overclocking, but things just dont add up.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Actually it does add up...... the proof is the 20 mhz change helped to stabilize the system.<br />
So whether&nbsp;clocking is involved in the root cause of the issue or not it does seem to&nbsp;be
<br />
involved in the occurrence.<br />
<br />
An electronic part will often react at a certain temperature, though it is not suppose to,<br />
and that can trigger an event. As parts age they are more likely to do this. That is why<br />
even normal temps can be present when a heat related event happens. This may not<br />
be the cause however it happens very often. If so the fix is to replace the component.<br />
(Over-clocking, even with adequate cooling, can cause aging to occur at a more rapid<br />
rate that normally would be expected. Also&nbsp;a given percentage of any type of component<br />
can age&nbsp;or breakdown at more rapid rate than the norm.&nbsp;Such is the nature of electronic
<br />
components.)<br />
<br />
Why not upload the minidumps so we can analyze them as indicated in the troubleshooter<br />
above. That may not help thought it might.<br />
<br />
We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other file<br />
sharing sites.<br />

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>We have a digital video camera, and editing software called Ulead. &nbsp;Worked great in WindowsXP, but now we cannot view or edit these videos at all. &nbsp;Error that the camera cannot be found, and the software won't launch as it seems incompatible with Vista.
 &nbsp;Don't really want to go to the expense of new camera and software. &nbsp;Isn't there some way of running 32-bit software and drivers on a 64-bit machine?</p>

<p><span>Hello SkyeHierwarter,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have 32 Bit Windows Vista installed on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Most programs designed for a computer running a 32-bit version of Windows will work on a computer running 64-bit versions of Windows. Notable exceptions
 are many antivirus programs, and some hardware drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>However, on my research I see that the Ulead Video Editing Software is not compatible with Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>You should try to run the Software in the Compatibility mode and check if you are able to run this.
</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Programs, and then clicking Use an older program
 with this version of Windows. <br />
<br />
2. Follow the instructions in the wizard.</span></p>
<p><span>Check out this article for more information on this:

<p><span>If this does not work, you can also try to use the Windows Movie Maker as the Video Editing Software. Check out this article for more information on
 this: </span></p>

<p>I chat with support team and they told that this serial is registered with another account, they opened case to unregister it to let me register.</p>
<p>They also told that my console had 250HDD and internal 4gb either. Now if I can't see it in setting, that means that it is corrupted. May the internal storage get lost due to user actions like formatting or something like this?</p>
<p>Is there any tool to check physical devise status? </p>

<h2>            have lost my .pdf drag and drop feature - Upgraded to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When trying to drag and drop .pdf from 'folder' to programs such as Dropbox - I receive a small icon on the .pdf with a red circle and red line through it.&nbsp; This only began after upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp; Any advice to 'turn on' this drag and drop feature?&nbsp;
 (I can drag and drop to Outlook email message)&nbsp; (currently using Adobe Acrobat&nbsp;DC if needed to know :))</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you would like to enable the drag and and drop feature for Adobe Acrobat. We will help you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to update Adobe Acrobat to the latest version and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to Place the computer in <strong>Clean Boot</strong> state and then try to drag and drop.</span></p>
<p><span>A Clean Boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please refer the steps given in the link below to perform a <strong>Clean Boot</strong>:</span></p>

<p>Then get rid of the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">discontinued</span></em> Windows Live One Care and replace it with its successor, MSE.</p>
<p><strong>Microsoft Security Essentials</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>If you have another computer handy, you can download and save both programs. Copy to CD or Flash and then install them on the laptop.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player crashing First time, Every time</h2>
                    This is rather recent, Every time I open Windows Media Player, For the first time for that day, It crashes. It runs fine if I open it again, but the first time after start up it crashes on me. Nothing has recently changed, although I do have automatic
 updates. It is kind of annoying, but Not urgent.

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft forums. </p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand that Windows Media Player is crashing on the computer. We are sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you get any error message when the Windows Media Player crashes?<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to the computer prior to the issue?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You might be facing this issue due to some changes in the Windows media player settings or some software conflicts. I suggest you to try the following settings and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to perform the Media Player troubleshooter and check if it helps. If your computer is having problems playing video or audio files in Windows Media Player, try using the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to fix the problem. The troubleshooter
 checks the configuration and network settings for Windows Media Player to make sure that you can play content you've downloaded and saved to your computer, or content streaming over a network or the Internet.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows key + C” on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type Troubleshooting and click Troubleshooting under Settings.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now select Programs in the search option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Media Player, select Windows Media Player DVD and Windows Media Player Settings respectively to run the troubleshooters.</p>
<p>You can try the following steps if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable and then enable Windows media Player from the Windows Features and see if the issue persists.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.Press Windows key + X and select Control Panel.<br />
2.Select Programs and Features.<br />
3. click Turn Windows features on or off. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
4.Click on Media Features.<br />
5. To turn Windows Media Player off, clear the check box. Click OK and then restart the computer.</p>
<p>To Turn Windows Media Player ON, click on the checkbox once again and click OK. And then restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue persists, I suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot and check. Clean boot eliminates software conflicts.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Follow the instructions (Step 1 for Windows 8) given in this link to perform a clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Note: After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow these steps to return the computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.<br />
c) On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click ok.<br />
d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope it helps.<br />
For any further Windows related assistance, feel free to contact us and we will be glad to help.</p>
