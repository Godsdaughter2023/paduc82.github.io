<h2>            Battery saver</h2>
                    The battery saver feature was working okay but since last one day the feature got disabled. When I turn it on, nothing happens and it gets turned off on its on.

            Hi saara-25,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Ana. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us
<br />
<br />I recommend checking the configuration to activate the battery saving process.
<br />
<br />First disconnect the PC from the electricity and keep it running only with the charge and go to the option of battery configuration verify it is activated
<br />- Turn battery saver on automatically if my battery falls below
<br />- Battery saver status until next charge
<br />Set the percentage for activation preferably at 20% load.
<br />

<br />
<br />Important: take into account that while the load is active is to say the pc connected to the current battery saving will be disabled.
<br />
<br />I wish I had helped you.
<br />Let me know any questions
<br />Regards

    <title>What Do I need to connect a monitor to my Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dblack17  say:</h3>
<h2>            What Do I need to connect a monitor to my Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    I have a surface pro 3 and just bought a new monitor. Can you tell&nbsp; me what I need to hook them up. None of the cables that came with the monitor work with my Surface . Will the mini DisplayPort to VGA Adapter work or do I need the Microsoft Surface Dock.
 Thank you.

            Yes, a converter should be enough to use a monitor.&nbsp;I've been able to connect a monitor using an HDMI to Mini DP, so I'd imagine it'd be the same for VGA.

            <p>If you mean Outlook, then you can uninstall Outlook via Control Panel | Add / Remove programs.&nbsp; If you mean Outlook Express, then you can't uninstall it, but you can open it up and remove your mail account from it (Tools
 | Accounts | Mail) if set it up before.&nbsp; I don't know if you can set AOL as the default mail handler in Windows though.&nbsp; You might try asking in an AOL forum, if they have such.</p>
<p>You should post your second question as a separate question, as no one will see it, since the subject doesn't cover it.</p>

            wvbailey here: I see a ton of errors on my system WIN7 64 bit. Similar complaint. Critical at 2 instances in the past hour (Kernel power, me forcing shutdown). Errors qty 103 in the past hour, 1387 in 24 hours, 3750 in the past 7 days (!!) The misery seems
 to start in mid-April. In the past hour Event IDs #3, #10 (WMI), #1000, #1002, #6008, #7001 (Service Control Manager, 52 instances), #7026 (1 instance), 7031 (21 instances), #7032 (4 instances), #7034 (4 instances), #10000 (1 instance), #10005 (6 instances),
 Is there an automated way to get this stuff back to you folks? Should I just pay the $100 and have someone look at the machine?

<p>Hello Tyler!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! I understand that being locked out of your account can be frustrating but, I will be happy to assist you today. Just to clarify so that I understand your situation better, are you having issues signing into your
 account just on the website or are you also having an issue with signing into your account on your Xbox One console and/or Xbox App? Have you tried to reset your password to see if maybe your password was incorrect? Do you know if you have Two-Step Verification
 active on your account? I would suggest waiting 24 hours before trying any more login attempts. I would also suggest trying to go through the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/lost-password-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Account Recovery</a> process after the 24 hours I suggested you wait. Thank you again for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

<p>There was another user with the same problem as you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>We told him to wait 72 hours and then try again, Why? because it may have to be something with security issues, so, better to wait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you could try resetting your Ip or changing browser or device, get into the MS support, and see if you have been flagged for something.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UGH my is still broken also. And it has now been over two weeks that I still cant login to my account. The only response I get is that it is being worked on and thats even after I reported this to the BBB. Even My thread was closed by Microsoft for dubious
 reasons which is horrible because it clearly shows they dont care about customers or this issue we are having. Just a recap this is the issue some of us are having.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help but it's not any of those issues. Since all those options are the first steps many of us tried when well before calling support. This is an ongoing issue for a few unlucky gamers that cant access their profile on any device or web browser.
 All we are asking is that the issue be resolved or give use the opportunity to migrate our accounts or keep us in the loop of when it could potentially be fixed. Instead we are being ignored and silenced with no real updates as to what why how or when we can
 access our accounts again. :(</p>

<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>This issue can be caused if the app is not completely closed, it is in suspended state. You have been trying to close
 the game app by dragging the app to the bottom of the screen, you most likely noticed that the app may still be running in the Task Manager. Microsoft has implemented a new yet still similar way to close the app completely.
</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>In order to close an app in Windows 8.1, simply drag the app to the bottom of the screen (just like how you do it in
 Windows 8) and simply hold the app there for a second until the app tile changes to its own logo. Now the app will close completely and eventually the process will disappear from the Task Manager within a few seconds. You can still close apps the old way by
 simply dragging them to the bottom of the screen but the app may still appear in the task manager.</font></font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000"><font>Memory consumption is a big issue these days so this process is important for those of you who do not want an app to
 eat up your resources unnecessarily. So there you have it. Try out this new method to close apps in Windows 8.1 and let us know if you encounter any issues.</font></font></span></p>

    <title>Unable to open files from back up in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ludovic cruz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to open files from back up in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi - first time post on here. Can someone help or advise?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new Desktop, running Windows 10. My previous Desktop died after 7 years with a complete failure of the hard drive.
</p>
<p>I am trying to restore files from a WD Passport back up, but having now moved the "retrieved" folders and files there is an issue with "permissions" and I am unable to open any documents, photos. music or anything. The previous Desktop was originally Windows
 7, but I took the option of a free upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The standard error message for jpegs is : </p>
<p>"IT APPEARS YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO VIEW THIS FILE. CHECK THE PREMISSIONS AND TRY AGAIN".</p>
<p>and for Word documents:</p>
<p>"WORD CANNOT OPEN THE DOCUMENT. USER DOES NOT HAVE ACCESS PRIVILEGES"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to view security settings but on the files I have checked, these are set under Type as "Allow" and access as "Full control".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or possible fixes appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>

<p>Hi Dennis</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this suggestion and found that all updates were current so no change I'm afraid - same problem as described before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the problems with my new week old Dell PC have now got worse. During a session with MS support, my internet connection began to cut out - making it difficult for them to complete the fix allowing me to import my Contacts into Outlook. Yes,
 another problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the internet connection on the PC is cutting out regularly - and I abandoned any attempt to reconnect with a support engineer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the PC is switched OFF the internet connections for other devices work fine, so my broadband connection works OK.&nbsp; I suspect the issue is One Drive which on inspection is trying to update 5.2GB of Outlook data - running in the background. I have found
 a way of stopping this by unticking "Start OneDrive automatically when I sign into Windows" - this has now stopped my internet connection dropping out. I have no experience with OneDrive, but can't believe it would create a problem like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to my original question with no longer having "permissions" to view seven years' worth of retrieved documents, music and photos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts on how I can fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin (Ludovic)</p>

            <p>Hi Omkesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are other ways to boot your PC in Recovery Environment to access the UEFI Firmware settings, and use it to isolate the issue. Kindly follow the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Restart your PC with Recovery Environment.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Power</strong> button from <strong>Start</strong>.</li><li>Press and hold down<strong> Shift key</strong> while clicking <strong>Restart</strong> button.</li></ol>
<p>By then, you can now access <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>option </strong>
from there.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method</strong> <strong>2</strong>: Through Command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt (Admin) </strong>by right-clicking<strong> Start </strong>
button.<strong><br />
</strong></li><li>Type in "<strong>shutdown.exe /r /o</strong>" without the quotation.</li></ol>
<p>A message will prompt in the middle of the screen warning you that you are about to be signed off and then, your PC will automatically
<strong>Restart</strong> with Recovery Environment.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Dont know. There has not been anyword on if the DLC will get any alts. I get the feeling that they are waiting for the fourth character to be released so they can patch an extra area to the Krypt that we will be able to get the alts, second fatalities, concept
 art, etc. But of course dont know this for sure.</p>

                    My system would run for up to one hour but within that time it would crash and then hang at the Blue Screen (BSOD) and not generate a crash dump file. The event logs were not helpful because they would create a warning or error based on whatever application
 or service was running at the time of the crash.

<div>The Blue Screen would display the following error code:</div>

That is a DNS error. Since several other people have reported the same error today, there is probably a problem with the DNS records for some mail.live.com servers. It should sort itself out in due course.<br />

    <title>Minecraft Freezes when installing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kid.oliva  say:</h3>
<h2>            Minecraft Freezes when installing</h2>
                    <p>I purchased Minecraft for Christmas. It installed fine and was able to play without issue. About a month ago, it started to hang when launching and would take over a minute ot two. I decided to uninstall and reinstall. At first it would not uninstall and
 make the Xbox One X unstable and I would have to shut it down by holding the power button for 10 seconds. I tried to uninstall again and it froze. I just left it in hopes ut would uninstall. It finally did after an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then proceeded to reboot the Xbox and reinstall. It would reach 93.9% and then freeze. The install would not continue. I noticed when installing from the disk at this point it would show a ridiculous number of 2.5TB of 2.45TB completed. Minecraft is only
 about 350MB. I stopped the install and removed the game. Rebooted the Xbox and tried again. Same issue. I tried installing offline, same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I thought maybe the disk is corrupt so I purchased Minecraft through the Microsoft Store. I have now purchased the game twice. I really love my kids. I started up the Xbox, clicked install and now it is stuck at 95%. What is wrong with the
 install. Is there a way I can get at the registry on the Xbox One? I bet there is something lingering it did not clear. I could use your help Microsoft. This is your system and game that I have purchased through your store.</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble with Minecraft not fully installing is that correct? Take a look at this helpful support article

            So basically you're saying I need to do a factory reset? I explained everything so the first suggestion is pointless as I have already done that. I was trying to avoid a factory reset. The Xbox One runs on a stripped down version of Windows. There is no
 way for me to connect and manually clean the registry and remove any folders? I am a licensed Support Engineer and finishing up my MCSA. I have manually removed and cleaned many viruses and corrupt software files. It would take me probably 30 minutes at most.
 A factory reset for a 350MB game when I have a TB worth of games and data on my Xbox One X is unacceptable.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Kid.Oliva, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for responding to us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately there is no way for you to access the registry to remove any folders. As for the reset to the console. XBF George was saying to select the option to Keep your games and apps. That would remove the account but keep all the games and apps. As
 long as you don't pick the option to remove everything then it should be fine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give it a try and let us know how it goes :)</p>

<h2>            how can you make folders open or display a preview when hovering the mouse on them&#63;</h2>
                    I would like to find a way to make a folder, particularly on the desktop, that would popup or somehow show its contents just with the mouse hovering for say a second or something. &nbsp;Something similar to how the start menu can turn the folders to the right
 into menus which can be navigated from there. &nbsp;I want to put several shortcuts in a folder to save space on my desktop but I want to show them with just a mouse hover so that its basically the same functionality as the having them on the desktop without extra
 clicking involved or popping an explorer window up.

Unfortunately that is not possible. If we hover over a folder or a file it will show us the default information which is by design. You may post your feedback on the following link:<br />

            Hello  DickWilliams1072
<br />Make sure that iCloud isn’t your default account in Data Files
<br />When iCloud is set as your default account in Data Files, your data won't sync between your devices. 
<br />
<br />Select File &gt; Info &gt; Account Settings &gt; Data Files. 
<br />If iCloud is listed as the default account in the Comments column, select a different account.
<br />Click Set as Default.
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

<p><span><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Which version of windows Vista is installed on your computer?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Have you made any recent changes on your computer?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Did you get any error message when you try to enter cost in Assign Resource Window?</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>Which application are you using for Assign Resource?</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I have few steps which might help you.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Perform clean boot and check if you have similar issue, you can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform clean boot (Check the link for Performing clean boot)</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable half of the services</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine whether the problem returns</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable half of the startup items</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine whether the problem returns</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat the above steps until you find out which service or program is causing the issue</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration Utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article : How to troubleshoot a problem
 by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7 : </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Try to uninstall the application, then reinstall it back and check if it is working fine.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Actually, backing up is quick and effortless ... once you know how. My computer runs backups every night and manages the entire process automatically. The 'trick' is to use a third-party backup program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 only has one supported backup utility, and that's File History, which was designed for backing up small numbers of files and folders as they are changed. You&nbsp;<em>can</em> make it backup all your personal files at one time, but it's awkward and
 not even close to being as convenient and reliable as a third-party backup program. Windows 10 has no supported image backup utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a 'real' backup program you can custom-design as many different backup jobs as you like, have them run automatically on a schedule you choose, create a retention schedule that automatically maintains the last 10 days' worth of backups or the last week
 of backups, for examples, and even checks the backup to see if it ran correctly. You can be notified by email if a backup succeeded or failed. And that's just the beginning: You can run incremental backups throughout the day, backup to a wide variety of locations,
 and so much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do a ''folder and file' backup to backup all your own data folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) or you can do an image backup to backup an entire partition in one shot. Windows can't do that - and why should it, when there's an entire industry of
 developers who specialize in that type of technology.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To find great backup software, just search the internet. Look for reviews and comparisons by professional reviewers (not 'hey YouTube') and try a few. Macrium Reflect is a popular image backup program which will also do a folder and file backup, as will
 Acronis TrueImage and EaseUS ToDo Backup, among others. For a strictly folder and file backup there are too many good programs to list but Backup4All is a good example. And for folder and file backups many people just use a file compression program like 7-zip
 or WinZip.</p>

            <pre>Hi  loveaduck44br 
The information below I provide is thorough and verbose, but its the truth regarding Backup in Windows 10. and the alternatives you will need to consider. 
File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Details:
Lets start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsofts Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. Its optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let's say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup -This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let's say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer wonâ€:tm:t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoftâ€:tm:s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image a Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That's pretty much all that's involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time. If you still want something a bit more user-friendly, then check out EaseUS Todo Backup Free.

<h2>            Windows 7 Won&#39;t Boot, Just Black Screen.</h2>
                    I am currently running Windows 7 Home Premium 64X (Upgraded from Vista just a month ago) on my Acer Aspire laptop.&nbsp; I turn on my computer and the following happens:
<br />
1st&gt;&nbsp; system boots showing BIOS info&nbsp; <br />
2nd&gt; 5 mins of black screen before the screen says "Windows is loading files"<br />
3rd&gt; a few seconds later the "Microsoft Corporation" and load bar appears but blinks away after 3 seconds<br />
4th&gt;nothing but blackness; no login screen or anything!<br />
<br />
I can't even get into Safe Mode (F8), after pressing the buttons a few times the beeping starts.&nbsp; I tried the 5x Shift Button tip, but no good. I have not recently installed any devices or software and very IT skilled.&nbsp; This is a real nuisance, please help.&nbsp;
 Thanks
