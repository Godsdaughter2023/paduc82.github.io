<h2>            Windows 10 - 1809 update Active Directory error&#47;can&#8217;t log in&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>So I have about 10 computers attached to a local NAS (Synology) as an Active Directory server. Let me point out that each of these computers has an ethernet connection to the server, is running an activated version of Win 10 Pro and has roaming profiles
 e.d. This all worked fine until today. <br />
Today collegues of mine started to get the Windows 10 v 1809 update. Nothing to worry about, really, was my thought. But as the update finished, logging in 'stalled'&nbsp; the computer. There is a video of the situation after logging in here: https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/9l2hlt/windows_10_1809_update_active_directory_errorcant/<br />
It is important to know that the 'older versions'&nbsp; of Windows 10 don't have any problem logging in!</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>So what did I do to troubleshoot?<br />
&nbsp;- Rolled back the computers that could be rolled back. Fixed the problem for them.<br />
&nbsp;- Created a clean windows installation with v 1809. I can add the computer to the Active Directory although when I reboot and try to login to a user, the same problem occurs.<br />
&nbsp;- Tried removing all GPO's. No effect.<br />
&nbsp;- Tried different (new) users. No effect.<br />
&nbsp;- Tried changing network settings. No effect.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>What I probably should add is that the used DNS server for windows is 192.168.0.100, which is the NAS which runs the DNS server and Active Directory.<br />
I am really confused. Can maybe someone help me out to solve this problem? <br />
And if not, maybe someone knows more technical details on what changed in this new version that might lead to my problem?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thanks a lot!</div>

            Hi IT.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would ask this at our sister forums for IT professionals Technet, as this is strictly a consumer site:  <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-...</a>
<br />
<br />I will add that I would always troubleshoot with only a single monitor, and to check your Display driver is fully updated and working properly.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Hey Greg!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your reply to my previous post. I followed your tip on troubleshooting with one monitor. Thanks for this tip, it got me further in the process! I have the following update after another day of troubleshooting. Hope someone can help out!<br />
</p>
<p>First I tried logging in via Safe mode. The system almost instantly crashed giving me the following error:<br />
<br />
<em>sihost.exe&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>-&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>System Warning Unknown hard error&nbsp;</em><br />
<em>&lt;ok&gt;</em><br />
<br />
So that didn't help. Next I logged in reguarly and the screen started flashing again. I waited for an hour to see if anything happened but unfortunately not.<br />
<br />
We got to this situation:<br />
&nbsp;- Local login works (seems fine)<br />
&nbsp;- AD login crashes<br />
&nbsp;- Ctrl + Alt + Del works. So I can logout crashed user<br />
&nbsp;- Loggin in locally again makes the "hi, welcome'&nbsp; video appear. After this it seems the local user has partly reset.<br />
&nbsp;- Everything is up to date (double checked).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What I did next was disconnecting my screens. Suprisingly this helped with the flickering, and so I could log in to my AD profiles, although still there seems to be a problem with the server connection.&nbsp;<br />
It seemed I had this problem (Edge doesn't have internet connection) https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Windows-10/Windows-10-1809-Edge-not-loading-pages/td-p/266050 which I could fix by enabeling IPv6 (It is weird this is obligated right? Or is this a
 driver issue?)<br />
Then it seemed I also had this problem (search bar not working) https://basics.net/2016/12/20/windows-10-cant-type-in-search-field/ which I haven't really been able to fix by following the numerous online tutorials on how to fix this.<br />
<br />
Also the following errors occur in the error log:<br />
<br />

<br />
<em>The User Profile Service service terminated unexpectedly.&nbsp; It has done this 1 time(s).&nbsp; The following corrective action will be taken in 120000 milliseconds: Restart the service.</em><br />

So not sure what to do now. Seems everything is very unstable.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts? </p>

Anyway, rolled back all devices except one. Still experiencing the problems, so I'll just wait for a new update first before seeking technical help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have experienced the same issue in some computers and finally we discovered that by removing the HOMESHARE value in the AD account settings, the users were able to logon. Maybe it might help you.</p>

<p>We've experienced the same issue.&nbsp; This was only experienced by users that, under the Profile tab in their AD account, had a UNC path in the Local path that was not mapped to a drive letter.&nbsp; Users with a drive letter assigned were fine. Once we changed
 Local Path to Connect to drive letter users were able to log in successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a quick script I used to find and change the settings.&nbsp; Probably not the most efficient, but it was quick and worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To get the list:</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Get-ADUser {-filter enabled -eq $true} -properties SamAccountName, HomeDirectory, HomeDrive | where {$_.HomeDirectory -like '*\users\*' -and $_.HomeDrive -ne 'D:'} | FT SamAccountName, HomeDirectory, HomeDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To make the change:</strong></p>
<p>Get-ADUser {-filter enabled -eq $true} -properties SamAccountName, HomeDirectory, HomeDrive | where {$_.HomeDirectory -like '*\users\*' -and $_.HomeDrive -ne 'D:'} | Set-ADUser -HomeDrive 'D:'</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, FYI -while looking at Task Manager while the screen flashing was going on we saw the Explorer.exe process starting, hanging, starting, hanging, starting, hanging, etc.</p>

<p>Thankyou!!!!&nbsp; I have been fighting this for about 3 months on about 6 different computers all using Active Directory from a Synology server.&nbsp; The symptoms varied slightly but most of them end up with a flashing task bar and or an SIHost error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your suggestion I checked the Active Directory service on the Synology and each user had a home path set in their profile set to "\\10.1.10.151\home" changing this to use a home path with a drive letter solved the problem.</p>

            <p>I agree. This happens on the Windows 10 phone calendar as well. It seems to affect whole day events (including events which I create myself). If I make an event with a specific time, it works fine. If I make a whole-day event it immediately gets changed
 to the previous day.</p>

            <p>None of this works to fix the problem.</p>
<p>The Windows 10 calendar app is faulty if you live in New Zealand.</p>
<p>Public NZ holidays appear one day out&nbsp;in the app, however appear correct in the&nbsp;web browser calendar.</p>

            Looks like this problem with the Windows 10 calendar has had a problem with NZ Holidays for months and it is still an issue. &nbsp;All the Easter 2016 days showing up one day out. Good Friday as Thursday 24th, Easter Monday as Sunday 27th. &nbsp;Can the developers
 please give some priority to fixing this? &nbsp; Seems pretty fundamental. None of the 'fixes' in previous posts addresses the issue. &nbsp;It seems the problem is only for NZ users.

            <p>Interesting... suggests it is an issue with NZ Daylight Savings Time. Holidays during Standard Time are fine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daylight savings ends on Sunday the 3rd of April. If I try make an all day event on Sunday the 3rd and Monday the 4th - the Sunday one gets moved to Saturday, the Monday one is fine.</p>

            <p>Interestingly, although I reported that this was only an issue with NZ Holidays, when I enable Australian &amp; UK holidays their Easter Holidays are exhibiting the same one day error in the Calendar. &nbsp;But I agree with you that the problem appears to be related
 to<strong> holidays which fall within the NZ daylight savings time period.</strong> &nbsp;Turning off daylight saving makes no difference. &nbsp; Looking forward, there are errors in Labour Day (Monday Oct 24th) , Christmas Day, Boxing Day. &nbsp;In 2016, NZ daylight savings
 time ends on 3 April and starts on 25 September. &nbsp;There ya go Microsoft, we are helping you with detective work!</p>

Finally I got the answer for this issue. As I mentioned in above thread "One Important Observation: I am not able open below two URL's in any browser while any other website is getting opened in IE."<br />
<br />
The reason for the same was my DNS of router was got hacked which I finally managed to fix. Please go through below link.

<br />
Thanks to jd_programmer1 [see the answer given by him in above link]. <br />
<br />
Now I am able to update my windows machine.<br />
<br />
Note: Make your router firewall enabled, router password should be strong enough so that it can not be hacked easily.<br />

<h2>            Store Games - keyboard input not working</h2>
                    <p>Hello! Recently I bought Game Pass Ultimate and loaded my PC with games. They worked normal but yesterday I ran into an issue. None of the games I got work with my keyboard. Like when I push WASD I don't move. When I move my mouse, it works like normal but
 not the keyboard. When I connect my xbox one remote, it works like if I was playing on an xbox. I mainly play Minecraft and Sea of Thieves and both have the same issue and result with the remote. I've tried restarting my PC, reinstalled and reset the apps,
 and even putting new batteries in my keyboards and mice. I know my keyboard still works since I was able to type this! The game is just not getting my keyboard input.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Jorti.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you everything possible for keyboard problems.  If you need help with any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />If this began within the recent past,  See if you can  System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Check which Updates were installed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History and try uninstalling any from around the time this started.  If they return and cause the same problem then hide them with the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />What also might work is to go into Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Keyboard device, on Driver tab try Updating the driver automatically.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the same location try rolling back or Uninstalling the Keyboard driver, which works in a surprising number of cases where keyboard is messed up by Updates.  Restart PC to reinstall driver. 
<br />
<br />See if the keyboard will work in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />If not see if the On-screen Keyboard works at Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard &gt; Turn On the On Screen Keyboard.  
<br />
<br />If so then it could confirm the keyboard is failing, so test it in repair mode to see if it works since it uses different drivers there:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If not you can contact a laptop manufacturer to see if you can still get it replaced under warranty, or check for replacement keyboards for that model from the PC maker or online from after-market OEM's that exactly match it.  
<br />
<br />This keyboard bulletin from Lenovo can also apply to other brands:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht118432" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/solutions/ht...</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting the keyboard:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also remap keyboard keys using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap-fix-keyboard-layout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/missing-key-remap...</a>
<br />
<br />Check in your BIOS or UEFI firmware Setup for keyboard settings there, too.  
<br />
<br />If none of these works then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />Update your drivers and BIOS/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />Another thing that might help as it solves many problems is to Upgrade to the latest version by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Generally, you can see the duration about this call in the Skype for Business client: click the

</p><p>Meanwhile, based on my experience, if all participants leave the meeting, it can be closed. In other words, if the conference is going on, they can hear the conversation unless they leave the conference.

    <title>No sound from speakers on dell studio 17 laptop, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wacko118  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound from speakers on dell studio 17 laptop,</h2>
                    
<p>Only sound is on startup and shutdown so the speakers are working. I get the microsoft jingle when the windows icon loads, however once i sign in there is no sound of any kind from any kind of speaker, internal or external. I check the sound control and
 it says it is producing audio, i also checked the microsoft fix it auto thing and that detected no problem....</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any changes in the sound scheme?</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Step 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Make sure the speakers are set as default playback
 device. Do the following to check.</span></p>

 Start and Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Hardware and Sound and then Sound.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 the Playback tab, check if the Speakers say Default Device.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 not, right click on Speakers and select Set as default device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check for the issue by changing the sound schemes.

<h2>            wifi stops working suddenly</h2>
                    <p>I have an ACER Aspire S7-191 running win10 which automatically updated recently.&nbsp; A shrt while after the update wifi stopped working.&nbsp; I can connect to internet through cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried loading an older version of the Qualcomm Atheros ARBMD222 driver&nbsp; -- no effect</p>
<p>I tried Manually reloading WLAN autoconfig&nbsp; -- no effect except that o get a message that the path to the exe does not exist.&nbsp; It does exist! &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried running the svchost.exe directly -- no effect</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using a&nbsp; USB wifi module -- The computer recognises it and loads the drivers.&nbsp; Again does not work.&nbsp; Incidentally this was a TP-LINK T4UH with the very latest software driver.</p>
<p>

<h2>            no network after windows 10 upgrade -  broadcom 4313</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded my machine from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 Pro. After the update the machine doesn't recognize my wifi device. It is a broadcom 4313. I have tried installing drivers for windows 8.1 and 7 but no effect. In the device manager it shows the device
 is working properly. Same problem with my NIC, it is a Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller. &nbsp;It is also displayed as working properly in device manager, but when I try to setup a new network from Network and Sharing Center it shows that there is no network
 device. Also there is no option to add wireless network in the&nbsp;Network and Sharing Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any solutions ? Thanks in advance</p>
<p>Sreejith</p>

<br />
WiFi would show, "Connected.&nbsp; No internet."<br />
Wired wouldn't work either.&nbsp; The light on the network adapter was flashing fast orange as if to signify some sort of error.<br />
<br />
ipconfig revealed a 169.254.x.x address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about 4 hours I uninstalled my anti-virus (Avast in this case) and restarted.

Everything works now.<br />
Good luck everyone.</p>

            <p>I have had the same problem of not getting a IPv4 IP-adress, only IPv6.</p>
<p>So i set a static IPv4 in my current network range to get internet access.</p>
<p>When i saw you deleted your Avast antivirus (wich i use aswell), i thought i had seen an option on installing Avast calles SecureLine VPN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As in other posts on different forums people having trouble on W10 and internet had been given answers containing uninstalling VPN client software, i thought of having SecureLine VPN disabled in Avast.</p>
<p>I didn't even need to reboot my laptop after i disabled it. I got a IPV4 adress almost immediately.</p>
<p>All works fine now.</p>

<p>If you tried a 'burn session' lately (and, forgoten about it!)...with the in-built burning software, some times it does take it's own sweet time about doing the 'burn' for you and you get stuck......right in the middle of that process. That's why your OPTICAL
 DRIVE is 'in use', too. To FIX, just FOLLOW what your computer is 'asking of you to do'.......Please, insert DISK.</p>
<p>And, let the 'burn session' happen!</p>
<p>Everything will/should 'return to normal', after that.</p>
<p>Or, you can simply STOP/DELETE it....as it starts, so that it clear the 'burn session', anyway.</p>
<p>If I want to 'burn' anything, I use 'dedicated'&nbsp;Burning Software. Nero 10, to be precise, and nothing else. And, I do it MANUALLY, so that I know for certain.....that what I am about to 'burn'....gets burnt properly, with the appropriate software!</p>

            &nbsp;Missing workgroup.Multipule duplication of my user acccounts and many of my system folders.
<p>When i try to turn on workgroup : doesn't match with the account name.<br />
&nbsp;Win 7 Prem Home.1 owner/user.Standalone. Home use only.<br />
&nbsp;lt works fine on the net but folders keep appearing and diappearing. l've been told to
</p>
<p>activate it twice for no apparent reason. My net speed is as constant and as fast as my isp
</p>
<p>says it should be, yet when i look in taskmanager there are 100;s of things showing, most are

            <p>l answered too soon. ibought every kind of disk there is. l put them in the drive, lt spits them back. The reason i mentioned l/o's and irq's is that i am sure that i'm hacked and it's using my D:\. l've lost my Workstation, i'm refused entry to nearly everything
 i try to open, lt tells me&nbsp;you don't have permission. l'm sole user, owner and the user and administrator are both me.</p>
<p>The only thing it hasn't hurt is connection to the internet. lt still works at max ISP speed.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>The scanner won't load except in safe mode.&nbsp;The&nbsp; problem is on my Desktop. l have now lost control of the system&nbsp; &nbsp;and windows have forced me to became part of a Domain. I have almost no control over it and i find that everything i try to open or &nbsp;find i'm
 informed that it is not this drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This'll will be the 4 system l've lost. Microrules grant a local machine no rights or permissions so active directory just takes over and over-rules everything i try to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Now on my, also new, laptop, the same thing is happening.</p>

            <p>Hello Confused with Microsoft, <br />
<br />
How have you been forced to become part of a Domain? If you have a standalone machine, your workgroup name by default in Windows 7 is: Workgroup. Unjoin from the domain and create a new workgroup for your computer.<br />
<br />
Can you create a new workgroup&nbsp;name for example: My Workgroup and join it?<br />
<br />
Change your password immediately and be sure to make it a strong password. <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/passwords-create.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
How many users are on your computer? Delete any user names other than guest and Administrator that you did not create. Make sure the guest account is not enabled.
<br />
<br />
Run a virus scan. If you don't have a current antivirus, then you can download Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE)&nbsp;for free. Click on the link below to download MSE. It protects against viruses, spyware and other malware. It is easy to use, has real time protection
 and has auto update. <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
Go to the Start button. In the start search box, type in MSConfig. Then go to the startup tab. Look at the list of programs and if you don't recognize them, then uncheck and they wil not run at startup.
<br />
<br />
Check for any network drives that are mapped to your computer. <br />
<br />
Check out the following links to help clean your computer. <br />

<h3> zoepeate  say:</h3>
<h2>            No &#34;Startup Settings&#34; or &#34;Automatic Repair&#34; options</h2>
                    <p>After the last Windows 10 updated I am faced with a black screen with blinking cursor and no Windows login. I understand this to be a problem with my graphics card as I have no other external devices connected.</p>
<p>After reading numerous forums/threads I have used the media creation tool and am booting up via USB. I get as far as the Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options then there is no Startup Settings option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have used the command prompt to try and enable advanced boot options but nothing is working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also attempted the System Restore, Go Back to Prevoious Build and Startup Repair options, all of which say "This option is not supported on the operating system you've selected." The only operating system option present is Windows 10.</p>
<p>Please help!?!? My laptop is an Asus M51V Notebook.</p>

            <p>Hi Zoe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding and apologizes for the delay in response to your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about user data on your device before performing custom installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that Custom installation will offers granular options for preserving files in addition to being able to complete format the hard disk erasing all data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you perform custom installation the files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old . You will be able to access Windows.old folder later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer to the article suggested by <strong>Thofikh Ahamad </strong>
in the previous response about Custom installation of Windows 10 and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the section: <strong>C</strong><strong>ustom install Windows 10 </strong>
from <strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">the article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to read all the screen shots provided in the article to better understand about Custom installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Get back to us for further assistance on this issue. We will be happy to help you.</p>

            <p>You don't do that with Windows 8.1 Update 1 and also Metro UI apps function in the START screen environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, with Update 1, you can put the icon for it on the Desktop Taskbar just like you see the STORE icon there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to the START screen and click on that down arrow you see in the lower left section of the screen.&nbsp; The All Apps page will display and look for the OneNote icon.&nbsp; Right click on it and tell it to "pin to taskbar".</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, I do believe you can do that with all Metro UI apps!&nbsp; That would create a very busy taskbar though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Delete my profile from hard drive, clean the system cache (3 times), redownload profile to hard drive</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Delete my profile from hard drive, clean the system cache (3 times), redownload profile to memory unit</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Made sure my NAT is OPEN</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Made sure my NAT is STRICT</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Used the uPnP settings for the DMZ setup</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am NOT on wireless; I am Ethernet cable jacked directly into the router.&nbsp; I have wiped and reset my router and my modem.&nbsp; After each one of the above tests, I restarted the Xbox to ensure the settings took.&nbsp; So I turn on my Xbox and walk away for say 5
 minutes and come back, I am logged out.&nbsp; I restarted my Xbox and watched and I do in fact log in on start up, its after an amount of time that the Xbox just logs me out.&nbsp; Did someone institute a timer setting for inactivity or something?????</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
More than likely this has nothing to do with your connection but a setting in your router. I've seen this before multiple times, and each time it's been a router issue.<br />
<br />
You should be able to test this by bypassing your router and directly connect your Xbox 360 to your Cable/DSL modem using your Ethernet cable and see if you still get logged out within the stated time period.<br />
<br />
Please reply with the router model and firmware version your router is running on as well as the Cable/DSL modem model number that you're using.</p>

<p>Just to confirm, even with a direction connection with an Ethernet Cable from your Xbox 360 to your Cable modem you still disconnect from Xbox LIVE after 5 minutes?<br />
<br />
I just want to confirm that before I go and look up some more information on this. First I've heard of this happening with a direct connection to your Cable modem without the router in the picture.</p>

<p>Have you tried to reset your Xbox 360's network settings to default?<br />
<br />
You should be able to do so by going to your Settings &gt; System &gt; Network Settings &gt; Select Wired Network &gt; Additional Settings (Second Tab) &gt; Restore to Factory Default.<br />
<br />
After that's done restart your console. See if it still disconnects you right after 5 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I gave it a shot but that didn't work...</p>
<p>HOWEVER...I think I have isolated the router to being the issue because I was redoing ALL my stuff over again and this time before plugging into the modem. &nbsp;I powered it off, then plugged up and turned it on and it did not happen. &nbsp;So I think my router is
 just losing connectivity which might explain why I have had some lag in my games as well</p>

    <title>Can my Vista 32 computer run Windows 7 64&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kitty44  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can my Vista 32 computer run Windows 7 64&#63;</h2>
                    I ran the Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor and it said, <strong>"You can upgrade to 32-bit Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate."
<br />
</strong><br />
Then I followed these instructions: Can my computer run a 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
To run a 64-bit version of Windows, your computer must have a 64-bit-capable processor. If you are unsure whether your processor is 64-bit-capable, do the following:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp; Open Performance Information and Tools by clicking the Start buttonWindows, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type Performance Information and Tools, and then, in the list of results, click Performance Information and Tools.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Click View and print detailed performance and system information.<br />
And it said <strong>"64-bit capable&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes" </strong><br />
I also found instructions on how to install a 64-bit version of Windows 7 on a computer running a 32-bit version of Windows, which basically said to choose "<strong>custom"</strong> over
<strong>"upgrade".</strong> <br />
Before I buy Windows 7, I want to know for sure that I can actually run the 64-bit version on my computer, which actually has 4GB of ram, but Vista 32 only recognizes 3GB which lowers my Windows Experience number to 5.6&nbsp; instead of 5.9.&nbsp; (I actually prefer
 a "clean install" of 7 instead of an "upgrade" as I have everything backed up on an external hard drive.)<br />
I'm confused, do I have to run 32 or can I install 64?

<h2>            who Needs Silverlight and .NET Framework&#63;</h2>
                    I am not a developer, so do I need to download any of the Microsoft updates which include updates for both Silverlight and .NET Framework? &nbsp;In other words, as a user only, is there any requirement to have this software on my PC for surfing/viewing/interacting
 with the internet and web pages as a non-developer?&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Secondly, if I delete/uninstall any or all of these updates will that affect in any way my browsing experience or my use of audio and visual media played through the internet, downloaded from the internet or played in Windows Media Player? &nbsp;Can your answers
 kindly address all three instances of use. &nbsp;Thank you.</div>

Jose, thank you for your very prompt answer. &nbsp;Given that Silverlight has dropped from approx. 65% usage to less than 4%, (maybe because Microsoft made the mistake of not making it cross platform compatible across the board?), &nbsp;it would seem to me that it is
 becoming superfluous. &nbsp;Given that it also takes up a great deal of disc space it would seem to me even more of a reason to ignore these updates.
<div><br />
<div>Good to know that I will know when I need it, (assume a pop up dialogue box let's the viewer know?), but it does seem to me that if I were to open a website using the application, I would hardly go back and download all the mega files necessary to update
 Silverlight on my PC, just to view an occasional website.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What about .NET Framework? &nbsp;You say nothing about that. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also can you kindly respond to my query as to whether or not having neither of these programmes installed will in any way affect my Windows Media Player listening/viewing experience of downloaded or uploaded material? &nbsp;In other words are there features
 in either of these programmes which enhance the WMP experience, which are not internet related?</div>

            Thank you. &nbsp;I don't know what search terms you used, but I couldn't get any decent responses that were in plain English on the Google search page, but you did. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Most of them give conflicting answers to the question and are confusing with technical speak, except for 'Ask Leo'. &nbsp;He sorted out the question for me, so thank you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I know this is an MS site, but really after reading the criticisms of the programming and architecture of .NET Framework, it reads all over again as having the same issues as Windows - poor programming, poor architecture and a generally messy structure,
 prone to bloated programming, requiring patch, upon patch, upon patch. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Apparently the structure is so flawed that they can't ditch earlier versions of .NET to make a clean sweep with each newer version, like most other application programs do. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>MS frustrates the socks off me with its programming manners. &nbsp;It is criminal that consumers must purchase independent software to keep their PC's running. &nbsp;I mean ... what sort of a maintenance tool kit do they ship with it - a pathetic disk cleaner and
 disk checker. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that this kind of maintenance is necessary is bad enough, but to ship no effective kit with its OS is plain rude, given that if you don't do regular maintenance of Windows, your PC will eventually crash and burn from MS bloatware and the massive
 sludge footprint it leaves behind. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Apologies if I sound p'd off, but I am a bit riled (yet again) by the MS disrespect for the consumer.</div>

    <title>CANNOT DELETE OLD SYSTEM IMAGES FROM EXTERNAL HD &#126; WIN 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rajdeep218  say:</h3>
<h2>            CANNOT DELETE OLD SYSTEM IMAGES  FROM EXTERNAL HD &#126; WIN 7</h2>
                    I have a &nbsp;Win 7 64 bit Notebook. Ever since &nbsp;I &nbsp;got an External hard drive, I have been backing &nbsp;up my &nbsp;data on a monthly scheduled basis, using &nbsp;Backup and Restore utility, with the &nbsp;following configuration.&nbsp;
<div>~ Running on &nbsp;a Schedule</div>
<div>~Select where you want to save your backup</div>
<div>~Let Windows choose [ recommended ]</div>
<div>~What do you want to back up</div>
<div>~ Data &nbsp;files, &nbsp; with include a system image box &nbsp;ticked.</div>
<div>~ Review &nbsp;your back up settings... save settings and exit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since Windows &nbsp;can allocate upto 30% of the &nbsp;external hard drive &nbsp;towards system image and since this figure was soaring [ as of now 122 GB ] , I decided to delete &nbsp;all system &nbsp;images and &nbsp;backups to &nbsp;start &nbsp; afresh and this is what I did. Went to Explorer
 &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;My &nbsp;external hard drive &nbsp;and deleted</div>
<div>~ All back ups &nbsp; under my &lt; Computer name &gt; Back up set</div>
<div>~ Windows Image back up.</div>
<div>It seems &nbsp;that I had &nbsp;taken a wrong move. Reading several blogs &nbsp; I &nbsp;came to know that &nbsp;system images and &nbsp;backups can be deleted &nbsp;from&nbsp;</div>
<div>View &nbsp;back ups ~ select &nbsp;a &nbsp;back up period to delete</div>
<div>System image &gt; You can free up disk space &gt; change settings &gt; Let Windows manage or keep the latest image.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Following the above NOW ~&nbsp;</div>
<div>My previous back ups are &nbsp;successfully deleted.</div>
<div>However, in &nbsp;system Image when I click on the " Keep the latest system image &gt; Are you sure you &nbsp;want to delete previous system images, when &nbsp;I click " delete " &nbsp;<b>MY &nbsp;PREVIOUS &nbsp;SYSTEM IMAGES ARE NOT DELETED</b> "&nbsp;</div>
<div>I also read &nbsp;and followed this link, hoping that &nbsp;I will succeed, but to &nbsp;no avail.</div>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Yes, before &nbsp;I &nbsp;am asked " Have you made any &nbsp; recent changes to your Computer " ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I &nbsp;started back ups, &nbsp;I had a single "C" Drive. &nbsp;Three months &nbsp;ago I made a partition &nbsp;of &nbsp;my "C" Drive and now have a " partitioned " " D " &nbsp;Drive to accomodate &nbsp;my &nbsp;downloaded applications " where I have a &nbsp;choice to &nbsp;decide where to &nbsp;save them
 " .... unlike certain ones like MSE, Google and even Logitech Mouse &nbsp; which does not &nbsp;offer such options and automatically &nbsp;get saved in the "C" Drive.</div>
<div>Having made a &nbsp;partition of my "C" Drive........</div>
<div><b>COULD THIS &nbsp;BE A PLAUSIBLE REASON, WHY MY &nbsp;PREVIOUS AND OLD &nbsp;SYSTEM IMAGES CANNOT BE DELETED ?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>OR &nbsp;AM I STILL &nbsp;DOING &nbsp;SOMETHING WHICH IS NOT &nbsp;IN LINE WITH &nbsp;WINDOWS &nbsp;OPERATIONS ?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div>If &nbsp;that be so, &nbsp;can someone please advise me, under &nbsp;the above circumstances, how to &nbsp;delete &nbsp;previous &nbsp;system images.&nbsp;</div>

            <b>HERE'S THE &nbsp;SOLUTION !!</b>..... and this goes out to &nbsp;several people who have have suffered like me.
<div>This is what I did. First, &lt; turn off &nbsp;schedule &gt;from the left pane in backup and Restore</div>
<div>1. Type....&lt; create &gt; in the &nbsp;search box. Click on &lt; Create a Restore Point &gt; System properties</div>
<div>2. Assuming, your External hard drive is already &nbsp;plugged into your Computer, go to Protection Settings &gt; Available Drives and &nbsp;then
<u>click on &nbsp;your &nbsp;external hard drive</u>, normally Local Drive ( Drive letter : )</div>
<div>3. Click on Configure &gt; Ensure that system protection is turned off. Even if you do turn it on, you will see a &nbsp;yellow triangle with a message &gt; " Using &nbsp;System protection on a drive that contains system image backups will cause &nbsp;other shadow copies to
 be deleted faster &nbsp;that normal"</div>
<div>4. Go to &nbsp;disk space usage &gt; &nbsp;You will see the &nbsp;same &nbsp;figure which appears in &nbsp;&gt; &nbsp;Back up and restore &gt; Manage &nbsp;space &gt; space usage summary &gt; system image &gt; xxx GB [ In my case 122.63 GB, without having a single &nbsp;system image ]&nbsp;</div>
<div>5. You will also &nbsp;see &nbsp;a Max usage &nbsp;slider showing some &nbsp;fancy figure [ In my case, this was 155.99 GB being &nbsp;upto 30% &nbsp;allowable for &nbsp; Windows &nbsp;to retain system images.</div>
<div>6. Just turn the &nbsp;slider [ left ] and bring it down to &nbsp;zero.</div>
<div>7. Now &nbsp;go back to . back up and Restore. You will see that " System image " now &nbsp;shows 0.00</div>
<div>8. Go to the &nbsp;left hand side panel. Click on " Create a system Image " &nbsp;followed &nbsp;by &nbsp;settings preferred by you.</div>
<div>9. Once this is done, you may like to &nbsp;do a back up. &nbsp;Go to &gt; Change settings &gt; Select where you &nbsp;want to save your back up &gt; Let me choose &gt; What do you want to back up....</div>
<div>I selected everything in the box and <b>excluded </b>" Include a System Image of &nbsp;drives.......... " &nbsp;since &nbsp;I already have &nbsp; a copy of the same.&nbsp;</div>
<div>As of now, &nbsp;I have made a &nbsp;system image and also a back up. My free &nbsp;space in my External hard drive is now correct, the &nbsp;magical figure of 122.63 GB has &nbsp;disappeared.........................</div>
<div>....................... and so has my headache !!&nbsp;</div>
<div>I wish to reiterate, that &nbsp;I have read several articles &nbsp;in an effort to &nbsp;delete system Images on my Computer, and bring down the &nbsp;figure of 122.63 GB &nbsp;to 0.00. [ One link is mentioned above ] &nbsp;None of them worked ~ except this one.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>About Transferring Licenses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluecudas  say:</h3>
<h2>            About Transferring Licenses</h2>
                    
<p>On August 25 my account was<span> compromised and the person who took my account transferred all of my licenses of my previous games purchased to their console. &nbsp;Now I have my account back and my points that they spent have been refunded but I still can't
 transfer my licenses back to my console until Christmas. &nbsp;I was wondering if I could have this reset so that I could transfer all of my games that I have purchased back to my original xbox so that I can play offline without having to be on the internet all
 the time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;My gamertag is Bluecudas.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<h3> hollywoodbda  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Network Printer error &#34;Not Connected&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 7 on an HP Pavilion dv7. Occasionally (daily) I loose connection to my HP Wireless Printer. Printer is connected with good signal. Sometimes I can reset my router and restart my computer and it works again. Sometimes I reload my Printer
 Software and/or drivers and it works again. When I loose my connection to the Printer, my Network runs slower than a snail. I looked at my Norton Network Security Map under good and bad conditions. I'm not sure what to do about it. I need to FIX what is causing
 this intermittent problem. Attached is my Norton Network Security Map.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the problem description, I understand that you are facing intermittent wireless printer connection issue on your Windows 7 HP pavilion DV7 computer. Sometimes it works fine after resetting router and restarting the computer, sometimes it requires
 you to reload printer software and drivers. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is this issue restricted to printer only? Do other connected network devices work fine when the problem appears with the printer?</span></li><li><span>Is this computer connected to a group of computers and other devices through wireless network?</span></li><li><span>Were there any significant software or hardware changes made prior to this issue?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">There can be a number of reasons for dropping/limited wireless connection in Windows, some common issues that can cause these problems are:</span></p>
<ul>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sometimes inappropriate computer distance or obstructions or interference with some home devices may cause the wireless connection to drop.</span><strong>
</strong><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Move your PC closer to the router or access point. If the PC is portable, try moving it around to determine the range of the wireless signal and the best place to use your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you can't get closer to the router or access point, consider buying and installing an external antenna for your wireless network adapter to improve its reception. Check the information that came with your wireless network adapter to see if you can
 install an additional antenna.</span></p>

</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Limited/ Intermittent connection</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> means that the system has successfully connected to the router and network device, but the computer wasn't assigned a valid IP address, so you
 can't actually get to the Internet or connect to the network devices. It can also indicate that a valid IP address was assigned but that the computer doesn't have Internet connectivity. If you're connected to a home network, try restarting the router.</span></p>

            <p>HI, sorry it took so long to get back to you, needed to get the printer going to print the e-mail out to read and digest it. To answer some of your questions; the issue is restricted to printing, but the Internet also runs slow during this issue. The only
 equipment is my computer, my printer, ATT-uversy router and TV. The only software I remember installing in the last 3+ months is RegHunter &amp; SpyHunter and I contacted them (no problems with their software). &nbsp;Method 1: my laptop is 8 feet from the router and
 the printer is about 30 feet away. When I get a chance to check Method 2 &amp; 3, I will report results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for all the information.</p>
<p />
