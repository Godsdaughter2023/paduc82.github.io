<br />
<br />Also, your iPhone cable might frayed, check to ensure it is connecting properly, you can try nudging it a bit to see if it works. 
<br />
<br />Check if the female port on the iPhone is clean and does not have any artifacts in there. Also check if the iPhone cable is clean too. 
<br />
<br />You can also try isolating the problem by connecting to another working computer. 
<br />
<br />Make sure iTunes is also installed.

<p>I recommend that you close any programs you aren't actually using before the scan begins&nbsp; that way you will get the best results.&nbsp;<a href="http://ask-leo.com/why_cant_my_antivirus_program_open_certain_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ask-leo.com/why_cant_my_antivirus_program_open_certain_files.html</a>&nbsp;
 Over time, and if you scan every night this probably won't make much difference (and some files will never be scanned while the system is running but that's nornmal and nothing to worry about), but if you keep the same programs open all the time (escpecially
 if you remain online all the time), it would be better if you closed them at least sometimes (perhaps on a rotating basis).&nbsp; And congratulations on a very good habit that may have already saved you a lot of grief from malware (and will continue to do so).&nbsp;
 The same thing works the other way, so if the AV program is scanning a program's system files, that program will be temp9orarily locked because the files are in use (by the AV program).&nbsp; It's normal - just wait a bit and it will get past that program and you'll
 be able to open it.&nbsp; Some AV programs show what files are being scanned in the progress section so you would know when it is done with your program (I don't know if AVG does this - I've never actually used that particular program (though I have tried quite
 a few).&nbsp; I use Microsoft Security Essentials as my real-time main line defense and run Prevx 3.0 in scan mode only and every few weeks I run&nbsp;Malwarebytes to catch anything the others missed.&nbsp; Although I have been infected, every one was caught and quarantined
 or deleted before it could gain a foothold (I also run about 6 other programs&nbsp;- one at a time -&nbsp;every couple of months or so to be sure nothing gets past my defenses and they almost never find anything except maybe a tracking cookie or two - but no viruses
 or malware).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck and best wishes.</p>

    <title>Why is Microsoft so indifferent of its clients privacy&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgekazamias  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Microsoft so indifferent of its clients privacy&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Things are simple.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People want their email disconnected from skype or even better to have a choice whether they appear online or offline in their web client. A choice that will be respected.
</p>
<p>I have a lot to say on this, but I am too tired and disappointed to even try and write them down. I know the response will be childish. I have seen it numerous times in all these posts that try to help Microsoft be a better company with more satisfied clients.
 They just ignore people. They don't even escalate this issue to higher management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing that makes people furious is that it is so simple to implement that option. It is as simple as, this client logged in, read the preferred skype status, initiate skype client or not accordingly. It is only a couple of if statements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most infuriating thing is that in the past at least there was some stupid configuration that didn't really respect the clients choice since it was following the desktop skype client configuration no matter what. Or at times, Microsoft decided to activate
 it by itself in order to force people into skype. Now this troublesome option is gone and we are left with no option at all. You know, some option is better than no option. Just saying in case you are not smart enough to tell by yourselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, since I strongly believe that Microsoft engineers are smart enough (otherwise fire them and hire new people, I volunteer), the question remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Microsoft so indifferent of its clients privacy and welfare? </p>
<p>Why don't you care for your clients opinion of your products?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Need older version of Skype</h2>
                    I have a Macbook Pro that crashes when too much video power is needed and for some reason the newest Skype crashes it. I had a Skype representative install an older version and it was working good but when I tried to use it today it was the latest version
 and it crashed my laptop. So I need to know from where to download an older version.

<h2>            Controller Input Lag</h2>
                    <p>Hey</p>
<p>Ive had my XBOX One since the day it came out. I have the Day 1 2013 Controller, all that stuff. And ive just recently been delayed. I frequently play NBA2k19 and Fortnite, and on both games i am delayed. When I hit a button or move my joysticks, it takes
 1.5-2 seconds to register. Ive tried switching the HDMI on my TV. Didnt work. Ive tried switching my controllers. Didnt work. Ive tried switching my TV entirely. Didnt work.</p>
<p>ive even plugged in a USB cord from my controller to the XBOX. Didnt work. What could be the problem? Is there something wrong with my XBOX? Is there something wrong with my internet connection? Please let me know soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sounds like you've done some good troubleshooting so far without results. You may wish to try checking to see if your controllers need an update as they can act a little funny otherwise. I recommend
 the following support articles that can help you troubleshoot the situation further:</p>

</p><p>Give these a try and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Johnny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply with an update. Sorry to hear that you're still having trouble with that input lag. If your controller is fully updated and you've already attempted to troubleshoot your network, but its still ongoing with that issue, you may want to
 try a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset of the console</a> itself. This will remove any potentially damaging files from the system's OS that could be gumming up the works, and this type of reset allows you to keep your games &amp; apps installed.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide.</li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>All Settings</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>. </li><li>Select <strong>Console info</strong>. </li><li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Reset console and keep my games &amp; apps</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> Before performing this step, please be sure to know your log in information for your profile (email and password) as it will remove any profiles from the consoles.</em></p>
<p>Give this a try and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps a bit more!</p>

<p>Thanks for the advice, but unfortunately, this didnt work. What is wrong with my Input Lag? Should i get a whole new console? New controller? Let me know soon</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually the batteries are the culprit but by using the power cord that resolves that issue. I believe even if you are plugged into the console, the controller still uses a wireless connection. I would try a new controller or even the cheapest wired one.
 Also you could be getting weird interference from another device (LED lights, USB wifi adapters, etc.) .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there Johnny!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue with your console. </p>
<p>I would say that if your console is still being weird after doing a soft reset, then the next step and last resort would be a full factory reset that removes everything. I know it could take a while to install your games, but it's a valid troubleshooting
 steps for things this severe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, then you would have to either get the console replaced or serviced. If you wanna get your console repaired, then you can get it done by either going to
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support </a>or by contacting&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support
</a>directly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>

<p>Ok</p>
<p>Sorry for the wait, but what I noticed is that my controller is only delayed when I am playing online. When Im on the dashboard and everywhere else, even playing games but not connecting online, everything is working fine. But once I play online, such as
 Park on NBA2k19 and Fortnite, my controller is delayed.&nbsp;</p>

            Go to start and type bluetooth and open it.
<br />Turn the slider to ON if it is not already.
<br />Also make sure keyboard is set in pairing mode to find it.
<br />
<br />If that does not work then go to start and type troubleshoot.
<br />Select Bluetooth and run through that to see if it can fix it.

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you, Please don't feel bad to ask question about any thing.
<br />
<br />To turn On Bluetooth:
<br />
<br />Click on the start menu and open "Settings"
<br />Then click on "Devices"
<br />Then Click "Bluetooth"
<br />Now you have to move Bluetooth toggle to "ON"
<br />save the changes you made and close that window.
<br />
<br />Thats it
<br />
<br />I would like to suggest you to see the below mentioned article and see how to connect Bluetooth in Windows 10.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>
<br />
<br />Secondly you may see the Bluetooth settings  in Windows 10.

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

<p>Ok so I can see I am not the only person this has happened too!! I have filed complaints blocked players they simply make up new gamertags and start the process all over again!! I have provided clan names gamertags and nothing gets done! There seems to be
 this flippant attitude it's done by puberty kids these guys are grown men who simply in my opinion are jealous because they can't get host and then DDOS! The last time this happened it is always Gears of war2 they play and I went through all the proper channels
 Microsoft actually argued with me that it's IMPOSSIBLE TO DO?? Well I hope they read this forum! Not only do they DDOS me but they got all their wee clan and friends to bomb complaints against me so that I have been banned not just a small ban but an indefinite
 one!!! I bought an Xbox one because off all the carry on but because of that ban Iost everything associated to my name and it goes into £1000's off pounds worth off maps season passes everything and nobody will listen to the facts that I put forward in my
 defense. I would love to discuss it further but nobody will listen the clansWIN! I then decided last week to go back and have a game on gears2 NEVER SPOKE TO ANYONE, but because I get host all the time and the way I play they knew who I was oh they sent me
 messages telling me they knew who I was, so I blocked reported phoned because they came on in different names DDOS me again then filed loads off complaints FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN JEALOUSYguess what I have another 2week ban!! You only need to check my profile
 on Xbox one it shows my reputation as a great player!! Yet I am the victim everytime I complain or phone Microsoft I get banned where is the justice?? I am a gd gamer who has put £1000's into Microsoft and I am banned. It's time I got some justice even if
 it was the account with everything on it back but I know that's never going to happen cause GOOD GUYS COME LAST!!!</p>

<p>Those guys "Lizard Squad" did DDOS to Xbox live. But we were not hacked right? So I don't need to change passwords and etc? I understand what DDOS means, but I just want to be sure.</p>

<p>What ever happened to JDM ?????</p>
<p>TRY watching a Broken Lizard flick........ I suggest Super Troopers or Beerfest &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Otherwise, &nbsp;just Block, Avoid, Mute and Report any unwanted players..... &nbsp;Most ambassadors should know the basics....... &nbsp;Asking others to file a complaint does NOT WORK, &nbsp;
</p>
<p>IMO, JDM's C1VIC needs to see an Impound lot..... &nbsp;</p>
<p>GOOD LUCK!!!!!!</p>

<h2>            can not connect to xbox games</h2>
                    
<p>On 10/26/13 I had no problems with connecting to Xbox to play the solitaire games and daily challenges.&nbsp; On 10/27/13 I was notified that there was an update that was needed, which I installed.&nbsp; Now, when logging in, I get a message that says no internet
 connection.&nbsp; I have no trouble logging into my account, but can't login to play the games.</p>

<p>Hey petmom96,</p>
<p>Could you make sure that you're Windows LIVE account is connected to your PC account?</p>
<p><strong>This can be done the following way:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, click&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and then click&nbsp;<strong>Change</strong>&nbsp;<strong>PC</strong>&nbsp;<strong>settings</strong>.
</li><li>Tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Accounts</strong>, and then tap or click&nbsp;<strong>Your</strong>&nbsp;<strong>account</strong>
</li></ol>
<div>If you're already signed in with a Microsoft account, your name and email address appear above your account picture.</div>
<div>Let us know if signing-in did the trick =)</div>

<li><span>When that connection error message appears, does it provide any other info at all? What's the exact message?</span>
</li><li><span>This may seem like a basic step, but have you rebooted your computer since applying the update on the 27th?</span>
</li><li><span>Are you able to play any Xbox games on your PC currently, or are they all stuck behind that connection error?</span>
</li></ol>

<h2>            Advanced replacement - email response&#63; </h2>
                    I completed the advanced replacement for my dead Xboxone and am curious should I have received an order conformation? I find it odd that I fill out a form and give all my info and credit card number to replace a faulty product that MS puts out and I don't
 even get an email confirming the order and a we are sorry to have sent you a crappy faulty unit. Let us get the taken care of ASAP for you. We value you as a customer and value continued business from you. Anything really would be nice at this point! Come
 on Microsoft? Unhappy customer that wishes he had more options.

<p>After many calls/chats with MS support, I finally got my XboxOne registered and was able to complete the online replacement form. &nbsp;Upon submitting the form it returned an error, but shortly after I was able to view the new SR online and received an email
 confirming the SR and the advanced replacement request. &nbsp;The email stated that my request was in progress and a replacement would ship out in two business days. &nbsp;It also detailed the return process.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>I put my request in on Friday. &nbsp;Now I understand it was put through late evening so that means Friday wont be taken into account. &nbsp;Nor the weekend. &nbsp;However I did expect some kind of response instead of just a generic "Here is your confirmation". &nbsp;I also
 don't like how the website is constructed, what does "Order in Progress" mean? &nbsp;They really need to change it so I can see what stage my order is at. &nbsp;Has it been confirmed with the replacement team? Has credit card been accepted? Is my order being packed,
 has it reached the warehouse? Do they even have a spare console to ship to me? At the moment I feel like I'm just sitting with my thumb up my bum. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As I didn't get any response, I contacted support yesterday to ask what was going on and if my order had even been seen by someone. &nbsp;I was told it would be shipped this week. If my console is not shipped by Wednesday I will request they 1. Remove the 2 business
 day resolution statement or 2. Add a clause to explain to consumers that new release consoles will take longer (which is understandable but they don't state it). &nbsp;It's annoying because I took a day off work and I've been talking to support since. &nbsp;My console
 is meant to be shipped today, based on their website's claim. &nbsp;But I've not received any confirmation and it's already 1pm in the UK...</p>

<p>I just chatted with support, they told me that my SR I submitted late Sat was waiting for a transaction number from FedEx . I also asked if it qualified for the free game and was told that I will get an email about it within 3 to 5 days after submitting
 the request. &nbsp;My xbox just died after setup, I did not have a chance to check the disk drive.</p>

<p>I chatted with Tracey. &nbsp;Tracey told me &nbsp;my request was waiting for a fedex transaction number. &nbsp;I assume this is the return fedex number for my broken xbox. &nbsp;Once this is received the new console will ship. &nbsp;I also asked if the &nbsp;replacement would be a Day
 one. &nbsp;She told me it would.</p>

<p>I processed my advance on Saturday. &nbsp;Its seven days later. &nbsp;Xbox says they still haven't shipped it. &nbsp;Can't tell me why, and they don't know when. &nbsp;They will not be shipping it tomorrow, which is Sunday. &nbsp;Shipping should take 5-7 business days. &nbsp;I'm not
 happy. &nbsp;My complaining has got me 9 months of free live, Ryse, and Forza 5 though.

<p>Hi DarkNinjaEXE,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear this is currently happening. I would like to gather a bit more information in this case. By any chance have you recently uninstalled and reinstalled the game that after it started giving you the error message? Also, one thing I suggest
 to try is to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/add-remove-account-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">remove and re-add your account</span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</span></span><span><span>v</span></span><span><span>ery
 important to make sure you know the primary email/password to the account before removing it from the console</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p>After adding the account back on the Xbox do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <strong>settings </strong></li><li>Choose <strong>Disc &amp; Blu-Ray</strong></li><li>Choose <strong>Blu-Ray</strong></li><li>Next you'll choose<strong> persistent storage</strong></li><li>Hit <strong>clear (this will bring you back to the Blu-ray settings)</strong></li></ul>

<h2>            Cannot access &#34;Network and Sharing Center&#34; or &#34;Change Adapter Settings&#34; on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and everything has been generally fine. But this week I moved back to school, where I prefer to use a wireless access point to use the internet since the wifi provided by the school is public and has no
 security. I ran into an issue with the access point while setting it up, and I'm pretty certain I know how to fix it because it has happened before, but I cannot access the particular settings I need to access in order to solve my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to access "Network and Sharing Center" and "Change Adapter Settings," and they simply will NOT open. I go to start, click settings, Network and Internet, then click "Change Adapter Settings," and, simply, nothing happens. Maybe half an
 hour later File Explorer will pop up and act like it's trying really hard to load something, but never does.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching Windows for both "Network and Sharing Center" and "Change Adapter Settings" and I am able to locate them that way as well, but clicking on them does nothing. There was one instance where if I waited roughly 2 hours, Network and Sharing
 Center would load up, but then it was frozen and I couldn't access any of the settings it offers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 64-bit/ Intel Core i7/ 8GB RAM on an ASUS Republic of Gamers laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody has any information to offer for possible solutions, I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>hi,</p>

Ok... I'm using Windows 10. It took a while to figure out why File Explorer and Network and Sharing Center wouldn't load.....</p>
<p style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">
I reinstalled Windows a few times, and thought it was one of the Windows Updates that was causing the issue, so I completely disabled updates though the Group Policy Editor after a clean Windows 10 Pro 64-bit installation, and my problem still came back......</p>
<p style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">
In the end I realized it was actually the scaling feature (which is very buggy in my opinion). I'm running my Windows 10 Pro OS with a GTX950 video card on a 65-inch Sony Bravia 4K TV. I would set the resolution to 3840x2160, and scaling to 175%, and then neither
 File Explorer would open, or Network and Sharing Center. After clicking either one, the screen would flicker, and the taskbar would completely freeze for about 20 seconds.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">
To fix the problem, I set the scaling to 100% (so no scaling basically), applied the change (signed out and back in again), and suddenly both File Explorer and Network and Sharing Center would load again. I then set scaling back to 175% like I had it set initially,
 and it worked. So that is 100% a bug with Windows 10 scaling...</p>
<p style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">
I also tested this on and older computer which has a Radeon HD 7770 video and the same thing happened. So it's not the video card either.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(63, 69, 73, 1)">
In looking for a solution to my problem I came across numerous forums where people were having trouble with Network and Sharing Center not loading, and all the help they got was being told to do a system restore......... Totally didn't address the issue at
 all.... It's really too bad and I feel sorry for all those people. But not many people would think Network and Sharing center (or File Explorer) not loading would simply be a scaling issue.....</p>

<p>hi and tks a lot,</p>
<p>Your solution works perfectly. It must definitely be a bug somewhere and as it appeared all of the sudden in my PC my bet is some update introduced it.</p>
<p>Anyway tks again.</p>

            <p>Really freaking strange. I've been having exactly this problem for weeks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any time I connect my cellphone to usb tether a data connection (I use it to stream video to the phone over usb), the wifi would start acting strangely and the network and sharing center would be come unresponsive and my wifi and ethernet 2(the usb tether)
 would randomly drop and freeze from the network for 30 seconds and then reconnect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was until I went into the Nvidia control panel and turned off screen scaling...</p>
<p>
</p><p>how odd. Its working perfectly for the last hour or so...more solid than its been for weeks now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defintely a bug, but who's bug?</p>

            <p>I just ran into this problem with a brand new computer build. &nbsp;Many things would hang from time to time and then work again for seemingly no reason. &nbsp;Network and Sharing center hanging was a more consistent problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it was 2 versions of sound card software both running and causing a conflict (Realtek &amp; Creative). &nbsp;My motherboard's software came with these 2 versions since they sell motherboards with different sound chip sets. &nbsp;I just installed everything without
 too much thought. &nbsp;Once I uninstalled the wrong version everything has been going smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If any experts out there could shed light on how I could have determined this earlier (like a log file) I would be happy to hear about this. I only found out by uninstalling everything I could think of and looked for any oddities.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Release and renew Internet Protocol (IP) address.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Start”.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “cmd” in the Start search box and hit “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the following commands:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>ipconfig /release</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>ipconfig /renew</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Assign a static Internet Protocol (IP) address.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to assign an IP address manually:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click “Start” and click “Control Panel.”</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the search box type “Network and sharing.”</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the search results, click “Network and Sharing Center.”</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the left hand side, click “Change adapter settings.”</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the connection and click “Properties.”</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select “Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPV4)” and click “Properties.”</span></p>
<p><span>g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under “General” tab, select to check “Use the following IP address.”
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Assign a static IP address and see if that fixes the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:

    <title>Thai characters with Arial Unicode MS font displays incorrectly in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> orish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Thai characters with Arial Unicode MS font displays incorrectly in Windows 10 &#40;only&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 and reinstalled all my Office and other products. I can't remember whether I had to install Arial Unicode MS manually or whether it was already installed with the Office products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then discovered that all the documents and websites that use Thai text are displayed incorrectly - even the add text feature in Paint!! Thai is an abugida script, with vowels and other marks sometimes on top or underneath letters. These 'accents' tend
 to display slightly to the side rather on top of the letter or if they do display on top then the position overlaps with the character, rendering the text unreadable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was bizarre is that websites that are standardized on Arial Unicode MS also became unreadable. I can't seem to find what the new standard unicode font is and I managed to find some Thai fonts to use as a replacement. However, so far none of the fonts
 I have found display Thai characters in the standard, 'classic' way - as used in Thailand by official printers and schools and other official publishers. So many of my documents designed for children and learners of the Thai language no longer display or print
 correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to change the website display is to manually select a different font in View, or to modify the CSS files in the website directly (for sites that I have control over) and select alternative fonts. The problem is that not everybody has the same
 fonts installed on their computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested this on other computers - it's a universal problem. The problem does not exist on Windows XP, 7 or 8 or 8.1. But the moment I upgrade to Windows 10 (or when I bought a brand new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed), I can no longer view Thai
 text with Arial Unicode MS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PDF files that have been produced from Arial Unicode MS documents continue to display and print correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix this? Is this a known bug in Windows 10? If so, is it being fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what is currently the 'standard' or 'universal' font (for all versions of Windows and Macs and androids and IOS devices and Linux platforms) to select for documents and websites so that everybody can view multilingual texts (including Thai) without having
 to manually install a separate font?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If one needs to instruct users to install a 'universal' font, what is it and where can it be downloaded from?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Gary</p>
<p>

            <p>I'm using the latest version of Office 365. The problem only occurs with Windows 10, not other versions of Windows. I have to tell my customers (corporate &amp; private) not to upgrade to Windows 10 if they want to continue to access my Thai documents and websites;
 many have switched to Mac computers instead. It's not a trivial problem I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is Arial Unicode MS no longer supported in Office 2016? It's just a font, like any other, right? It's become the standard font for multilingual documents and websites so far as I can tell since around 2003.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If this font is being made redundant then what is the replacement font for multilingual documents and websites? And how does one ensure that the right font is selected when producing or viewing multilingual texts? (And then, where can users with older systems
 download the new standard font... or does one have to somehow support both fonts for the foreseeable future using things like a font-family list in HTML documents?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been searching off and on for a year now, but no-one seems to know. I haven't pursued this issue until now because I thought it was just a bug that would be resolved with one of the updates to Office or Windows in due course, but it's been more than
 a year (since the launch of Windows 10). But it's becoming more mission-critical (at least for Windows users) because newer PCs and laptops already come with Windows 10 pre-installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the Arial Unicode MS font is available on my computer.</p>
