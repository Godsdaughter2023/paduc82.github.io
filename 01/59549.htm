                    <p>I have 2 Dell laptops, an older XPS and a new Inspiron 15 5000 series, that both exhibit black screen spinning dots. &nbsp;What both share in common is KB 4022405 installed on 6/18.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to boot to safe mode on both machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktops currently boot fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any workarounds available besides a complete reinstall?</p>

<p>Andre, thanks for your reply. &nbsp; I had read others messages who had similar issues. &nbsp;Most replies revolved around usb issues or video issues. &nbsp; Not utilizing anything usb, I uninstalled the video drivers and low and behold, I'm back in action, on both laptops!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who would think both laptops could be resolved with the same fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks again for your quick reply.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Kindly try these and get back to me with your findings:</p>
<p>1. Run the FixIt in KB 971187 - How to fix MSI software update registration corruption issues by clicking the link below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971187</a><br />
2. Retry the Update.<br />
3. If the Update fails, proceed to Step 4.<br />
4. Download .Net Cleanup Utility from the link below:<br />
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-file.ashx/__key/CommunityServer-Components-PostAttachments/00-08-90-44-93/dotnetfx_5F00_cleanup_5F00_tool.zip</a>.<br />
5. By using the Cleanup Tool, uninstall all .Net Framework entries. (You will not be allowed to remove the .NET Framework 2.0 on Vista and higher because it is an Operating System component.)<br />
6. Restart the computer.<br />
7. Download and install the .Net Framework 3.5 SP1 by clicking the link below (this will also install .Net Framework 2.0 SP2 and 3.0 SP2):<br />

<h3> xanda-escuyer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium&#58; network file sharing - client access as Guest.</h2>
                    <p>We've had a laptop running Windows 7 Home Premium (x64) which until recently, happily shared folders/files across the network to clients requesting access as Guest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason it has now stopped working in this manner: clients are now required to use an account and password instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only changes made recently are some system updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The configuration is as follows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network type: Work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advanced sharing settings:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Network discovery: ON</li><li>File and printer sharing: ON</li><li>Sharing for anyone with network access to read write the Public folders: ON</li><li>Media streaming: ON</li><li>Connection encryption type: 40- or 56- bit</li><li>Password protected sharing: OFF</li><li>HomeGroup option: set to use accounts and passwords</li></ul>
<p>Other settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows Explorer folder options has Sharing Wizard UNCHECKED.</li><li>Firewall is OFF</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>These settings haven't changed although we've toggled a few to see if they fix something - no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've also tried setting read or modify privileges for the Guests group and the Guest account at the are disk permissions and file sharing levels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wasn't difficult to setup in the first instance (a few weeks ago now) but now things have gone awry and we are lost to know where to go next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody help please? Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Xanda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking through your network configurations, your network file sharing should be working. However, with the recent issue that you've encountered, there could be settings that were not checked or possible that the problem was triggered by the recent system
 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to isolate this further, we would like to know what recent system updates were installed. Also, please check your Credential Manager. There could be a generic credential that needs to be updated. To open it, just open
<strong>Control Panel &gt; Credential manager &gt; Windows Credential</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should the issue persists, we suggest posting this matter to <em><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/home?forum=w7itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft TechNet Forums</a></em> for in-depth assistance regarding
 network file sharing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks for responding to the post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer the questions:</p>
<p><em><strong>For us to isolate this further, we would like to know what recent system updates were installed.</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">This is hard to say definitively. We recently had to reset the update components due to an error and have updated again since. The attached screenshot shows the current status.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">We also suspect it may affected by an attempt at recovery to system restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Also, please check your Credential Manager. There could be a generic credential that needs to be updated. To open it, just open Control Panel &gt; Credential manager &gt; Windows Credential.</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">We don't understand how this affects the issue a snapshot of the current configuration for the Guest account is attached at the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Should the issue persists, we suggest posting this matter to Microsoft TechNet Forums for in-depth assistance regarding network file sharing.</strong></em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">Posted here at: <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/f7e08bb5-41c3-435b-b861-401462fa69eb/windows-7-home-premium-network-file-sharing-client-access-as-guest?forum=w7itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Home Premium: network file sharing - client access as Guest.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to the last post:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this example [Win7Home PC]=system in question.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Access the Win7Home PC from a non-Windows client: the shared folders are not presented unless the client uses a password protected account; this holds true for all clients types such, Android, Linux and Mac.</li><li>Access using Windows Explorer from another client: selecting the Win7Home PC from within the computer browser does not result in a login challenge where credentials may be supplied. The connection is simply rejected with a 'permission denied' warning.</li><li>Using another Windows PC client: shared folders can be accessed directly, anonymously (as guest) by entering the full network address into Windows Explorer e.g. \\NAME-OF-WIN7-PC\SharedFolderName</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the Win7Home PC in question does indeed allow Guest access to shared folders over the network if they are directly addressed. It is only when the computer is selected using an explorer/browser that it fails to present the list of shared
 folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is an account issue?</p>

<h2>            Scan App Problem - &#34;Can&#39;t find the scanner&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Scan App Problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use the scan "App" from Windows 8.1 64Bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP OfficeJet Pro 8610. I was able to use the scan app and now it says "Can't find the scanner"</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows Fax and Scan can find and scan</p>
<p>2. It has worked earlier today and I have not performed an update</p>
<p>3. HP scan app works</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tied both wireless and USB connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideals why it will not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Please do not tell me to update the drivers as they work with 2 other programs and have worded in the last hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try the below Methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Run Hardware troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>You can try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware
 connected to your PC is installed correctly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;• Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping Search (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen,
 moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking Search), entering hardware and devices in the search box, tapping or clicking Settings, and then tapping or clicking Find and fix problems with devices. You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm
 your choice.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persist follow Method 2:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Try to <strong>
uninstall and Reinstall</strong> the printer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Also refer to the Microsoft help articles:</span></p>

<p><span>Video Buffering</span></p>
<p>
<span>﻿If videos you’re watching over the internet are buffering (stopping and starting) that means the video isn't being sent to your computer fast enough. This can be because of a slow internet connection,
 sharing the connection with multiple computers, or if you are also downloading other files at the same time.<br />
<br />
On some sites you can lower the video quality of a video - example: near the bottom right of the YouTube player you can select 240p, 360p, 480p, etc. The lower the number the less likely it is to buffer. If the video still buffers you may need a faster internet
 connection.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>A few hours ago I upgraded to Windows 10 Home from Windows 7 Home Premium on my HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC and now I have more questions regarding Windows 10 Home.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>1. After the upgrade to Windows 10 Home my notebook PC had sound working just fine and then all of a sudden it went out and didn't come back on again until I restarted the computer. Does this mean that there is something
 wrong with my Sound Card's Driver?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>2. When I first ran Windows Update, it didn't work right at all. It totally wouldn't find any updates and gave me an error code of: (0x8024402f). This also seemed to have fixed itself after restarting the computer. What is
 the reason for this error code?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ed68318d-8638-4cf8-9d4d-a836bc335074" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>3. After upgrading to Windows 10 Home and running iTunes 12.2.1 where it wouldn't allow me to update any of my apps that I found out needed to be updated. After restarting the computer, this problem also seems to have fixed
 itself. I forgot what the error code was but has anyone else had any problems with iTunes after upgrading their computer to Windows 10?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>4. After upgrading to Windows 10 Home from Windows 7 Home Premium, I noticed that my new External Hard Drive (a Silicon Power 1TB Rugged Armor A60 Shockproof/Water-Resistant 2.5 Inch USB 3.0 Military Grade Portable External

 Windows 7 Home Premium without any problems, after upgrading to Windows 10 Home though one of the popup notifications was that this External Hard Drive wasn't working and had an error. Before restarting the computer the Hard Drive when trying to click on it
 would act like it didn't exist and "forcefully" disconnected it. After a restart this stopped for a little while and I was able to access the hard drive for awhile to take care of some things. Right after that I got that popup notification again saying that
 there was something wrong with that drive again and so I had Windows 10 run a scan on it and attempt to fix it and as I've already stated, this hard drive is new (it isn't even 3 weeks old yet). Now this hard drive is being inaccessible on Windows 10 at this
 moment and all it says underneath it is "FAT32". After another restart this hard drive is accessible again. But what with Windows 10 Home until I tried accessing it. When I try to access it, it makes a "ding" sound then vanished from the available Hard Drives
 as well as other removable media. So what in Windows is causing any problems with it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e8e27482-d7d5-4774-b9c9-f271c48bc31f" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>5. On Windows 7 Home Premium I had organized my "Start Menu" so that it was the way I wanted it. The upgrade to Windows 10 Home kept some of my personalization sorting but when accessing the main folders within the Start
 Menu for the programs all the programs are listed in the main folder instead of the sorted individual folders I had created in Windows 7. I really want these sorted individual folders back and I want to know how to get them back. What do I need to do to sort
 the folders in the Start Menu? I'm including a screenshot from a remote controlling app I have for my iPad on a Windows 7 computer to demonstrate what I mean for how I organized a folder in the Start Menu that uses both Microsoft Office as well as Open Office
 organized in the Microsoft File Folder.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d6f90a49-2b21-46eb-b42e-f2d288c5845c" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>6. With the Hard Drives, Flash Drives (Removable Media), and other Media Sources when clicking on "My Computer" they are in one setting. But what I want to do is to set them up the way that they were within Windows 7. What
 do I need to do this? I'm including a screenshot from a remote controlling app I have for my iPad on a Windows 7 computer to demonstrate what I mean, the problem is that this computer doesn’t have any external hard drives or flash drives connected to it but
 it still shows the type of setup I am talking about that I want to get in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffcffa8a-9edf-41a7-a216-0cd7a521f0d1" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>7. This question regards Microsoft Edge. In Internet Explorer 11 it was possible to have the tabs that you used for browsing the Internet to be below the "Ribbon" (so to speak) and this is where I want the tabs to be with
 Microsoft Edge. So how do I get the Tabs I have when browsing the Internet to be below "the Ribbon" instead of above it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/02ed5a8f-1cd2-4cfa-a612-04336ec07983" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>8. This question also regards Microsoft Edge. I really don't want a blank page when I open up new tabs in Microsoft Edge nor do I want to use the other options for my "Homepage" in Microsoft Edge. So how do I set up a Homepage
 in Microsoft Edge that will open up directly to the Homepage whenever opening up a new tab in Microsoft Edge?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>9. Where do I go to find my "Recent Documents" in Windows 10? And like in Windows 7 is still safe to delete the documents in "Recent Documents" without deleting their original copies?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>10. During the first time I restarted my computer after installing/upgrading to Windows 10 Home, I was met with this error as seen in this screenshot</span><span>.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e55957eb-0017-4b2d-80ef-6baf4c47cf08" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Before I chose to restart my computer and getting this error, the entire desktop and everything else froze. I was able to do a "Control, ALT, DEL" to bring up the Task Manager where I chose to restart the computer instead.
 When this error/problem occurred on Windows 7, I used Task Manager to End "Windows Explorer" and then I would restart "Windows Explorer" which would fix such a problem.
</span><span>What is causing it and what can be done to fix it?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>11. From everything I have read about Windows 10 including from the "Get Windows 10 App" that I had on my Windows 7 Home Premium OS said that Windows 10 is supposed to be able to load faster, boot up faster and even wake
 up from sleep mode faster than previous OS. From the amount of times I have restarted Windows 10 Home so far, that doesn't seem to be the case at all. In fact I can swear that Windows 7 actually loaded faster for me. So why isn't Windows 10 not moving faster,
 starting faster and resuming faster?</span></p>

</p><p>I didn't need to do this, after another restart hours later (as in a new day) Windows Update worked just fine without doing anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I really need is answers to my other questions/inquiries now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as the following two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>12. Since Windows 10 has Microsoft Edge, how do I uninstall Internet Explorer 11? It stayed after upgrading to Windows 10 and since it's redundant, I want it gone. I attempted to uninstall it but it sends me to "Add/Remove Programs" and Interent Explorer
 11 isn't listed there or under installed updates. So where do I go to uninstall Internet Explorer 11?</p>
<p>
</p><p>13. I still have Windows Media Player installed from Windows 7 Home Premium and I thought it was removed in Windows 10; so why do I still have it?</p>

<h2>            Memory Management, Systemservice Exception, Bad Pool Header... Getting Bluescreens on a daily basis.</h2>
                    <p>So 3 months ago I built a custom PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far so good, I built it together, but after a while I was getting all sorts of bluescreens. I googled them and most of the things I have read, led me to believe that my RAM was bad. I switched out my RAM and was pretty confident that my problem was solved.
 That was until a few days after switching my RAM. Since then I occasionally get Memory Management, Bad Pool Header and Systemservice Exception bluescreens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried updating my drivers and reinstalling windows a few times, but I can't seem to get rid of those bluescreens. I tested my RAM with memtest again and it seems to found an error, but how is it possible that 2 newly bought sets of RAM break in that
 short amount of time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>CPU: Intel core i5-4590 (4x3,5Ghz)</p>
<p>RAM: 8 GB DDR3</p>
<p>Mainboard: Gigabyte Z97P-D3</p>
<p>GPU: Nvidia GeForce GTX 960</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope that someone can help me fixing these problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello ThePuchegger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you are using 8GB of RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using 2 slots, like 2 x 4GB sticks or 1 x 8GB?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try using a different slot if you're using 1 slot to see that the issue lies with one of the slots or if you are using 2 slots and remove 1 of the 4GB sticks and try that for a few days then swap it for the other slot. See what results you get.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, see if you can get an update for the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have anymore questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be here.</p>

            <p>I use 2 x 4 GB sticks<br />
I already tried using the other two slots but when I did that, I would not even get my Monitor to work, so I seated them back. Could there be a possibility that due to my bad RAM my Windows got corrupted, so it won't work properly with the new RAM thus causing
 problems?</p>
<p>As far as I could see the BIOS should be up to date.</p>

I was thinking that maybe the motherboard itself is causing the RAM to fail... Is that a likely solution or am I making things up?</p>
<p>I already thought about it being too low voltage on the RAM, but it doesn't appear that way in BIOS.</p>

    <title>Game reverted back to trial for no apparent reason - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Game reverted back to trial for no apparent reason</h2>
                    
<p>So a while back I purchased a new console and did a license transfer. I re-downloaded everything. This morning I went to play Trials HD and it said I only had the trial version. Thinking that I missed it for whatever reason, I re-downloaded it. Still no
 good. When prompted to purchase the full game it just tells me to re-download. I have achievements for this game so I know I have a license. Any way to fix this?</p>

<p>I've been going round in a similar catch 22 system - My old Xbox went RRD the day before Xmas. New console was purchased on 28th December 2012- transfer license - does not work. followed instructions at &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../download-content</a>
</p>
<p>But my Xbox says to come back to the above site. So what can I do now? </p>
<p>None of my games are allowing my other gold-family-accounts cloud-storage to be read, unless I sign in first as the primary account holder, and load one of my own save games from the cloud. Then I have to sign out and then sign in with the other account
 that I want to use- eg my sons account on Minecraft. </p>
<p>Other games have totally lost the cloud save, like Skyrim, I was on a really high level with many tens of hours spent playing it. I downloaded from my download history and got my previously purchased updates like Hearth-fire, But; Now all I see is start-a-new-game.
 It is soul destroying. I simply cannot play all that again, It has totally ruined my game if the cloud save has gone forever.
</p>
<p>For example, I deleted and re-installed Minecraft, as per instructions, yet my old full game version is not picking up on my other gold family member accounts like it used to. in addition, I tried the license transfer as per xbox instructions &gt; settings
 &gt; account &gt; License Transfer. But all my Xbox complains, is that I had a transfer in November 18th 2012 and that have to wait till next march 19th 2013 to redo it. But I only bought the new xbox on the 28th of December!
</p>
<p>This is stupid, I have no access to my online games. On the 28th December &nbsp;I installed my games to my new xbox, from discs (to save disk ware and improve access). Also a new game Battlefiled 3 PREMIUM EDITION, (a Xmas present on Xmas day). Only ever played
 on the new Xbox, it gave me and my other gold accounts online access. All 5 expansion packs and early access to future expansion packs at £49.99 (so not cheap).</p>
<p>Both my son and I were playing it separately up till the new year, (because my other game saves were not available, re- the licence transfer issue), Then after following xbox lives instructions to re-install all my games, my Premium Edition Pass is now not
 being accepted! - </p>
<p>Both my son and I have separate Battlefiled 3 Premium Edition game saves in the cloud, it was the only game that was working properly. However, if you read help.ea.com FAQ about online passes, they say it is only for one account, but it was working on at
 least two of my gold family accounts separately? So what the hell was going on there? Why did I have access with two of my accounts? And now I have nothing?</p>
<p>The point is SINCE I FOLLOWED xbox live's instructions &nbsp;to delete my games and re-install a few days ago. I now find that my expensive Battlefield 3 - PREMIUM EDITION - ONLINE PASS, is NOT ACCEPTED! Claiming this has already been used! This is not fair and
 I think I should receive compensation for this lost time and bad advice given by Xbox live, also that I should get my premium access back at Xbox Lives expense. It is not fair, I followed Xbox live's instructions and those instructions have rendered my Battlefiled
 3 Premium Edition useless to me!</p>
<p>I am beginning to hate Xbox live, since I have spent about 10 hours to date and still I am going round in circles.</p>
<p>Not happy.</p>
<p>Can anyone help? Sunday Jan 5th 2013.</p>

<p>I add now another 5 hours of reading and writing a detailed description of my Xbox live issues on this forum as a last resort, and previously today ( just like 2 days ago), waiting in support for a call back that never came and WAITING on support with a
 114 minutes wait time. Only to get dropped with ten minutes to go. Now you know why I am starting to hate Xbox live! I still don't have a solution, who do you complain to?
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>For me, it is now 3.20 am Sunday 5th Jan. and I am off to bed, disgruntled and dismayed with the lack of real technical support from Xbox Live. PS3 is looking so appealing right now!</p>

<p>Started - again 9.15 am Sunday 6th - going to give this another go. Message above was actually 3.20 am on today the 6th (I thought it was still the 5th). Off to read and try everything or anything that sounds logical to fix this transfer licenses issue.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1, Request a call not working Claiming "Invalid data. Please check your information'. Yet it is all the same as I entered yesterday and a few days before, that was accepted, (yet I got no call). So, perhaps there is a separate issue there. I know we are
 +5 hours in front and that the call center won't be open yet. (9.38am UK GMT is actually 4.38 am EST), but I should still be able to request a call back to get in front of the ques today for when the call center does open at 2pm my time. It seems logical to
 me. But I guess I'll have to try again at 2pm my time.</p>
<p>.NEXT - lets try....</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2, - Battlefield 3 support, for my expensive Premium Edition content that is up the Swanee River with the rest of my game saves. Off to read.... &nbsp; After reading all the BF3 Website and leaflet and online pass ticket that came with the game, I could ring
 BF3's Telephone support right now, since it is available 7 days a week from 9am to 10pm GMT on 0870 243 2435. But, there is little point just yet, (If, as I suppose they will talk me through something on my Xbox), &nbsp;unless I get my other licenses transferred
 first, otherwise, this is just likely to happen again. So I will do that after, talking with Xbox live Support. &nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Before anyone asks, YES I do have an EA Origin Account, that is the same email and gamertag for my Xbox Live! - So there should not be any doubt as to my ownership of the BF3 Premium Edition Access that I have already paid for.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>BEWARE BF3 Premium Edition owners. It looks like, (from what I read), that no excuse will get round the ONE TIME PASS CODE that you get with the game. Once you've used it, that's it! You're done! So, thanks to Xbox, if I want what I've already paid for,
 I will have to layout more money to buy it again. &nbsp;(TIME NOW 11.15 am - another two hours of wasted time, over 17 hours to date for what should be a simple licence transfer)!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PS, I did not mention, that all my RDR and Undead Nightmare, GTA4, TBoGT and TLaTD, all games that I have completed, all my saves are GONE!
</p>

                    <span>"Windows 10 new download has resulted in my sound drives not even being recognised
 sound permanently muted. i am not technical on computers but by using internet advice, i have tried updating, uninstalling and re-downloading and nothing works (i can't even set a default drive it's shaded grey). On one of the drives there is a yellow exclamation
 mark triangle and everytime i re-install/download it has this symbol. your troubleshooter says there is an error in downloading a fresh drive. after 4 hrs messing about absolutely disgusted they have not taken driver compatibility into account As i have said,
 i am not computer savvy so considering taking my laptop into our I.T. guys at work to sort. Do any of you guys out there have a simple solution please?</span>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level 
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for your reply. I have an Acer VS-552 ultra-slim laptop. The troubleshooter says it is not 'plugged in', the option for rollback is 'greyed out' so not an option. Have uninstalled then re-loaded AMD but nothing works, there is a yellow
 triangle on an icon underneath the AMD called 'audio device on high definition audio bus', this has a yellow triangle next to it. Tried uninstall then re-install but triangle still there. Tried a scan with driver easy and it says drivers are out of date but
 when i install what is supposed to be the latest and compatible driver, it's still the same. It's as though the new OS just isn't recognising the driver is there (as though i don't have one).</p>

            I recommend you try rolling back:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<p>Thanks a lot Andre, that's sorted the problem, i uninstalled Windows 10 update assistant and Windows update installer because as soon as i came to my main screen, it started to update to the new system again. Hopefully i'll be ok, cannot believe that an
 organisation such as Microsoft arbitrarily force a new OS without doing their homework properly and&nbsp; 'ironing/anticipating' issues before introducing it to their customers. A lot of people unhappy about this.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks again Andre... You've been brilliant! Will keep you posted. Have a good week.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I checked the list of Acer notebooks tested by Microsoft, My Acer Aspire V5-552 is not on the list and has therefore not been tested. I have sorted the update using metered connection so it comes up as a reminder but i just click remind me
 later. Don't know what to do about the fact that my notebook has not been tested and indeed why they have missed it.</p>

<h2>            &#34;We Can&#39;t Connect&#34; but computer is connected</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded an older laptop to Windows 10, and have encountered the following issues.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Cortana:</strong>&nbsp; Cortana is not working.&nbsp; I'm in the US, have the language set to English (UK - can't get the US language pack, but that's likely not noticeable).&nbsp; When I go to Cortana settings, the settings state that Cortana isn't available
 in my region.&nbsp; When I click on a link that says "Why?", I am brought to an online page that says, "Cortana is only available in the following countries/regions: ...
<em>United States</em>.&nbsp; Let me be clear: I am accessing the Internet, and I am in the United States.</li><li><strong>Windows Search and other Windows Apps:</strong>&nbsp; The issue was first noticed with the Windows Search, located on the bottom left corner near the Windows flag.&nbsp; When I click on the search bar, I'm greeted with "We can't connect to web search at the
 moment but you can still search your stuff.&nbsp; Make sure you are currently connected to the Internet."&nbsp; Let me be very clear, since the several times I've seen this question answered, I've come across connection troubleshooting.&nbsp;
<em>I am connected to the Internet.&nbsp; I can load a web browser and visit MSN and other sites.&nbsp; The Internet connection is working perfectly well.&nbsp; There is no trouble with the adapter, the modem, the router, or the connection.&nbsp; I am connected to the Internet.</em>&nbsp;
 Windows search and Windows apps, however, are saying I need to check my connection.&nbsp; I am connected.</li><li><strong>Unable to Sign In with Microsoft Account:</strong>&nbsp; The upgrade did not give me the option to sign in with a Microsoft Account, only a local account.&nbsp; When I try to set up to sign in with a Microsoft account, the pop up that I presume usually allows
 for this comes up with "Something went wrong."&nbsp; Again, the computer is connected to the Internet.&nbsp; Somehow, no Microsoft Apps are acknowledging this.</li><li><strong>Unable to Add Users:</strong> I can't even add them locally.&nbsp; "Something went wrong."</li></ul>
<p>Is there a solution to any of these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that other people who have been unable to add users, were told to install using a DVD.&nbsp; That's how I installed.&nbsp; Do I need to wipe the drive and reinstall Windows 10?&nbsp; I shouldn't have had to restore Windows 7 to get the upgrade to work, but
 I did.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to reinstall Windows 10, or jury-rig the OS to work.&nbsp; Could we get some fixes for these issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> I'm wondering if these are somehow strangely connected.&nbsp; Also, to provide some specs:&nbsp; the computer I upgraded is an Acer Aspire 5532, and was running Windows 7 Home Premium, SP1.&nbsp; The adapter is an Atheros AR5B93 Wireless Network
 adapter.&nbsp; I also tried it with the Atheros AR8132 PCI-E Fast Ethernet Controller.&nbsp; The computer connects to the Internet without issue, but does not let me use Windows Apps requiring Internet connection.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are glad to provide the assistance required to help resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that it is not recommended by Microsoft to alter the registry in your PC as any false alteration can lead to system failure. Normally system registry are altered by users whose computers are malfunctioning.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tells you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you
 follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to
 view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: </span></p>
<p><span>322756 (</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</span></a><span> )
</span></p>
<p><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Even if you want to proceed with the above, I suggest that you give permission to the Synaptic folder check if your able to perform the desired task.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps</span></p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t update a new driver for my graphics card driver.</h2>
                    <p>Good day to you guys.<br />
So, My nvidia graphic driver is 337.88 now.<br />
I know you guys know that latest driver is 344.11.<br />
But i was clicking the NVIDIA Geforce Experience, nothing happen.<br />
But when the com ask me to Install easy or Install customly.<br />
I was pressing Install and the NVIDIA Geforce Experience just dissapear.<br />
I tried hundreds of times and the download is not even processing.<br />
The &nbsp;NVIDIA Geforce Experience just keep dissapear.<br />
I tried another way like 3 ways.<br />
&nbsp;1. Just go to the NVIDIA website and finding the graphics card that i use and download the driver. The process is smooth but a thing come out and said the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; downloading is how many precent and when it's done it will auto install. So i was waiting
 about 1 minute. The downloading was complete but the install never &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; appear<br />
<br />
&nbsp;2.I go to Task Manager. Close all of the NVIDIA task. And went to uninstall the NVIDIA things and reinstall again but i cant uninstall a NVIDIA things so i just gave &nbsp; &nbsp;up uninstalling.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;3.I click the Computer button and went to Window (C:) where my NVIDIA driver install. Then I click on NVIDIA &gt; Display Drivers then i saw 2 drivers. One is 337.88 &nbsp; &nbsp;version another is new one 344.11. So i delete the 377.88 one.I I though everything is done
 but i click again on NVIDIA Geforce Experience. It same before i &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;deleting the 344.11 version . It ask me to install or not. So i was just install and it happen like before. Just dissapear.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Damon</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to us.&nbsp; Sorry to hear you are having trouble with wifi and Bluetooth on your Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to check some things.&nbsp; Please manually confirm that you have all available updates installed.&nbsp; Remember to keep the power supply plugged in and connected when updating.</p>
<p>Desktop&gt; Swipe for Charms&gt; Settings&gt; Control Panel&gt; Windows update&gt; check for updates&gt; install</p>
<p>Be sure to restart Surface between layers of updates, even if not prompted to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried different&nbsp;Bluetooth accessories to see if your experience varies?&nbsp; What happens if you use a wired mouse or speakers instead of Bluetooth?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what is happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing the same issue.</p>
<p>Here's the difference between I experience when I have&nbsp;my Headphones connected to the Surface pro via Bluetooth vs cables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connected via Bluetooth:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Connected via cables:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2243ad2c-b53e-4af6-8e90-bde5482b7ba1" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed all the latest updates to Windows 8.1.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to a fix being provided.</p>
<p>

            There is no fix as this is the limitation of bluetooth. Unless your router can have dual band frequency with the 5GHz for example, you should disable bluetooth connection.
