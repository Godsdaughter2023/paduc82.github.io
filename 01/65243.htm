    <title>Background color in start menu and setting changed from blue to red, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardbe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Background color in start menu and setting changed from blue to red, but not by me.</h2>
                    <p>The background color of my settings dialog and some of the tiles and icons in the start menu has changed without me doing anything from blue to red. This happened after I had to turn my computer off manually due to Firefox causing the whole machine to lock
 up and I am just wondering if it is significant in any way:</p>

            Hi Edward,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The changes you see might occur if the option “Automatically pick an accent color from the my background” is swipe/switched on.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Go to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Colors, and then choose your own color, or let Windows pull an accent color from your background.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

    <title>error message when trying to access links in emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elizabeth mcneil  say:</h3>
<h2>            error message when trying to access links in emails</h2>
                    <p>Ever since my account was changed to Windows 10, which I had not wanted (everyone said there were many problems, so I avoided it), but which the computer seems to have thought I should have despite my wishes, I have been able to link to increasingly fewer
 sites from email, though I can still access some. First, it was just Zillow.com, and now all of a sudden it's other real estate sites, my realtor's client portal, the New York Times. If I can see the URL (I cannot with my realtor's portal, hence my larger
 problem, since I need to purchase a new house), I have to copy and paste the URL in order to go to the page. I can only get to some sites through my Outlook email on my phone, too. Occurs same using Chrome or Firefox. Or Google on phone.</p>

            To run these networking commands in a command prompt window
<ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span>Command prompt</span>,&nbsp;press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;<span>Command prompt</span>, and then select&nbsp;<span>Run
 as administrator</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Yes</span>.</li><li>At the command prompt, run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:
<ul>
<li>Type&nbsp;<span>netsh winsock reset</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>netsh int ip reset</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /release</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /renew</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Type&nbsp;<span>ipconfig /flushdns</span>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li></ul>
</li></ol>
Temporarily turn off firewalls<br />
<p>
Sometimes firewall software might prevent you from getting connected. You can see if the connection issue is caused by a firewall by turning it off temporarily and then trying to visit a website you trust.</p>
<p>
The steps to turn off a firewall depend on the firewall software you’re using. Check the documentation for your firewall software to learn how to turn it off. Make sure you turn it back on as soon as you can. Not having a firewall turned on makes your PC more
 vulnerable to hackers, worms, or viruses.</p>
<p>
If you have trouble turning off your firewall, do the following to turn off all firewall software that's running on your PC. Again, make sure you turn your firewall back on as soon as you can.</p>
To turn off all firewalls
<ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span>Command prompt</span>, press and hold (or right-click)&nbsp;<span>Command prompt</span>, and then select&nbsp;<span>Run
 as administrator</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Yes</span>.</li><li>At the command prompt, type&nbsp;<span>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state off</span>, and then press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li><li>Open your web browser and visit a website you trust and see if you can connect to it.</li><li>To turn on all firewalls you might have installed, at the command prompt, type&nbsp;<span>netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on</span>, and then press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>.</li></ol>
<p>
If you find the firewall software is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to check and see if updated software is available.</p>
Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software
<p>
Sometimes antivirus or malware-prevention software might prevent you from getting connected. You can see if the connection issue is caused by antivirus and malware-prevention software by turning it off temporarily and then trying to visit a website you trust.
 If you find it is causing the connection issues, contact the software manufacturer or visit their website to see if updated software is available.</p>
<p>
The steps to turn off antivirus or malware-prevention software depend on the software you’re using. Check the documentation for your software to learn how to turn it off. Make sure you turn it back on as soon as possible. Not having antivirus or malware-prevention
 software turned on makes your PC more vulnerable to hackers, worms, or viruses.</p>
<p>
If you’re not sure what antivirus or malware-prevention software program you have installed, Windows might be able to tell you.</p>
To find out what antivirus or malware-prevention software is installed
<ol>
<li>In the search box on the taskbar, type&nbsp;<span>System and security</span>, and then select&nbsp;<span>Review your computer’s status and resolve issues</span>.</li><li>Select the down arrow next to&nbsp;<span>Security</span>.
<p>
If Windows can detect your antivirus software, it's listed under&nbsp;<span>Virus protection</span>. For malware-prevention software, look under&nbsp;<span>Spyware and unwanted software protection</span>.</p>
</li><li>If the antivirus or malware-prevention software is on, check the documentation for that software to learn how to turn it off.</li></ol>
<p>
Make sure you turn your antivirus or malware-prevention software back on as soon as you can to make sure your PC is better protected.</p>
<p>
</p>
Use network reset to reinstall network devices
<p>
Using network reset&nbsp;should be the last step you try. Consider using&nbsp;it if the steps above don’t help to get you connected.</p>
<p>
This can help solve connection problems you might have after upgrading from a previous version of Windows to Windows&nbsp;10, as well as fix problems where you can connect to the Internet, but not to shared network drives. It removes any network adapters you have
 installed and the settings for them. After your PC restarts, any network adapters are reinstalled, and the settings for them are set to the defaults.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
Note</div>
<div style="margin-left: -24px">
<div>
<p>To use network reset, your PC must be running Windows&nbsp;10 Version 1607. To see what version of Windows&nbsp;10 your device is currently running, select the&nbsp;<span>Start</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;button,
 then select&nbsp;<span>Settings</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>System</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>About</span>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the&nbsp;<span>Start</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;button, then select&nbsp;<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Network &amp; Internet</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Status</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Network
 reset</span>.</li><li>On the&nbsp;<span>Network reset</span>&nbsp;screen, select&nbsp;<span>Reset now</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Yes</span>&nbsp;to confirm.
<p>
Wait for your PC to restart and see if that fixes the problem.</p>

<p>Upon reviewing the issue based on your reply, there might be an issue with the printer driver which is why you were unable to use the printer even though it was connected to your PC. A PC has different types of hardware components connected to it. To communicate
 with these hardware components the PC requires a software program, popularly known as a Device Driver. Device drivers are developed both by operating system developers and hardware manufacturers. To ensure that the device drivers on your computer stay at their
 best performance and are free from any bugs, you need to update them on a regular basis. What we strongly recommend is for you to install the latest update from the printer manufacturer's website and see if that resolves the issue?

<p>Thank you for your responses - I downloaded the drivers yesterday, and once again to-day - what actually worked was one of the Microsoft routines (from a different screen) the problem solving ones, and I hit fix about three times and then I got a new message
 saying that one of the documents 'in waiting' was blocking - then I ran the fix routine (no, I can't tell you which one, but it was a different one!) and three of the docs that were queued up printed off, but then the next new doc I tried to load wouldn't
 print, so I removed multiple versions of the printer (1) (2) etc. and either one of the remaining versions found its correct port or God in his infinite wisdom and mercy...???&nbsp; It is fixed now - thank you.<br />

<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></b><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem,
 the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.
</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us
 to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning
 and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span>
 The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>

<p>
<b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad
 sectors are found, the scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Please perform these recommended steps, review the additional information provided and post back if you are still experience the issue. I will be glad
 to provide you with additional options available that you can utilize to get this resolved.</span></p>

Of course he's made changes to his computer, he's just put windows 8 on it!! Sorry but how much of a pain in the **** is that so called solution? 


What is a 'Clean Boot'? 


Why don't you just say you're not sure and save us all some time? 



Basically the error message means 'erm ... I think something went wrong, maybe.'

</p><p>My query is that I have a business number for Skype and I need to utilize the call transfer facility. Please note I am using the latest Skype version that comes with Windows 10 and I can not locate the call transfer tab; upon searching the web I was directed

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community!<br />
</span><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
What is the exact error message?<br />
</span><span><br />
You may try the suggestions provided and check if it helps:<br />
</span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span><br />
</span><span>You may try running check disk and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the steps to check disk for errors.</span></p>
<p>
<span>a) Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b) Click on
<b>‘Command Prompt (Admin)’</b> to bring up elevated command prompt.
<b>Note</b>: Click <b>‘Yes’ </b>if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c) In the command prompt, type
<b>‘chkdsk /r’</b> and press Enter.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Answer Y when
<b>‘chkdsk’ </b>asks you if you want to check the drive next time computer boots (restarts).</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span>
 While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span><span><br />
<br />
<br />
</span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span><br />
You may update the chipset and BIOS (Basic Input/output system) to the latest version from the manufacturer website and check.<br />
<br />
Note :</span><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting
 properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<br />
If you need any other information about Windows, feel free to post your questions and we will be glad to help.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your suggestions but I&nbsp;should have reported in my original post&nbsp;that the disk is OK, I had already&nbsp;checked with sfc / scannow&nbsp;and chkdsk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bios is also the latest version available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the problem is to do with the way W8 handles AHCI or the features associated with AHCI.</p>
<p>As I understand it Storahci is new to W8.&nbsp;I have found several others reporting similar problems on other forums - solutions however seem to be quite varied and have mixed reports of their effectiveness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I disabled Aggressive Link Power Management (ALPE)&nbsp;and Aggressive Slumber / Partial Management (ASP) in the BIOS and that seems to have eliminated the errors.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure if this is a Windows 8 issue or an issue with my BIOS but I didn't have these errors under Vista with this BIOS setting enabled.

            <p>Whew, after banging my head on the wall, trying to update BIOS, Chipset and anything else I could find I decided to backtrack what the user did/was doing when the problem decided to present itself.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out the user changed Power Options from Balanced to Power Saver.&nbsp; Reverting from Power Saver to Balanced fixed the issue.&nbsp; No more disk errors and the computer ran like a champ.&nbsp;

            <p>This is also a solution for the Win 10 "black screen of death" !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue have started 1-2 minutes after changing the power settings and after 2 weeks of useless troubleshooting and BIOS/drivers updating, I've traced all system events one more time and noticed this one repeating. Finally after just changing the power plan
 - in my case from Balanced to High Performance - I've got the "black screen" issue fixed.<br />

<p>I have two laptops and a PC all running on Windows 8.1. I can type n my password to start the computers, but as soon as I am signed in, the keyboard freezes and wont type anything in IE or in Word or on Chrome. Same issue on all laptops and the PC using
 the same Microsoft account to sign in. However, when I sign in as a Guest, I am able to type anywhere ! I am trying to sign out of my account but the Windows wont let me without&nbsp;first entering my password - something I cannot do because I cannot type. Is there
 another way to sign out and create a new sign in account for Microsoft? Am I on the right track? I am wondering what could be wrong with my Hotmail account anyways. there is no issue&nbsp;with Hotmail on m y Android phone or on windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;computers. Thank you very
 much for your help!</p>

    <title>Billed for new game....did not buy or order - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Billed for new game....did not buy or order</h2>
                    
<p>As implied in the title, I received an email a few days ago that confirmed my purchase of the game "Battle High 2 A+". &nbsp;I have never heard of this game and definitely did not order this. &nbsp;There is no other person that has access to my xbox. &nbsp;My credit card
 has been billed and the game now appears as ready to download. &nbsp;I tried looking around on the Microsoft site, but my order history does not include this game (or any games that actually purchased). &nbsp;I also couldn't find a contact email to send seek assistance
 on this (the website just kept directing me to FAQs and this forum - the chat also is not working for me). &nbsp;Something seems amiss and I have some concerns over Microsoft having this type of access to my credit card.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;Who do I contact to get this resolved?</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;Why is Microsoft's website so poor? &nbsp;There are a handful of companies that I would expect to have amazing sites and Microsoft would be one of those (/s, no need to answer this question)</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Administrator password requested to be entered by system - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> r.smith1969  say:</h3>
<h2>            Administrator password requested to be entered by system</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Stream Notebook PC 11 operating system Windows 8.1 and 64 bits. This is the only computer that I have and it is not used for any business purpose or associated with a workplace. As part of the learning curve I created a Homegroup and added different
 email accounts to "have" other users. I purchased Windows 10 and tried to install it, but I am unable to do that. When I set up the computer I DID NOT create an administrator account nor did I establish a password for an administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about the last month every time I try to run, install, or delete (sometimes I can delete) a program I am prompted to enter an administrator password. I cannot run programs or delete files. When I try to run a file ending with .exe the only choice is
 to run it as an administrator. Then a dialogue box opens and if I click on "Show Details" it always says "Show information about this publisher's certificate" and then "To continue, enter an administrator password, then click Yes." If I select "Troubleshoot
 compatibility" from the dropdown menu the result is an "Incompatible Program" and "Fix OneDriveSetup is incompatible." I have generated troubleshooting reports and submitted those. My C Drive is just about completely full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem and how did you resolve it? Some of the solutions that I have researched tell me to use the Windows key + R to bring up the Run dialog box and then enter commands to run programs. They will not run on my computer. I hope
 I don't have to remove and reinstall Windows 8.1 and start all over again. Thanks for any support/advice on how to handle this problem.</p>

<p>Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to you and/or anyone else who might be able to help me resolve this situation. An administrator account should have been created when this computer was initialized and it was turned on and setup. Unfortunately
 that did not happen. An administrator account was never created by me or anyone else (please remember this is a PC with no business or school use, that was given to me as a gift in an unopened box from Walmart) so there is no administrative password that I
 know of. This appears to be a case of a phantom Administrator that sadly has been given the ghoulish assignment to haunt my computer and make my life miserable. It has and it is doing exactly that. Lots of both. Misery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have learned about my computer because of all the research I have done to try and resolve this miserable problem. My computer is an HP STREAM NOTEBOOK PC 11 that runs Windows 8.1 with Bing (64-bit) as the operating system. Version 6.3.9600
 identifies it as being used for Windows 8.1 and 8.1 PRO that was sold directly to consumers starting on 10/17/13. The touchpad failed and the fix for that was to spend about $25 for a wireless mouse.&nbsp; The time spent researching the problem and then calling
 both HP and Microsoft for help figuring out what had gone wrong and what the cure was incredible. Figuring out who messed up and how I was going to get my computer fixed was a requirement due to the blame game. Have you ever tried to run a computer using just
 the keyboard shortcuts? It is very difficult and time consuming. I was so happy to resolve that issue. I had no idea what was yet to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used command code command NET USER and found these users listed for my computer domain: Administrator, Bette (a fictitious person that I created as an exercise to increase both my anxiety level and knowledge), Guest, Roger (me), and rpsmi_000.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>COMMAND CODE COMMAND NET USER ADMINISTRATOR</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIRST SECTION&nbsp;OF NET USER&nbsp;ADMINISTRATOR</p>
<p>C:\Users\Roger&gt;NET USER ADMINISTRATOR</p>
<p>User name:&nbsp; Administrator, Full Name: blank, Comment: Built-in account for administering the computer/domain, User's comment: none, Country/region code: 000 (System Default), Account active = NO, Account expires = Never.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>SECOND SECTION&nbsp;OF NET USER ADMINISTRATOR</p>
<p>The password was last set on 12/09/14 at 11:48:07 PM, Password expires: Never, Password changeable on 12/09/14 at 11:48:07 PM, Password required: No, User may change password: Yes.

<p>Logon hours allowed: All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIFTH SECTION OF NET USER ADMINISTRATOR</p>

<p>
</p><p>I tried to give as many details as possible so that hopefully someone who has had this problem can give me some advice on what I need to do. The things I have read do not work such as command code commands that will not work. I cannot run programs (like
 those that end in .exe) because it keeps requesting an administrator password that I do not have.&nbsp;<span>For the last 6 to 8 weeks or more, every time I have tried to run, install, or delete (some I can delete but most have
 security requirements) and the control panel/administrative programs I try to run am prompted to enter an administrator password. There is something wrong with the certificate(s) that are on file. My computer RAM memory is all but used up because I cannot
 run programs or delete files. When I try to run a file ending with .exe the only choice is to run it as an administrator. Then a dialogue box opens and if I click on "Show Details" it always says "Show information about this publisher's certificate" and then
 "To continue, enter an administrator password, then click Yes." If I select "Troubleshoot compatibility" from the dropdown menu the result is an "Incompatible Program" and "Fix OneDriveSetup is incompatible." I have generated troubleshooting reports and submitted
 those. to Microsoft. My C Drive is just about completely full.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem and how did you resolve it? Some of the solutions that I have researched tell me to use the Windows key + R to bring up the Run dialog box and then enter command code commands to run programs.
 They will not run on my computer. I hope I don't have to remove and reinstall Windows 8.1 and start all over again. Thanks for any support/advice on how to handle this problem.</p>

<p>Whatever steps that I took to setup this computer did not create or discuss or deal with an administrative account/password. My original request for help contains this statement "<span>When I set up the computer I DID NOT
 create an administrator account nor did I establish a password for an administrator account." Please reread what I have put in my letter and hopefully you will see that this is a flawed product that never should have been unleashed to anyone. I am unable to
 activate or add an Administrator Account. on this computer.&nbsp; When I try to run, add, or delete programs a box pops up and asks me for the administrative password to allow Microsoft to take that action. I hardly have any space left on my hard drive C</span></p>
<p><span>The more research that I do has lead me&nbsp;to the conclusion that the 8.X series of Windows is the worst disaster that Microsoft has ever created and released on an innocent marketplace. The computer is poorly conceived,
 designed, laid-out, executed and constructed. The first major failure was the touch-pad&nbsp;(a mouse was needed to gain use of the computer back, a huge waste&nbsp; of time), lack of adequate disk/storage space, then the request for an administrative password to be
 entered to do most things to maintain the computer. I certainly know now what to avoid when I go to look for my next computer. It is much faster to search for failures of HP Stream Notebook PC 11 with Windows 8.1 than research each flaw individually. I would
 appreciate&nbsp;it if Microsoft and HP would just admit this and help me get this mess fixed/replaced pronto without further delay or cost to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>No one here works for Microsoft, we are home users like you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first account you ever create on a PC is an administrator (if it wasn't you would never be able to install anything or change any settings, create other users, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could pay for a support desk to help you, but any free option would require some level of effort on your part. Probably to reinstall the OS (takes about 20 minutes). Do you have a install disk? If not you can download the files for free from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            I am sorry but I do not understand the solution you have suggested. What "new code" are you referring to? I do not have a phone, I have a PC. Please explain using step by step instructions as what I need to do because I am happy to try anything at this
 point to get rid of this PC requesting an administrative password to be entered. I am also curious that instructions on this site and other solutions suggested want me to use command code RUN (Windows key + R) to correct the problem. Many of the command codes
 do not work (an example is lusrmgr.msc for local users and groups, it tells me this snapin cannot be used with this edition of Windows 8.1, has someone updated things and not bothered to explain what to do to get things fixed? Another suggestion was to enable
 the built-in administrator account in Windows.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The instructions tell you to right-click on Command Prompt, and then&nbsp;</span><strong>select</strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;Run
 as Administrator. When you are prompted by User Account Control (UAC), click Continue. At the command prompt, type net user administrator /active:yes, and then press ENTER. Type net user administrator {Password}, and then press ENTER. Does not work for me.</span>
 Thanks to anyone who can shed light on this Microsoft Mess.

<p>For the third time I will recommend to reinstall the OS files.&nbsp;<span>That would be my first choice, it is by far the fastest, safest, easiest, most direct path to instantly fixing the problem because you'd be all done with

<p>I don't believe you will be banned but I wouldn't recommend doing it for two reasons. The first one is to be certain because EA might be policing it to some extent. The second is because it was never intended for someone to be able to do that, I don't think.</p>
