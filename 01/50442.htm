<h2>            Will a Xbox One purchased in the US work in Brazil&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all, I am going to be in Brazil for a month for work and am considering bringing my console, which I purchased in the US. Aside from needing a converter for my power cord, are there any issues with using my console in Brazil? I wasn't sure if I would
 be able to connect to Xbox Live in another country.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondly, say I am unable to get online for whatever reason, am I able to play games that I have a physical copy of the disc without being connected to the Internet?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Yes, first of all with the correct power supply unit your Xbox one will work in Brazil no problems. Now for Xbox Live and your account. You can change your region which will enable you to take your gamertag &amp; achievements but will unfortunately lock any
 region restricted content. Region locked content can include subscriptions to Xbox Music, SKY TV, and other streaming Apps. On top of this you will only be able to switch your region once every three months.</p>
<p>You can start this process by clicking the link below</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/manage-account/change-region" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../change-region</a></p>
<p>Gaming offline is no problem either. The only time you'll need an online connection is for the initial setup of your Xbox One, and to get the latest system and title updates before you start playing some games.</p>
<p>Hope that information helped.</p>

<h2>            Desktop not showing up in normal mode</h2>
                    My windows Vista runs normal in safe mode with networking but in normal mode, after I enter the password for my account, the desktop never shows up, i just have a blank (black) screen for hours. I tried restoring the system at different points in the past
 but the problem remained the same. Also, before the computer crashed, I has a blue screen for 2 seconds and then the computer restarted and the desktop never appeared in normal mode since then. Any suggestions ?&nbsp;
<div>Thank you. </div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Have you scanned your system for viruses ? If yes then what virus was detected in your system ?<br />
<br />
Check the below registry entry in safe mode :<br />
<br />
<br />
</span>Check the value data for<span style="font-weight: bold"> shell.</span> It must be<span style="font-weight: bold"> EXPLORER.EXE</span> only. If it modified, then remove the malicious content &amp; keep only&nbsp; EXPLORER.EXE.
<br />
</span>Hope it will help you.<span style="font-weight: bold"><br />

<h2>            0xc00000e9, An unexpected I&#47;O error has occurred</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
Original title:I got a status: 0xc00000e9 and then i got no operating system found. How to fix this?
<br />
I was using any video converter to convert some videos into AVI in order to burn them on a DVD because i had little space left on my laptop. Then suddenly it went black like if on sleep mode. I tried to wake it up but nothing. So then i turned it off and when
 i tried to turn it on i got <span style="font-style: italic">Status : 0xc00000e9</span>, Info An unexpected I/O error has occurred.
<br />
<br />
I went into the safe mode and it was finding a restore point in order to restart but it went as an error so i turned it off again. I made a start up Test and its results were:<br />
<br />
100% of the system memory tested OK<br />
<br />
2,912,301,056 bytes of system memory tested OK<br />
Memory test pass<br />
Primary Hard Disk Self Test<br />
Quick test<br />
0% Complete&nbsp; .<br />
"Hard Disk Test" Failed<br />
<br />
I forgo to say that when i turned it off and then on it said no operating system found and when i click any button on my keyboard it beeped.<br />

The email address you use for those services can also be used to sign in to Skype. If you have more than one account, you can be signed in to Skype but not with the correct account where your contacts and Skype Credit are stored. <br /> <br />Someone else may have used your device to sign in to their Microsoft account.<br />Someone like a friend, family member, child, or spouse may have used your device to sign in to their account and forgotten to sign back out.<br /><br />Follow these steps to sign in to the correct Skype account:<br /> <br />Do you have more than one Skype account?<br /> <br />Do you use an email address to sign in to other Microsoft products or services such as Xbox, OneDrive, or Outlook.com? If you recently signed in to one of those other services, it's possible you may be signed in to Skype with a different

            Are you using Wireless or Wired network?
<br />
<br />Have you tried signing out then signing in again?
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features
<br />		Scroll down to Skype
<br />		Select it
<br />		Click Advanced options
<br />		Click Reset
<br />
<br />		Restart
<br />
<br />		Check the Store for updates
<br />
<br />I would also try running Skype diagnostics on your account:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics</a>
<br />
<br />Also sign into Skype for Web to confirm if you are still unable to send messages. 
<br />
<br />Skype for web
<br /><a href="https://web.skype.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/en</a>
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Check Skype status to see if its functioning in your region:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/status/</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure you are using your email address and password associated with the account and not the Skype ID.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week. 
<br />
<br />From Skype
<br />We are encouraging everyone to upgrade now to avoid any inconvenience as only Skype version 8.0 will work after September 1, 2018. As we roll out improvements, there comes a time when we must shut down older services and application versions. 
<br />

            how old is the printer? is there windows 7 drivers for the printer? most likely the printer is a rebranded printer like Lexmark. I had a client that had a dell printer , same situation as you turned out it was the browser. They had to go back a version
 or two for the printer to work. Try googling your printer make and model along with your concern. the printer could be broken try installing on another computer if possible.

            <p>Start by cleaning up the Print Spooler, this entails cleaning out entries at the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Environments registry key.&nbsp; This can be done manually but it's much easier and safer to use a Microsoft supplied utility
 to clean it for you see here:&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askperf/archive/2012/02/24/microsoft-fixit-for-printing.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Fixit for Printing</a></strong>&nbsp;

<p>The following information will be useful to other users who cannot get a different printer to work after removing a Dell or Lexmark printer.&nbsp; Dell printers are re-branded Lexmark printers, these printers add a dependency on the LexBce service to the print
 spooler, the above Microsoft Fixit for Printing utility will remove this dependency, when you reinstall the Dell printer software the needed LexBce service dependency will be added to the spooler.&nbsp; The dependency can also be removed manually by entering the
 following command at an elevated command prompt:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sc config spooler depend= RPCSS</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note the space between = and RPCSS.</p>

<h3> wsov04  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista 32 bit Clean installation</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;Built my own computer and trying to install vista 32 bit.&nbsp; Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>Asus M4A78 Pro Mother Board</p>
<p>AMD Athlon x2&nbsp; 64 processor Dual Core</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my problem:&nbsp; I'm booting up with vista in the cd/ dvd drive.&nbsp; I go through the first few steps (US, Custom, etc).&nbsp; Next, the installation bar appears at bottom&nbsp;of screen.&nbsp; It's divided into 2 sections: 1. "Collecting information", 2. "Installing Windows".&nbsp;&nbsp;The
 bar only fills up&nbsp;2/3 in the "Collecting Information section until a screen pops up and says "no drivers found.&nbsp; Please select the driver you want to install.&nbsp; Please insert the media - cd, dvd, or floppy.&nbsp; A friend says that he had to do the same with a floppy
 drive.&nbsp; I install a floppy drive through the usb in the back.&nbsp; There are 2 buttons - "Browse" or "Re-Scan".&nbsp; I've clicked both but when I click "Browse" there appears Drives A:, B:, D:, E:, F:, G:, Boot.&nbsp; I selelct A: which has the floppy.&nbsp; A screen appears
 and reads "Please insert formatted 1.44 Floppy".&nbsp; I do so and it begins searching for driver, which in the end..."Driver is not found" again.&nbsp; I've also selected other drives in the "browse" button.&nbsp; My ASUS mobo also comes with a disc that reads "Vista Drivers
 inside".&nbsp; I've also tried downloading&nbsp;it in DOS mode.&nbsp; It reads "please select:&nbsp; a) vista 64 bit, b) vista 32 bit, c) windows xp, d) dos prompt.&nbsp; When I go to select "b" it then displays A:/ and after a few seconds it reads "please insert floppy into A:/.&nbsp;
 I then proceed to do so and following it says it cant be found then gives me the option of aborting, ignoring, retrying, or canceling.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Does anybody have any ideas what's going on.&nbsp; Please help!!!!</p>

            Hello wsov04,<br />
<br />
<br />
Perform a clean installation of Vista (make sure nothing is plug into the computer&nbsp;via USB, except the ethernet or modem cable)
There are two ways to perform a clean installation of Windows Vista. The first method is to install Windows Vista by running the Setup program from the current version of Windows on your computer. The second method is to start the computer from the Windows
 Vista DVD. First, try method 1. If it does not work, try method 2.<br />
<br />
<strong>Warning</strong> In a clean installation, existing data on your computer is deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and software programs. After you install the operating system, you must also reinstall all
 programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or other external storage devices before you perform a clean installation.
Method 1: Perform a clean installation of Windows Vista by running Setup from the current version of Windows
To perform a clean installation of Windows Vista from the current version of Windows on the computer, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Start the computer and make sure that the current version of Windows has started.
</li><li>Insert the Windows Vista DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray. Wait a moment for the Setup program to start automatically.
</li><li>If the Setup program does not start automatically, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>
Run</strong>. </li><li>Type <span>Drive:\setup.exe</span> and then click <strong>
OK</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note </strong>Drive is the drive letter of the computer’s DVD drive. </li></ol>
</li><li>When the Setup program starts and the <strong>Install now</strong> screen appears, click
<strong>Install now</strong>. </li><li>When the <strong>Which type of installation do you want?</strong> screen appears, click
<strong>Custom (advanced)</strong>. The follow the instructions to install Windows Vista.
</li></ol>
If Windows Vista is now running on your computer, you have completed the installation successfully.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Perform a clean installation of Windows Vista by starting the computer from the Windows Vista DVD.</strong>&nbsp;
<strong>Note: </strong>The computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For information about how to configure the computer to start from the DVD drive, see the documentation that is included with the computer. Or, contact the computer manufacturer.
<br />
<br />
To perform a clean installation of Windows Vista by starting the computer from the Windows Vista DVD, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Start the computer. </li><li>Insert the Windows Vista DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray.
</li><li>Restart the computer. </li><li>When you receive the "Press any key to boot from CD" message, press a key. </li><li>Follow the instructions to install Windows Vista. </li></ol>
If Windows Vista is now running on your computer, you have completed the installation successfully. Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day!<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Type Cover not working. Any help is greatly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> capt hornblower  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Type Cover not working. Any help is greatly appreciated&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am having trouble with my Surface Pro 3 Type cover. I have searched and spent that last day trying to figure out what is going on. It will only work when I do a 2 button restart. I was even able to restart the Surface Pro 3 after and it still worked.
 However, when I close the Type Cover and it goes to sleep, the cover no longer work, at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the drivers in Device Manager before it stopped working and I saw the Surface Type cover driver there under Keyboards, along with HID Keyboard. When I closed it up, put it to sleep and start it back up, the Type Cover doesn't work and the Surface
 Type Cover driver disappears from the Device Manager. It is only left with two entries for HID Keyboard under Keyboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all of the troubleshooting that I can find via Google, but I cannot figure this out, at all, and I am becoming very disappointed. So, I thought I would ask here to try and find some help and a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance for any and all responses, suggestions and help. I really, really appreciate it!</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply. I have not tried that, but i will. It's just unfortunate that this is happening. I mean, i know the device is a few years old, but there should be no reason why the TypeCover would just stop working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure about the battery drain, but my issues certainly leans towards a software/driver issue. I can see the Surface Type Cover driver when it is working (after the two button restart), but soon as I close the Type Cover, the driver disappears and
 the Type Cover stops working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very frustrating, to say the very least.</p>

 should i delete one account (and use a completely new email address for work contacts)? Thanks for any help.

 have these issues w/bad updates as i looked online by googling it and i have never really had issues with updates until i upgraded to windows 10..please help asap cause i have read im not the only one having these kind of issues..thanks</span>

            <p>It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>

</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>

            <p>The error you are experiencing is an UNEXPECTED_STORE_EXCEPTION (Bugcheck 154).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may be a&nbsp;hardware issue and&nbsp;seems to be related to&nbsp;Fast Startup as each blue screen error is preceded by the following error (from the Event Viewer):</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows failed fast startup with error status 0xC0000001.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also the following error which may further indicate a hardware issue that may be particular to Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The system watchdog timer was triggered.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be able to work around these issues by disabling Fast Startup and, if necessary,&nbsp;hibernation as suggested in the following topic:</p>

            <p>i think i fixed it as i checked for driver updates via online on hardware manager and found a update for bluetooth as it updated it and then i shut it down without fast boot at first and no error and then checked fast boot and no error code after 4 shut
 downs and turn ons but will monitor it to see if it happens again.. *knock on wood* :)</p>

<h2>            Gaming Computer, I Need To Turn Off Unnecesary Programs.</h2>
                    <p>I have a gaming computer with Windows 10 installed.</p>
<p>When playing video games the games online, and offline&nbsp;keep shuttering, and hanging up, some times crash.</p>
<p>I have been told by the games support to turn off all unnecessary programs, including&nbsp;unnecessary operating system programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the system resources from the task manager&nbsp;with the computer sitting idle.</p>
<p>The OS alone&nbsp;is using 2.7GB of memory and 30% of the CPU. This is a huge problem for a gaming PC, and is most likely the cause of the game performance issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is: I don't know what OS programs are not necessary.</p>
<p>I have turned off all the unnecessary user&nbsp;programs, but the games still shutter and hang up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have noticed the Cortana is a huge recourse hog. I shut it down, and it turns its self back on.</p>
<p>I really wish I could uninstall it, its totally worthless to me.</p>
<p>I ask it a question and it takes me to Bing with no results, I can go to Bing on my own I don't need a resource hog of a program to do that for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now Cortana is using 1.2GB of memory, 21% CPU, 112 MB of Hard Disk, and between 1.0 and&nbsp;2.6 Mbps of my Internet.</p>
<p>I'm not using Cortana so why is it using all these resources?</p>
<p>How do I totally disable Cortana for good, or uninstall it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was using Windows 7, I didn't have a single issue playing Video games on my gaming PC&nbsp;.
</p>
<p>When the PC was idle it wasn't using hardly any resources. CPU was between 0% and 2%, Memory was between 0 and 2MB, the hard drive was 0%</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought Windows 10&nbsp;is supposed to be an upgrade. No offence, but to me&nbsp;Windows 10&nbsp;a downgrade.</p>
<p>I am trying everything I can to make it work for me, but so far can't get it to cooperate with me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can some please give me a list of all&nbsp;unnecessary Windows 10 programs that I can shut down, so they do not come back on until I turn them back on</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You In Advance.</p>
<p>Have A Great Day!</p>

            completed method 1 with no issues found. If I am playing a game, it freezes up and uses so much ram. I can't play a game for more than 10 mins without have to close the browser because it freezes or I have to open task manager to close it because it has
 frozen. I have the same question as the original poster about the second method. A&nbsp; response would be nice please. Thanks

    <title>Xbox One Controller keeps losing sync - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lloydizle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Controller keeps losing sync</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a problem and I am hoping its software related.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently my Xbox one controller keeps losing sync then resyncs again. But it happens every 30 seconds to a minute making it impossible to play it wirelessly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spoke to someone on Xbox live chat who (which was a 2 hour long conversation cause he kept taking 10 minutes to reply!) And he told me that I had to hard reset, then changed his mind and told me to send my console of for repairs &nbsp;</p>
<p>Heres my problem:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time I sent of a device to Microsoft it took 2 months to get it back because they lost my package and did not bother to notify me that it was lost! I had to call/email them every day to get a response from them! I really don't wanna go through that
 again!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Secondly, he told me about some advance exchange programme where they will "hold" a
<strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity] </strong>ton of money on my credit card (which I don't even have cause I use debit) which ain't even in my bank account which is ridicilous! Why do they have told "hold" my money?! Its ridiculous!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is this a software issue or do I have no choice but to send this off for repairs?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is software, is there a fix?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have ran through ALL the troubleshooting steps for this that found on the Xbox website BTW. And I tried it on 3 controllers (one of them is brand new and updated).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Same issue here, and I'm not sending my console back as this is apparently a widely known issue since September (coincidentally circa the Sept update). &nbsp;</p>
<p>Issue occurs with multiple controllers, and the suggestions to play with the controller connected via usb are, IMO, not a solution.</p>

<h3> jeb harmen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one  Controller makes really loud noise when the rumble is active.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there.</p>
<p>I was just wondering if this was a common issue, I have a titan fall controller, and a standard black one.</p>
<p>The TF started making the noise first. I know its not coming from the impulse triggers, and it sounds almost like the motor for the rumble feature has come loose.</p>
<p>I have not dropped either of them, and now the black one has started to show the same symptoms.</p>
<p>More then likely I will contact support for a replacement, as I did for the TF one. but it would be great if this problem could be fixed.</p>
<p>Also I know this is off topic for this thread, but dose anyone know how to receive a invite for the Xbox one beta program, I would enjoy being able to give feedback on testing software.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<h3> redphoenix hd  say:</h3>
<h2>            No 32-bit apps can access internet - 64-bit apps can</h2>
                    
<p>I am asking this here simply because I'm sure this is more of a network stack issue than an actual MSIE etc issue. As of about a week ago nothing in the 32-bit realm can access the internet ...<strong>MSIE 32, Safari, FireFox, Chrome, Messenger, Skype, etc
 etc etc ... nada</strong>.<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The MSIE 64 browser works fine</span>. The 32 bit apps say they can not connect to any servers.</p>
<p>The OS is Windows 7 Home Premium 64</p>
<ul>
<li>I ran the <strong>netsh winsock reset</strong> command and it said it was successful ... didn't fix the issue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>I ran the <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command and it said there were no issues or discrepencies found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </li><li>I checked the firewall settings and all the 32 bit apps are set to <strong>allow</strong>, just like the 64 bit apps are.</li></ul>
<p>So far nothing I've tried has resulted in the 32 bit applications being able to access the internet.</p>
<p>Is there a separate 32 bit network stack that could be affected, that doesn't affect the 64 bit apps?</p>
<p>What can the network experts tell me that the MSIE experts have been unable to? I am at the point where I may need to restore my OS back to its factory default, but I really want to avoid that if possible!!</p>
<p>Thanks :-)</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</div>
<div>2. Are you using proxy server to access the internet?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>If you are using a wired internet connection please check whether you face the same issue while working in the safe mode with networking.<br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently&nbsp; tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows&nbsp;7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode with Networking.<br />
e. When Windows starts, use Internet explorer and check if the issue still persists.</div>
<div>For additonal information refer to the articles below.</div>
<div><strong>Start your computer in safe mode</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></div>

&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue does not exist in Safe Mode perform Clean Boot troubleshooting to find the root cause of&nbsp;the issue.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div><strong>If you are using the proxy server to access the internet you can refer to the steps below.</strong></div>
<div>This is a problem that occurs when 32-bit Internet Explorer browsers run on 64-bit operating systems.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Important: <br />
Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,

<div>To work around this issue, copy the proxy settings from the 64-bit registry location to the 32-bit registry location. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
a. Open Registry Editor. <br />
b. Locate and then right-click the following registry subkey: <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings <br />
c. Select Export . <br />
d. Save the file to the desktop as InternetSettings.reg . <br />
e. Exit Registry Editor. <br />
f. Use Notepad to edit the InternetSettings.reg file. <br />
g. Click Edit , and then select Replace . <br />
h. In Find what , type the following: <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings <br />
i. In Replace with , type the following: <br />

j. Run the script. <br />
k. Make sure that you grant all users (everyone) the Set Value permissions for the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\Connections</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Check with System maker's&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and their forums<br />
(if any) for known issues. Some maker's have issued BIOS and other updates to help with battery<br />
problems.<br />

Other information that might help :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Power Options - Power Plans - Change plan Settings - check the Advanced<br />
Settings for drain and usage settings (this is how much to be used and not how much or how<br />
long to charge).</p>
<p>Actually what causes a lot of wear on a battery is draining it too low repeatedly. With today's<br />
systems over-charging is not an issue.<br />
<br />
Here are some tips to help and troubleshoot battery related issues.</p>
<p>Old battery? Unplug power to computer - remove battery and clean the contacts with a pencil<br />
eraser (do not use this if your battery has thin slots -&nbsp;just clean the knife edges that fit into<br />
them and be careful). Batteries do wear out if old, or it could be a problem with the computer.<br />
Check with the support of the system maker and many of them&nbsp;have on-line forums.<br />
<br />
Newer type Litium-Ion batteries usually last longer if you do not discharge them below 30%<br />
however on a laptop that will not extend their life that much. Best is to use A/C adapter<br />
whenever possible.<br />
<br />
I use the free version of BatteryBar to monitor my battery. Click the Green button on the<br />
Yellow box on right side of page to download latest stable version.<br />

    <title>backslash not working on a german keyboard in the Open&#47;save dialog - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomas.menzel  say:</h3>
<h2>            backslash not working on a german keyboard in the Open&#47;save dialog when default keyboard layout is US but application has been switched to DE</h2>
                    <p>alright here comes a bug report that is bothering me already quite a wile. it goes like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i live in germany but since i'm a programmer and power user my UI language is set to english and and my default keyboard layout is EN (US).</p>
<p>for writing german texts i switch to the DE layout - so far so good and all works fine, i.e. all keys work as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>but always when i open the <strong>standard win7 open or safe dialog</strong> from
<strong>any application</strong> switched to DE, i cant type the backspace which is on a german layout "Alt Gr+ß" (right ALT + the key to he right of the 0 on an US keyboard). so i always have to switch back to EN in order to type a "\" - very annoying!!! plz
 fix it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>this happens on any win7 version that i have used thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>more hints:</p>
<ul>
<li>none of the chars that are supposed to be typed in combonation work with ALT GR</li><li>ALT GR is internally also mapped as ALT+CTRL, when i use this combo with the key, e.g. LEFT ALT + CTRL + ß then i will get the letter.
</li><li>i can type the \ when i do these steps:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>the app is in EN</li><li>i open the dialog </li><li>i switch to DE</li><li>-&gt; then i can type the \ with ALT GR+ß</li></ol>
<p>my guess is: <br />
when dialog is opened the keyboard layout is not properly passed along -- although the other special chars that dont need the ALT GR work. i bet the developers in US just didnt know about "alt gr" that some non-US keyboard have to type special chars.<br />

                    <p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
I have an Acer Aspire v3-471G running windows 7 Ultimate, everything was good and suddenly one day I hardly can connect to wireless network. The wifi logo stays the yellow star even if I've connected to internet. Sometimes if I reboot, than it'll change the
 logo to normal (the white bar logo). But it didn't stay that way, reboot again than stays at yellow star.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">
Another issue is that the connection is slow, very very very slow. My internet speed is 2mbps. The connection isn't constant and always get limited access error or disconnected. I tried to reinstall the wireless lan driver but it didn't work. Please help!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>If you are actually getting a wireless connection, but slow speed, there is likely nothing wrong with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried connecting using an Ethernet cable directly to your modem or router?&nbsp; If that works much better, then there is a wireless connectivity problem.&nbsp; In that case, try moving your computer much closer to the wireless router/modem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If connecting directly by cable makes no difference, you need to speak with your Internet Service Provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chances are, the first thing they will ask you to do is to reboot your modem, and if you have a separate wireless router device as well.&nbsp; To do that:</p>
<ol>
<li>disconnect power from both modem and router</li><li>wait 30 seconds</li><li>provide power to the modem (only the modem if this is NOT a combined device)</li><li>wait 2 minutes</li><li>provide poser to the router if it is separate</li><li>wait 2 minutes</li><li>Try the connection again.</li></ol>

            <p>Sorry, &nbsp;false alarm. I guess. After releasing my inner geek, i found out that one of the wire that's suppose to connect to the wireless module on my laptop didn't connect. It looks like this..</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd3ec42c-d8c4-458c-88c7-d4a298700f64" /><br />
Maybe the wire disconnected when I accidently dropped my laptop or something like that.</p>
<p>By the way, thanks for the help. Love U Microsoft, can't wait for windows 10.</p>

<p>I am not able to select my Microsoft account balance (I have $20) to make the transaction. The only options allowed to me are to add a card/Paypal. After I added one, I still could not switch the payment option. I can't switch to my balance at all with any
 game purchase attempt.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot:&nbsp;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6040452/Public%20Images/nomsp.png</p>
<p>I am able to make purchases with Paypal (just purchased Tales of Vesperia). I want to use my balance though, as it expires in 2015. Never had a problem before back when MSP was still around.</p>

<p>If you try to make the purchases via the console, you should see the MSA as a valid payment option.</p>
<p>The website has not yet been updated since the transition to be compatible with the currency in the MSA. For now, it only works with PayPal and credit cards.</p>

<p>Thank &nbsp;you, Maxen. I wasn't aware that the website has not been updated to use the account balance yet. The option to purchase with account balance showed up when I attempted to purchase via the console. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm one of the few people left with an old Xbox 360 that doesn't have wireless (never bought the receiver). I usually avoid moving my Xbox upstairs where our router is unless I want to download several games, want to update the system, etc.</p>

            Microsoft will NEVER call you or email you that you have issues. This is a SCAM. See <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-privacy/avoid-phone-scams.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/safety/online-p...</a> - please read this all the way through.
<br />
<br />Sadly, there are nasties out there -- I would block the caller from caller ID and delete the email 
<br />
<br />If you opened the "error report", sadly it might have a trojan or malware. Please run a thorough scan with Windows Defender immediately if you opened the attachment. 
<br />
<br />I get calls like this frequently. They are all offshore and outside the scope of US law enforcement. Bad situation.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance.
