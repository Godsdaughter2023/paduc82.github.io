    <title>windows update disabled driver for Behringer UMC202HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregcartertoday  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows update disabled driver for Behringer UMC202HD</h2>
                    <p>I just ran the windows update on 9/15/17. After that my audio recording IO device stopped working. It is a Behringer UMC202HD and is a USB device. I went to the device manager and find it there. It says it has the current driver. But just to be sure, I uninstalled
 it and reinstalled it. When I go to settings --&gt;Devices, I see the USB device listed, but it says 'Driver is unavailable'. And this IO device no longer shows up as an input in my audio recording software. What should I do?</p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern with your audio device can be due to the changes to the configuration of your computer. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If other USB devices still works on your device. </li><li>If you've already tried connecting the device to another USB port of your computer.</li><li>If you've tried other audio devices such as a headset or headphone on your computer.
</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend running the Windows troubleshooter to find and fix sound problems on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. The drop-down menu in the link also provides additional items to consider when troubleshooting audio problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response. Here are the answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If other USB devices still works on your device. - Yes, USB is working fine. I can use any other device including USB storage</li><li>If you've already tried connecting the device to another USB port of your computer. - yes, I have tried all the USB ports.&nbsp;</li><li>If you've tried other audio devices such as a headset or headphone on your computer. - yes, I have speakers and headsets working</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. - Windows 10, version 1703 (OS Build 15063.608)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>But again, it seems to be more an issue with Windows recognizing the installed driver. When I go to device manager, the driver seems to be installed. When I click update driver it correctly reports that I have the newest
 version. But when I go to settings - Devices, the USB device (UMC202HD) is listed but it says that the driver is unavailable</span></p>

<p>I ran the troubleshooter with the instructions you provided. the first step of the troubleshooter was to ask me which audio device. It did not list the UMC202HD as an option. It only found my speakers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I think it is important to point out that the UMC202HD is not an audio output device like speakers. It is an audio INPUT device. I plug microphones and musical instruments into the UMC202HD and it translates their analog signals into a digital stream
 which is fed into the computer via the USB port and then handled by the driver. Is there a different troubleshooter I should run to deal with issues on an input device?</p>

<p>Based on the details presented above, we'd recommend checking directly to the manufacturer's website to check and/or download the latest drivers for the specified device. To determine if you have the latest driver version, you can compare the information
 posted on your device and on the website. You can perform the following to check the driver version of the specified device:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and launch Device Manager using Cortana.</li><li>Locate your device and right-click on it.</li><li>Select Properties and click on the Driver tab.</li><li>Locate Driver Version.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes after you've performed the steps.</p>

<p>I already checked to see if it was the right version of the driver. And just to make sure, I have uninstalled the driver from device manager and then re-installed the latest version. It still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind, I just bought this device a few weeks ago. It was working fine on my computer for the first two weeks. It only stopped working after the windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also installed the device driver on my laptop and it works fine from their with the same driver. It just doesn't work on my desk top anymore.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We appreciate the information that you've shared. We'd like to check if the laptop that you've used is running on the same version and build of Windows 10. This will help us understand if one of the components added in the update that was installed on your
 desktop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend isolating issues that can be caused by the USB root hub. The USB root hub is the software driver that lets you connect multiple USB devices on your computer. To do this, you can perform the following:</p>
<p>1) Open Device Manager. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.</p>
<p>2) Right-click USB Root Hub option and click Properties.</p>
<p>3) Go to Power Management tab and uncheck the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power. Click OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have more USB Root Hubs, you need to repeat this operation a couple of times. Please remember to click OK after each performance. After completing the steps, plug your USB device back in to see if your computer is able to recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your USB device is still not working after this, please check the Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power back on and refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>1. In the Search box, type Device Manager and press Enter.</p>
<p>2. Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.Note: You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</p>
<p>3. Right-click the first USB controller under Universal Serial Bus controllers, and then click Uninstall to remove it.</p>
<p>4. Repeat step 3 for each USB controller that is listed under Universal Serial Bus controllers.</p>
<p>5. Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</p>
<p>6. Check the USB device to see whether it is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Uninstalling and reinstalling the USB controllers will revert their configuration back to default.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to an update after you've performed the steps.</p>

<p>Hi Derek,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have just recently updated your computer to version 1709, there is a possibility that the device driver is still not yet updated and incompatible with the new update. This can happen when there is a delay in the release of updated drivers from
 the device manufacturers. For us to provide better assistance, we would like to ask for more details.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the current build of your Windows 10 version 1709 computer?&nbsp;</li><li>Were you able to check for pending driver update?</li><li>Have you tried checking the manufacturer's website if they have already released a compatible driver for the fall update?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon. </p>

<p>Hi <strong>Adamczek</strong>,</p>
<p>1. With which device are you trying to pair this bluetooth headset(is it with phone or computer)?<br />
2. Are you facing any issue in pairing this bluetooth headset with the device?<br />
3. Are you receiving any error message?<br />
4. Are you getting any prompt to install the drivers for the headset?</p>
<p>As we checked with the manufacturer’s website we could not find any drivers for the headset.</p>
<p><strong>But if you wish to troubleshoot the issue you are facing with bluetooth headset, then you may visit this below link.</strong></p>

<p><span><strong>Note: From the manufacturer's website, it is clear that the bluetooth&nbsp;headset is only paired with phone but not with computer.</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update failing daily, but update history doesn&#39;t show it</h2>
                    <p>For the last week or so my Windows 10 PC has been trying, and apparently failing, to install some update. After it reboots and a bit of time goes by a popup appears in the lower right corner saying something like "Update failed to install. Click here for
 more information." When I click on the popup I'm taken to the Settings - Windows Update page, and clicking on Advanced and then Show History provides me with the attached info.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0244209c-b948-4f82-bf7e-e8593b6630cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0244209c-b948-4f82-bf7e-e8593b6630cd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm being told an update is failing, but the history only shows everything as being OK?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find out what update is failing, and/or how can I prevent these daily update/fail/reboot cycles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>i gamefly'd this game because i was tired of black ops and figured i needed something different. i got a little into it and then i got owned by some spiders a couple times in a row so i looked to the net for a cure and
 found out that you can glitch for free xp and lvl up. so i rolled back the update and did it.(i know im a bad person but i just wanted to go through the story) my thing is i didn't or would never want to cheat on live i just figured this is a non live game
 and wanted to see the story and send it back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>then i got an achievement... then i thought oh crap...&nbsp;<span>
</span>now im cheating online-err offline but now i can't ever go online. i never meant to rob anyone of their status or bragging rights but now i'm screwed. devs have mercy on me please because i didn't mean to get offline GS by cheating. i just wanted to
 make this game a thing i went through and had a little fun with. seriously take my GS back... this game is ok gut i don't want to be labeled a cheater... i don't boost GS... i just thought it was harmless to LVL in this game until i saw the GS award. i'm sorry.</p>

<p>To soothe your guilty conscience:</p>
<p>1. Install the latest update.</p>
<p>2. Learn how to use "Tactics".</p>
<p>3. Set the difficulty to "Casual".</p>
<p>4. Play the game without exploiting "glitches".</p>
<p>You'll breeze through the game and your character won't have to do anything if you set up your team's tactics properly.</p>

<p>lol it won't matter. Real infractions from gamerscore cheating comes from obtaining online/multiplayer only achievements offline through use of third party software and game saves. For the most part, you're fine.</p>

<h2>            Key purchased through Windows Anytime Upgrade won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Just bought a Win7 Ultimate upgrade key through Windows Anytime Upgrade, but am receiving a message that the key provided will not work with Windows Anytime Upgrade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it's of any use, I'm upgrading from OEM&nbsp;Win7 Professional which I had purchased from an Australian retailer together with my new computer system, and had&nbsp;activated successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the MS support site also refuses to accept either of the keys, saying that they are not for this country.</p>

    <title>WIndows 10 Screen Timeout and Screen Saver issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mscheuerman1948  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 Screen Timeout and Screen Saver issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell 8700 Desktop with two monitors and recently upgraded to Windows 10 and now the Screen Timeout and Screensaver don't work.&nbsp; I've searched to community boards and every website I can find to see if there's a solution or if it's just a bug in
 a new O/S.&nbsp; I've tried everything suggested by this forum (SFC scan, driver updates, power plan troubleshooter, etc.) and nothing seems to work with my regular admin account.&nbsp; I have a second admin account, and when I login with that account&nbsp;everything&nbsp;works
 just fine&nbsp;(which would&nbsp;seem to rule out hardware).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem didn't occur with Win 7 or 8 so I suspect that there is something unique to the way WIn10 determines if the system is inactive enough to turn off the screen or activate the screen saver.&nbsp; Any help or advice is welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIA&nbsp; - Mike</p>

            Thanks again for the help.&nbsp; I did run the troubleshooting app and it found no problems.&nbsp; The issue seems to have been resolved, although I'm not sure why.&nbsp; The screen timeout has been working for several days now, so either one of the Windows updates fixed
 the problem or it's still hiding waiting to manifest itself later.&nbsp;

<h2>            Safe to remove hardware message only shows in Windows 10 after second click</h2>
                    <p>More on the Safe to remove message issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click 'Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media' it always results in a window with "Problem Ejecting USB Mass Storage Device" blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Disregard that and&nbsp;click 'Safely Remove Hardware and Eject Media' again and the Safe to Remove Hardware notification appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is consistent behavior; it always happens whether or not the device was in use. It isn't sometimes, it is every single time, whatever the device and regardless of it actually being in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps &nbsp;others could check to see if it is common to all WinX systems.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. Is the issue specific to a particular media device?</p>
<p>2. Did you try connecting the device to a different USB port?</p>
<p>3. Do you receive the "&nbsp;Safe to Remove Hardware" popup in the second attempt?</p>
<p>4. Did the issue occur recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This behavior can occur there are open handles with any files in the USB Mass Storage Device are in use by another program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type control and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Type troubleshooting in the control panel search box.</p>
<p>4. Click "view all" on the left pane.</p>
<p>5. Run the hardware and devices troubleshooter and follow the on-screen instructions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update USB drivers</strong></p>
<p>In order to identify if this is a driver related issue, I would suggest you to try updating the USB drivers in device manager and check again.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type devmgmt.msc and press enter to open device manager.</p>
<p>3. Expand Universal Serial Bus Controllers.</p>
<p>4. Check if there are any drivers with a yellow exclamation mark.</p>
<p>5. If so, right click and update the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, uninstall the USB drivers and restart the compute and have Windows automatically install the latest drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

<p><em>To better assist you, please answer the following questions:</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>1. Is the issue specific to a particular media device?</em></p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I only have memory sticks, a floppy reader and a camera, and it is the same for all of them. Also I have SD cards; these do not appear in the 'Safely Remove ...' list.</p>
<p><em>2. Did you try connecting the device to a different USB port?</em></p>
<p>&gt;&gt; I just have 3 free ports and it is the same whichever I use.</p>
<p><em>3. Do you receive the "&nbsp;Safe to Remove Hardware" popup in the second attempt?</em></p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Always at the second attempt, never at the first.</p>
<p><em>4. Did the issue occur recently?</em></p>
<p>&gt;&gt; It has always been like this since Win7 to WinX upgrade. It is totally repeatable with any device and any USB port.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</em><br />
<em><strong>Method 1: Hardware and devices troubleshooter</strong></em><br />
&gt;&gt; No problems shown, but insisted that I restart Windows. Did that and nothing has changed.</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: Update USB drivers</em></strong><br />
&gt;&gt; No alert icon on any device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you saying that I have a unique problem? &nbsp;Does your own PC behave in the way I have described?<br />

            <p>Hi Saeid,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer these questions to assist you better. </p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you get any error message?</li><li>Which troubleshooter are you referring to?</li><li>Are you able to access to internet in browser and other application?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step I suggest you to install all pending Windows updates in your PC and check if you are able to use Windows Store. If the issue still persists follow next Methods.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method</span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong><strong><span>1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure that the date and time are correct on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a)&nbsp; Check the setting for Date/Time by choosing the Desktop tile and then left click on the date/time in the corner.</span></p>
<p><span>b)&nbsp; Click on change date and time settings. And then verify the time zone is correct as well as the internet time tab has the option to Synchronize with Internet time server.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: Run the Windows App Troubleshooter.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to run the Windows app troubleshooter, which fixes common issues related to modern Apps on Windows 10 and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>I'm having the same difficulty. Everything was working yesterday. I left my computer on in sleep mode all night, when I awoke the Calculator Microsoft Corporation icon was invisible in my taskbar. There was a space between two other apps where it used to
 be. Clicking the invisible icon made the page blink, then nothing.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Unable to access Windows Store via Edge or Chrome. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to get to Windows Store via Google search but apps would not download.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dates, time, and time zones are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am set up for automatic updates - all updates are current.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooter for Windows apps found no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No changes have been made to system since upgrade to Win 10 two weeks ago, other than to turn off remote access.</p>

            Booting into Safe Mode, then emptying the %temp% folder will probably clear the error condition.

                    <p>Hello! One of my older laptops has a key that stopped working, and now I can't log into it. I used my phone to change my Microsoft password, but when I try to log in again on the old laptop, it just tells me 'Your device is offline. Please sign in with the
 last password used on this device.' How do I get around this? I used the pin option before to log in to the old laptop, but can't find anywhere on my other devices how to get access to it to change it [becauseI forgot it]. Please help!</p>

<p>Hello! My laptop is set to automatically connect to my WiFi. I had checked it before &nbsp;and it connected. I hadn't made any changes prior to when this issue started; when that laptop isn't in use for more than a day or so, it asks for the login information,
 but I was able to input the correct info before. I had checked several times on my other devices that my password is the correct one, yet it still doesn't work on the old laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will check again if my internet connection is the issue, and also click on the link for 'when you can't sign in to your Microsoft account.'</p>
<p>

<h2>            Modder on GTA IV</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Over the course of a month I have been followed by one player who uses, hacks, cheats &amp; mods to ruin my experience on Xbox Live.</p>
<p>If any of you are familiar with what the hacks &amp; cheats are like on GTA IV, you'll know my frustration; the player always freezes my games, teleports to me to kill me repeatedly, sets me on fire.</p>
<p>No matter what game mode I am in, or if Im appearing offline the player will get to me and do the things above. Either until I leave or my Xbox is frozen.</p>
<p>Tonight I have recorded that player doing the following; teleporting to me and killing me, then teleporting to me as I spawn again. Setting me on fire without molitovs and causing explosions without explosive weapons.</p>
<p>Xbox Chat Support have pointed me here, I want to know what they can do with this player and the rest of the modders on GTA IV?</p>

<p>Good suggestion by my fellow Ambassador "Daft Badger".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, Microsoft is not responsible for the GTA IV Servers/M<span>aintenance for that game.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Like Daft Badger already said, you can always File-Compaint players you suspect they are violating the
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Code of Conduct</a>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note that for every game you play the Xbox Code of Conduct AND
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/livetou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Live Terms of Use</a>&nbsp;is active, even it's not a game that's developed by Microsoft or published by Microsoft.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you want to take more actions than only File-Complainting, I suggest to
<a href="http://support.rockstargames.com/entries/479492-rockstar-games-technical-support-contact-info" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Contact Rockstar</a> about this "Known"issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Rockstar is responsible for that game and GTA IV is still a supported game, so you can try to get in touch with one of Rockstar's Support Engineers and perhaps they can help you to reduce the amount of players that
 are violating the <a href="http://www.rockstargames.com/legal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
GTA IV</a> and Xbox Code of Conduct.</span></span></p>

<p>@adoorable door - yeah its only GTA IV, the modder cant get into private games of course, unless theyre given an invite. But, private games are no fun as you can imagine so I dont venture into them often.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">I understand exactly what you are saying and the ONLY way to get any action taken against any modders/cheaters on XBL from MS is to use the FILE A COMPLAINT system. If you want to band aid the problem that is what you do. If you
 want the problem to actually go away you need to contact the GAME DEVELOPERS and get them to write up a patch for their game.
<br />
<br />
<br />
As an Ambassador you should already know this information, no one here should have to explain it to you. Also it is very common knowledge that Support isn't the most reliable resource in MS, they tend to give misinformation in regards to reporting offenders.
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you knew exactly what you were doin you would be over at the GAME DEVELOPERS website on their forum complaining about this issue...</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Same thing here! Many, Many, people are encountering this error/bug! My computer was working fine then after this update its been 5 days of frustration and just hell where my computer is completely inoperable. First I could not click on the start menu to
 open the start menu and then I noticed Cortana and my taskbar were inoperable (where I couldn't click on or open anything in my taskbar) then I discovered I couldn't even use the Windows key on my keyboard to open the start menu. Finally I was able to find
 out I could not open ANY settings or even get to my Settings by using any method!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install, deleted Everything and formatted my Samsung 950 Pro NVMe</p>
<p>M.2 SSD over 4 times; and same issues! And the formatting and deleting has seriously decreased the lifespan of this very expensive hard drive... Yet Nothing has been fixed or repaired and the Fresh Start or "Repair" Install advice is utterly useless..! Now
 I just can't continue wasting any more time or mental health trying to get windows to work right. Microsoft OWES its customer a fix or an actual Patch or hotfix... not these useless DIY ne'er-do-wells posting "tips"or things to try when they can barely read
 English! In other threads Microsoft "representatives" are telling people with this same problem to open their settings using the Start Menu that people are complaining is broken and they can't get to, to&nbsp;<span><em><strong>begin with</strong></em></span>..!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid over a Hundred dollars for Microsoft Windows 10 Home Edition from Walmart when I built this computer last year. And the least I could expect was for it to work and to be able to use my computer! Some people are recommending Linux as a better OS and
 I can see why now! This Windows 10 OS is the worst ever and Microsoft doesn't give a dam% about their customers or actually fixing the problems and havoc THEIR updates have caused!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Luckily from my signature/info on a PC Builders forum I had listed my system information and was able to find my Windows Build information from January 1, 2017 right before the trouble started... (Windows 10 64-Bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home Version 1709 OS Build 16299.1922</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody should open a class action lawsuit against Microsoft for all the problems they have created in peoples lives; with no concern whatsoever on how their "Automatic"/mandatory, forced, horrible/hurried/hair brained, rushed out, untested, updates have
 affected peoples lives and livelihoods. If Microsoft is going to force everyone to receive their "Automatic" updates they should at least TEST them THOROUGHLY and MAKE SURE they won't harm people's computers or hurt their businesses or interrupt our lives
 and livelihoods. Even Forbes business magazine is reporting this latest update as a Microsoft disaster!</p>

<h2>            Reset default printer after each print job.</h2>
                    I would like my printer to reset to the default printer after each print job.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;a Hp LaserJet 1020 on my desk, set as my default.&nbsp; Sometimes though, I print to our colour printer etc.&nbsp; Then when I go to print again immediately after the colour print
 job - it goes there (and not my default).&nbsp; I looked under printer properties, devices, etc. - but don't see where I could update this?&nbsp; Can you let me know.&nbsp; Thanks.

<p>You do not tell how you make this decision to change printers. I have two printers, HP4135 all-in-one&nbsp;(default), and HP6122 duplexer.</p>
<p>Example: From within MS Office Word 2007 the default would always print. But I can select a printer to use. With that selection, as long as I stay within that project, the HP6122 could be used. It would default back to the HP4135 if I closed the project.</p>
<p>If you go: Start, Control Panel, Printers you'll see all the printers. The default has a Green check mark. Right click on a<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">different printer</span> and a menu drops down with an added feature "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Set
 as default printer</span>".</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 can&#39;t reboot, can&#39;t reset, can&#39;t restore previous points</h2>
                    <p>I need help recovering my files and also I already tried all of the troubleshooting option that was available in the recovery mode and still I can't boot my OS. Is it possible for me to recover those files and also would it be possible for me to recover
 the Windows key that I have because it was legit and buying another one is expensive. Is there anyway that I can boot my pc without the Disc because we just downloaded the OS and applied the cd key.</p>

<p>How many times do you need to post same question in 10 minutes?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>do a clean install, you do not need the key, the digital license is tied to your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>but first, did you upgrade to 10 from previous OS and was that previous OS from a PC that was an OEM install and not a retail install???</p>
