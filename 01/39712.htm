<h2>            NBA 2K15 will not download&#33;&#33;&#33; Extremely angry&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So I've been searching for a hard copy of NBA 2K15 for Xbox 360, but could not find one. So I decided to purchase a digital copy from the xbox game marketplace. When I try to install the game, the download stops and says "Device Full", or "Can't Download
 2K15." I know that it is not a problem with the amount of memory I have available, as the game is 7.73 GB and my USB has 13.8 GB of free space. I've been trying to get this game to download for over two days. I'm extremely upset with Microsoft for this random
 unknown problem. If anyone can help I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Similar issue:</p>
<p>I have a gold membership, and I tried to "buy" Gears of War 3 (Xbox 360) as it is the GwG of the month, in the hope it will be backward-compatible one day on my Xbox One. I had done the same in the past for Thief and Plants Vs. Zombies successfully, by simply
 "buying" them for free on the website. However, this seems not to be possible with Gears of War 3. If I try to click on "download" or "buy" in the following page:</p>
<p><a href="http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-GB/Product/Gears-of-War-3/66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024d5308ab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">marketplace.xbox.com/.../66acd000-77fe-1000-9115-d8024d5308ab</a></p>
<p>I get a pop-up asking: "Sorry, Is this your first purchase? To ensure it is compatible, please sign in to Xbox Live using your console and try again."</p>
<p>No, I do not have an Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Yes, I have my payment details added, and in fact I can buy other games or even add-ons with the same procedure. Only GoW3 seems blocked. I bought Thief and Plants vs. Zombies when they were GwG.</p>
<p>I have contacted support and after several trials, they gave up, and thought that it is a decision of the publisher to make this game downloadable only from a console and not online.</p>
<p>I think it will be good if this kind of stuff won't happen, given the backward compatibility we have now on Xbox One.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>Just to add some more info, I have another friend who did the same procedure of "buying" Gears of War 3 through the xboxlive site, doing exactly the same thing I'm trying to do and he managed to "buy" the game with no problem. So it's not a publisher decision,
 there is some kind of problem with certain accounts. Please solve this, I want this game.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Its easy to solve actually</p>
<p>You just have to follow the instructions listed in the error</p>
<p>First if you never owned an xbox 360 thats why you are getting that error as it did mention is this your firdt 360 purchase</p>
<p>2Nd its only a ome time check</p>
<p>If your friend signed in on an 360 with his account before thats why he was able to get it</p>
<p>First gears of war amoung other games like destiny or darksiders are region locked account region
</p>
<p>Actual region</p>
<p>Console region has to match thats why you are getting the error</p>
<p>Because you havent used an xbox 360 on your account it cannot check if your console is compatible</p>
<p>In order to download the game you must first sign in on either your own or your friends or a rented xbox and make one purchase to regiater the console type</p>
<p>Basically its looking for ntsc or pal </p>
<p>Once that is done the first purchase check goea away </p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>For me it's not my first 360 purchase, as I "bought" the Plants vs Zombies that was available for xbox 360 on games with gold even this month.</p>
<p>Additionally my friend that was able to download gears of war 3 never owned an xbox 360, he only has a xbox one and was able to download the game.</p>
<p>I'm trying to purchase in the region where my console is registered but with no success.</p>
<p>Can't think of anything else to do. Thanks</p>

<p>It does not matter you must confirm compatibility</p>
<p>Only waybto do that is having a console registered or doing itnthru the console</p>
<p>You do not need to own one you just need one to queue from</p>

<p>Eventually I downloaded the game using a friend's console. It worked. It seems that as you say, certain games require the console for downloading. The question is: will other games require the console again, or now that I have "registered" a console, I will
 be able to buy everything online? It seems the former, unfortunately: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/wave_16_1508/f/5409/t/2012293.aspx?pi7406=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>It's happening again for "Dirt showdown", same thing. This time, however, they promised that GwG will be backward compatible, so it cannot be anymore that we need an actual Xbox 360 console to finalise the purchase!</p>

            Hello Char, I’mm Be answering your question.
<br />There are two ways - one is via Ctrl + print screen button which copies the entire screen to the clipboard, then you can paste into paint or your choice of photo software, then there’s the snipping tool which will capture all or part of the screen, then save the capture &amp; it may ask where you wish to save it to.
<br />To open Snipping Tool, select the Start  button,﻿ ﻿﻿type snipping tool, and then select it in the search results.﻿
<br />To choose the type of snip you want, select Mode (or, in older versions of Windows, the arrow next to New), and then choose Free-form, Rectangular, Window, or Full-screen Snip. When making free-form or rectangular snips, use your mouse to select the area that you want to capture.
<br />To take a new screenshot using the same mode you used last, select New.
<br />Use the Save and Copy buttons at the top of the snip to save or copy it to the clipboard.

<h2>            Minecraft sync issues</h2>
                    Microsoft has known about these issues for years and has done nothing to fix or even slightly make gamers aware of the problem. I played minecraft on a survival world for an entire day and it wouldnt sync to the my xbox. Because you are forced to save
 and quit, when I tried to reload the world on the other xbox we played on, it ironically synced the save from the first time I tried to load it. It erased an entire days worth of what is work at this point. These issues existed before there was even an xbox
 one version of minecraft. They dont warn players of the dangers of using their promoted services. You can lose so much time and effort for using the xbox cloud method. This wouldnt even happen during the days of using memory cards. I have tried the hard reboot,
 uninstalling the game and reinstalling, clearing the local save drive, its all gone. This type of false promotion should be illegal. I was excited to play minecraft after the new update release but all my excitement has been repl

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about your poor experience.&nbsp; It is your choice where you play, but *always* taking small steps to make sure things are right, before moving to another console (if it's important), would be the best advice I can give, moving forward.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to find a support article on cloud saves, that will hopefully ensure that this will not happen again.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sync Outlook contacts with Skype - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> duffaringo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Outlook contacts with Skype</h2>
                    I used to use Skype Classic / Skype 7 until it stopped working a few weeks ago.&nbsp; This worked brilliantly with my Skype number because I could "speed dial" all my Outlook contacts.&nbsp; With Skype 8, I don't see any way to get my Outlook contacts to sync.&nbsp;
 This means that I have to look up a phone number on Outlook and then manually type it in manually.&nbsp; This is a massive pain.&nbsp; Also, I cannot tell who is calling me - it just displays the phone number.&nbsp; Can anyone help?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

<p>Hi Duffaringo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Skype!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, syncing of contacts from outlook to Skype 8 is not yet available. This feature is not yet incorporated on new version of Skype. The only way, you can dial the same number/s is to manually type the number from Outlook to Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Skype 7 able you to sync your outlook contacts, all incoming calls to your Skype number coming from your Outlook contacts will display the caller's info. Unlike on Skype 8, all incoming calls, you'll need to save the numbers to your contact list. That
 way, you will know who is calling your Skype number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Nothing to worry as we are working hand in hand with our Development team and Research Engineers to make this feature possibly available in the new Skype. Also, I would appreciate if you can formally submit/vote this feedback to

<p>INSANE to drop this feature- you force your biggest users to make calls like it was 1999.&nbsp; This should be fixed today not "maybe" in a future version!&nbsp; When I search my Skype directory, I can't find Theo, my employee, but I can find 29000 Theo's from around
 the world?&nbsp; Skype is not a social network, it is a tool to call my contacts.&nbsp; Fix this!!!</p>

<h2>            SkyDrive appears stuck when downloadin files and shows &#34;Downloading x items...&#34; message.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In Windows 8.1 release, when I open the SkyDrive app I see that there is a message saying "Downloading 5330 items...". Clicking on this message opens the&nbsp;"Progress" screen where it shows "Downloading (5330)" and lists thumbnails for all 5330 items it believes
 are pending download. However, every item in the list is shown as "Completed" not "Pending". I assume this means it has actually be downloaded.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If I browse through other SkyDrive folders and locate a file marked as "Available Offline", then select the file and choose "Make online-only" the file gets removed as expected. If I then re-select the file and choose "Make Offline" the download message
 changes to "Downloading 5331 items..." until the download is complete at which time the download message reverts to "Downloading 5330 items...". &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While it appears the downloads are stuck, what I suspect is actually happening is that the downloads have actually completed and that the download message and the list of downloading files on the Pending Downloads screen are wrong.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried the following with no luck:</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarting the app.</li><li>Rebooting the computer.</li><li>Running the SkyDrive Help&nbsp;Troubleshooter app.</li><li>Installing the latest Windows 8.1 updates.</li></ul>
<p>How can I confirm if these files have actually be downloaded? If they have been downloaded, how can I reset this download message since it's very confusing!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p><br />

<h3> billy b0b  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I stop Wisptis.exe from running two processes and using 3,840k and 4,464k of memory.</h2>
                    I'm running Win 7 64-bit and do not have Office. I'm surprised to find these processes running and even more surprised that this issue goes back to beyond 2004. I've seen articles dating back to 2002 where people are having trouble shutting down these
 processes. When I opened task manager I found 2 versions of this process running and have been unable to "end" them. Even following instructions from different sites I'm finding it is not as simple as the instructions imply. I am not being allowed to delete
 the file as I,...the "administrator",...do not have administrator privileges. I do have a Wacom tablet and the Photoshop version that it came with back in 2003. From what I've gathered, this program has to do with Microsoft Office and pertains to pen and touch
 abilities. I would like to stop these from running as I don't use them and they are wasting my resources. I would consider this a major flaw in Windows. And it's a ten year old issue,...with no simple resolution?

How does this pertain to Windows Update functionality?<br />
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
****************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
This is a "virus" that was installed by Microsoft updates. In the list of issues that your question pertains to,...Updates did not specify "functionality". I did not say Windows updates does not work. Windows update is how this "virus" got on my computer in
 the first place. I don't have Microsoft Office. Wisptis.exe should not be on my computer. It's like having GPS on a desktop. Constantly running in the background and using up resources. "Oh look,...according to my GPS,...I'm still at home."<br />
<br />
I not sure you checked your first link. It had nothing to do with turning wisptis off. The only mention of "wisptis" on that page is off to the side in related threads,...which brings us to your second link. I'm not sure you read that one either.<br />
<br />
MatchWhat asked the question and Fazil M basically replied with delete it. MatchWhat replies that that doesn't work because it simply restores on next boot. (I can't even delete it or end the process as I don't have administrator privileges.
<b>Even though I am the administrator.</b>)<br />
<br />
Fazil M's second suggestion is this link: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en/tabletandtouch/thread/09bccd29-7137-4dfc-aaf1-6e04df4beba7<br />
<br />
Which is a link to someone asking the same question as I am asking. Quoted here:<br />
<br />
<i>"Can anyone give me a clue as to how to permanently disable <b>wisptis.exe</b> AND its
<b>updates</b>?<br />
<br />
I&nbsp;have tried modding the registry and eventually settled on setting all permissions to DENY on
<b>wisptis.exe</b>. This stops the service from running (which is a good thing since it interferes with WACOM tablet use), but it doesn't stop MS Office from trying to
<b>update</b> it whenever <b>Microsoft Update</b> decides its time has come (and of course the installation dies sionce (sic) it can't access the file, and then restarts itself in a closed loop). Before you ask, NO, there is NO control panel or services item
 for Ink Services under Windows XP. If there was, that would make life easy.<br />
<br />
I'm really looking for a solution to stop wisptis.exe from trying to <b>update</b> and reinstall itself every time Office
<b>updates</b>. Can anyone help?"</i><br />
<br />
I highlighted the "update" and "wisptis.exe" so that you might understand why I would relate my question to
<b>updates</b> concerning this virus/resource hog. If you read any further on that link you would see that MatchWhat jumped into that conversation on March 30th, 2012. Matchwhat is still trying to resolve this issue in April with your second link.<br />
<br />
Ahhhh,...now I see where you got your first link,...James from April 8th,(completely different issue). If you followed the conversation you would see that "Billy B0B",(yours truly), ended that discussion on page 2 after larryw suggests to turn the "feature"
 off in MS Office,...which I don't have.<br />
<br />
This is a <i><b>MS update</b></i> that cant be turned off or deleted because of a lack of administrative privileges despite my being the administrator. I cannot end the process in task manager. I don't need it running and yet it uses 8,000k of memory running
 2 instances.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time spent trying to resolve this issue Pa Bear. Like I said,...I am absolutely amazed that this issue goes back to 2002 and I'm just now dealing with it for the first time in Nov./Dec. of 2012.

<p>Please elaborate: Such behavior is typically a symptom of&nbsp;a <em>real </em>infection (i.e., a Trojan, Worm&nbsp;or "hijackware" infection).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also please answer&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em>&nbsp;diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em>&nbsp;quoting this post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. <em>Assuming Win7 64-bit SP1 with&nbsp;<u>IE9</u>&nbsp;installed =&gt; </em>Are ALL of the following updates listed in

            I first sat down to a computer in 2003. I built my first computer in 2007. I replaced the motherboard in December of 2010 because of one bad capacitor. Because of that I replaced the processor, RAM, and OS. From XP to Win7 in Jan., 2011.<br />
<br />
1a. It's not a DELL. AMD PhenomII x4 B65, ASUS M4A89GTD PRO/USB3, 2 sticks Kingston HyperX 2GB DDR3, CD burner, DVD burner, 600w PSU,...<br />
<br />
1b. I installed Win 7 Pro 64-bit clean on Jan. 1st 2011. I reinstalled it clean in August when I installed the SSD.<br />
<br />
2. Hah,...that link tells me I'm running Windows 7. (Window key + Pause shows Windows 7, Service Pack 1)<br />
<br />
3. I use Microsoft Security Essentials, SuperAntiSpyWare, Malwarebytes, and SpywareBlaster. I update each daily or every other day and run all but SpywareBlaster regularly in under 5 minutes on quick scan. When the SSD was new,...MSE would run in 13 seconds.
 Now it takes 60+ seconds. SSDs are great. Every couple of weeks I'll run full scans and find nothing. No third party firewall. I use Eset's online scanner when I think there might be a problem.<br />
<br />
4. I am passionate about Norton and McAfee. Have you ever tried to uninstall either of those? Even the tools they created to help remove everything don't work.
<br />
<br />
5. No. I uninstall or delete anything and everything to do with McAfee or Norton.<br />
<br />
6. (a) Yes, Yes &amp; Yes;<br />
(b) Yes, Yes, Yes &amp; Yes;<br />
(c) Yes, Yes &amp; <i>definitely</i> Yes;<br />
(d) Yes, Yes, Yes, &amp; Yes [<i>definitely</i> No];<br />
(e) Yes, Yes &amp; Yes.<br />
<br />
7a. Control panel shows Java version 7 update 9.<br />
<br />
7b. Control panel shows Adobe Flash Player Plugin v11.5.502.110<br />
<br />
8a. I've <i>never</i> thought Internet Explorer worked OK.&nbsp; I have version 9.0.11. The update on 11-13-2012,(KB2761451), replaced all my homepages and settings.<br />
<br />
8b. Firefox v16.0.2 is installed but while checking the version an update was added. I may have a new version but would have to restart to find out what number it is.<br />
<br />
9. I'm not in the "habit" of using any of the 20 registry cleaners you listed but have recently installed CCleaner, (11-5-2012), and have used it twice. I did run the registry cleaner, (after a back up), and all the errors found were leftover from uninstalled
 programs pointing to nowhere.<br />
<br />
I found this link and tried the solution earlier today to no avail. <br />
<br />
http://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-7/windows-7-how-to-delete-files-protected-by-trustedinstaller/<br />
<br />
I thought that was going to work. I still get "Access is denied" when I try to "end process" on the instance that has no user name. The instance with my user name blinks off and then back on when "end process" is clicked. In the comment section I see several
 people with the same problem. Access still denied.<br />
<br />
I ran Eset's online scanner for an hour and 39 minutes on all drives before responding. Zero viruses found. I'll pose this question to the Windows section although I doubt there's a solution.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Restored your data backups to the HDD;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; • Downloaded and/or installed other applications you needed (e.g., Photoshop);</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4d. What DEFINITIONS version?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5a. In what way is IE9 <em>not</em> working OK (e.g., constant "Page cannot be displayed" errors; links not loading in new tabs or windows; IE9 just "crashes" whenever you try to use it)?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5b. Assuming the clean install left you with&nbsp;IE8, was IE8&nbsp;working OK before you upgraded IE9?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Did you install Firefox because Internet Explorer wasn't working or...?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Is Firefox your default Browser?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Can you successfully run a manual check for updates per <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            How to fully shut down Windows 8</h2>
                    Whenever I select "shut down", my computer seems to shut down, but when I open the lid again, it boots right up. I am worried that it is not shutting down completely, and therefore wasting my battery while I'm not using it. Is there something I can do
 to make it shut down fully?

                    &nbsp;My games won't display but I can hear the sound and see the cursor. It's the same result with SWTOR, CS:Go, and Diablo 3. I have tried windowed instead of full screen and it doesn't work.&nbsp;

 if you just keep your ME2 import and then played ME3 your really getting left out.

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Corrupted browser can be one of the possible reasons why your computer freezes or locks. You may proceed to uninstall/reinstall Google Chrome and see if this would resolve the issue.
<strong>Note</strong>: Kindly back up your personalized settings and favorites before uninstalling your browser to avoid any inconveniences.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persisted you may follow the next suggestion. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall the Windows updates dated January 11, 2018 and then follow the steps below to temporarily stop updates from re-installing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the Local Group Policy Editor to prevent updates to install automatically. Here's how:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Right-click the <strong>Windows key</strong> and click <strong>Run</strong>.<br />
2. Type <strong>gpedit.msc</strong> and click <strong>OK </strong>to open the Local Group Policy Editor.<br />
3. Navigate to <strong>Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update</strong>.<br />
4. In the right pane, double-click the <strong>Configure Automatic Updates policy</strong>.<br />
5. In the left pane, check the <strong>Enable </strong>option.</p>
<p>6. Under options, the following items are available:<br />
<br />
* 2 - Notify for download and notify for install.<br />
* 3 - Auto download and notify for install.<br />
* 4 - Auto download and schedule the install.<br />
* 5 - Allow local admin to choose the settings.<br />
<br />
You can enable or choose option 2 so you'll be notified if updates are available, but it will not be downloaded. If you prefer other options, you are free to do so.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Once done, click <strong>Apply</strong>, then <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us of the result for us to help you further. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

<h2>            Lenovo G500s Touch Screen does not Work</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My laptop's touch screen has recently stopped working.</p>
<p>It is a Lenovo G500s Touch and I've never had any problems with it prior to this.</p>
<p>Under 'PC info,' I am told that there is "no pen or touch input available for this display."</p>
<p>In the control panel, I do not see the 'Tablet PC Settings' tab either (in all icon sizes).</p>
<p>And this is what&nbsp;appears under Device Manager&gt;Human Interface Devices.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/827c781e-403a-4726-87a7-28c73d7f6d40" height="340" width="347" /></p>
<p>There aren't any physical damages to the laptop that I can see.</p>
<p>I've used this laptop's touch screen features up to the day it stopped working.</p>
<p>All help is appreciated. Thank you</p>

<h2>            Whats with all the online codes&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I do not understand why games that have multi player require you to buy an online code. If you buy the game new fine but used? I have to spend 10 bucks on one. Mortal Kombat has one Homefront. Bullet storm and I think battlefeild. I assume this is to pay
 for servers. I can only level up so far. Like Homefront I can only hit level 5 leaving me to have to pay for additional DLC to progress and unlock more achievements. I remember when games included online at no extra cost. It seems more common these days that
 companys are charging gamers who buy "used" copys of games to buy a online code. I understand it pays for the server or something but Is that really the reason? or are companys wanting more money?</p>

<p>I remember reading an article about it when EA started it, and all it sounded like to me is that the developers are doing it in order to make money off of used games. I think it's a little stupid really.</p>

<p>It's the developer. The developers are becoming money hogging people who don't care as much for the community as they do for the money. Sure they update the games, but they know if they don't games will be returned in aggravation by the consumer (which is
 us). As a result they found a sneaky way to make more money for anyone buying a used game so they will make close to the same amount of money by using these online battle codes or whatever they call it. No matter what they say, it's only so they can make more
 money.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">Well you still get exactly what you pay for. You buy a new game, and it has everything that it's always had. All that's changed is you have less incentive on buying used. As explained, that's because the developer/publisher doesn't
 profit from used sales, and likewise neither is your purchase contributing to their support.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">Although used game retailers have lowered the price on the used games which support online passes to reflect this change.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 0, 1)">The only publishers pushing these passes is EA Sports, and THQ. Mortal Kombat is a lone and first attempt by Warner Bro's, although retailers such as Gamestop do print out the online pass for buying this game used at no extra
 charge. So it's not as though this is a status quo, just a small attempt at publishers profiting on used game sales. The majority of titles released/releasing have no impact from this.

<p>I don't think we can do anything to change this. Some people will say don't support it by buying games that use the code. Sometimes it is hard to pass up a good game.

<p>When you buy a game used the companies that make the game receive $0 all the money from used games goes to the store where you bought it from they charge people who buy used for online passes in order to make some money off the used games. Hopefully the
 people who buy used games are able to get good deals because it seems the use of online passes is growing.</p>

<p>I personally buy very few games new and its a pain with all these online codes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With all the games coming out and the DLC out within a week of release (Sometimes even before) Companies are expecting you to buy the unfinished game new at a premium price when its not fully finished. And once the codes are used the value of these plummets
 so any potential trade ins are dropped. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It hits people hard who try to game on a budget. &nbsp;That said there's no way these companies will stop doing it</p>
<p>Also Am i going to be the one who points out the elephant in the room? &nbsp;It may well have been implimented to drop money lost from piracy. &nbsp;Just a thought.</p>

<p>You say it like it's a bad thing to want to make money. Aside from labour costs, there are also bills to pay, debtors to satisfy, and investors waiting for a return. Doing it for the art is always going to be a secondary consideration to paying the bills.
 And when you've paid all the bills, and you can spot another way to increase your profit margin, it is neither noble nor wise to ignore it. The whole endeavour is a business</p>

                    I have been experiencing the BSOD since 11/15.&nbsp; I looked at the crash dump files and indicator seems to be NETIO and ntoskrnl.exe.&nbsp; I am having the problem of only some symbols being identified for the dump file so I could be missing something.&nbsp; But following
 the directions for referencing symbols has not completely eliminated the 'symbols' error messages.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <b>BAD_POOL_CALLER (c2)</b> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the current thread is making a bad pool request.</i><br />
<br />
By default, NETIO.sys is at fault which is the Network I/O Subsystem (not the true cause). Usually when we have network related crashes like this it's caused by one of two things:<br />
<br />
1. Network drivers themselves need to be updated.<br />
<br />
2. 3rd party antivirus or firewall software causing NETBIOS conflicts. 3rd party device driver corruption.<br />
<br />
I see you have Sunbelt installed, likely the cause of crashes. This is likely one of the most brute-force anti virus software out there. It cannot be easily installed most of the time like any traditional piece of software, and the developers have wiped most
 of the removal links and tools so you rely on 3rd party software to get rid of it like Revo, etc.<br />
<br />
First off, boot into Safe Mode and rather than removing it via Control Panel, let's straight away hit it with Revo to save time and possible headache -

</p><p><span>Hello Bobbie,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand the inconvenience you have experienced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue might be with the drivers or might be with the User account settings. Say for example, when you're playing a video on Google Chrome, go to system tray and right-click on
<strong><span>sound icon</span></strong>, then select
<strong><span>Open Volume Mixer. </span>
</strong><span>Then you can able to see</span><strong>
</strong>Google Chrome listed there with the volume slider. Try to check with that to see if it selected correctly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it does, then the problem might be with the drivers. I understand your PC is up to date with the latest drivers. But there might be chances where the latest drivers still fails to work
 correctly due to compatibility. Go to device Manufacturer website and then try to update both Video and Audio drivers to see if they work correctly. If you don't find Windows 10 drivers, then try to install the available drivers. Click the
<a href="http://in.gateway.com/gw/en/IN/content/drivers-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link </a>to download the drivers from Manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted the outcome.</span></p>

            You will require backup software, many users recommend Macrium Reflect free to create a full system image - this captures all partitions &amp; the contents therein.
<br />You then create a backup &amp; point the image creation to the F drive as a destination.
<br /><a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree</a>

<br />This program has saved me many times after PC problems.

<p>The best way to do this is with a third-party image backup application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backing up is a very big topic, with lots of details and nuances, but the most important thing is to get started. You can learn the finer details later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An image backup is a copy of an entire drive letter. For example, you can backup everything on C: with an image backup, including the&nbsp;<em>metadata</em> that is a technical description of C: and isn't contained in a file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A third-party image backup application will make a copy of C: in a matter of minutes, and it takes only minutes to restore the image. The image is compressed, so it occupies much less space than the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has its own image backup application, called System Image Backup, but Microsoft has stopped developing it and recommends instead the use of a third-party application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By contrast, a file and folder backup copies individual files and folders. You can't use it to backup C: because it doesn't include the metadata needed to make C: bootable, but it's great for backing up your personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many more details that are beyond the scope of a community forum post, but they're out there on the internet for you to discover. Run a web search for:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.google.com/search?complete=0&amp;hl=en&amp;site=webhp&amp;source=hp&amp;q=best+image+backup+software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">best image backup software</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>and you'll find plenty of reviews. Pick one or two applications and read the descriptions of how they work in their technical support websites. For example, the image backup application I use is
<a href="https://www.macrium.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Macrium Reflect</a> and you can find a great description of how it works
<a href="https://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW7/Macrium+Reflect+User+Guide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are also plenty of good file and folder backup applications to discover with a web search. An example is
<a href="http://www.backup4all.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Backup4All</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very important to store your backups outside your computer, but you already know that ;-)</p>

<p>Regarding the "how," see the other replies for suggestions. Almost any third-party program is better than what comes with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wanted to my thought on backup in general:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span>First of all, almost everyone should be backing up to external media regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause
 the loss of everything on your drive. As has often been said, it's not a matter of whether you will have such a problem, but when.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Essentially you should back up what you can't afford to lose--what you can't readily recreate. What that is depends on how you use your computer and what you use it for.</span></div>
<div><span>It takes time and effort to backup, but it also takes time and effort to recreate lost data. If you back up daily, you should never have to recreate more than one day's worth of lost data. If weekly, there's potentially a lot
 more to recreate. You should assess how much pain and trouble you would have if you lost x days of data, and then choose a backup frequency that doesn't involve more pain and trouble than that you would have if you had to recreate what was lost.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Some things (photographs, for instance) can never be recreated, and more frequent backup may be wanted for them.</span></div>
<div><span>At one extreme is the professional user who would likely go out of business if his data was lost. He probably needs to back up at least daily. At the other extreme is the kid who doesn't use his computer except to play games.
 He probably needs no backup at all, since worst case he can easily reinstall his games.</span></div>
<div><span>Most of us fall somewhere between those extremes, but nobody can tell you where you fall; you need to determine that for yourself.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Should you back up Windows? Should you back up your applications? Most people will tell you no, since you can always reinstall these easily from the original media. But I don't think the answer is so clear-cut. Many people
 have substantial time and effort invested in customizing Windows and configuring their apps to work the way they want to. Putting all of that back the way it was can be a difficult, time-consuming effort. Whether you should backup up Windows and apps depends,
 once again, on you.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>How to backup? What software to use? There are many choices, including the Windows-supplied backup program. Which choice is best for you depends at least in part on the answers to some of the questions above.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Finally what backup media should you choose, and how should it be stored? There are many choices, including&nbsp;</span>
<span>CDs, DVDs, thumb drives, second hard drives, and online backup services.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>I don't recommend backup to a second non-removable hard drive because it leaves you susceptible to simultaneous loss of the original and backup to many of the most common dangers: severe power glitches, nearby lightning strikes,
 virus attacks, even theft of the computer.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>In my view, secure backup needs to be on removable media, and not kept in the computer. For really secure backup (needed, for example, if the life of your business depends on your data) you should have multiple generations
 of backup, and at least one of those generations should be stored off-site.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>My computer isn't used for business, but my personal backup scheme uses two identical removable hard drives, I alternate between the two, and make a complete copy of the primary drive.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><span>I also use a pair of 16GB thumb drives for making more frequent backups of my most critical data (like financial information). For that I just drag and drop.</span></div>

    <title>Windows 10 Crashing All Steam Games and System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lelandrangel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Crashing All Steam Games and System</h2>
                    <p>Since the latest update to Windows 10 my machine will regularly crash anytime I run a Steam game no matter what the game is if I have Real-time protection turned on (which apparently will not stay off even though I've turned it off multiple times). The fact
 that it will not stay off after a reboot is the most annoying thing you guys have ever produced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it takes a minute of playing the game, other times the game will not even load and I get a message in notification that the "Application has been blocked from accessing graphics hardware".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has not always been this way and I've had Windows 10 running on this machine since it was out. I've always kept my machine up to date and it is only used to play games, nothing else so you can imagine my frustration that now it will not even do that.
 It runs behind a firewall at my modem level and another layer at my wifi router which are two separate pieces of hardware, so I'm not terribly concerned about security and run virus scans regularly. My graphics card is older, a Radeon R9 200 Series but still
 runs most things well and it always up to date with the latest release version or the current beta version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed every online suggestion including the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>uninstalled and reinstalled my drivers for the graphics card</li><li>uninstalled and reinstalled the games in question</li><li>added all games to the Exclusion list under Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Security &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection &gt; Virus &amp; threat protection settings &gt; Add or remove exclusions</li><li>Added all games to Graphics settings under Display</li></ul>
<p>Nothing works except for turning off Real-time protection every single time I restart because it turns itself back on again without fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm annoyed to the point of giving up on windows and windows gaming after being a customer for 20+ years and spending thousands of dollars in the gaming community on steam and elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to permanently fix this issue?</p>

<h3> nick &#91;h&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to set up 2 Chrome icons on taskbar&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Chrome both for general internet browsing, but also to access my bespoke work diary on a remote server. I would like to set up 2 chrome icons on the taskbar: one for personal browsing the other for my work diary (only). At the moment, each time I create
 a new tab it collates them both on the one chrome taskbar icon, whereas I would like to keep them separate for ease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way that I can have 2 chrome icons on the taskbar and keep them separate, without using the 'never combine' option?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this same issue when I moved to windows 10, here is a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt; Right click on the taskbar</p>
<p>-&gt; Click on "Taskbar Settings"</p>
<p>-&gt; Scroll down to "Combine taskbar buttons"</p>
<p>-&gt; Select "Never" from the drop down menu</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked for me.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows 7 does not detect USB connected Creative USB Sound Blaster External Sound Card</h2>
                    My External Sound Blaster card SB0490 works on my XP machine.<br />
When connected to my Windows 7 machine almost everything except Creative MediaSource Player gives the error message "The audio device suppported by this application is not detected"<br />
The MediaSouce Player works ok. <br />
The driver is USB_W7DRV_LB_1_01_0099<br />
The USB Bus Controller is "USB Composite Device" using Driver file usbccgp.sys version 6.1.7600.16385 (win7_rtm.090713-1255).
<br />
An update search confirms this driver software is up to date.<br />
The Windows 7 Compatibility Center reports "Information coming soon" for this hardware.<br />
Has anybody a solution?
