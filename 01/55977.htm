<h2>            purchase fail</h2>
                    <p>On the first January I pre ordered Sea Of Thieves. I paid the 69.99 euros and I got it on my xbox and pc. So everything was fine. I even had acces to the closed beta and stuff because of my pre order.</p><p>Yesterday I got a email from the windows store that my purchase failed, although I had paid for the game and when I bought it it wasn't a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I'm a little bit desperate because I don't know what to do and 69.99 euros is a lot.</p><p><br /></p><p>I hope this can be helped.</p>

<h2>            Tony hawks pro skater 4, Tony hawks underground 1 and 2. Can we plz add these to xbox one B.C. list&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have always loved these games, they are fun for just doing brainless airs and grinding, great when you are just trying to relax. Recently i tried to play Tony hawks underground 2, and to my surprise, found that it is NOT on the Xbox one backwards compatibility list. These were pretty big games, and where/are very fun. I would really like to be able to play these games in HD, and with an Xbox one controller. I do have an original Xbox that i can play them on, but going from the Xbox one controller back to the original Xbox s controller is a big difference. Controllers have come a long way hah. Not to mention the 480p it runs in.&nbsp;I think it would be very fun and awesome to be able to play these on my Xbox one. Please if you agree with me say so! and if you know how/have the ability to make this happen, please do!</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>P.s. also please do not try to refer me to Tony hawk pro skater 5, because it completely sucks,&nbsp;and is a totally different style of ga

<h2>            Windows 7 safe mode keeps rebooting</h2>
                    <p>I have a win7 system, fairly new hardware. All software up to date etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used msconfig to put it into safe mode for next boot to look into a non-performance related issue. It boots into safe mode, but about 12 seconds after showing the logon screen it reboots. This happens at the same period after the GUI appears whether I
 log in or not. Murphy's law - away from home, no recovery disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially I need to get it back to Normal boot by some other means. Is there a file I can edit that reverts the boot back from Safe mode to Normal?&nbsp; Then any fix for Safe mode causing reboot?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies. I guess I should have been more complete in describing my actions. BIOS sees the boot drive (which is a SSD in fact) and also I had tried a rescue disk from another computer which also sees the drive. I can see the files on the drive
 that way, although it does have a different drive letter (i.e. not C:\). I am assuming this is an effect of running it from a rescue CD,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be surprised if it were hardware, because there is a clear co-relation between putting it in Safe boot mode via msconfig and the very next boot having the problem.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
After the above and if needed :<br />
<br />
StartUp Repair often works from a Windows 7 Installation Disk or Windows 7 <br />
Repair Disk when it&nbsp;does not from Recovery or a Recovery Disk. If needed <br />
how to make a Windows 7 Repair Disk is below. A Repair Disk can be made <br />
on any computer with a CD burner running XP, Vista, or Window 7 as it uses <br />
no files from the Host computer.
<p><br />
You can try some of these in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot. <br />
<br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not <br />
copy protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since <br />
you already own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer. <br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows
<br />
come&nbsp; back and try Startup Repair again.) <br />

            <p>Thanks Rob Brown, but frankly, as far as I can see you have just posted some copy-paste stock answer without either reading or understanding my post. That is if you are actually a person and not just an auto-reply robots. I mean, come on - you talk about
 dong stuff in safe mode etc when it is obvious I have no possibility of doing these things because it is not even booting up?&nbsp; How do you become a Microsoft MVP? By posting answers that are factually correct but without an helpful information whatsoever? That
 would be typical Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have fixed the problem with thanks to poster "Brink"on www.eightforums.com. From his post I got into BCDedit.exe as an alternative to MsConfig, and used the following command to remove the setting for Safe Mode and allowing the pc to boot into Normal.</p>
<p>
First, find the identifier for the computer as follows, which brings up all the boot parameters:
</p><p>
</p><p>bcdedit /enum</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then taking the Boot Loader idenitifier, use it in the following command:</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdedit /deletevalue "{default}" safeboot</p>
<p>The {default} parameter is the identifier found by first step. Also note that the " " around the identifier are required because of the non-standard characters { }.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And bingo - booted straight into Normal mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I hope this is of help to any other user with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Derek</p>

            <p>Would you post the link to that post on the www.eightforums.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the good ol' XP days there was certain malware that if you enabled Safe Boot from msconfig your system would never boot again in any mode.&nbsp; My theory was the malware knew you were trying to find and get rid of it and wanted to fool you into thinking
 you had to reinstall your Windows from scratch but that problem was easy to "fix" from the XP Recovery Console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I knew about that I would never suggest using msconfig to enable Safe Mode - just get into Safe Mode from the F8 Advanced Boot options menu (or learn how to fix the other problem).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you have fixed your system so it boots normally again but if you enable Safe Boot in msconfig won't you still have the same problem or have you tested that yet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not knowing too much yet about fixing boot problems in Windows 7 I was wondering how to explain and fix this problem and solution in the future so I began to wonder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system was not booting up how did you get to a Command Prompt to enter those commands if you are away from home with no recovery disk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand this problem I enabled Safe boot in msconfig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I type bcdedit&nbsp; /enum I see:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af41a63d-50ca-440c-8364-4cba36bd0bfd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af41a63d-50ca-440c-8364-4cba36bd0bfd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Which identifier should I use for the next command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the one called {current} since I can see the safeboot option there (it was not there before).&nbsp; So to find the correct identifier for the next command I should just look for the one that has safeboot listed in it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To remove safeboot from the {current} identifier should the next command I enter should be:</p>
<p>
</p><p>bcdedit&nbsp; /deletevalue&nbsp; "{current}"&nbsp; safeboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think so since now things look like this and safeboot is no longer listed under the current identifier:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/604612d1-af26-4e61-aeb0-b2d98f5ba225" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/604612d1-af26-4e61-aeb0-b2d98f5ba225" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking msconfig again finds the Safe boot option unchecked so that seems to work.</p>
<p><br />
Now that you know how to undo the msconfig adjustment how are you going to boot into Safe Mode to look at your non performance issue?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi ElderN,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, that is exactly what I did. When I was updating this chain it was from an iPad so no access to screen shots. Thanks for adding thise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I came across the actual solution of the original issue. Currently it is undergoing an intense virus &amp; malware scan. Once I am happy that there are no issues I will try again and see what happens. I have had it in safe mode before, but I suspect it
 was because in msconfig I selected "minimum drivers". I will post the result out of interest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The original issue was that i was getting a constant stream of "invalid certificate" pop-ups whenever I was browsing. Extremely annoying, several every couple of minutes. &nbsp;The resolution was to do a specific download and reinstall of Kaspersky. This issue
 is with rev 16, rev 17 needs to be downloaded and installed rather than relying on the inbuilt updating. Problem seems to have gone away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, D</p>

</p><p>I was booting from a borrowed Rescue disk, and the selection to open a command window. Quite a few things I tried to do would not work, like running&nbsp; msconfig from there. I would get a reply that I was not in Admin level, despite the cmd window being labelled
 as such. I also tried using runas to open msconfig as a user, but when it asked for a password it would not accept the one I use to logon as Admin.</p>

            <p>OK, so here we are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I set SafeMode from mcconfig, when it boots into SafeMode it will restart after 10 or sec's, and I have to boot from a recovery disc and use bcdedit to get out of SafeMode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use F8 to enter SafeMode, it will still restart after the 10 sec's, but at least it will then reboot back into Normal mode by itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the initial problem is still present - will not run in SafeMode.</p>

            <p>I don't know what that problem might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps Windows us crashing in Safe Mode and you just can't see the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) but it seems Safe Mode would be safe from things like that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you are able to boot normally make this adjustment then you can see if Windows is crashing when booting into Safe Mode:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your Desktop right click Computer, Properties, Advanced system settings and make it look like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=1846c190-a123-4853-a2b2-6cc724851ae1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/80637717-1703-442f-ba9c-3e648418924a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no need to create the Minidump folder as Window will create one if it needs to.</p>
<p>
Then click OK enough times to close all the dialog boxes and restart your system for the changes to take effect.&nbsp; After rebooting you can go back and check the settings again to be sure the adjustments "stick".

    <title>Bring back RalliSport Challenge 2 to either Xbox Arcade or Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dogrockets  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bring back RalliSport Challenge 2 to either Xbox Arcade or Xbox Originals</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got back into and oldie but still extreme goodie, PGR4. To this day even my friend's Grand Turismo5 on PS3 or the new Forza Horizon still doesn't have all the bells and whistles and all out fun PGR4 has and its now FIVE years old!!!!! But Im here
 to talk about an even older but also extreme goodie... Rallisport Challenge 2....<br />
<br />
The reason I mentioned PGR4 is because it reminded me of Rallisport Challenge 2 and how much more realistic and advanced it still is to current rally games just like PGR4 is to street / track racers. I will never forget the time I was running a time trial on
 RSC2 and half-way through after a jump, I had trouble turning right and couldnt figure why till I finished and watched the replay. Apparently I had completely ripped the left wheel off when i landed and it went flying parallel to my car for about 50yrs! I
 was driving with only 3 tires and everytime i tried to turn right, the left brake rotor dipped into the dirt preventing me from turning! To this day I haven't even come close to that kind of simulation on DIRT or DIRT2 or any other attempts at rally racing.<br />
<br />
Sad was I to find out years later when I was sure Xbox was done doing the backwards compatibility list, RSC2 was not on the list and worse, proved that it didnt work when I tried to play it on my Xbox 360. I hear Rallisport 1 is compatible, but even though
 I never played 1, I read and viewed videos that showed it just didn't compare.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why games like Rallisport Challenge 2 fall to the wayside and do not get re-issued or continued while other crappier games like Sega Rally do. Im blindly hoping that Xbox isn't one to not know a gem when they see it, even though maybe sales
 at the time of the original didnt show it. Obviously this game didn't get enough notice or marketing to get it to be at the top of the radar list for remakes, but I can assure you that anyone who's played it can agree that it is still (realistic and physics
 wise) the best rally game on console, and a much better choice than Sega Rally!!!</p>

<p>Sega Rally not only is a crappy racing game but its Sega Rally Online Arcade was removed from the marketplace due to licence issues, I think.</p>

            You'll need to install updated drivers, what works in XP does not necessarily work in Windows and that is definitely the case with drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Snazio does not have drivers for Windows 7, but it does have drivers for Vista which will almost certainly work
 in Windows 7.&nbsp; See: <a href="http://www.snazio.com/Links/driverdownloads.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snazio.com/Links/driverdownloads.asp</a>

<h2>            USB Devices Constantly Disconnecting then Re-connecting after Windows 8.1 Upgrade - Solved</h2>
                    After updating to Windows 8.1 on my desktop, I had no real problems apart from my mouse and keyboard constantly disconnecting and reconnecting while playing World of Tanks. This was a major hassle as you could understand and I could find no real answer.
 Everyone was more intent on fixing video problems and mouse dpi issues.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Well I found a thread somewhere and did a little investigating and fixed the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The answer lies with power management. I went to control panel, hardware and sound, device manager. I then went through every device and looked at the properties. I then looked for a tab marked 'power management'. Usually under this tab there are two check
 boxes. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power, and</div>
<div>2. Allow this device to wake the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Because this is a desktop and I am not as power conscious, I unchecked the first box on every device I found that had it.</div>
<div>Generally I found them on Generic USB Hub, USB Root Hub, and on the LAN.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Maybe someone knows a different way around this, but since I have done this, the game is now playable with Windows 8.1.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

            I am having what might be a similar issue with Windows 8.1. On my Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p, the connection to my Galaxy S3 through the USB port will disconnect and reconnect every second. Fast enough that file transfer is impossible.

            Matthew,
<div><br />
<div>Try going to Control Panel&gt;Hardware and Sound&gt;Power Options&gt;Change Plan Setting&gt;Change Advanced Power Settings&gt;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Scroll down until you get to USB Settings, click the + sign and it should say 'USB selective suspend setting' and that might be enabled. Disable that and it should work.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is probably an easier way to get to it, but this is what I now do.</div>

            I have already done this, and just confirmed again that 'USB selective suspend setting' is still disabled. The problem remains.

            I have exactly this problem with my Dell XPS 9530 and Samsung Galaxy S5. With all the latest updates for windows 8.1, updates BIOS (even without any win8.1 updates it does it) when I connect the S5 via usb it would make the connecting and disconnecting
 sounds like twice a second. Even after all these "solves" it makes no difference. I have a feeling it has to do with incompatible OS that need better drivers however if anyone solved it using another problem help would be appreciated because it is not usable
 like this :(<br />
Thanks

<h3> thomz23  say:</h3>
<h2>            DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE Lenovo Y50</h2>
                    <p>Hello again, back on here for the same problem with my brand new Lenovo Y50 Touch. Since i updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, which i did right after i turned it on for the first time, the computer seems to crash every few days from "DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE",
 and I cannot figure out why. Attached is the link to the minidump files as well as the MSinfo32, I hope this is the information you need to help me with this, any and all help is greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link:&nbsp;https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=afaf0dd1f2470dc9!451&amp;authkey=!ADltyv-HQO7p9aI&amp;ithint=folder%2czip&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent crash dmp file happened 4/15/2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF there is any way to fix this without having to run any tests and purposely make it crash again to get new dmp files, thatd be greatly appreciated. Seeing as though there is nothing specifically i do to make it crash, it happens completely at random, and
 it would take forever to go through a trial period just to make it crash again to get new dmp files. Last time someone told me to make it crash again, the computer could not recover, so i had to recover from an earlier date, which lost all the new dmp files
 it created. Please anyone who is good with this stuff help me! Im pretty good with computers but this just completely baffles me.</p>

<h2>            Can I Restore A System Backup To A New Device&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I may need to replace my Surface Pro3 with a new device, either a replacement Pro3 or a Pro4. I'd like to do that with a minimum of hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;I create a full system backup with the Windows backup tooling, can I restore that backup to a new device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, does it make a difference if the new devide is an identical Pro3 or a Pro4?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And does it make a difference that I've partitioned my current Pro3 into C:&nbsp;(system)&nbsp;and D: (data) (did that for path settings compatibility with my laptop)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if I can't restore a system backup to a new device, what is the best way to get my new device into identical functional state as my current? I use the same MS account across devices, and store my data on Dropbox, so a lot will transfer cloud-based.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of your printer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no universal method in <span>Windows</span> to change ink or toner cartridges because the procedure varies by printer. To find out which cartridges to use and how to change them, check the information that came with the
 printer.</p>

            <p>Hello Bergen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that the Desktop has no Start button, taskbar or the search box in Windows. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you facing this issue after any recent update installed?</li><li>Are you facing this issue in any other user accounts?</li><li>Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</li></ul>
<p>This issue might have caused due to some system files damaged or corrupted in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try the below Steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Check if the issue resolves in
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode.</span></strong><span> </span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Safe mode loads only minimal set of drivers and applications which helps you rectify the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Refer this </span><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article to boot to safe mode</a></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span> <span><span>Perform a
</span><strong><span>clean boot</span></strong></span><span> and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />
Follow: </span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span> </span><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></span> </span><span><span><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>I suggest you to
</span><strong><span>try creating a new user account </span></strong></span><span><span>and check if issue persists.<br />
Click on the below link to check how to create new user account in Windows 10<br />
</span><strong><span>Microsoft Support link:</span></strong><span> </span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note: </span></strong><span><span>Install all the pending updates after logging in to Microsoft account and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Keep us informed if the taskbar and start menu issue is resolved. We are glad to help you further.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Hi racingfast,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Windows opens, but after a while the monitor displays the message</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Most likely the computer has entered sleep mode. To bring the computer out of sleep mode, use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following steps and check whether you can fix the issue.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Method 1: To bring the computer out of sleep mode</strong><br />
1. Move the mouse or press the Spacebar. </span></p>
<p><span>2. If the computer does not wake, press the keyboard Suspend button. You may need to press the Suspend button on the keyboard twice (the suspend
 button has an icon that looks like a quarter moon).</span></p>
<p><span>3. If the computer still does not wake, press the Power button on the computer case for one second and release.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. If the monitor does not wake, restart the computer and turn off suspend mode:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE: Turning off suspend mode does not solve the problem, but it will help you determine if the problem is related to suspend mode
 or something else. Steps for Windows Vista :</span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Wait until the hard drive activity light on the computer is not lit and then press and hold the Power button on the computer case until
 the computer turns off.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Wait 5 seconds and then turn on the computer by pressing the power button again.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click
<strong>Start, Control Panel</strong>, <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, and then click
<strong>Power Options</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Select
<strong>High performance,</strong> and then click <strong>Change plan settings</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>e. Change the
<strong>settings to Never</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Click the
<strong>Save changes</strong> button to accept the changes, and then restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Use the computer with the power settings turned off to see if the message continues.
</span></span></p>
<span><span>• If the message opens after a software program is opened, such as when starting a game, the software is
 forcibly changing the display resolution to a mode that is not supported by the computer and monitor. Do not use the software or change its video settings.</span></span>
<span><span>• If the message opens after certain period of time when the computer is not in use, the problem is most
 likely being caused by a screen saver. Turn off the screen saver to see that the problem no longer continues.</span></span>
<span><span>If the above steps don’t work, then you may refer the following HP support link and try the steps provided:</span></span>
<span><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00061509&amp;cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=3356598" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c00061509&amp;cc=uk&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=3356598</span></a><span>
</span></span>
<span><span>Method &nbsp;2:Also make sure that the Display adapter is up to date.
</span></span>
<p><span><span>1. Open Device Manager by clicking the
<strong>Start button</strong>, clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>, clicking <strong>
System and Maintenance</strong> and then clicking <strong>Device Manager</strong>.‌
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. In Device Manager, locate
<strong>Display Adapter you</strong> want to update and then <strong>double-click</strong> the device name.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click the
<strong>Driver tab</strong> and then click <strong>Update Driver</strong> and follow the instructions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You may also refer the Manufacturer’s website and download the latest drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>

            Thanks for the info. I can't&nbsp; try any of these steps to try and repair it because my computer is not displaying anything on the monitor the only thing that I can see at all on my monitor is a message that comes up and says "no signal input" then another
 message come on the monito that says monitor going to sleep. then the monitor goes to sleep and I can't get nothing elses to come up on the monitor. and when I connect the power cord to my tower and plug it into the wall my tower automatically powers on without
 me pressing the power button<br />
thanks again<br />

 time. So pleased! Many thanks!

<h2>            Windows Firewall Red Shield</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have an interesting problem in our domain</p>
<p>Through GPO I've allowed for all computers connected to Domain or Private network to have firewall on but through the advanced rules it will accept any connection a send any connection (I called the rule "Any")</p>
<p>We have done this because we use A Checkpoint firewall to mange connections and there is no need for the Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>Our intentions are to keep the firewall and to remove the "Red Windows Firewall Shield" (so that everything will be green)</p>
<p>Though the Red Shield still stays</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried searching the web for a solution but to no luck</p>
<p>I would be glad if someone could help me solve this issue or at least explain why this is happening even though the firewall is technically on (for example: is it because of my "Any" rule? or maybe because it's through GPO?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want to note that even though "Private Network" is not connected it shows a green shield</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance</p>

    <title>MTP device troubles, disabled &#58;&#40; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            MTP device troubles, disabled &#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm afraid I&nbsp;messed up with the MTP device which can't help bubbling me I had a "new device connected". I decided to turned it off so&nbsp;I disabled it (in this little driver window) thinking I could enable it later. But I can't.</p>
<p>Now my Samsung Galaxy S can't connect to my PC even in "mass storage" mode. I can't see either my internal and external SD card in the explorer window.</p>
<p>How can I enable the MTP device again?&nbsp;I've been looking every where but obvioulsly not at the right place.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support.</p>
<p>H.</p>

            If it is a cache issue, then give us an option to clear the cache everytime we exit an application.

            Amazing - a simple error code 124 and the solution seems to be to rewrite the kernel of the OS nine different ways.&nbsp; This is JUST Solitaire for heaven's sake!&nbsp; Just fix it and make it work when we hit the icon to run.&nbsp; It's 2019 and computers have been
 around since the 1940s.&nbsp; These apps shouldn't even break...

    <title>External hard drive issue &#40;Can&#39;t delete files&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yuhatn  say:</h3>
<h2>            External hard drive issue &#40;Can&#39;t delete files&#41;</h2>
                    I have an external hard drive that I was using under Windows XP&nbsp; and am now on Vista 64-bit. I have no problem accessing files on the drive or adding new folders or moving files onto the hard drive. However, I can not delete the files that are on the hard
 drive. If I right click on the folder or file, the option to delete *literally* does not show in the menu. I am on the administrator account (only account that has been created).
<br />
<br />
The problem may lie somewhere around this: if I right click on a folder and goto properties, read-only is checked. If I unchecked it and save, it acts like it's applying it to the directory and all sub-directories. When I go back to the properties, it is again
 as read-only. I'm assuming somewhere herein lies the problem.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?? This has been an incredible pain for many months.<br />
<br />
Thanks

If you use your favorite search engine and search for "add take ownership to vista right click" you will&nbsp; find plenty of third party software downloads that will allow you to change permissions on multiple files and / or folders at once.&nbsp; I know there is one
 called TakeControlOf.zip and one called own.zip that you can download for free.<br />

            Hello Yuhatn,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; Your problem is related to file ownership.&nbsp;&nbsp; You will have to change the permissions of the file/folder to be able to delete it.&nbsp; You can do this by right clicking on the file/folder and selecting the Security tab.&nbsp; Once there, you can
 change the permissions for your account in regards to this file/folder.&nbsp; You might have to do this for all files in a folder to be able to delete the folder.&nbsp; There are some 3rd party tools that will allow you to add this function in the right click menu.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.

<h2>            Skype - old username saved instead of e-mail address</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Hello,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I’m experiencing issues with saved usernames in Skype. In list of saved usernames is old username “<strong>v****_****a</strong>“ stored. But if I try to login using this username an error message appear “This Microsoft account does not exist.
 Please use different account or create new one.”</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If I login using my e-mail address then everything works fine but e-mail address is not saved in list of saved usernames. So I have to fill it manually every time I try to login.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I tried to manually delete complete folder “C:\Users\XXXX\AppData\Roaming\Skype\<strong>v****_*****a</strong>" and login in Skype using e-mail address (to create it again). I was hoping that e-mail address will be stored but after Skype restart
 “<strong>v****_*****a</strong>” account appeared again instead of e-mail address.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What shall I do to force Skype remember my e-mail address instead of old Skype username?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

<p><span>However, my previous attempt with deleting above mentioned folder led me to a solution. I simply renamed this folder to my e-mail address and voila! – e-mail username is on list of saved usernames.</span></p>

            As you know there are 2 password for bitlocker.
<br />One is to unlock the drive which you can set up yourself from Control Panel - System and Security - Bitlocker.
<br />The second one is a recovery one in case you forget the first.
<br />This one is a 48 digit one that you can not choose.
<br />But I would recommend to save it in a cloud drive or another machine.

<h2>            Windows 10 - USB mouse Device Descriptor Request Failed</h2>
                    <p>I have got a fairly new Surface Pro 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;It came with Windows 8.1 but I rapidly upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to use a USB mouse rather than the trackpad.&nbsp; This seems like a fairly basic requirement and I wouldn't have expected it to be problematic.&nbsp; However, when I plug in a mouse, it is not recognised.&nbsp; I have tried a couple of different mice, but
 the result is the same.&nbsp; In Device Manager, it says "Device Descriptor Request Failed".&nbsp; Both mice work with other computers, so the problem is not with them - it is with the Surface or Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried various things, including:</p>
<p>1. Turning the power off and on again.&nbsp; (Result: No change.)</p>
<p>2. Uninstalling from Device Manager (Result: Same problem occurs when the mouse is next plugged in.)</p>
<p>3. "Update Driver Software" from Device Manager.&nbsp; (Result: Windows says that the correct driver is already installed.)</p>
<p>4. Third party software - Driver Talent (Result: It says that the driver is 'abnormal', but when it is asked to Repair there is no improvement)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to restart in Safe Mode but it seems that due to BitLocker this is not as straightforward as it used to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort I may reinstall Windows, but this is not convenient and seems excessive.&nbsp; And of course there is no guarantee that it will help.&nbsp; Have I missed an easier solution (or, indeed, any solution)?</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried Method 1 (troubleshooting) and there was no change.&nbsp; There was no clear indication that a problem had been found or fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try Method 2 (download and install drivers from Microsoft) in due course and update.</p>
<p />

            <p>Mouse has started working again of its own accord. &nbsp;By coincidence I was actually downloading the Surface drivers when this happened, but haven't installed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this problem will recur in future, since the underlying cause hasn't been identified or (as far as I am aware) fixed. &nbsp;Hope I am wrong.</p>
