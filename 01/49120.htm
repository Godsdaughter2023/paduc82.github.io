<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get the Magnifying symbol on the lock screen you will need to enable Windows spotlight for the lock screen.
 Windows spotlight is an option that displays different background images on the lock screen.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To enable Windows spotlight on your computer, please follow the steps mentioned below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press and hold
<strong>Windows key + I</strong>, to open <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on
<strong>Personalization</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on
<strong>Lock screen</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select
<strong>Windows spotlight</strong> from the drop down menu under <strong>Background</strong>.
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

    <title>DVI &#40;digital&#41; does display boot-up screens, but doesn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oskar h.  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVI &#40;digital&#41; does display boot-up screens, but doesn&#39;t display in windows.</h2>
                    <p>One day I started my pc and everything worked fine. After approximately 1 hour the DVI-D signal to my Benq monitor stopped. I turned on my TV that's connect with a HDMI and I saw everything except the DVI signal was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><div>I restarted my pc and if I remember correctly the DVI-D signal came back normally and I ignored the problem.</div>
<div>
<p>The day later I started the pc and the Benq monitor did display boot-up screens but lost signal in windows. Again the TV with HDMI worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>System specifications:</div>
<div>- Main GPU: Gainward Phantom Geforce GTX 970</div>
<div>- Backup GPU: MSI Radeon HD 7750</div>
<div>(never used at the same time)</div>
<div>
<p>- CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1230 v3</p>
<p>- motherboard: Gigabyte G1.sniper B5</p>
<p>- RAM:&nbsp;ballistix (4 times 4GB) DDR3 BX Sport</p>
</div>
<p>- SSD: Crucial 6Gb/s M500 120GB</p>
<p>- HDD: 1TB SATA Western Digital</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried with Nvidia main card:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall Nvidia Graphic driver with DDU (in safe mode)<br />
Result: DVI-D signal at boot up screens but not in windows</li><li>Empty all disks and reinstall windows 10<br />
Result: DVI-D signal in 480p with basic Microsoft display driver in windows</li><li>After new windows install, automatic install of the NVidia driver version 353.54<br />
Result: DVI-D signal in 1080p in windows</li><li>Upgraded driver from 353.54 to NVidia version 359.06 then to 373.70<br />
Result: Both versions worked 1080p in windows. The last upgrade (version 373.70) displayed for a short time (less then a minute) in windows then suddenly the DVI digital signal stopped working. The TV with HDMI still worked in 1080p.</li><li>Repeating the installation of the drivers above didn't get the DVI signal to work in windows again.</li><li>Upgrade the driver 353.54 to 372.90 not with device manager&nbsp;and removed the HDMI cable from the Graphics card while installing the NVidia driver<br />
Result: DVI signal in 1080p in windows. after installation I reconnected the HDMI and both screens worked in 1080p. After a restart with both cables connected the DVI did not display in windows.</li><li>Restart with only the DVI connected<br />
Result: DVI signal in 1080p in windows, after startup I connected the HDMI and both screens worked in 1080p</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Things I tried with AMD backup card</p>
<ol>
<li>Reinstalled windows and getting latested AMD drivers<br />
result: DVI digital signal in 1080p</li><li>Next day startup<br />
result: DVI does display boot-up screens, but doesn't display in windows.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Most important is that I didn't get any better then having the DVI signal in windows for a short time or until the next restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Every time I uninstalled or reinstalled a driver I followed all steps the installer was giving me. For example I&nbsp;restarted the pc when I may did not describe this in the "thing I tried" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is in windows because sometimes the DVI randomly works again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can help me because I feel I tried everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Solution that works so far,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been to the company where I bought the graphics card and most of my other components. I tested the whole pc there with there display and the same problem appeared. They tested just my graphics card in another system with out me and the problem didn't
 appear.</p>
<p>We tested 1 of there graphics card in my system a GTX 950 and the problem didn't appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>After cleaning my graphics card from dust while there was almost none we tried my graphics card again with out any though it would work. But then the problem didn't appear ever since now just 1 week later after cleaning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be sure we cleaned some smudge that has been sitting there for a year on the motherboard from when I spilled soda. the smudge was not bigger then the finger tip of my pinky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the graphics card worked right away after just cleaning the dust I think the smudge was causing the problem and the dust was making it worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help but I gues it's solved now. Because I can't mark my own replies as "the awnser" a moderator can maybe do that for me or just close the post or what ever?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p><br />

            I clicked the Wi-Fi icon on the task bar and clicked "Network Settings." In these settings there is a tab called "Proxy" on the left side panel. For some reason the option "Automatically detect [proxy] settings" was "On." I turned it "Off" and the problem
 is now solved for me. Hopefully it'll also work for you. Good luck!&nbsp;

            let's try this
<br />
<br />Update Microsoft Store: Select the Start button&gt; Microsoft Store. Select See more&gt; Downloads and updates&gt; Get updates. If an update is available for Microsoft Store, it will start to install automatically.
<br />
<br />Repair and restore the application: select the Start button&gt; Settings&gt; Applications&gt; Applications and functions. Select the application that does not work, and then Advanced Options. On the page that will open with information about the application, select Repair. (Note: some applications do not have this option). If the repair of the application does not solve the problem, select Reset.
<br />
<br />Uninstall and reinstall the application: select the Start button. In the list of applications, right-click the one that does not work, select Uninstall and again Uninstall to confirm. To reinstall the application, select the Start button&gt; Microsoft Store&gt; View More&gt; My Library&gt; Applications. Next, choose the application you want to reinstall and select Install.
<br />
<br />Try running the Troubleshooter for Microsoft Store applications. Select the Start button&gt; Settings&gt; Update and security&gt; Troubleshoot&gt; Windows Store applications

            <p><span>I replaced starter with a fully paid click-to-run version (including the Australia tax).</span></p>
<p><span>What I have found through the process of solving this problem is that while office 10 will theoretically work with windows 10, there are a number of potential problems</span></p>
<p><span>I my case it was the known issues with click-to-run and windows installers</span></p>
<p><span>There are also issues with uninstalling all office products with an uninstaller (mr fixits are available for all versions of windows)</span></p>
<p><span>So if you have a click-to-run office it will need to be uninstalled and the mrfixit run to remove it completely before reinstalling</span></p>
<p><span>However if the click-to-run installer version that you handed over your cash for was designed to work for windows 7 it WONT work on windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>So to solve the problem I am back to running windows 7, the click-to-run installer failed even though I am back to windows 7 BUT through support I now have another installer that works (it may even work for windows 10 but I don’t have
 time or internet data to spare sorting out any further problems)</span></p>
<p><span>End result : I wasted 5 Gig of internet at $10 a gig and I am still running windows7
<span>&nbsp;</span>but I do have office working and I learnt a valuable lesson – read each of the options in a popup window carefully because what you assume is a ‘ask me later button’ may actually be a ‘download now install later button’.</span></p>

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />There have been some reports of issues printing PDFs from Edge at this time.
<br />
<br />I recommend you try using Internet Explorer instead to print the PDF or a third party PDF viewer such as Adobe Reader DC or Foxit Reader.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: iexplore
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Try printing your PDF or

 in wtv format, it crashes with yellow bang.&nbsp; Claims the file is corrupted.&nbsp; But the last 4 wtv files I recorded from HD TV all does this.&nbsp; I also moved one of the files to a laptop I have MM 2011 with no update, and it does the same thing.&nbsp; Seems like there
 was some update to WMC wtv file format, maybe a codec, that MM doesn't understand, and there was not a corresponding MM 2011 update.&nbsp; These HD files are usually over 10GB.&nbsp; LD files are &lt; 5GB and don't require preprocessing, and they work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don't say "just update to MM2012" because it doesn't work on my system, apparently the HW is too old and 2012 doesn't support it, I had all kinds of issues with 2012, and went back to 2011 upon advice of an expert, which solved all the major issues, except
 now I have this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I could revert to older WMC (before update) if only I could find out how, and then turn off autoupdates.&nbsp; Actually I do have autoupdate turned off, so I don't know how it's updating.&nbsp; I just know it does, because about every month I come in first thing&nbsp;and
 the&nbsp;system has rebooted, and a popup tells me that Windows has been updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wish I could fix this problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting. I understand that you are having issues with the videos from your Windows Media Center. Let's try to isolate if the issue was on your codec.
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="font-weight: bold">Microsoft FixIt tool</span></a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> for codec.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In case the issue still persists, I would like to ask for a screenshot of the updates installed on your computer prior to the issue. You can see the updates by following these:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press <strong>Windows button + R</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Type <strong>appwiz.cpl</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Click <strong>View installed updates</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Sort it by installation date by clicking the

<p>After loading HD file:</p>

<p>So the problem still exists.&nbsp; More info:</p>
<p>1. I currently have 3 files that exhibit this problem.&nbsp; One file takes 5 sec to get the error, another takes about 15 sec, and a 3rd takes several minutes.&nbsp; I have a hard time believing that all 3 of these files are corrupted, unless there was some change
 to WMC that now corrupts wtv files in HD.</p>
<p>2. As you can see above, no codec issue was found and no update. The last updated app is Java, but that was done on 10/27, and this problem happened before then (but after the previous 9/20 update) since the earliest of the 3 files is dated 10/20.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>3. I know it was working on 10/11 because I still have a wmv file that was processed from a HD wtv file (the original wtv has long been deleted and no longer in the recycle bin).&nbsp; 10/11 was the date I processed that file.</p>
<p>4. I never had an issue with this error on HD files before, this is the first time the problem showed.&nbsp; In the past I processed perhaps 10 or more HD files from wtv format.</p>
<p>5. The last Windows update history shows 9/4 as the last time files were updated.</p>
<p>6. There was a recent power outage (actually several in the past month), but I cannot imagine how that could cause this specific issue.&nbsp; It just seems like more of a SW compatibility problem, but I'm at a loss as to what changed between 10/11 and 10/20.&nbsp;
 The only thing I can think of is a possible power outage, or some automatic update that doesn't show in Windows update history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What's the next step?</p>

            As it worked well just a couple weeks ago, you could try a system restore to go back to a restore point that was before it stopped working well
<div><br />
<div>Hit the start button at the lower left of Windows 7 &gt; type in the word restore &gt; it should show you System Restore at the upper left &gt; open it and follow the instructions.... see if you have a date that fits your needs.... select it</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can check Movie Maker and undo your restore if it doesn't resolve it.&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back. I agree with the post of PapaJohn. You can try to go back on a previous System Restore point by following the steps he gave. In case the issue still persists, I would like to reiterate the screenshot of the installed Windos Updates.
 You can see the screenshot after trying the <em>appwiz.cpl</em> the <strong>View installed updates</strong> button on the left pane. Just click it and then sort it by
<strong>Installed On</strong>.</p>

This doesn't help, since the files do the same thing on another system.&nbsp; I believe the evidence I presented shows the problem to be in the wtv files, not in the system or WLMM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the past, I encountered a few files in which there were some dropouts (signal lost), in which DVD&nbsp;Maker couldn't handle, and those had to be cut out of the wmv file.&nbsp; But I never encountered a problem with the pre-processing before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said before, I have another system that had not been updated nor was affected in the power outages (it being a laptop), and those files exhibit the same issue on that system.&nbsp; It just seems to me that the problem is in the files, and the problem is
 being generated by the WMC app that records the wtv.&nbsp; Those files have no problem in playback on WMP.&nbsp; It appears to me that the issue is between the wtv files and the WLMM pre-processing app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to say I'd try it on a system with WLMM 2012, but I don't have access to one at this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>About the screenshots, do you need something other than what I attached previously?&nbsp; I think the 2nd pic looks like what you are looking for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the error happened after preprocessing, I might be able to work around it by cutting some of the file out; but since it happens at the beginning, I can't do anything about it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Right now I'm just looking for more troubleshooting guidance.&nbsp; Is there some log file I could find that might point closer to root cause of the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a suggestion for future releases, it would be nice if, when there was an error, a log file would be generated (or at least the error reported) with some detail info such as which file it was processing and where in the file the error occurred (such
 as time stamp).</p>

<p>Thanks for posting back. Yes, the screenshot I need was different from the one you gave since the one you gave was for the programs list and not for the Windows Update. This screenshot will help us if one of the installed updates contributes to the issue.
 Please follow the steps I gave to get the screenshot we need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you cannot start doing anything on the video since the error occurs the moment it was imported then I could suggest that you convert the file using a video converter and try again editing it.</p>

<p>As you can see here, there were not any recorded updates since 9/4, I think I mentioned that before.&nbsp; Since the problem started happening after 10/11, it does not appear that updates is the issue, seeing also the same files exhibit the same issue on my laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So then, I would think at this point there might be some indication of root cause embedded in log files, if they exist.&nbsp; Since the yellow banger doesn't give me any indication, and my searches don't yield any log file info, I'm at a loss what to do next.</p>

<p>Thank you for providing us the screenshot. As you've mentioned that the updates didn't caused the issue. Since there's no listed update right after the occurred. What we can is to request log files from you. However, it will not record the error that you've
 encountered when you import the .wtv file. For investigation, we also request that you provide us one affected .wtv file.</p>

 a WIA interface (Paint requires WIA, does not work with TWAIN). Since Windows sees it and recognizes it by name, I think that means that the USB stuff is good to the scanner, but that Windows can't figure out what kind if device it is. Could I have disabled
 something years ago that I now need? **** in the registry? Any ideas? Thanks john

            I had looked at that article, and I have looked at it some more.&nbsp; I came up with:<br />
- msinfo32 shows the device under components / USB, not components / Problem Devices, which implies that as far as that goes, the device is working.<br />
-in the setupapi.log, there are entries showing the installation of the driver as finished successfully.<br />
-under device manager, if you double click the device, it says "This device is working properly."&nbsp; I tried the "troubleshoot" button, I get to "This troubleshooter is unable to solve your problem" and "Okay, I'll try to get help elsewhere" (so here I am!).<br />
<br />
This reinforces my feeling that the driver and the device are not the problem, the problem is Windows just doesn't understand scanners.&nbsp; Like some bit in the middle is broken or turned off.<br />

                    My Temp folder under my username keeps losing permission. I am the sole user of this computer and the administrator. Everytime I reboot, the temp folder loses permissions and I can't write to it. SYSTEM and my username disappears. I have to manually add
 myself and SYSTEM every time.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have done a sfc /scannow - no errors.</div>
<div>I have added Everyone with full permissions, same things happening.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No matter what I do, when I reboot, the Temp folder goes back.</div>

            The temp folder in the Windows directory is intended to be this way.&nbsp; Temp files related to programs being run by a user are in your %appdata% directory under your user file.&nbsp; This is by design to virtualize and isolate processes per user and prevent writing
 to the system directories.

            Shawn -&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If windows is designed to do this, I will make the statement that it is a design flaw. &nbsp;Case in point... &nbsp;Google Drive, Quickbooks Accounting Software and others - these programs will not function properly because of this windows design with the "temp"
 folder. &nbsp;Google drive will not automatically start because of the permissions issue and renders a python.dll error unless manually started and ran as an administrator. &nbsp;Quickbooks is a far worse issue - and I'm not sure if it is entirely a Quickbooks issue
 or an issue with SQL in general, but here is the symptom. &nbsp;Upon launch, Quickbooks appears to start and the software loads - it never gets past this point however and in the meantime, a background process occurs that creates hundreds of thousands of folders
 with a file called dbdata11.dll &nbsp;This will continue until the user launches control panel and terminates quickbooks manually. &nbsp;Here is the rub... THE USER HAS NO WAY OF KNOWING THAT QUICKBOOKS IS CHEWING UP DISKSPACE BY CREATING THESE FOLERS WITH FILES IN
 THEM. &nbsp;Just this morning I hand to remedy this on a client's computer. &nbsp;There were over 285,000 files/folders totaling 85GB of disk space because of this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there anyway to disable or stop this "design" from occurring? &nbsp;Currently, the only solution I am aware of is to run google drive as an administrator and run quickbooks as an administrator. &nbsp;Running quickbooks as an administrator is not really that big
 of a deal, however, running google drive as an administrator will keep it from auto loading if a windows restart occurs. &nbsp;That can be very problematic. &nbsp;If the end user doesn't know that their google drive is not running, their files won't be synced with the
 cloud until they realize this to be the case. &nbsp;If something happened to their computer or hard drive, no synced copy will exist in the cloud - all because of some design issue deemed necessary by Microsoft. &nbsp;I don't think the user should be "forced" to have
 this issue to contend with - and MANY quickbooks users are not even aware of it. &nbsp;Most google drive users just launch as administrator, but some might not beware of the consequences of a restart and not having google drive auto-load at startup because it is
 being ran with elevated permissions and appears to need to be started manually when ran with those elevated permissions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you are aware of a way around this that is PERMANENT in nature, please share with this group?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you,</div>

            I am having the same problems, my quickbooks do the same, dropbox and google drive the same. Quickbooks also keep on filling up my harddrive with utter nonsense. All you read is to stick a band aid over it rather than fixing it. Even when i install programs
 i need to say run as administrator even though i am the only administrator on the pc with the correct privileges. Do not know if this is a Win 8 problem as i did not have this problems with win 7. &nbsp;Any help on this would be appreciated.

 here, it might even be something they already know of and can provide an easy fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the permissions, I can confirm that Google Drive and Drop Box operate normally under a fresh account, and require no admin rights or "run as admin".&nbsp; I would try the

<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the problem was being caused by an illegal copy of adobe acrobat. &nbsp;The solution was simple - uninstall the hacked copy of adobe acrobat and all of the issues went away. &nbsp;No more permission issues on the temp folder, no more 100's of thousands
 of quickbooks temp files, no more anything - period. &nbsp;I had found the problem described on an adobe website actually. &nbsp;It could also be a bootleg copy of other adobe products where the hackers posted a free version of adobe acrobat or creative studio, or photoshop
 or other products. &nbsp;They have the user replace a couple of the .dll files that are installed by adobe and these replacement .dll's are the culprit that cause the permissions to switch on the temp folder.</p>

<h2>            Random Keys Stop Working Randomly on Windows 10 &#40;Spacebar Stops Working on Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have the Acer Aspire E15 laptop and recently installed Windows 10. Randomly throughout the day, some keys will stop working: the spacebar, certain letters, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my drivers are fine and they work flawlessly on Linux, so it's definitely not a hardware issue (I've been running Linux for a long time without any issues. I'm on Windows for a week and suddenly my keyboard starts acting out).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was on the Stable channel for a while, have updated everything and it still happens at least once or twice a day. I recently installed the Beta (Windows 10 Beta preview) and as I see, it happens&nbsp;<strong>less,
</strong>now, but it just happened again for the first time using the beta.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please provide some feedback or suggestions? This is really irritating and so inconvenient, but I'd like to stay with Windows 10 if I can get the keyboard to stop acting out and randomly stop working with certain keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Attempts I've made. </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>FN + F11 key: I hold it for a few seconds. Sometimes this works. Other times it doesn't.</p>
<p>Reboot my laptop. Sometimes this works. Other times it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried seeing if there were any updates for my keyboard drivers via Windows 10 settings but it said that Windows determined it was up to date.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Installed Linux again a few nights ago, re-flashed Windows 10 on my USB and deleted all partitions again, clean installing Windows 10. Seems to work fine now. Every once in a while I get a strange function or two with my keyboard but it seems to work now,
 this being basically my fourth or fifth Windows 10 install. Hopefully it'll stay working. If not, I'll see maybe it's a hardware thing, but so far it's working okay now.</p>

Use Deployment Image Servicing and Management to fix Windows Update errors</p>
<p><br />
1.Open an elevated command prompt. </p>

            I don't want to reset or refresh again, this will be the third time, I don't want to lose everything again. This is very frustrating, Windows 7 is running with no issues on this computer but Windows 8 has several errors, and it was pre-installed. I hope
 I can just install Windows 8.1 over Windows 8 and it fixes everything because I don't want to lose everything again.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>And why is Windows 8 so eager to erase all of your desktop programs and files, I have a desktop computer not a tablet, even if it does have a touchscreen. I never really use the Start Screen apps.<br />
&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I did the other things you suggested and they didn't work. Windows Update won't let me try the updates again and I still can't install iTunes either. But Thanks.</div>

<li>Did you check the Windows Update Log file?</li><li>Do you receive any particular error message/code when you try to install Windows Update?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please go through the Private Message and provide us the Windows Update Log file so that we can check what is the exact cause for the failure of Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile , try the troubleshooting&nbsp;steps provided in the article "<strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot problems with installing updates</a></strong>".</p>

<div>I have a laptop which runs XP. It was running slow and i&nbsp;decided to restore it to an&nbsp;earlier time. I ran "system restore"&nbsp;, and when it was done it said that the System Restore could not be completed because there was not&nbsp;enough&nbsp;"free disk space". So I
 deleted some files and&nbsp;tied&nbsp;to run it again. &nbsp;When I did this all previous "Restore Points" were gone. Leaving me &nbsp;with only the current day as a "Restore&nbsp;Point". Why did this happen? What can I do to to get my "restore points" back?</div>

            <p>HELP! SIMILAR ISSUE! I use Disk clean up at least once a week, (not much available space!) and System restore is a priority for me . I didn't major in Computer Science and am never sure if I add, move or delete something, will it be the one thing I shouldn't
 have done so I have left a large portion of available space to do restore points 1-2 times a week. I have had to use a restore point up to 3 weeks prior to an issue because the system couldn't restore to any other more recent points. I have looked everywhere
 for a way to delete specific dates/restore points &nbsp;or even to delete all but most recent&nbsp;4-6 points, but can't find out how. So&nbsp;I used the option in Disk Clean up that says
<u>"DELETE ALL BUT MOST RECENT RESTORE POINTS"&nbsp;</u>. I&nbsp;regularly check to see how many and the most recent restore points are stored, so I figured the worst would be I would loose all but the MOST RECENT which "Most Recent" apparently means ALL. I had originally
 asked to restore to previous point, then was able to check and see how many had been done so I felt I was safe with the last restore points being every 3-5 days....But I then clicked "Cancel" and Did not complete (Since the point was for info, not to restore
 at that time) so disk clean up ended, I clicked ok to Delete all but MOST RECENT, but when the problems were not helped by cleanup, and seemed even worse, I tried to go back to actually restore to the last restore point a week ago, but was gone. I couldn't
 even click back to previous days, much less weeks or months, nothing. Every MS update/Software distribution, created or automatic restore point was gone.&nbsp; The don't end up in your recycle bin, so where do they go? How do I get back and EXACTLY WHAT DOES MOST
 RECENT MEAN, 1 WEEK, 1 DAY, 1 HOUR? EVEN WORSE, SYSTEM STILL SLOW AND IT DOESN'T APPEAR I HAVE ANY MORE AVAILABLE SPACE THAN I DID BEFORE!</p>

            Hi Gary M.Ball,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately you cannot restore the system restore points, if a restore point is not present or deleted. Restore points are saved until the hard disk space System Restore reserves is filled up. As new restore points are created, old ones are deleted. If you
 turn off System Protection (the feature that creates restore points) on a disk, all restore points are deleted from that disk. When you turn System Protection back on, new restore points are created.<br />
<div>For more information refer the following link.</div>

<h2>            Microsoft App Store</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I opened up the Microsoft App Store, and I have windows 8 system and I wanted to upgrade to windows 8.1, However&nbsp;when I access the store, when I press on the upgrade 8.1, it presses but it doesn't respond, and when I clicked on all of the other things in
 the store, they don't respond either. I got my laptop 2 days ago, and I have also signed up for Microsoft account and verified it. and I am connected to the internet</p>

            <p>Hello DonaldAmo, <br />
<br />
In addition to the information from Arya, if you are trying to copy a large amount of files, you might want to consider RoboCopy. Robocopy is for Robust File Copy for Windows. It is included in Windows 7 and has different switches for options like copying subdirectories.
<br />
<br />
Look at the following link for documentation or at a command prompt, type robocopy /?.<br />

Hope this helps.</p>
