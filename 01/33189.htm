<h2>            Rotating display on netbook running Win7 Starter</h2>
                    I have a new netbook running windows 7 starter edition -- I would like to rotate the display to portrait for ebook reading -- but CTRL+ALT+Right arrow doesn't do anything, nor are there any screen rotation properties available in the display properties
 available by right-clicking on the desktop. What can be done?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You can right-click the desktop and select 'Screen resolution'. There should be an option for Orientation. It defaults to landscape, and portrait should be what you need.<br />
If for some reason you do not have the Screen Resoltuion option, try this. <br />
<br />
Click START and type&gt; Change Screen Resolution&nbsp; &gt; press Enter.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps<br />
<br />

<h2>            Buyer beware - Microsoft stops servicing devices after they release new model</h2>
                    <p>Based on my recent experience Microsoft does not offer service or repair after a new model is released.&nbsp; Beware that if you purchase a Microsoft device (e.g., Surface), they may refuse to repair it even if you are willing to pay for the repair.&nbsp; Thus, the
 lifetime of your device may be limited.&nbsp; They just refused to repair or service my Surface 3, which needs a new charging port.&nbsp; My device is in excellent condition otherwise.&nbsp; Their response was to buy the new model (Surface Go).&nbsp; Why should I spend hundreds
 on a new device that does not have substantially better specs when my device works well and only needs a ~$20 repair (including labor)?&nbsp; What level of customer service and product quality guarantee is provided by Microsoft when they will not even stand behind
 their own devices by offering support and service for the device's lifetime.&nbsp; All I asked for was for them to offer service and repair, which I was willing to pay for.</p>

            <div>Yes, the support duration seems much shorter than it should be considering that</div>
<div>the Surface PRO 3 was released in June 2014 and is still supported while the</div>
<div>Surface 3 was released a year later in May 2015 and is not. And they set the</div>
<div>lifetime of the Surface 3.. However, Microsoft has never repaired OR replaced</div>
<div>parts. They've always replaced with a complete refurbished device. At a cost of</div>
<div>$400 or so for a Surface 3. If you REALLY want another Surface 3, you might find</div>
<div>one on Amazon -</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>HOWEVER, do you know for sure that it is the port itself that is damaged as</div>
<div>we've seen that the USB charging cables on these S3's go bad and prevent</div>
<div>charging. I personally ran into this problem. There are very few third party</div>
<div>chargers and combinations of cables/plugs that will charge a Surface 3. I</div>
<div>learned this one myself.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft actually stopped selling the original replacement official charger for</div>
<div>the Surface 3 (as opposed to the Pro 3 where you can still purchase official</div>
<div>chargers). When mine died for no apparent reason, after I learned that all micro</div>
<div>USB cables were not equal and that power supplies mattered, I purchased</div>
<div><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KWY703I/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01KWY703I/</a> and</div>

<div>ever since. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Microsoft Stores in the US have test chargers (none for sale) If you are in</div>
<div>the US, you should go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store</div>
<div><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/find-a-store</a> so if you are in</div>
<div>the US, you could visit a store and verify it is the charger. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But again, the original chargers have not been available for some time and you</div>
<div>will need a third party combo. </div>

    <title>Barulho no console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucaspsilva1985  say:</h3>
<h2>            Barulho no console</h2>
                    
<p>E ae Gamers, comprei Gears 2 e meu console faz muito barulho quando roda o jogo. Não é só na inicialização do jogo, é durante o jogo inteiro. Antes de comprar este jogo havia alugado Red Dead Redemption e fez o mesmo barulho, parecia que o console iria levantar
 vôo. Achei que era problema da mídia, troquei o jogo na locadora, mas com jogo novo foi uma facada no meio do peito. Pior que isso eu liguei no suporte e eles ficaram de enviar uma caixa para que meu console fosse reparado e estou esperando a quase um mês,
 eles informam que em 7 dias estarei recebendo a caixa mas... já é a segunda vez que eu solicito e nada! Manos eu estou há quase um mês sem jogar!!! Tá fogo...</p>

<p>Alguém passou por isso?</p>

<p>Me ajudem ae, por favor!!!</p>

<p>Abraço!</p>

<p>Eles não iriam falar no lançamento do console que ele faz muito barulho. Se tiver espaço no seu console da pra você instalar sim, faz isso que é melhor e ele vai durar muito mais.</p>

<p>Hi Mohamed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might be experiencing this issue because of corrupted search index, or the Windows Search service is not working properly. To diagnose and fix this problem, we suggest that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
run the System File Checker tool</a>. This utility allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend that you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12373/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
download any pending updates</a> that need to be installed through Windows Update and check if it helps resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, let's rebuild the search index on your computer. Please note that while the steps to initiate the rebuilding process are simple and quick, the actual process you are initiating can take quite some time depending on how much data Windows
 has to index. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start Menu</strong>, and select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>If you are in <em>Category</em> view, change the view in the upper-right part of Control Panel to
<strong>Large icons</strong> or <strong>Small icons</strong>.</li><li>After changing the view, select <strong>Indexing Options</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Advanced</strong> button to open the <em>Advanced Options</em> dialog box.</li><li>In the <em>Index Settings</em> tab, under <em>Troubleshooting</em>, click <strong>
Rebuild</strong>.</li></ol>
<br />
<p>Keep us updated with the results, and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p><span>Hi Mary Tully,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to make your printer work on windows 7, suggest you to check if the printer is compatible with Windows
 7. To check for compatibility visit the below mentioned link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</a>.
 If it is not compatible in windows 7, try the compatibility in Vista. <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Default.aspx?type=Hardware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Default.aspx?type=Hardware</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is not compatible, suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and check for the printer that is compatible
 with Windows 7. Install the latest/updated driver and verify if it is working fine.</span></p>

    <title>8000FFFF Error when Installing Service Pack 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 2rchfbks  say:</h3>
<h2>            8000FFFF Error when Installing Service Pack 1</h2>
                    <p>I have not been able to install Service Pack 1 on my version of Windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I try to install the Service Pack from Windows Update it gets to 30% complete in the downloading phase and fails with the error code 8000FFFF</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I downloaded the file (windows6.1-KB976932-X64) and ran it. The progress bar gets to about 80% full and then fails with the error code 8000FFFF.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have run the Windows Troubleshooter. It says it has repaired Windows Update components but the Service Pack still will not install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have run the Microsoft FixIt tool (MicrosoftFixit50202) with and without the aggressive options and the Service Pack still will not install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have run the System Update Readiness tool (Windows6.1-KB947821-v12-x64) and the Service Pack still will not install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have disabled the Avira AntiVir free version and ran the updater and the Service Pack still will not install.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have run checkdisk and found no errors. I have run memcheck and found no errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas? Let me know if there are any logfiles that would help sort this out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Thanks to the help of <span>
Laura Li at MS support I have resolved the issue.<br />
<br />
I had to use the Windows 7 disk to update and repair my Windows System files (specifically the NT framework - a message came up after the installation which stated this).<br />
<br />
I'm glad I could update without having to do a clean install of Windows 7! <br />

            Hey kudrach,
<br />
<br />You have to render the video, that's a project file. Under File (on the top left), there should be an option to *export* the video. I'm not sure what Movie Maker version you are using, but it all depends. There may be a "Save video" option on the newer one, which you can use to save a whole video. Save project is to only save data about your project, the video is not encoded at all.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any other questions or concerns, otherwise I hope this has been helpful.

            Hi  kudrach, that file is just the porject file in Movie Maker, you need to use Movie Maker to produce (render) the final video, using the 'Export' button on the File menu

<p>Hi Melissa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype ID or Skype Name is different from your email address. Since the migration of Skype accounts to Microsoft accounts, the option to create a unique Skype Name has been
<em>removed</em>. This is because we want to focus on&nbsp;allowing you to login-in with a single sign-in to Microsoft services with just one password.​</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you created your Skype account using an email address or a phone number, here are the steps on how you can find your Skype ID:</span></p>

<h2>            No sound on Windows 10 Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>After uploading the new software for Windows 10, I accessed Moviemaker and recorded a video,&nbsp;however I do not have sound. I see my mouth moving but nothing is coming out. Parts in the video where I added music plays, but the recorded part of me talking...there
 is no sound. I've checked several postings on Youtube but they do not seem to help with my issue. I will say what those steps are so this posting is productive:

<p>After the bar pop up/scroll and stop, click on <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>Done .... close out and re-open your video and it should play. </p>
<p>DIDN'T WORK! &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Install Windows error after hard reset&#59; new PC originally with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello - </p>
<p>
</p><p>Our teenager has a relatively new laptop (August 2016, HP, Windows 10) and was creating folders on an SD card in the computer when it locked up. She did a hard reboot and also took the card out in a fit of panic. Upon turning on the computer, windows won't
 load and she gets an install windows error: "Windows could not complete the installation. To install Windows on this computer, restart the installation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates are automatic, and she isn't aware if any were performed today.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help or advice you can provide! </p>

<p>Thank you for your reply! We are getting the error message on a black screen. Initially, the computer tries to boot, and the blue Windows screen comes up. It says administrator instead of her profile, but never actually loads. The circle is loading under
 administrator when the screen turns black (still lit, but black) and the message comes up.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to get to safe mode but can't seem to access it by the older methods (shift + f8) during boot. How can I access it if we can't load Windows?</p>

    <title>Bluetooth headset on Surface Pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaygourley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth headset on Surface Pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Can someone tell me how Windows sound is supposed to work with a Bluetooth headset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you pair a Bluetooth headset with the Surface, it creates a headphone device and a headset device, which makes perfect sense.&nbsp; Just guessing, I assume the headphones device is supposed to be the default playback device and the headset is supposed to
 be the default recording device and the default communications playback device.&nbsp; That too would make sense.&nbsp; It works okay with a wired headset plugged into the Surface audio jack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But neither voice recorder, iTunes, Groove Music, nor Skype will work with a Bluetooth headset using these settings. &nbsp; I've tried with two different Bluetooth headsets.&nbsp; I'm not at all sure, but it looks like the apps and Windows sound settings are always
 on different pages.&nbsp; Some apps sometimes use devices that are not the default device.&nbsp; Most apps don't allow you to control which device they use.&nbsp; This is really confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you have to do to make a Bluetooth headset work on a Surface Pro?</p>

<p>You're right, Barb.&nbsp; I have since discovered that this particular problem is unique to the Apple AirPods.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still a little confused though.&nbsp; After I paired the AirPods to my Surface Pro 4, the Settings: "Bluetooth &amp; other devices" showed only headphones paired, not headphones and headset.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I went to the older Windows Sounds: Playback and Record tabs from the systray speaker icon.&nbsp; I saw the headset as a recording device.&nbsp; And I saw both the headset and headphones as a playback devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite that, I couldn't get the AirPods to work as a headset.&nbsp; They can be made to work as headphones only if you tell the Sounds menu to disconnect the mysterious headset that it shows there.&nbsp; Even though other Bluetooth headsets pair and work fine just
 as you described.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read some postings in other forums, where people got other non-Surface Windows 10 platforms with other Bluetooth chipsets to work by getting drivers that include some kind of "assist" function.&nbsp; So maybe the problem could be solved by a more advanced driver
 for the Surface Bluetooth chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution to the problem though is to return the AirPods to Apple and wait for some smarter and more resolute than me (like you) to solve this problem.</p>

<h2>            Game wont start up and i keep getting kicked to the home screen</h2>
                    
<p>Every time i try to load up overwatch, it will act like it is starting up but then kick me back to the home page. It doesn't happen with any other games. I have tried unplugging the power box and leaving it for 30 seconds, hard restarting and even uninstalling
 the game and re downloading it but it didn't fix anything. Although a few days ago while I was playing overwatch, I would complete a match but then my characters wouldn't load. You could still hear people talking and the next game starting but it would still
 be stuck on that frame. I would try to press the home button but that wouldn't do anything so i would have to shut off my xbox and if i tried to turn it on either it would just do the same thing, let me play for a little bit then freeze up or it would get
 stuck on the green xbox loading screen. This has happened before with bo3 and destiny but usually i would just leave my xbox unplugged for a few days then start it up and it would be normal, but both of those games still work fine. Also I did take the overwatch
 to my friend's house and it did work and start up on his xbox one. But if anyone could help me with getting my game to work and if you know why my xbox does that, it would be much appreciated!</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Missing Icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alejo1707  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Missing Icons</h2>
                    <p>Ok so I know what you are thinking, but this is not the regular go to personalize and activate the Trash Bin shortcut, this is more like "**** happened? kind of post".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I woke up and turned on my computer, no problems whatsoever until I signed on, my desktop icons where gone!!! The shortcuts are still there, but they have no icon above them, just the words. Maybe the icons were disabled? Well, no, they are
 fully enabled but missing. When I enter the File Explorer I have another pretty surprise, all the left side bar icons are gone as well, so I googled how to clean the icon cache and followed the steps for it, the cache is recreated but the icons are still missing;
 I am considering fully reinstall my system, but before I do it I wanna try the community help or some Microsoft representative.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.D.: All programs work fine, but I'm missing icons everywhere but the start menu, even the ones in the task bar are missing; my installation is hard to look at right now. I am fully updated as well and ran a Malware and Antivirus, as well as a registry
 cleaner, literally I have no idea what's going on. OH!!! And I did sfc scan and it shows no errors either.<br />

<h2>            Software Warranty Expired&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I received a call from someone claiming to be from&nbsp;Microsoft who advised my computer's software warranty expired?&nbsp;They needed to help me fix my computer and asked for my computer id.&nbsp; &nbsp;I gave them my ID so they could remote access into my computer.&nbsp; This
 turned out to be a sales pitch or scam.&nbsp; Now I feel my computer's security is compromised.&nbsp; What can I do to change my id and prevent hackers or viruses etc.?&nbsp; Hope anyone can help. Thanks,</p>

<h2>            injustice gods among us ultimate edition dlc</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased injustice gods among us ultimate edition on the xbox live store. I downloaded the game successfully however upon playing none of the additional content is available. Is there a trick to acessing the dlc that I am missing or did I not
 receive the ultimate edition as advertised and paid for (59.99 vs 30ish for the regular version)?</p>

                    <p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">UPDATE 2:</span></span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>So, I have recently retested GTA 5 performance with the following tweaks:</strong><br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">- Downclock the CPU to 3,700 MHz</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">- Disable Hyper Threading and Intel VT</span><br />

<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">- Disable Base Clock &amp; PCI-E Spread Spectrum</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">- Disable HPET using cmd command and the Device Manager</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">- Enable Threaded Optimization in NVIDIA Control Panel</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">I noticed more frametime spikes and long stuttering after applying mentioned tweaks without any FPS lock.</span><br />
<strong>But</strong><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">, with 150 FPS lock there was no drops or any similar issues in GTA 5.</span><br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>UPDATE 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Just an hour ago I did:</strong><br />
1. Disconnect my Aorus GTX 1080 Ti physically from the motherboard.<br />
2. Uninstall NVIDIA Driver 391.35 with Display Driver Uninstaller.<br />
3. Switch to the Intel's Integrated Graphics, download and install the latest Intel VGA driver.<br />
4. Lower all GTA 5 graphics settings to minimum and set 800*680 screen resolution.<br />
5. Start playing.<br />
<br />
The average performance was about 72 FPS. But drops and frame time spikes still happened at lowest possible graphics settings with 800*680 resolution! I'm really disappointed. Issue didn't go away even WITHOUT GPU and NVIDIA driver.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then I opened the Latency Monitor and started playing GTA 5 again. After 5 minutes of gameplay I switched to LatencyMon and noticed that highest DPC latency was about 202 ms (instead of normal 30-90 ms) for this driver
<strong>"Wdf01000.sys - Kernel Mode Driver Framework Runtime, Microsoft Corporation"</strong>. I think that WIndows 10 is the culprit but not 100% sure.<br />
<br />

</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Hi community,</strong><br />
<br />
It's sad to say, but there are serious FPS drops/spikes/freeze and micro stuttering in almost all the games on my new self-built high-end PC with Intel i7 8700K + Aorus NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080 Ti.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Please Note:</span><br />
1. PC specifications, Windows 10 &amp; Software configurations are below in this topic.<br />
2. I use Google Drive for image/docs hosting instead of other specialized sites in terms of security (sorry Imgur fans).<br />
3. All images, screenshots and documents mentioned in this topic are stored in the shared Google Drive folder available at the following

<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Warning!</span><br />
I figured out that only with NVIDIA 388.13 Driver MSI Afterburner's "Power" monitoring option cause enormous FPS drops and especially stuttering in absolutely any game every time MSI AB refresh values in hardware monitor. This depends directly on hardware polling
 period in AB settings. Therefore, I recommend you to disable "Power" monitoring feature to prevent issue with future or other NVIDIA drivers.<br />
<br />
<strong>Introduction</strong><br />
<br />
FPS drops/stutters are very noticeable in GTA 5, The Witcher 3 and War Thunder (very laggy hangar). There are almost no drops in recently released World of Tanks 1.0. Every game's graphics settings are set to Max/Ultra values without any type of sync or FPS
 lock.<br />
<br />
All PC hardware have been purchased from trusted local vendors with original seal and warranty from the official manufacturer. PC was precisely built by me without any mistakes, with all the manual/PC building guides requirements.<br />
<br />
Enough intro, let's dig in!<br />
<br />
<strong>GTA 5 — FPS Drops/Stuttering</strong><br />
<br />
I have read that I'm not the first player who catch these kinds of issues. But this Rockstar child is especially laggy on my rig. FPS drops occur after each 1-2 minutes of gameplay with high average FPS, particularly noticeable when flying and aiming at the
 police helicopters on the background of the skybox.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also I know that GTA 5 game engine doesn't allow more than 188 FPS. For the first time, I thought that the game is just the culprit because of the 188 FPS engine lock and Grand Theft Auto 5 porting from consoles. But now I'm think that troubles arise due to
 software or much worse hardware fault.<br />

<br />
<strong>The Witcher 3 — FPS Drops/Stuttering</strong><br />
<br />
Well, I didn't expect any problems with this CD Projekt great-optimized masterpiece game due to very positive feedback on all game platforms and tons of articles like "The most optimized game ever". Unfortunately, of course, not on my rig.<br />
<br />
Drops are rarely and less noticeable compared with Grand Theft Auto but they ARE, and this an issue. Usually, I notice them while moving, Roach riding or fighting with monsters and guards. And the biggest sorrow is that there is no workaround for this awesome
 game.<br />

<br />
<strong>World of Tanks 1.0 — FPS Drops Only</strong><br />
<br />
What about this MMO, I didn't catch any spikes up to yesterday evening, when I decided to play a test battle to show that only one game can run smoothly on my high-end PC without any issues. But what was my disappointment when I found out that WOT wasn't as
 seamless as I expected.<br />
<br />
I noticed only one drop to 18.7 FPS after 8 minutes of battle. It's the first huge FPS drop<br />
in the last month playing WOT. Till this moment the maximum frames drawdown wasn't below 53.8 FPS and it only happened after my tank was destroyed.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WOT graphics settings was set to Ultra preset and 100% 3D Render Resolution without any other changes. Screenshots are not needed there. Also, I missed a moment of FPS drop and didn't have time to take a screenshot, so there are only MSI AB graphs.<br />
<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VFcBiO9sL62leixwwPKJiEGzta9K6SaS?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MSI Afterburner Graphs</a></span><br />
<br />
<strong>What I tried to do and that DID NOT HELP any game:</strong><br />
1. <a href="https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/1004600/geforce-drivers/all-games-stuttering-with-fps-drops-since-windows-10-creators-update/post/5235141/#5235141" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Marts_Sum's method</a> with EmptyStandbyList on GeForce Forum.<br />
2. Set UEFI (BIOS) and Windows 10 to default settings.<br />
3. Roll back to Windows 10 Anniversary Builds 1703, 1607 and fresh reinstall of 1709.<br />
4. Disable/Enable: Windows Defender, Firewall, Cortana, Game DVR/Game Bar/Game Mode, all unnecessary services/drivers/startup items, indexing, consumers features, power modes (Balanced/High performance/Power saver), hibernation, SWAP &amp; PAGE files, Fast Boot
 (in UEFI as well) and LAN by unpluging an Ethernet cable.<br />
5. Reinstall/Reconfigure all possible old/new drivers and firmwares from official sites. Also tried to use DDU.<br />
6. Overclock/Downclock GPU, CPU and turn on/off XMP Profile (3,200 MHz).<br />
7. Install other overclocking software.<br />
8. Uninstall all Windows 10 built-in apps.<br />
9. Uninstall MSI Afterburner &amp; RTSS.<br />
10. Paused MSI AB Hardware Monitor and disable "Power" monitoring option.&nbsp;<br />
11. Reinstall game from M.2 SSD to 7,200 RPM HDD and vice versa.<br />
12. Lower down/max out graphics settings, screen resolution and refresh rate.<br />
13. Run as Administrator and disable/enable Fullscreen Optimization.<br />
14. Switch to integrated Intel® UHD Graphics 630.<br />
15. Install GTA 5 and The Witcher 3 on NASA computer in the hope of getting rid of FPS drops and stuttering. =)<br />
<br />
<strong>What I tried to do and that SOMEHOW HELPS (unfortunately only for GTA 5):</strong><br />
1. Lock up to 150 FPS and less using the Rivatuner Statistic Server.<br />
2. Enable VSync. But I rarely notice some drops down to 32 FPS, better than falling down to 5-8 FPS but not worth it. Also, high input lag doesn't make this method a pill from all the illnesses.<br />
3. Hope it will be soon thanks to your helpful tips.<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
<br />
I hope that I gave you enough information to find out the reason. Unfortunately, I still haven't found any permanent way to play games without these killers of the game experience.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let it be a software fault, because I really don't want to send my hardware to a service center, and I definitely don't know which part of the PC causes problems.<br />
<br />
<strong>Questions</strong><br />
<br />
1. So, dear readers, do you know any advices, workarounds and working fixes?<br />
2. Or, maybe, any official confirmation from NVIDIA, Microsoft and Intel that is 100%&nbsp; related to their software failure instead of hardware defect?<br />
3. If FPS drops and stuttering caused by hardware, сan you roughly determine what is the culprit and where to dig?<br />
<br />
Thank you very much for the attention!<br />
I will be very grateful for any of your help!<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Compatibility issue between game settings and PC specs is one the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We'd like to get additional information to help isolate the issue. Kindly answer the following question below:
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you met the system requirements to play the games on ultra high settings?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried to lower the graphics settings? If yes, is the issue also occur on lower settings?<br />
</li><li>Are you noticing any overheating issue whenever FPS drops?<br />
</li><li>Are you using a graphics driver from the manufacturer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Compatibility issue between game settings and PC specs is one the possible reasons why this issue is happening. We'd like to get additional information to help isolate the issue. Kindly answer the following question below:
<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you met the system requirements to play the games on ultra high settings?<br />
</li><li>Have you tried to lower the graphics settings? If yes, is the issue also occur on lower settings?<br />
</li><li>Are you noticing any overheating issue whenever FPS drops?<br />
</li><li>Are you using a graphics driver from the manufacturer?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll keep an eye out for your response.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Answers to your questions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Of course. It's the top PC with i7 8700K and GTX 1080 Ti. It's "overmet"&nbsp;<span>the system requirements to play the games on ultra high settings.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Yes. I tried to lower&nbsp;</span><span>the graphics settings down to Minimum Preset and 800*680 resolution. And issue occur at this settings too!</span></p>
<p><span>3. No overheating of CPU or GPU. I have awesome air cooling solution. Temperature don't grow up higher than 63C for CPU and 58C for GPU. CPU &amp; GPU fans start working at 100% duty cycle when a temperature of both rich
 higher than 50C.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Sure. NVIDIA drivers from here:&nbsp;</span>https://www.geforce.com/drivers</p>
<p><span>All other drivers form here:&nbsp;</span>https://www.asus.com/us/Motherboards/ROG-MAXIMUS-X-HERO/HelpDesk_Download/</p>
<p><span>DirectX &amp; Visual C++ from Microsoft Download Center.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important note</strong></p>
<p>Just an hour ago I did:<br />
1. Disconnect my Aorus GTX 1080 Ti physically from the motherboard.<br />
2. Uninstall NVIDIA Driver 391.35 with Display Driver Uninstaller.<br />
3. Switch to the Intel's Integrated Graphics, download and install the latest Intel VGA driver.<br />
4. Lower all GTA 5 graphics settings to minimum and set 800*680 screen resolution.<br />
5. Start playing.<br />
<br />
The average performance was about 72 FPS. But drops and frame time spikes still happened at lowest possible graphics settings with 800*680 resolution! I'm really disappointed. Issue didn't go away even WITHOUT GPU and NVIDIA driver.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then I opened the Latency Monitor and started playing GTA 5 again. After 5 minutes of gameplay I switched to LatencyMon and noticed that highest DPC latency was about 202 ms (instead of normal 30-90 ms) for this driver "Wdf01000.sys - Kernel Mode Driver Framework
 Runtime, Microsoft Corporation". I think that WIndows 10 is the culprit but not 100% sure.<br />
<br />
You can check the MSI Afterburner GTA 5 log.hml available in the Google Drive folder:&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14DrbFKVLNyiAG4zBtAWWF6soUT91ApyY?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a>
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>P.S.</span></p>
<p><span>Maybe your MS 1709 build or NVIDIA driver (not sure about "green guys") cause these&nbsp; issues?&nbsp; Because there are extremely huge amount of complains after 1709 Creators Update and latest NVIDIA drivers.</span></p>

<p>Sorry, but your tips is as obvious as possible.</p>
<p>I don't use AV and your Corporation's Defender. I tried more hardcore things that just defrag the HDD.</p>
<p>I tried to find MS full support site but MS've not it except from useless chat where employee can't eve access official NVIDIA forum because of "Group Policy" on their PC. It's ridiculous how a giant international corporation haven't even a support portal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you link me with MS development department or someone related to it? I'm 100% sure that they know more than enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>MS announced that Windows 10 1803 Redstone build will be release today. I tried to rescan for Win updates a lot of times but didn't find anything. Well, whats going wrong? Still not ready?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Man,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it seems to be games related issue. No positive changes after 1803 installing. I still haven't any answer from NVIDIA support team.</p>
<p>Now I'm closing eyes on this frame time spikes and play "most optimized game ever" PUBG. Nice rofl, right? How I like PUBG Corp. damn bad coding. =)</p>

<p>Hi, all!<br />
<br />
Also having these issues, but for me it got a bit worse form Creators Update, and then it just trashed my laptop's performance since 1803. I'm all out of possibilities, and also out of excuses to never use Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>From here on, this is a rant:</p>
<p>I would also like to say to every customer support agent ever (except AMD, cause they apparently read the emails I send them, and answer accordingly): We are not dumb. Most of the users complaining over these problems come to you because you keep making
 messes with every new update. Just Google (don't Bing it) ''_________ problem windows 10''. Literally thousands of results.&nbsp; It worked before, it doesn't work now. The only thing in the equation that changed is YOUR product, i.e. OS. Hence, the problem is
 the update/OS. Don't pin it down to games (even pirated), bad drivers, etc. I've changed BIOS settings multiple times (which means I've tried everything in between, from reinstalling drivers, on multiple occasions, using multiple methods, to disabling all
 kinds of features of the OS and the game, tried all the compatibility modes, clean installing OS, etc.) - nothing changed. One thing to keep in mind: since 1803 update my fps halved, and I have so much stutter that it rendered all my games (not just the online
 ones) unplayable. On the other hand, at about the same time new Ubuntu came out, 18.04 LTS. And AMD followed suit, saying: These are the files, install them, if they don't work now, they will, we're still getting stuff figured out. And I obliged, I installed
 it. Then I installed Playonlinux. And then a game that I have 13 fps in on Windows 10. And you know what? It rocks. I'm getting 40-50 fps on maxed out graphics, without any stutter. It is, actually, better than the game ever was on Windows (and remember, this
 is a game run on community developed emulation free software, not multi-billion dollar company backed expensive software). So don't come here all smug and tell Subminder to ''restart his pc'' or some easy bs like that. We've tried it. It doesn't work. Instead,
 get your **** together and put out a good update, for once. That hasn't happened in over a year.</p>

<h2>            Re-enable Windows Apps to Run in Background</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I reinstalled Win10 1803 and the setup was a bit different than what I was used to.&nbsp; I ended up accidentally turning off several apps from running in the background.&nbsp; It appears one or two of the apps, Settings and Edge, need to run in the background
 for Windows Spotlight to work.&nbsp; Now when I go in to re-enable them, only 2 apps that I left running are listed.</p>

            <p>Thanks for reaching out, SUVZ!&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>To clarify, the season pass itself wouldn't need installing - it's just a license that grants you access to DLC&nbsp;as the DLC&nbsp;is released. It may not have a tile associated with it when you <a href="http://xbx.lv/IamJoo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manage add-ons for a game</a>, but as long as it's showing on your account, it should still give you access to DLC that's granted by the season pass, as it releases. </p><p><br /></p><p>If you see any trouble with accessing specific DLC included in the season pass when it's released, reach out here and let us know!&nbsp;</p>
