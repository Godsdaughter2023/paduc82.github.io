    <title>KB4499164 fails on Windows 7 Pro with Error 80004005 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            KB4499164 fails on Windows 7 Pro with Error 80004005</h2>
                    <p>80004005 is a singularly unhelpful error code. :(</p>
<p>The saga so far:</p>
<p>o Turned off AV (Avast) and tried again</p>
<p>o Disconnected USB devices (except for mouse) and tried again</p>
<p>o Installed KB4490628 and tried again</p>
<p>o Downloaded Windows6.1-KB4499164-x64.msu and tried that</p>
<p>OS: Win 7 SP1 Build 7601</p>
<p>HW: M5A97EVO</p>
<p>Graphics: ATI HD4800 (0x9442)</p>
<p>CPU: AMD Phenom 810</p>
<p>A solution would be nice, failing that, any suggestions as to what to try next would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To whom it may concern. Having a generic "it failed" error code doesn't help us little guys out on the bleeding edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Rgds, -H-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: Problem solved for me, see below for details. Also, if you have multi-boot issues/concerns, there are some Windows 7 + Windows 10 issues should know about if you don't already. See my replies below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A hearty thank you to all who provided help with this issue. There's a lot of good general problem-solving stuff here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that others who have posted here may *still* have this issue. Please feel free to keep posting if you can help them. -H-</p>

<p>I have the same still unresolved problem but with error code 80071A91.</p>
<p>Startup of desktop goes thru two and a half cycles of configuring updates, rebooting, and reverting changes.</p>
<p>It takes about 5 minutes to start up.</p>
<p>Strangely, I got a phone call that said "All services are suspended.&nbsp; This is an emergency call from Microsoft".</p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft is working on a solution.</p>

<p>I notice that kb 4499164 is the old MAY 14 Monthly Roll-up.</p>
<p>You may already have a later Roll-up installed ???</p>
<p>Possibly the June / July or August Roll-up.</p>
<p>As it states not compatible i would not worry to much providing the later ones work.</p>
<p>One suggestion would be try installing the Windows 7 Compatibility Update and let it check / run.</p>

<p>Try installing the Windows 7 compatibility Update. and let it run.</p>
<p>You may have to turn on the Customer Experience Improvement Program setting if you have turned it off for it to work effectively.</p>
<p>To find it&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the Start Menu.</p>
<p>Type in :&nbsp; change customer experience&nbsp; improvement program settings.</p>
<p>Open it in the drop down.</p>
<p>Select : yes i want to participate in the program.</p>
<p>Apply the setting.</p>
<p>You can later go back to it and turn it off again.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p>With XP you can do a refresh install without really touching the current applications and data.</p>
<p><strong>Refresh XP Installation.</strong> <br />
<br />
Boot from the XP original CD. Skip the first screen that offers Console Repair, and continue as though you install a New XP.<br />
<br />
After you Agree etc., the new install screen will come on and would detect the current XP installation.<br />
<br />
Choose the Repair option by Pressing R for Repair.<br />
<br />
Use it, would take about 45Min. and you will have a Refreshed Installation of XP while keeping all your data and XP configuration.<br />
<br />
P.S. If you made changes to WinXP Security setting (Like Firewall special permission), you have to look over them after the refresh since they might revert to the Default.</p>

<h2>            Windows Updates - How to tell which updates to install</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows Updates</p>
<p>1. I am receiving a large amount of updates that&nbsp;are given as "ready&nbsp;for update" &nbsp;that would appear to be repeated versions. Will reviised or repeated updated &nbsp;versions replace exisiting version simply by selecting update, or is it necessary to unistall
 past versions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. All updated are marked as important - how do&nbsp;I decipher critical updates and install these - as opposed to spending time and data on installing everything?</p>

<p>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/910339 </p>
<p>Hide Windows 7 Updates that you do not Ever Want to Install</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff382716.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff382716.aspx</a></p>
<p>My recommendation would be to install the updates in batches, such 5 at a time, exclude hardware/driver updates. Avoid installing a combination of Microsoft Windows and Office updates at the same time. Also, try installing the small updates first. Avoid
 installing things like .NET Framework and SQL Express Updates.</p>
<p>Restart each time you install the updates (its a chore, but it guarantees a more reliable experience). Try starting out with Microsoft Office Updates for programs such as (Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint).</p>
<p>Another thing, try downloading the updates then install them. When prompted to restart, disconnect from the Internet and restart your computer.</p>
<p>Proceed with installing the additional updates.</p>
<p>If the computer continues to become non-responsive, try the following:</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>You can reset Windows Update components by running the Fixit on this page. But, if there's malware present, it will continue to reset the connection to the update servers:</p>
<p>How do I reset Windows Update components</p>
<p>&lt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058&gt;</p>
<p>Suggest you download and save the Fixit. Then configure the system to Clean boot prior to running it:</p>
<p>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista/Windows 7</p>
<p>&lt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135&gt;</p>
<p>Once the Fixit has been downloaded and the system booted to the Clean state, check to see that the native Windows firewall is now On if a 3rd party firewall was being used previously. Now run the Fixit and choose the Default mode. Restart once it's done
 and see if the system can connect to the update servers. If it can not, then run the Fixit again and choose the Aggressive mode. Restart when it's finished running and check for updates.</p>
<p>I suggest before shutting down and installing any updates, disconnect from the Internet first.</p>

    <title>Xbox App DVR only records 40 seconds of a game - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidzhangzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox App DVR only records 40 seconds of a game</h2>
                    <p>I notice this problem while recording in the game CrossFire. Other games are fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is that however I try to record the gameplay, it would only generate a 40-45 seconds video after I stop the recording, even though I've started the recording for more than 10 mins already.</p>
<p>Again, as I said, other games work absolutely fine.</p>
<p>All help is appreciated!</p>

<h2>            My admin password doesn&#39;t work when logged into other users on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My son has a user on our Windows 10 pc. When we are logged into his account and try to perform admin-rights operations, then my admin password (Microsoft account) is wrong (it says wrong username or passw).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm logged into my account (admin), then there are no such problems because I don't have to specify any password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that the Windows 10 admin-password is different from the Microsoft-account password for the admin user?</p>
<p>If so, then how can I specify the W10 admin-password for my account ?</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Have you checked that when you use your admin password you also use  your Microsoft Account email?
<br />To perform admin action with a standard user, you need to insert your admin email and password.
<br />Try checking this, then tell me if you have the same problem.
<br />Eventually upload a screenshot of the admin-level authorization window.

Can you access the computer in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot?<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do<br />
not have a Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also<br />
your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

<br />
Also from the COMMAND PROMPT of Recovery Console (if possible) or a Vista disk<br />
<br />
SFC /scannow<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
and after that runs <br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
Hit Enter<br />
<br />
( Spaces between C and /&nbsp;&nbsp; k and /&nbsp; and f and /&nbsp;)<br />
<br />
Retry Startup Repair after Chkdsk.<br />
<br />
If needed after those you can try System Restore from the Recovery or Vista disk.<br />

    <title>Need to fix Windows Installer package problem where it says during - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phillip underwood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to fix Windows Installer package problem where it says during either an install or uninstall, &#39;A program run as part of the setup did not finish as expected.&#39;</h2>
                    The vendor software is PTPublisher for a disc duplicator called Brave SE Disc Publisher/AutoPrinter, a costly machine to duplicate DVDs and CDs and print on the media.&nbsp; I cannot install the latest version of the software because during the install process,
 the PTPublisher install puts out a message as follows:&nbsp; 'There is a problem with this Windows Installer package.&nbsp; A program un as part of the setup did not finish as expected.&nbsp; Contact your support personnel or package vendor.&nbsp; I did this, working the level
 1 and level 2&nbsp; vendor's tech support but could not get the install to work.&nbsp; Out of desperation, we tried uninstalling the application (PTPublisher) and got the exact same message during the install. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type “services.msc” in the Start search box and hit “Enter.”</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>Scroll down and look for "Windows Installer" under the “Name” column.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click “Windows Installer” and click “Properties.”</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click “Apply” and click “OK.”</p>

<br />
<br />Based on my research, the .BG extension is associated with Backgammon for Windows.
<br />
<br />You could try the following:
<br />
<br />point to one of the .bg files, right click it 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, click Change
<br />Choose Photos
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />Try opening the JPEG
<br />
<br />If that does not work, right click the .bg file, click Open with, click Paint to see if it opens.

    <title>Trying AGAIN to back up computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gmt3010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trying AGAIN to back up computer</h2>
                    <p>Greetings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't find my original question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP probook, which is&nbsp; a notebook with a fancy name. I have been backing up quite well for months, since November, weekly, since a reburbished hard drive was installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 7 pro 64 bit. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One night the back up just failed. I did not add any hardware. It was the same external WD 2T drive. It was not full. Plenty of room. I didn't add any software. I really can't recall anything that changed. I am at a loss. That doesn't mean something didn't
 happen that I don't get, but it's beyond me. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded this software from WD and checked both my WD internal hard drive 1T and my external both the 2T and a 4T, and all check out. I also did diskchk (?) on the hard drive and it fixed sectors but I doubt it found anything wrong.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am trying AGAIN as I really would like to back this up, because I fear soon I probably should get a new hard drive at least, I have an i5 processor and I see they are still selling i3 (sorry if my abreviations are off) I also have upgraded my RAM to
 8G which is plenty for my uses, and basically, I really don't need to get another notebook now. I just need to try to figure out why this won't back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time, just a few minutes ago, I created a recovery disk, thinking well maybe that what it wants me to do. That seemed to go okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Then I started with a back up and OF COURSE I get the red line I COULD JUST SCREAM.&nbsp; It did show two things I tried to look up:</p>
<p>
</p><p>problems were with "application VSS and SPP event logs" -- or info in those logs. Well of course I tried to find those logs in my notebook but NOT. i found something that looked like some file I am totally unfamiliar with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE can someone help? YOu take a BIG CHANCE when you seek help because OF COURSE someone running a scam with soon call and claim they are microsoft which, most people should get it by now, that is bogus and a scam. I tried to report two phone calls on
 this site but my submission would not go through and I gave up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the drives. I think, sincerely, this has to do with that STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, STUPID, WINDOWS 7 PRO thing where you share. I got some message on one of my tries that said somethign about the shared folders. I can't reproduce that. Sometimes
 this notebook alters things and I don't know what happened. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had issues since with my outlook -- I think it was constantly indexing or it brought in eventually like 15,000 emails when i only had less than 500, It was a nightmare, I did call tech support.
</p>
<p>Now I have office 2013. But that should nto prevent any back up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone 1) tell me how to check those event logs and also interpret them or just 2) tell me how to end this "sharing" because if i look at the part of my notebook where the hard drive is it shows TWO HEADS meaning this notebook thinks there are TWO PEOPLE
 using it. NOT. I think the geek squad did that in november when they installed my replacement hard drive and used my back ups to restore windows 7 etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>THANKS THANKS IN ADVANCE TO VERY UPSET AND ANNOYED PERSON WITH WINDOWS/MICROSOFT.</p>

<p>Hi Gina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changes in the system configuration settings may have caused the issue. May we know when was the last time you've checked for a Windows update on your device?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access you System and Application log from your Event Viewer by selecting
<strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>Control</strong> <strong>Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>
Administrative</strong> <strong>Tools</strong> &gt; <strong>Event</strong> <strong>Viewer</strong>. In the left side of the window, select
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Logs</strong> <strong>System</strong> from the list. Click
<strong>System</strong>, select <strong>Action</strong> from the options, and then
<strong>Save</strong> all events. Do the same with application logs. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, upload them to a file sharing service like <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OneDrive</a></strong> or any other file sharing service and put a link to them in your reply as
 we have community members who can assist us with interpreting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Greetings:</p>
<p>Can you tell me where I find administrative tools? I go to control panel, but there is no administrative tools listed under it. I searched around the listings, which include: system and security, network and internet, hardware and sound, programs ....</p>
<p>but I don't see administrative tools. I remember it, I have seen it before but can't again find it.
</p>
<p>I have windows 7 pro 64 bit. Maybe this OS just lists things a little different?</p>
<p>I am sure I can get the event viewer, I can save them, but can't find admin tools,
</p>
<p>Also, I have to say the "search" function in this windows 7 is lousy, not like it was in windows XP which was fabulous, I found EVERYTHING AND ANYTHIGN I searched for in XP, every folder, image etc. But t his search is pretty weak, and I find what items
 are in my notebook software, folders, etc., may or may not come up in a search. Sad, it used to be so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I think what you said about system configuration change is probably the problem, because I have exhausted all else, and I often see changes in the way items are saved or wher ethey are. I do not make these changes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last, I always make sure windows is updated, and the lack check was a few minutes ago, windows is up to date.</p>
<p>thank you again,</p>
<p>Gina </p>

<p>&nbsp;HI again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found event viewer by putting it in the search of the windows in my notebook.</p>
<p>I am sure it is the right one, because among the items are Windows Logs, then under that list is one that says system.</p>
<p>It has a ton of entries, dating back to Feb. 26. Which is about the last time my notebook backed up nicely.</p>
<p>I did as you say and saved the system and application logs,&nbsp; but can you help me with the rest?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I access onedrive?</p>
<p>by putting in a link you mean my email? </p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again,</p>

<p>first of all, I didn't buy a refurbished hard drive. The hard drive I had bought to replace the original was new, but it went out after 18 months. It was still under warranty, so the geek squad replaced it. I did not know until later that Western Digital
 sends what they call recertified drives, instead of new ones. I would not agree to a used anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was installed and worked great. It was fast, I had back ups so my notebook was restored. I also was backing everything up from the replacement hard drive. It was working fine until the end of February or early March, when all the back ups started failing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what caused it, but I am positive it is not the external hard drives because Western Digital sent me a new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think with the error messages I got, which I posted, it is something that has changed in the configuration. I don't do that, these folks at microsoft or windows does that.&nbsp; I get windows updates, but I don't know if those would effect anything that might
 cause the back up not to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use windows back up.&nbsp; I don't use separate software, I use windows back up so everything gets backed up. Western Digital has back up software, but it only backs up files etc., not like windows back up. What is the point then of the WD software? I
 also had back up on my older notebook and this one previously and boy they come in handy if you ever crash and cannot get restored. I got into a habit of backing up my notebook regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I have a notebook computer, an HP Probook 4530s. I know it is old, but I might add that these processors like what I have (mine is an i5 or whatever they call it i can get the exact term) and they are still sellign them, i see them selling the i3 in
 fact. I also added ram, I have 8G of ram, and they sell less than that on some notebooks. I do not see a reason why my notebook won't back up other than it is a windows or microsoft problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that information about the model number actually helpful in any way? How would that be helpful in knowing why my notebook, which has a windows OS and back up help determine why it is not working?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is Mr. Ray Bel1 around? I have the information, I saved it I just need to make sure I upload it correctly. If I upload to ONedrive how do I note it? That part, that is all new to me. Glad to do whatever might help because the windows back ups are in my opinion
 the most useful if one loses one's hard drive. </p>
<p>thanks, </p>

<p>I am posting here because I hope someone who has had this problem might help. Or maybe someone who knows about this problem, because I cannot believe I am the only one on Earth.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wonder why people post questions that seem completely unrelated to anything, because that diminishes the whole point of the community help.</p>

</p><p>Do you have a notebook, or one of those big desktops?</p>

<p>I looked there. You know what I saw? I saw a newly created display name that I DID NOT create, as I did not create an online outlook account either that for some reason known only to the grand cosmos how it got there, because I did not create it, nor would
 i just duplicate a user name if I were inclined to use outlook online, which I am not. What is the point of using outlook, then? What is the point of having outlook software if you only go online, i could just continue using my email where it was and not have
 the convenience of having it at hand in my notebook (or desktop for you desktop fans). I don't understand that at all, how that happened. I always ALWAYS log out and change my password every few months. I see display name twice, and I think HOW did that happen?
 I didn't do that. </p>
<p>I don't use gmail unless I absolutely HAVE to log in for something and then I MAKE SURE i log right back out because of the horrible lack of security under that system.&nbsp; So no way did I create that display name twice. That is what I saw, I saw nothing that
 indicated it wojuld lead me to my questions, though in the past of a few years ago, I could access past questions that way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can back up files, folder etc. Why I use the windows back up, or always had used it, is because it backed up everything -- no need to reinstall the OS.
</p>
<p>But as far as backing up files, program software I have, photos etc I can do that with this.&nbsp; This is why I did the back up every week, so be able to restore to the most recent time, including outlook email. All that will be lost without a whole back up.
</p>
<p>I agree, windows for all it does and has, should have a very exceptional back up and should also make and sell external drives for this purpose. I can't believe they do not.</p>

<h2>            How do I contact Mentor Media &#47; Microsoft &#47; Acer about a lost order number&#63;</h2>
                    It's seriously become daunting to try and contact these people about something soooo simple! I accidentally deleted the email with my order number and details (I forgot to archive it and it got wiped out with everything else) and all I want to do is contact
 these people about having a new email sent, but it's nearly impossible! I've tried searching for this so called Mentor Media online and have come up with nothing! No email address, no mailing address, just stupid FAQ pages that are zero help. How do I get
 in contact with these people so I can have my order number resent? That's all I want! Way to go Microsoft let's make it 10 times more difficult than it has to be!

Hi<br />
<br />
Sorry, but you have not indicated where you placed the order from?<br />
<br />
If you placed the order online, your best option is to return to the website where you placed the order. usually online stores will have a way to retrieve this information using your name and/or address/phone number/login account&nbsp;or partial credit card number
 to retrieve any order/invoice documentation. <br />
<br />
The website where you placed the order should also have the contact information. Use a telephone option instead of an email option so you can speak directly to a customer service representative.<br />
<br />
If you let us know the&nbsp;location where you placed the order, we may be able to help.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

            I tried to buy using the Acer Australian windows 7 upgrade site but i have a problem with the verification code on my credit card (i only have 2 digits instead of three) the only way for my transaction to be completed is to talk to mentor media on the
 phone but the website given by Ronnie Vernon wont even load on my computer i just get&nbsp; "content coding error".<br />
The automated response from the payment process email tells me what i told them back in September via email my credit card is rejected with a link to re-enter my credit card details ! I follow the link and get directed to a site that wont let me login despite
 the information being correctly entered. <br />
<br />
This was to be the first of a number of Windows 7 purchases but if i cant get a simple single license transaction completed by talking to a customer service person then my business may need to consider a change to Linux as an operating system.<br />
<br />
*** Update : I have been in contact with Acer Australia since i posted the above comments and after providing them with the purchase details as well as the details of my product registration with them they had my upgrade problems with mentor sorted out in two
 days. My payment has now been confirmed ( using a MasterCard ) and i am now awaiting the arrival of my Windows 7 media . For those looking for a phone number don't worry about it use your manufacturers website and go through the customer support process.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I've got to say, the Windows 7 Upgrade Program offered by Acer and using Mentor Media is not a good experience at all. My father purchased a brand new Acer PC a couple of months ago. It came pre-loaded with Vista, so we registered (back in August) for
 the Windows 7 upgrade. <br />
<br />
A few of days ago my father received an email from Mentor Media saying that he can now proceed to make payment for the upgrade and a link was provided to do this. He entered his credit card details and the order went to 'Payment Pending / Payment Resubmit'.
 It stayed in this status for a couple of days and then he received an automatic mail saying that there was a problem with the payment and he should resubmit the credit card details again. The 'Reason' field on the email was empty!! He contacted his credit
 card company who said there was no problem with the card and no transactions had been blocked. So he resubmitted the card details (including address) on the Mentor Media site, but again got an automatic mail a short while after saying the same as before and
 nothing in the 'Reason' field.<br />
<br />
We did notice however that when entering the address, we got a pop-up window saying the post code may not be valid, with the option to ignore and continue. The post code is a valid UK postcode and has been for as long as my parents have been living at the address.
 Perhaps Mentor Media's car verficcation system can't handle UK post codes?????<br />
<br />
We have used the online Contact Us form several times. It says we should get a reply within 2-3 days, but nothing so far. If we could only find out why the payment is being rejected, then we could do something about it. The auto-mails they are sending are completely
 useless!!!<br />
<br />
Quite frankly we weren't expecting to have such a hard time with this. It would be great if we could talk to a real person at Mentor Media about this, but as previous posts have said, there's no UK number and if we call internationally we may as well have bought
 an off-the-shelf full version for what the call's going to cost us!!!<br />
<br />
Has anyone else had the same issue? How can we contact them and speak to a real person without calling internationally???<br />
<br />
Not at all happy with this experience and Microsoft should seriously consider using another partner for this upgrade program!!<br />
<br />

&nbsp;When i entered my home address it told me that the post code may be invalid (It isn't unless i've been using the wrong post code for nearly 30 years).<br />
I tried 2 credit cards which i know have plenty of money on, both came up with a problem with the cards and yet no reason in the reason box.<br />
&nbsp;I have also emailed them and as of yet no reply. Even spoke to my bank to make sure my cards were ok.
<br />
&nbsp;Can't find a uk number to call them and to be honest i'm really fed up about it.<br />
&nbsp;If anyone has managed to contact them please let us know.

 it was!!!!!!! It removed my d: drive which was my hd drive with everything on it and just threw everything all over the place on my ssd windows c: drive, had to reinstall windows and now have a C: drive and an E: drive which should be my D: drive !!!!!!! then
 the error it said was windows store error!!!!!, don't they test things first on a variety of setups !!! apparently not. I know they have admitted or should I say acknowledged the problem but what about the time and stress of each person having to sort their
 mess out!!!!!&nbsp; Is this going to happen again if it installs this update again ??? Disgraceful Microsoft.</p>

            I finally was able to get the computer screen to full width.&nbsp; I had to go back to the date it started acting up 12/29/11 and reset everything to before I had installed two downloads.&nbsp; The downloads were marked as Urgent and Optional.&nbsp; I selected both to
 be added and this was my mistake.&nbsp; The one update "Urgent" is okay but for some unknown reason the one marked "Optional" made my computer lose control of the left side of the monitor screen.&nbsp; After having deleted these updates everything went back to normal.&nbsp;
 I reinstalled the up-date marked "Urgent" and everything stayed working normally, so it had to be the other up-date marked "optional" that is at fault.&nbsp; Now I wonder if anyone else had the same problem or was this a fluke with my computer?&nbsp; I have a new Dell
 Inspiron 570 with up graded processing and memory.&nbsp; Could this be it?&nbsp; Being fairly new to the computing world I am at a loss, but now I am happy again!&nbsp; Thank you for your help and information.&nbsp; This is a wonderful idea from Windows, and I for one, am glad
 to be a small part of it.<br />

When you receive an error message, it is absolutely essential to post the ENTIRE message VERBATIM. Paraphrasing it wouldn't help.<br />
Meanwhile, please confirm whether you have step #5 checked and #6 Apply clicked&nbsp;....<br />
<ol>
<li>When you are returned to the Internet Accounts dialog box, click the <strong>
Mail</strong> tab. (If the Internet Accounts dialog box is not open, click the <strong>
Tools</strong> menu and then click <strong>Accounts</strong>). </li><li>Select your <strong>AOL IMAP</strong> account. </li><li>Click <strong>Properties</strong>. </li><li>In the Properties dialog box, click the <strong>Servers</strong> tab. </li><li>In the Outgoing Mail Server section, click the <strong>My server requires authentication</strong> check box.
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>If you have done that and it does not work, please post the error message and let Gloria take a look at it.<br />

            Hi , this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

You should reset the laptop and set it up with your own account:

Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
Click Troubleshoot
Click Reset this PC
Click Remove everything

Setup Windows 10 using the following instructions:

Best,

            Hello SirTerry. 

Unfortunately, following Andre's instructions will wipe out the data you want to recover.  Also, we have no way of knowing whether you're trying to get into a computer you have rights to or if you're simply trying to crack someone else's.  Nothing personal, of course, but I'm sure you understand.  See the Microsoft Policy about Lost or Forgotten Passwords: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/189126/microsoft-policy-about-lost-or-forgotten-passwords

            Please do not Reset the Laptop, you will loose the sensitive date you need to recover!

Start the laptop, just as the Lenovo logo disappears and Windows attempts to load, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down

Do this twice

On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.

Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt
Run this command: Net user administrator /active:yes

Restart the laptop and you should be able to sign into the Built in Administrator account and retrieve the sensitive data . . .

Once you have retrieved the data, you can then go ahead and Reset the System so you can get further use from the device . . .
