<h2>            High Performance Power Settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow I have completely lost the "High Performance" setting in Control Panel &gt; Power.&nbsp; As now I totally need to rebuild this (believe me, this needs redoing), can anyone please supply a list of all exact settings in "Change Advanced Power Settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

            Hi Frank.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Some laptops don't come with Bluetooth.  If you don't see it in your Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button,  then go to the  PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model to see if there's a Bluetooth Driver to install.  
<br />
<br />If not then you can buy an inexpensive Bluetooth USB adapter like the one shown here which work fine:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Bluetooth-Adapter-Raspberry-Compatible/dp/B009ZIILLI/ref=pd_lpo_vtph_147_bs_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=9H9R37EMJCDSWBCNTETP&amp;dpID=414xoPZ7htL&amp;preST=_SY300_QL70_&amp;dpSrc=detail" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Bluetooth-Adapt...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

            Finally, I was able to get Bluetooth on my Dell Latitude E6410 laptop. to do so I purchased from Amazon an adapter. .......... KINIVO&nbsp; BTD - 400 Bluetooth USB Adapter (version 4.0) for Windows 10&nbsp; $11.99&nbsp; ..... I'm sure it costs less than two dollars to
 produce. It did however get my older laptop to install Bluetooth so I can now use mini speakers which produces loud &amp; clear sound/music.

<p>thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the internet access icon in the lower right hand corner it gives me several choices including the one I want to connect with.&nbsp; When I click on it, it doesn't ask for a password it just gives me a message that windows was unable to connect
 to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use WiFi.&nbsp; I did try to connect with a cable but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The make of the new router is CenturyLink and the model number is C1100T</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old router was also CenturyLink model # PK5001Z</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click start I do not have a choice of Device Manager, but I do have Devices and Printers.&nbsp; When I click on that it shows 3 devices and 5 printers.&nbsp; My router is not one of the devices.&nbsp; When I click to add a device it cannot find my router. I don't
 know how if possible to add it manually.&nbsp; I don't know for sure what a warning icon is, but nothing seems to stand out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure that I configured my new router, I just plugged it in and accepted what was there.&nbsp; I did have to change the password because it assigned a new one.&nbsp; When you say wireless network, I'm not sure what you are referring to, but my computers are not
 connected to each other via a network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again when you say network password, they are not on a network, but I did change the internet connection password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes my new network is there.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>And if you still have your old router, does it have a label like this on the bottom?</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/358bf756-75f7-4d7c-9380-b22ba5b4f00e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/358bf756-75f7-4d7c-9380-b22ba5b4f00e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the complete text of the message that you get when you try to connect?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "network name" you should be looking for is the name marked as the "SSID" -- in other words, if you have a label like the first one above, you should be looking for CenturyLink1526.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you been trying to connect to the network identified on the label of the new router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you said that you "did have to change the password because it assigned a new one," I assume you would have done that the first time you tried to connect to the new router.&nbsp; Is that correct?&nbsp; Were you able to connect that first time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were ever able to connect to the new router, what happened to your system shortly before you became unable to connect to it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's hard to understand why "nothing changed" when you tried to connect by cable.&nbsp; The cable would have gone from your computer to one of the yellow jacks on the router.&nbsp; Connecting via Ethernet cable does not require a password.&nbsp; Did you get an error message
 when you had your computer connected to the router with an Ethernet cable?&nbsp; If so, what was the complete text of that message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You missed a step in trying to open Device Manager.&nbsp; After you click Start, you need to type Device Manager in the Search box.&nbsp; You'll then see a link to Device Manager and you can either click on it or press Enter.</p>

<p>yes the pictures you sent are pretty much my routers.&nbsp; They are in different order than you wrote, the first picture is my old router and the second one is the new router that is where I got what I thought was the model numbers.&nbsp; Do you need something else
 from the labels? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The message I get is "Windows was unable to connect to the network name which I didn't know was the SSID which I will call CenturyLink0000".&nbsp; Then below that it says&nbsp; "Troubleshoot problems" and "tell me more about internet connection problems".&nbsp; When I
 click on Troubleshoot problems it runs a test and tells me to investigate router or access point issues and suggests I unplug or turn off the router and try again, which I have tried.&nbsp; Then it tells me to check to see if the problem is fixed. After clicking
 on that it gives me the message "Windows cannot resolve your wireless connectivity issue".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now understand the SSID is the network name which is what I click on after clicking on the internet connection icon in the bottom right corner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I changed the password for the new router, I did it on my Windows10 computer which I have not had any problems with since I first set it up.&nbsp; I also have not had any problems with my wife's laptop, her tablet, the tv or any other devices we have working
 with the router.&nbsp; I have never been able to connect my windows7 laptop to the new router.&nbsp; This is the 3rd router I have had since I got the laptop and I have never had a problem before including the router you have shown above. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the cable, I plugged one end into the yellow jacks on the router and the other into the laptop.&nbsp; I didn't get any messages.&nbsp; Is there a different way to connect to the internet that I should be trying other than the icon on the bottom right of
 the screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get into device manager as you suggested, but I didn't see anything that looked to me to be a warning icon. When I double clicked on network adaptors it showed three&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini-card</p>
<p>Microsoft Virtual WiFi Niniport Adapter</p>
<p>Realtek PCIe FE Family Controller</p>
<p>
</p><p>and again didn't see anything that could be a warning icon</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks for that information.&nbsp; And you're right:&nbsp; I mixed up the order of your two routers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you initially wrote, you have an old laptop and it has an old wireless network card.&nbsp; The Dell Wireless 1397 WLAN Mini-card has been reported to have difficulties staying connected.&nbsp; There's also an updated driver for that card.&nbsp; However, let's first
 see if we can get you connected at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two passwords involved with wireless routers.&nbsp; One is the password used to connect to the wireless network and the other is the one used to access the router's configuration utility.&nbsp; On the image of the C1100T router, the password needed to connect
 to the network is cqxtn5qkkzaus5.&nbsp; To access the router's configuration utility, you would use a user name of admin and with password en8maqF9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without revealing your password(s), when you "changed the password for the new router, [using your] Windows10 computer," did you change the "Key/Passphrase" or the "Admin Password"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Click the network icon in the lower right corner (near the time display)</li><li>Does it look something like this?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5c4bc31-d6bc-4500-ad60-15993044e35b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5c4bc31-d6bc-4500-ad60-15993044e35b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If so, click "Open Network and Sharing Center"; if not, was what opened some sort of Dell program (please describe)?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you are at the Network and Sharing Center, click the link at the left to "Manage Wireless Networks"</li><li>Find the entry for CenturyLinknnnn, select it, and then click "Remove" (in the toolbar above the list).</li><li>Close the Manage Wireless Networks window and go back to the area near the time display and click the upward-pointing triangle to see the normally-hidden icons</li><li>Hover your mouse over each of the icons and if one of them is a Dell utility for managing wireless networks, open the utility, then find and delete the entry for CenturyLinknnnn (sorry, I can't be more specific about how to use the Dell utility)</li></ul>
<p>After all references to the CenturyLinknnnn network have been removed, try to connect again.&nbsp; This time, you should be asked for a password.&nbsp; Use the Key/Passphrase from the router's label or -- if that's what you changed using your other computer -- use
 the new password you created.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>*******************************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>When you </p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I plugged one end [of a cable] into the yellow jacks on the router and the other into the laptop.&nbsp; I didn't get any messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>did you try opening a web browser and going to some site, say google.com?&nbsp; If so, what happened?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect your computer to the router using an Ethernet cable, you shouldn't get any message at all about the connection.&nbsp; You should just be connected.&nbsp; If while you're connected via an Ethernet cable you open "Network and Sharing Center," you should
 see something like this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>yes, the network icon looks similar to what you showed.&nbsp; This is what I normally use to connect.&nbsp; I removed centurylink0000 from there, but I was unable to find the dell icon you mentioned.&nbsp; I show three hidden icons when I clicked customized I found them

<p>
</p><p>I tried to connect again, but the same thing happened it didn't connect, I'm guessing it's because I couldn't delete from the Dell icon I couldn't find.</p>

</p><p>yes I opened windows explorer and even though it showed the web site I tried to go to, something popped up on the screen that said&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Because of this I can't do anything in explorer.&nbsp; I couldn't close explorer in a normal way so I went to CTRL ALT DEL to close it.</p>

</p><p>You don't appear to have the Dell Wireless Utility installed.&nbsp; That's not a problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As near as I can determine, "quickset" is a Dell utility for configuring "settings for power management, icon and font size, display brightness, and volume control as well as other functions on most Dell systems."&nbsp; This isn't what I was referring to, although
 you can apparently use the Dell QuickSet utility to enable or disable your wireless adapter -- yours appears to be enabled at this point, so you shouldn't do anything.&nbsp; For more info, see

<p>
</p><p>"Webroot Secure" is your antivirus.&nbsp; Although it's possible that the firewall that is part of the Webroot is causing you connection problems, that's not likely, so we don't have to consider that at this point.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you saw the web site you were trying to go to (even though it was partially blocked by the pop-up), it seems that you actually are connecting to the Internet.&nbsp; If you want to know for sure, do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Restart your computer.&nbsp; Don't open any web browser after the computer starts.</li><li>Open a Command Prompt by clicking Start, typing Command Prompt in the Search window, and pressing Enter</li><li>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ping google.com</li><li>You should see something like the following.&nbsp; The important line is the one that says:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 &lt;0% Loss&gt;<br />
If you have "0% Loss" than you are connected to the Internet.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I've seen reports from a couple of years ago describing the problem you had.&nbsp; See this thread and follow the directions from "HarlanVogt" (about the 4th one down).&nbsp; Let me know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After we get your other issues straightened out, you might go back to the Network and Sharing Center and click on the link that says "Public Network."&nbsp; In the next screen, change to "Home Network" (unless you don't care about connecting to your other devices).&nbsp;
 "Public" is a bit safer, but makes communication between your own devices more difficult.&nbsp; See

<p>again thank you for helping me with this problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what you suggested at the command prompt and I got the line you said was important.&nbsp; It did say 0% loss.&nbsp; Unfortunately this only worked when I had the router connected with the cable.&nbsp; When I unplugged it there was no internet.&nbsp; When I use this computer
 I use it in a room that is not in close proximity to the router so it doesn't work for me if I need to keep it plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't know what thread you were talking about when you suggested I check on something you saw a couple of years ago relative to "HarlanVogt"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I understand that if I get to the website I am connected, but that pop-up not only blocks the website, it stops me from doing anything until it closes and I can't close it without using CTRL ALT DEL</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know my problem is taking a lot of your time, but if we ever get it fixed, I have another hopefully easy problem I also need help with on this laptop.&nbsp; For some reason my hard disk is divided into two drives, C &amp; D.&nbsp; The C drive has 58.5 GB which is full
 and the D drive has 397 GB which is mostly available.&nbsp; I have moved several programs to the D drive, but would prefer to have everything on the C drive.&nbsp; Is there someway I can move the available space from D to C?&nbsp; Again, not important but if it is an easy
 fix then that would be good.</p>

</p><p>You should probably leave the disk space issue until the connection issues are resolved, but see below.</p>
<p>With respect to your hard drive space, your description sounds as if someone partitioned the physical hard drive into a "system" partition (C:\) and a "data" partition (D:\).&nbsp; If this is done and -- as in your situation -- the system partition was
 not assigned much space, you have to be rigorous in not storing anything other than Windows on the C:\ partition.&nbsp; This means, for example, using a "custom" option when installing programs and directing the installation to the D:\ partition (and not all programs
 have such an option), and re-directing your data folders (My Documents, My Photos, My Music, etc.) to the D:\partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, you have some options.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing you should do is run Disk Cleanup.&nbsp; Click Start, type Disk Cleanup in the Search box, and press Enter.&nbsp; You'll have the choice of which partition you want to clean.&nbsp; The initial Disk Cleanup display will show how much space you'll recover.&nbsp;
 You can also click "Cleanup System Files" to see a few more things that can be deleted.&nbsp; You can click each of the items to see a short description of what you will be deleting.&nbsp; Disk Cleanup will give you some more space, but likely still not enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, you might want to download and run TreeSize Free.&nbsp; Make sure to right-click and select "Run as administrator" when running this program.&nbsp; TreeSize Free will show you what files and folders are taking up space on your drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<p>
</p><p>If your data folders take up a large amount of space on C:\, you can easily move them to D:\ as described here:&nbsp;
<a href="https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-move-windows-7-personal-folders-my-documents-another-drive.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.techsupportalert.com/content/how-move-windows-7-personal-folders-my-documents-another-drive.htm</a></p>
<p>Although moving your data folders will relieve some of the pressure on the C:\ partition, ultimately what you probably ought to do is combine the C:\ and D:\ partitions into one.&nbsp; This is a bit tricky to accomplish.&nbsp; First, you'll have to uninstall
 all programs installed on D:\ and later re-install them on C:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You then have two options.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>You can copy everything from D:\ to an external backup drive, then delete everything on D:\ and use Windows 7 native tools to merge D:\ with C:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can use a third-party disk management tool that merges D:\ with C:\ while
<em>attempting </em>to preserve the data.&nbsp; Notice the word "attempting."&nbsp; These tools
<em>should </em>work, but dealing with disk operations without first making a backup is living dangerously.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This page discusses both of the above methods:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.easeus.com/partition-master/merge-partitions-windows-7.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.easeus.com/partition-master/merge-partitions-windows-7.html</a>&nbsp; I noticed that the download links in that article are for a "free trial" of Partition Master Pro.&nbsp; I don't know what, if any, limitations the "free trial" incorporates.&nbsp; You don't
 have to buy anything.&nbsp; Partition Master also has a free (for individual use) edition that will work just as well:&nbsp;

<p>I went to the link and tried it, but it did not work.&nbsp; I tried it multiple times and the second time I tried it, it opened explorer three times.&nbsp; I deleted two of them and the pop up was not there.&nbsp; Thought I had it, but I turned the computer off and reopened
 it and when I opened explorer the pop up came back.&nbsp; Tried it multiple times since but could not get it to work.&nbsp; Didn't get&nbsp; the link that said why it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info on the drives, I agree, I would like to get the wireless problem solved before I try to fix anything else, I just asked in case it was a simple fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is probably 10 years old and I was thinking that maybe windows 7 was my the cause of my wireless problem.&nbsp; Do you think I could upgrade to 8 or 10?&nbsp; If so, could I get it on the D drive?</p>

    <title>How to change Black &#38; White System Tray Icons to Coloured Icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brothertank  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change Black &#38; White System Tray Icons to Coloured Icons</h2>
                    <p>In another thread for windows 7 it was asked how can you change the black &amp; white icons in the system tray to something else.</p>
<p>The usual response is that, that is what Microsoft did to Windows 7 and the new look of the taskbar.</p>
<p>So I'm asking again, can those icons be changed?&nbsp; What file are they in?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I am versed in the use of Resource Editors, so what can be done to make this flat looking tray more alive and colourful??</p>

In understand that that is the "Windows 7 by Design" answer, but what files do those black and white icons live in, so that they can be changed using a resource editor??&nbsp; Or will answering that threaten your job as a support engineer??</p>
<p>And as a suggestion, throw this up the pipe... when you make an evironment more ehanced visually, it would be better to maintain some colour in the the small places that we are already used to seeing in mostly colour.&nbsp;

    <title>DLNA Broken&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> assassinseyez  say:</h3>
<h2>            DLNA Broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I was upset by the missing native media player, like everyone else, but eventually found out about the Skifta app, and was up and running as easy as pie. Then, with absolutely no change that I am aware of, Skifta stopped being able to see the Xbox One as
 a "player". I have uninstalled and reinstalled Skifta, as well as the XBone video player, with no luck. I feel like have tried everything 10 times, and restarted everything twice that amount. I'm at a complete loss, and what makes it more confusing is that
 nothing has changed. Unless there was an update I missed that broke something, but I have yet to find anyone having a similar issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I have double checked all settings ie. making sure PlayTo Streaming is enabled. I have also tried finding it while it was on the XBone video player, as well as starting the video player and going back to the dashboard. I'm not sure if it matter but
 I am using Plex as my server from Linux Mint 16. The server is up and running, and I can see it is running from the Plex server web app, as well as from Skifta. I just can't seem to see the XBone as a media player anymore.</p>
<p>I would also like to add that I have tried several other DLNA streaming controllers, with no luck.<br />
<br />
Has anybody else had this issue, or does anyone have a clue as to what is going on?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all support, and I apologize if this is the wrong forum, it seemed like the best candidate.</p>

<p>Well, powering down and unplugging for 30 seconds seemed to fix it.</p>
<p>So, if you run into this problem, power down the Xbox One and unplug it for 30 seconds. Reboot and enjoy!</p>

<h2>            Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 button assignments</h2>
                    Where can I find the software that will allow me to specify what the various buttons do? The built in stuff in Windows 10 will let me change the primary button from left to right and the pointer, but there are several other buttons I would like to change.
 I downloaded the Keyboard and Mouse keyboard center, but it only sees the keyboard. Specifically I would like to change the behavior of the button on the left side of the mouse which currently acts as a "back" button. Thanks for your help.&nbsp;

<p>I've just insert another harddisk, and maybe i found the problem, i really don't know if this is the real problem:</p>
<p>After a few hours, a friend said that i should use a tool that verifies my pc. After that, i saw that the +3.3V was running at 2.94V and it showed me in a red bar. May the power supply be the real problem ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>LE: I opened my power supply and cleaned it , and now the +3.3V running on 3.2V. But now i have a savedump.exe process in task manager. is it ok ?</p>

<h2>            Media on Windows 10 zoomed in, black and white and grainy.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i've been having a problem with my pc for a little while now and haven't found a way to fix it yet, whenever I go to watch a video that I have recorded or edited on my pc, the image is zoomed in to the point where the video is unwatchable and is black
 and white, it also appears to be quite grainy as well. I have been looking for a way to fix this but have had no such luck yet. I have tried updating my drivers, which only said that they are up to date and dont need to be updated, I am completely out of ideas,
 I have attached some screenshots of the so you can get a better idea of what i'm talking about. Please help if you can, thanks.</p>

            Hi  sherbet453 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<h2>            Talk to text &#40;voice to text&#41; not working&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>as the title says, my voice to text isn't working for messages and for rocket league. Has this happened to anyone else? If so does anyone know of a fix? I was on the preview program but once the official update came out I left it. Ever since it hasn't worked.
 I loved this feature for rocket league and messaging. Help please!</p>

            <p>Hey Trap Eazzy -</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. Could you clarify what you mean by "Voice to Text" in regards to messaging and Rocket League? Are you referring to the Cortana feature? If so, please be sure you have Cortana enabled. You can find steps on how to do that in <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/cortana-voice-commands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this guide</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could provide more specific information regarding "voice to text" and Rocket League, that would be lovely! :)</p>

<p>It does have to do with cortana but I already have it enabled. When you go to type a message through the messaging app when Cortana is enabled you have the option to hit the select button (not menu button but the other one to the left of the Xbox button)
 and speak into your mic and it will type out what you are saying. This is known as talk to text/voice to text. But it is not letting me click the button.

<p>Gotcha! Thanks for the extra info. I was able to confirm that that text to voice feature for the on-screen keyboard is only available to consoles registered with the Xbox One Preview Program. If you left the program, that is why you no longer have access to that feature. At this time, we do not have additional information to share as to when that feature will be released to everyone. </p>
<p>Thanks for posting! :)</p>

<p><span>Hi Tina101,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Answers Forums!</span></p>
<p><span><span>First you need to take ownership of the Folder you need to make changes. You may follow these steps to take ownership of the
 folder.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To take ownership of a file or a folder</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You must have ownership of a protected folder in order to access it. If another user has restricted access and
 you are the computer administrator, you can access the folder by taking ownership.
<br />
<br />
To take ownership of a folder, follow these steps: </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click the folder that you want to take ownership of, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<strong>Security</strong> tab, and then click <strong>OK</strong> on the Security message (if one appears).
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click the <strong>Owner</strong> tab. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the
<strong>Name</strong> list, click your <strong><em>user name</em></strong>, or click
<strong>Administrator</strong> if you are logged in as Administrator, or click the
<strong>Administrators</strong> group. If you want to take ownership of the contents of the folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> check box. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Yes</strong> when you receive the following message:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You do not have permission to read the contents of directory
<em>folder name</em>. Do you want to replace the directory permissions with permissions granting you Full Control?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>All permissions will be replaced if you click
<strong>Yes</strong>.<br />
<strong>Note </strong><em>folder name</em> is the name of the folder that you want to take ownership of.
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>6.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then reapply the permissions and security settings that you want for the folder and its contents.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After taking ownership, check whether you can stop sharing.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

</p><p>My question is, if I have a Windows Store card, login to the Microsoft Site, and redeem it against my Microsoft Account, wont that just be money against my account that I can then spend on my Xbox One for games?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked Microsoft Support and they said the 2 stores are separate but seeing as I use my Microsoft Account for all of those stores/devices I'm not sure if they were correct or not...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone redeemed a Windows Store card and bought content on their Xbox One before, or can anyone confirm if this works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Updates takes too long</h2>
                    <p>I have a new laptop that came with Windows 10 and I got a message saying Windows 10 needs the latest security updates. It has now been almost 3 hours and it is still not finished. Is this normal??? I would hate to think how long it would take to update on
 a computer that had a lot of files on it....</p>

    <title>Windows Live Messenger default window size when opening - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sensaiii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Messenger default window size when opening</h2>
                    how do I configure the default window size of Windows Live Messenger? I am running Windows 7 (home premium 64 bit). When I open Windows Live Messenger contacts list from the Windows Taskbar it opens in windowed mode, I want it to open fullscreen but whenever
 I resize it to fullscreen and close the contacts list to open the list again, the window is once again in windowed mode. So how do I configure Windows Live Messenger to open in fullscreen mode, as I've been able to open in fullscreen earlier but all of a sudden
 it won't do that anymore.<br />
<br />
thanks in advance<br />

            Don't bother installing the camera. Instead just use the sd card in your computer's card reader to transfer photos. That model camera might not be compatible with 8.1. There is no listing for it in the

    <title>Setting up multiple digitizers to multiple external monitors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xantharian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up multiple digitizers to multiple external monitors &#40;multidigimon.exe&#41; is not working</h2>
                    <p>Hey Windows community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm facing a problem a couple weeks ago, since I want to use two or more touch screens on one system.
</p>
<p>Unless I tell Windows which touch digitizer goes to which screen, they both work on the primary screen only.</p>
<p>I know, from Windows 7 this should be done by running the MultiDigiMon utility from&nbsp;Control Panel/Tablet PC Settings/Configure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 7, I was able to run the multidigimon.exe utility (running from Control Panel or&nbsp;%windir%/system32/multidigimon.exe), but it wasn't always working (to be honest, it worked really buggy, I spent hours trying to connect the two touchscreens in different
 configurations to be able to set it up correctly, and had to do this after every disconnection).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10, multidigimon.exe does not even start up either from Control Panel nor system32. I tried several touchscreens (a HP Pavilion tablet too) and without touchscreen on multiple systems (fresh install and Windows 8 too). I've been only able to start
 the utility once after a Win 10 fresh install, but I was not able to repeat this since then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know where to look for possible log files. I am able to see the utility start up in the Task Manager, but it disappears immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both touch screens use Windows native drivers (one of them is a Samsung LD220Z with NextWindow 1950 digitizer, the other is a chinese, unknown-branded, had no official driver for that one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hoped Windows 10 will work better in connecting touchscreens to the system, and now I'm pretty disappointed. Please help to solve this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
