<h2>            Surface Pen won&#39;t work with Surface Book touch screen after Jan-2019 Windows updates</h2>
                    Windows updates KB4480056 and KB4480116 self-installed Jan-11/2019.&nbsp; Surface Book became unstable at the time, wasn't actually aware the updates were happening but did a shut-down and restart, the normal first thing to do.&nbsp; After restart, Surface Pen will
 no longer interact with the Surface Book touch screen.&nbsp; Finger will, it works fine with touch screen.&nbsp; Pen button activates various screen functions as programmed, so that aspect works fine too.&nbsp; Did a forced shut-down and restart, numerous normal shut-downs
 and restarts.&nbsp; Have ensured that all updates and device drivers are up-to-date.&nbsp; "Allow computer to turn off device to save power" is not enabled in Device Manager / Human Intercface Devices / Intel(R) Precise Touch Device.&nbsp; Have disabled then enabled the
 various Human Interface Devices in Device Manager.&nbsp; Have disconnected then re-paired Pen and Surface Book.&nbsp; Have installed new battery in Pen.&nbsp; Have run Surface Diagnostic Too

Based on your post the pen issue occurred after the update. To resolve this concern, we suggest that you download and run the Windows Update Troubleshooter for your version of Windows.

<p>thanks Loyd,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your suggestion, just finished downloading and running Windows Update Troubleshooter, it didn't find any issues.&nbsp; Neglected to mention in my initial post that I did run Windows Troubleshooter on all the various device and hardware possibilities, no issues
 detected.&nbsp; Win 10 version 1809 installed Nov-17/2018, but I'm not prepared to roll back because to me that's not an appropriate solution.&nbsp; I have an appointment booked with the local MS Store for next Weds Jan-16 and will get back to you after that with how
 it went.</p>

<p>Couldn't take it any longer so stopped by the MS Store today instead - the issue was the Pen, new Pen = no more problem.&nbsp; Technician said it might be that the internal contacts were malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To provide an accurate record of events: used Pen extensively last Friday morning, packed up Surface Book and Pen and headed out to the jobsite.&nbsp; Used Surface Book in laptop mode for ~15 min, didn't use Pen.&nbsp; No accidents, no dropsies.&nbsp; Back in office ~
 7 hrs after morning Pen work, busy in laptop mode when Surface Book became unstable, coincidentally just when I was attempting to use Pen again for first time since morning.&nbsp; From thereon as previously reported, rebooted SB, checked Reliability History and
 saw that Win 10 Updates&nbsp;<span>KB4480056 and KB4480116 had just self-installed - Pen wouldn't work.</span></p>
<p><span>B</span><span>y the way, new Pens don't c/w pocket clip anymore - Sigh . . .</span></p>

<h2>            Texts are blurred in Edge</h2>
                    <p>Often Edge shows text blurred after scrolling a page</p>
<p>This text is ok:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4d16313-4d6e-4e88-b7cb-f55136587d82" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4d16313-4d6e-4e88-b7cb-f55136587d82" /></a></p>
<p>Then, I have scrolled my page a bit and the same text is blurred:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56f1501e-f98c-4ea0-b47a-7953966292d7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/56f1501e-f98c-4ea0-b47a-7953966292d7" /></a></p>
<p>And, the text can be shown properly after another scroll. Or, it can be shown blurred again.</p>
<p>Sometime, the text is blurred immediately when a page is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried each suggested approach from&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking/blurry-text-on-microsoft-edge/f345a232-0096-4ae1-86b7-5b0e9a6f5d98">Blurry text on Microsoft Edge</a>&nbsp;conversation
 without a result.</p>
<p>My Edge version is 25.10586.0.0.</p>
<p>I have not faced with this issue at all when using Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please investigate this situation?</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your effort in fixing the issue. Are you facing the same issue in Internet Explorer as well?</p>
<p>Does this issue occur in all the websites or just the specific ones?</p>
<p>I suggest you to run the website in compatibility mode and check if the issue persists. Go to
<strong>Edge&gt;</strong> Press <strong>Alt&gt; Tools&gt; Compatibility View Settings. </strong>
Also m<span>ake sure that your system is up-to-date. Type Windows Updates in search bar and select Check for updates from the results. If updates are available, try installing them and check.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps, let us know how it goes, we'll be glad to assist. </p>

            <p>I am a bit confused by your instruction: "Go to <strong>Edge&gt;</strong> Press <strong>
Alt&gt; Tools&gt; Compatibility View Settings.</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to follow&nbsp;it but failed.</p>
<p>Then, I tried to search how to enable 'compatibility view' in Edge and where is&nbsp;the 'Tools' menu item and I have found the following description:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time (in Edge) it is not called as "Compatibility Settings" /"Compatibility View Settings". Instead, you will have to go through "F12 Developer Tools".</p>
<p>
</p><p>at http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-msedge/compatibility-setting-in-edge/840d6bf9-2ffe-42eb-8202-80c31250232b</p>
<p>
</p><p>Comparing to that reply, your instruction looks like a hurried copy-paste from&nbsp;IE9 answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have tried different emulation modes and sometime texts&nbsp;are blurred in Default, IE11 and IE10 modes. Also, sometime texts&nbsp;are blurred in my actual IE11 in the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reviewed my settings and found these&nbsp;values in Edge 'Settings' that can affect painting:</p>
<p>- Reading view style: Default</p>
<p>- Reading view font size: Medium</p>
<p>Hope, this information will help you investigate this issue.</p>

<h2>            Unable to Rename.. File Open&#63;</h2>
                    I have just got a new computer with Windows 7 w/ XP Mode, 32 Bit Operating System. A big part of my job is to review quotes then change them to jobs when orders are received. One part of this is renaming the Quote File to an Active Job File. Yet, almost
 every-time I try to rename a file, I get an error telling me that the file is open or in use by another program. I know that the file is closed. Why am I getting this error and how can I get it to stop. It is taking me twice as long to complete a project file
 package as when I had XP. Thanks for your help.

<p><span>Hi sdcamp,</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you installed any Security Software on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span>If yes, disable the Security Software for the time being and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure to turn on or enable the Security Software once you are done with the test.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Check if the same issue persists in Safe Mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Safe mode starts
<span>Windows</span> with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start
<span>Windows</span> are installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer this link to boot into Safe Mode:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></strong></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2:</strong>
</span><span>Perform a Clean Boot to check if there is any third party application which is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps given in the link below to boot the computer in clean boot state:</span></p>
<p><span><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />

<p><span><strong>Note: Reset the computer to start as usual</strong></span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password
 or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. <br />
b. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK. <br />
c. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family Features - Ask For Permission Error</h2>
                    <p>So basically, I'm not sure what I did, but now whenever I try to open Google Chrome, it shows up as "Microsoft family features, you'll need to ask an adult in your family if you can use: Google Chrome". With a blue button saying "Ask by email". This have
 never happened before. I found out I was in a family and I was marked as a child. I removed myself from the family and when I try to open Google Chrome it did the same thing. So I pressed ask by email and it said "Something went wrong. We're working on it
 - try again in a little bit." With a trace ID. I decided to add myself back into the family, and when I asked by email, it did show up. I pressed Allow to use Google Chrome, but nothing happened. I removed myself again and it kept doing the same thing. I tried
 many different ways to fix this, but it keeps showing up. I have an adult account, and I'm not in the family anymore, so why is this happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I must of caused this by using the built in email program in windows 10. I added my email into it and then the Microsoft family feature problem started to occur. I got rid of my email from that program but it still didn't fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this? If you do, please tell me ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! :)</p>

<p>Since upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium the Weather gadget will not show any information, when I add it to the desktop it only shows the "sunny day" background. I've tried various things; reinstalling the gadget, reinstalling all gadgets, neither of which
 had any effect. UAC is enabled to the default setting. <br />
This is only affecting my login, for the other login on my computer the gadget works fine</p>

            This is a known issue and Microsoft has released an utility to handle this problem.
<br />
<br />Download this utility from ( <a href="https://aka.ms/AppRPS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/AppRPS</a> ) and double click to unzip the file. This has 2 files which you should copy to somewhere on your computer.
<br />
<br />appraiser.bat
<br />AppRaiserScript.PS1
<br />
<br />Double click appraiser.bat to run and it will run and do all required tasks for you on its own to remove required blockers.
<br />
<br />After this runs successfully, you can try to update Windows again.

<li>If you were already able to check Device Manager to validate the status of the driver. You can perform the following to check it there:
<ol>
<li>Search and launch Device Manager using Cortana.</li><li>Locate and collapse Network adapters.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p>If you've made changes to the settings of your device after installing the Windows Update.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend checking for updates for your device. This will check for pending items to be installed which may include the missing driver. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this

<p>I have checked for updates, and my computer is up to date.&nbsp; There are no pending updates according to&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4043454, the last update KB4074588 was the one that was installed yesterday when the Wireless disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked at the drivers on the Acer website as you suggest, however there are 5 Intel drivers and I do not know which one is the one for this machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a message from my printer (when I tried to print) which said Acer Apsire 5810TZ Wireless Network Adapter B4074588 update today Acer Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions from the Acer Community were to uninstall the driver and to restart.&nbsp; The driver should then reinstall automatically, however it has not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can offer me any further advice I would be much obliged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Restarting/rebooting your device usually automatically reinstall the removed driver. Drivers are tied up to the hardware on your device. Its best to engage the manufacturer to determine the appropriate driver to download for
 your device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, <span>we'd recommend performing a system restore to revert your device to an earlier point in time. Performing this will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the date of the restore point. Restore points are usually created
 before key changes (includes Windows Update) are made to the system. To do this, you can perform the steps posted in the</span><strong> Restore from a system restore point</strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>section of this<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once done, check if the driver has been reinstated. If yes, you can proceed to updating the device. This process essentially isolates factors like corruptions after installing the update.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to an update on your concern.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for updating us, Hazel. If you have the technical skills to open a laptop, we'd recommend holding that process until we've exhausted our software isolation process. In laptops, a function key is usually available to toggle the Wi-Fi service. You
 an try pressing Fn + F3 (this command is based from the manufacturer's website) to turn it on and off.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that there's still no change, we'd recommend performing an <strong>
in-place upgrade</strong> to overwrite the existing configuration of your computer with default settings. This essentially eliminates multiple factors such as corruption and broken system files. To do this, you can perform the steps posted by
<strong>PaulSey</strong> on this <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">

<p>
</p><p>Note: This process will use an ISO to install Windows 10. You'll have an option to keep your files so you're assured that there will be no unnecessary data loss. Once this process is complete, you're device will have the latest version and build of Windows
 10.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for your post above.&nbsp; I had the same idea about the fn key, but there isn't one for Wireless, just for Bluetooth, which is F3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'in-place' upgrade which you describe above, is this the same as the restore I have already done?&nbsp; When I did the restore on Thursday, this actually completely reinstalled Windows 10 (to the latest version for my machine).&nbsp; It didn't bring the Wireless
 Network adapter back :-(&nbsp; I'm still working on reinstalling/locating everything I lost.</p>

<p>Thank you for posting an update. System restore brings back the state of your device prior to a major change. In situations that there were missing items that were not brought back upon the completion of the procedure, an in-place upgrade can be performed
 not only to fill those items but also to automatically install the latest iteration of Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>Let us know how it goes after you've performed the steps.</p>

<p>After uninstalling the update, attempting a PC Reset, resetting network adapters, checking for updated drivers, deleting the device and rebooting didn't work, I tried a USB Wireless Adapter. When the portable device came online, the original installed device

<h3> mquax25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphones not working after windows update.</h2>
                    <p>So my windows updated last night (Without warning me about it, as per usual. As if this updates ever did any good...) and once the laptop was back up and running my headphones were no longer working on it. I will plug them in and sometimes I get&nbsp; a notification
 that I have in fact, plugged them in, but they will not show in Playback or emit any sound. I've tried uninstalling drivers and installing them again, but nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drivers are RealTek High Definition Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this issue? </p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have tried both set of headphones I have in other devices and they work perfectly, it's just the laptop with Win10 that they don't work with.)</p>

            Please try these steps and check after each step. If these don't work, let me know. I will provide further troubleshooting steps.
<br />
<br />1. Run Audio / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; 
<br />A. Playing Audio &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />B. Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Audio Driver 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; Sound, Video &amp; game controllers &gt; Right Click on the entry below (if more than one, then you will have to repeat the steps for all) &gt; Properties &gt; Driver Tab &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Roll Back -  If Roll back driver is enabled, roll it back
<br />
<br />B. Update - Update driver
<br />
<br />C. Download and reinstall the driver from computer manufacturer's website - If you face issue, let me know your computer make and model?
<br />
<br />3. Check Speaker / headphone is not disabled and is set as default
<br />
<br />Type Sound in Windows Start Seach box &gt; Click Sound &gt; Under Playback tab, right click on an empty space and select, Show disconnected devices and Show disabled devices &gt; Select Speaker and click on Properties and make sure that it is is enabled &gt; You may also check if the Speaker that you are using is set as default.
<br />
<br />There are two other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>

<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions

            Check to see if you have it already.
<br />Right click your start button and select run.
<br />Type the following.
<br />gpedit.msc
<br />
<br />Rather then installing gpedit.msc you can also disable telemetry with the registry.
<br />Much easier.
<br />Before you do this make a restore point.
<br />Go to search and type restore point and click the option that says "Create a Restore Point" and then click Create.
<br />Once that it done go to search and type regedit and open it.
<br />Go here.
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\DataCollection
<br />Right click DataCollection and select New DWORD(32bit) 
<br />Name it AllowTelemetry and set it to 0.
<br />Setting it to 0 turns it off and 1 turns it on.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/91d96b6b-7b48-411f-83da-e95b0b067525?upload=true" />

    <title>Timing is off randomly in Movie Maker under Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianquass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Timing is off randomly in Movie Maker under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've used Movie Maker plenty of times and never found it inconsistent during playback.&nbsp; If a video image coincided timewise with a certain part of a song during one playback, it would do the same thing during a second and third playback.&nbsp; That's all changed
 recently.&nbsp; The change showed up right after Windows 10 was installed on my system -- tho' this may be a coincidence since I had gone a while without using Movie Maker until recently.&nbsp; (This is probably also the first time that I've tried to make a Movie Maker
 video on my new ASUS "republic of games" computer, but that may be a coincidence, too.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, now, when I cue video to start at a certain point in the song that I'm using, I can play the video back and get perfect results the first time, and then the next time (without having made any changes to the file whatsoever) the video and the
 song will no longer be in perfect sync but will be off perhaps by as much as 2 seconds.&nbsp; I can run the thing again and get different results, sometimes showing things back in sync again, sometimes showing things off by another small random amount.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me why this might be happening suddenly?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Brian</p>

            <p>Most often when I've seen these symptoms, the issue is the format of the music file. Certain file types (especially high-bitrate .mp3 files) can have problems during preview where they don't match the same position when you jump to the middle of the song.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this, convert the .mp3 file to .wma format and use that instead. It should stay in sync throughout.</p>

<h2>            GTA 5 installation</h2>
                    
<p>So the install disc is supposed to be installed to HDD or a usb flash drive,right? and the play disc is not supposed to be installed right?Then why am i having slight framerate drops in the game?this happens mostly when there is too much traffic going on
 or when i'm driving too fast.Does this happen to anyone else?It is really getting annoying from what is a perfect game.</p>
<p>Also can we install both discs to the same usb flash drive?</p>
<p>Please reply,thanks in advance.</p>

<p>So GTA V has a mandatory install disc which requires 8 GB of free space.</p>
<p>As soon as you launch this disc you will be prompted to install the file. If for any reason the install does not work you can manually install to you hard drive by following this link:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/audio-video-setup-and-use/install-play-delete-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../install-play-delete-game</a></p>
<p>The second disc is a play disc which Rockstar have already recommended isn’t installed to your hard drive as this can cause texture issues. This wont be a problem for some people but others prefer the quiet running of games installed on hard dives etc.</p>
<p>A way round this is to install the play disc to a USB flash drive which can be done as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-360/accessories/usb-flash-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../usb-flash-drive</a></p>

<p>II M0Z II is yet again failing to mention that Rockstar states on its own website to not install the play disc at all. &nbsp;Hard drive or USB does not matter. &nbsp;The people who made the game say to not install the play disc.</p>
<p>"For optimal performance, we recommend only installing the Install Disc, and not also installing the Play Disc to the Xbox 360 Hard Drive or USB drive via Xbox Home (dashboard). &nbsp;You will be prompted to install the Install Disc the first time you boot the

    <title>Windows 8 XBOX Live games gamertag change&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kari finn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 XBOX Live games gamertag change&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First: I am posting this here, as I seem to be unable to post on XBOX support forums, getting this message every time I press "Post":<br />
<br />
</p>
<i><b>Ooops! What happened to this page? We’ve moved some things around. </b></i>
<p><i><b>The page you are looking for may have a new location, or is no longer available.</b></i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
So typical Microsoft: I have half a dozen PCs running Windows 8, and a Windows 8 Phone. I do not however have nor do I want an XBOX; for my gaming needs, the Windows 8 and Windows Phone are enough. I would like to pay for XBOX Live Gold to play online games
 with my friends abroad, being a free member now unable to do that, but I am not willing to sign up for Gold as long as I am forced to use the automatically generated gamertag.&nbsp;<br />
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you sign up to <b>XBOX Live</b>&nbsp;on a Windows 8 PC (launch the Games App first time) to be able to fully utilize Windows 8 &amp; Windows Phone gaming, you cannot select your gamertag. It is automatically generated by the system, and (at least mine is) really
 stupid and even in some cases a bit offending. The gamer is allowed to change it once for free, but when you try to do it from XBOX Live website &gt; your profile, you only get instructions on how to change the gamertag using
<b>XBOX console</b>, which I do not have nor am I willing to buy it, or on the <b>
Games for Windows Live</b>, which Microsoft closed last month.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As my chat with XBOX Live "support" revealed, the so called "support" does not know a thing. They didn't even know the
<b>Games for Windows Live</b> is closed by Microsoft, I had to tell it repeatedly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The only working piece of advice I got was&nbsp;<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">to go to a retailer and ask if I could borrow an XBOX to change my gamertag!</span></em></p>
<p><i><u><br />
</u></i></p>
<p><b>My question: Regarding Windows 8 XBOX Live users who do not own an XBOX, is it really an official Microsoft policy to advice users willing to change their gamertag to find a retailer who lets the user to use their showroom XBOX device to change it?</b><br />
<br />
<font><span>A frustrating "support" chat from a frustrated long time Microsoft customer (I've edited a few typos and removed unnecessary "Hello's"):&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<span>Kazie:</span>&nbsp;It doesn't necessarily need for you to have a console to change your gamertag. Once you register to Xbox, the system will generate a uniqie gamertag for you that you can change one time for free.<br />

            Hi Kari,<br />
<br />
Yeah that is frustrating. You might try calling Xbox Support to see if you get any further<br />
there. Let us know if it helps.<br />

            That chat transcript above is from my chat with XBOX Support, or at least the first two or three support technicians I was chatting with were from XBOX Support. Only the last person was from Windows Phone Support, I do not know why they transfered me to
 him.
<div><br />
<div>XBOX Live Support forums do not allow me to post there. It might be due my regional settings, I have US English as display language, Finnish as input language, location set to UK but I am physically in Germany. I need the regional settings to be exactly
 as they are.<br />
&nbsp;
<div>I have already called both Finnish and German XBOX support (I am a Finnish ex-pat working in Germany), useless. Two things which tell a lot about the product and the company behind it:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Although Microsoft has closed down the Games for Windows Live service last month, all support staff both on chat and on phone tell me to download Games for Windows Live client, launch any game and from the game settings change the gamertag. I have fired
 help desk staff for far less; not knowing that one of the main products you are there to give support does not exist any more, what does that tell about the quality of said "support"?</li><li>Playing Microsoft Solitaire or Minesweeper on Windows 8, not to mention more advanced games, requires an XBOX Live account and a gamertag, which will be automatically created if the Microsoft account used to sign in for Windows does not have one previously.
 But Microsoft is not satisfied when I only bought half a dozen OS licences, they are also insisting that although changing the player name on a computer game should of course be easily done, Windows 8 users can only do it by buying an otherwise completely
 unnecessary XBOX console. Nice way to make some extra cash</li></ul>
<div>I am utterly profoundly disappointed in Microsoft when hearing the XBOX Support staff telling me that the simple task I would like to do could only be done by going to an XBOX retailer and "borrowing" their showcase consoles. Check my profile and posts
 / tutorials on the www.SevenForums.com (click my avatar to go to my profile here, link can be found there) and www.EightForums.com and you'll see I have been a really enthusiastic MS fanboy (Windows &amp; Office) and especially a hardcore Windows 8 advocate but
 this stupid cash fishing goes now too far.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Why does Microsoft not tell for Windows 8 buyers that if they want to play Windows 8 Microsoft games on their PC (games which BTW can be downloaded from Windows Store using any Windows 8 PC), they need to buy an XBOX in order to change the simplest settings?</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When you contacted Xbox Support did you discuss not being able to post in the Xbox<br />
Forums? You should be able to post in the US Forums and the others is my thinking<br />
however I really don't know the setup or limitations especially outside the USA.<br />

No, it does not help. Microsoft's answer for Windows 8 users still is that although Windows 8 game system uses XBOX Live account and in fact even the&nbsp;simplest&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft games published and freely downloadable to any Windows 8 computer (Solitaire, Minesweeper,
 Tap Tiles etc.)&nbsp;require an XBOX Live account and gamertag, I'm really stupid if I think that it's enough to have Windows 8. Of course Microsoft expects me to buy an XBOX, too. The only other option, as told by Microsoft &amp; XBOX Live "Support" is to ask a retailer
 if I could use their showcase XBOX to change my settings.

What a strange comment!
<div><br />
<div>Please let me summarize this <b><i><u>MICROSOFT</u></i> WINDOWS 8</b> issue of mine here at
<b><i><u>MICROSOFT</u></i></b> <b>COMMUNITY</b>:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Unlike previous versions of Windows, Windows 8 does not natively include any games. When user launches the Windows 8 Games app (BTW, it's titled Xbox Games) first time, system creates a required free
<b><u>Xbox Live Silver</u></b> account automatically generating the username (so called gamertag) if the Microsoft Account in question is not previously connected to an existing Xbox Live account. This free Silver account can be upgraded to a paid for Gold
 account. If the user is signed in to Windows 8 using a local account instead of a Microsoft Account, the Games App (as well as Store, Mail and other apps) needs first to be connected to a Microsoft Account (see
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/14RzSL8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Windows 8 Games App)</li><li>First time the user is let know about his / her new gamertag is when said user then launches a Microsoft game first time on his / her Windows 8. A strange, stupid and sometimes offensive username appears on every game (see
<a href="http://sdrv.ms/14RzVXd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">screenshot</a>&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Windows 8 Solitaire)</li><li>At this point when I contacted&nbsp;&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows 8 tech support to ask how I can change this username, I was told to contact Xbox Live Support. Transcript of my chat with Xbox Live Support in first post</li><li>Xbox Live Support did'nt even know that the only option to change this username without Xbox game console,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_for_Windows_%E2%80%93_Live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Games for Windows Live</b></a> system, has been shut down by Microsoft. The only "valid" piece of advice from said support team was to find a retailer selling Xbox consoles and use their showcase console to change the username in store</li><li>Later phone calls to Xbox Support in two different countries have only revealed that Xbox Live Support is basically only for users of Xbox game consoles, not for Windows 8 gamers, even if the Windows 8 games app is called
<b>Xbox Games</b> and <b><i><u>requires</u></i></b> an Xbox Live account. I was told to get back to Microsoft Windows 8 support</li><li>Microsoft Windows 8 support says there's nothing they can do</li><li>I have 9 Windows 8 computers in my home network, 8 of them Windows 8 (see <a href="http://sdrv.ms/14RAeS1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
screenshot</a>). These computers are mainly used using 5 different Microsoft Accounts. Not a single of these 5 Microsoft accounts has got an automatically generated Windows 8 games username (Xbox Live Gamertag) that we are happy with. For instance, all gamertags
 are in English but as my German wife cannot a word English, she cannot even pronounce her gamertag</li><li>As a Finnish ex-pat in Germany I'd like to&nbsp;socialize&nbsp;more with my nieces and nephews, kids of my siblings&nbsp;and cousins back in my native Finland. They all (almost) have Xboxes and paid Xbox Live Gold accounts which let them share games and play online together
 with other Xbox Live Gold users, both Xbox console and Windows 8 Games users</li><li>I would like to upgrade my Windows 8 game account (currently the free Xbox Silver) to a Gold account to participate, but am not willing to do it as long as I have this really stupid username generated by system. Might sound a trivial thing to you but when
 playing online with kids of my siblings, all using gamertags based on their real or nicknames, I do not want to be identified as "The LobsterLover68"</li><li>I know this issue would solve itself if I bought an Xbox game console. My point however is, why can't I as a Windows 8 user fully utilize my Windows 8 without buying extra hardware?</li></ul>
<div>Yes, as you mention there are other games for Windows 8 than the Microsoft ones. I've heard there's even other operating systems than Windows ;). However, as a
<b>Microsoft Windows 8</b> user and advocate I am asking advice for a <b>Microsoft Windows 8</b> issue at
<b>Windows 8 Gaming</b> section of the&nbsp;<b>Microsoft Community</b> when all official Microsoft support channels are not able or willing to help me.<br />
<br />
Could you please tell me why do you think my issue does not belong here?<br />
<br />
Respectfully,</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You have to add Xbox games if you want them so if you want non-Xbox games you add them<br />
instead. <br />
<br />
As I said above we are a peer review forum staffed mostly by volunteers. Feedback here is<br />
unproductive so it would be better to use the resources I posted above. Doubly so about<br />
Xbox game issues which have their own Support and Forums as I indicated in the first reply<br />
in this thread.<br />

            With every response you are showing more and more that you are not able to understand this.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am not talking about Xbox Games as in console gaming. I am instead talking about Windows 8 PC games, the Windows 8 games app, and posting my concern at IMO the one and only correct place, the Windows 8 Gaming section on Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Don't let Microsoft's misleading naming policy confuse you. This is as much about apples and oranges as if I was asking advice for Outlook (as in mail client, part of Ms Office) and you would send me to ask it on Outlook.com (as in ex-Hotmail) support
 forums. To play classical Microsoft Windows games (Solitaire,&nbsp;Minesweeper, Mahjong, Hearts etc.) on a Windows 8 computer, you need to use Windows Games App (native built-in Microsoft Windows 8 app) which is misleadingly named Xbox Games. This Windows 8 Games
 app on PC automatically creates the Xbox Live account and username assigned to it I have been talking about. Participating in tournaments and sharing high scores or playing online with other Windows 8 users (or Xbox Live users on Xbox consoles) is impossible
 without this account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft Windows 8 support tells to ask Xbox support mainly because of the same confusion: it seems that the official Microsoft Windows 8 support is unaware of the fact that Windows 8 Games App is called Xbox Games and that to play Microsoft Windows 8
 games the user needs an Xbox Live account. Xbox support says they are to support Xbox console users and sends requests back to Microsoft Windows 8 support, or as the chat in my first post shows to Windows Phone support (!).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then as a frustrated user asks his question about <b>Windows 8 <i><u>Games</u></i></b> app and its usage here,
<b>Windows 8 <i><u>Gaming</u></i></b> section at <b>Microsoft Community</b>, then come you and tell this is a wrong place to discuss this subject?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It might be that due English not being my native language I am unable to explain this in such a simple way that you, too, would understand it. Last try:
<b>I need help with using a native, built-in Windows 8 app made by Microsoft</b>, not with using a game console. I want to know why this native Windows 8 Games App does not let me to change my username but instead forces me to use one I am not happy with. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Beginning to feel this is useless, I want to apologize that I have raised this issue about native Windows 8 Games app here at Windows 8 Gaming section of the Microsoft Community; What an idiot I was to think this would be the place to discuss Windows Gaming.</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community forums and thank you for posting the question. I will surely help you to find a resolution regarding the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the model number for the Acer laptop?
</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Was it working before? </p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you installed the latest drivers for the webcam from the Acer website?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you have any application programs such as messengers or chat apps installed on the computer to check?
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to open any application that uses webcam and enable webcam option in the options. If it is not working,
<span>I would recommend you to download it from the website below:<br />
<a href="http://support.acer.com/us/en/drivers_download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.acer.com/us/en/drivers_download.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Once the driver is installed you can use the webcam on different applications like Chat Messengers etc.<br />
<br />
You may also download check the user manual from Acer on about how to turn on the camera.<br />
In the link below browse to the notebook model and click on "Document" tab and you can download the e-manual of the notebook.</span></p>

<h3> brent37  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to change the location where windows 8 apps srore dara</h2>
                    How can I change the location where Windows 8 Metro apps store data? Since the hard drive on my Win 8 Pro tablet is not that large, I want to direct my apps to store data on my micro sd card. Ideally I also want to move my actual apps there as well just
 like I could do on my Droid tablet.

<p>Hi Brent,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You would like to know if you can change the location of the folder where Windows 8 Apps store the data or you would like to know if you can move the complete apps to a different location on your micro SD card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry to inform you that this is not possible. The Windows 8 Apps get installed into the location: “Program Files\WindowsApps” in the C drive of the computer where the operating system is installed. We do not have any option to change this to a different
 location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to get back to us for any further queries or issues related to Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has stopped displaying the &#34;Safe to remove&#34; notification</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, my Windows 10 has stopped displaying the "Safe to remove" notification when I attempt to eject my flash drive&nbsp;from the USB port, instead it just makes a sound when removing...... I've sussed out how to choose what happens when I insert in Autoplay
 but how to change it back to display the Safe to remove notification before removing my USB is a mystery to me, I've been searching my laptop top to bottom and still cant&nbsp;find anything to change it, any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
We got it. It sounds that there are notification services that were disabled recently. For accuracy, it would be best to check here first:<br />
<br />
<strong>Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From here, ensure that these two options are turned on:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>Get notifications from apps and other senders.</em></li><li><em>Get tips, tricks, and as you use Windows </em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Tell us what you have. </p>

</p><p>It seems that we're now ready to get to its root. The next method will be a registry modification. Please check

<p>Yes ann07 method has done it but&nbsp;I did it wrong first time&nbsp;with the instructions I right clicked on HKEY_CURRENT_USER folder and created new DWORD (32 bit) Value which I deleted after creating as I realised had followed the instructions incorrectly, hope
 that was ok deleting it and hope I haven't done any damage to my system by creating a new DWORD (32 bit) Value and then deleting&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Actually, I can see that I did not write all that I should have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before editing anything in the Registry, you are always advised to make a full backup.&nbsp; I do not suppose you are going to.&nbsp; I don't either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what I do is save the key I am working on before starting - in this example, you are working on</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notifications\Settings\Microsoft.Explorer.Notification.{.....}</p>
<p>so, before starting, right click on the key &amp; select Export then browse to a convenient folder and save it.&nbsp; The default file type, as you will see, is .reg and you should leave it as that.&nbsp; [<em>You can also Export after you have finished work so that you
 can keep both before &amp; after records.</em>]&nbsp; When you have saved the file[s] you can:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Right-click on the .reg file, select Edit and you will see its contents in Notepad {<em>in a format that is much, much easier to read than would have been the case if you had messed about trying to Export the key as a .txt file type</em>}.&nbsp; It is perfectly
 safe to open it in Notepad and have a look around the various entries as long as you do not change anything that you do not understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Double-click on it, give it a couple of confirmations to proceed then await its completion dialog - running the .reg file rewrites all the values in the key to what they are in the .reg file.&nbsp; So if you make a pig's ear out of your Registry editing, you
 can run the&nbsp;<em>before </em>version of the&nbsp;.reg file to get back to where you started.&nbsp; Similarly, you can run the
<em>after </em>version of the .reg file if you ever reset it to defaults [or if a Windows update does that for you].</p>

<p>I'm not very good with computers Denis, I wouldn't of known were to start with backing up things, I was told to do that with Marcs last reply, I didn't do anything else all I did was create a new DWORD (32 bit) Value cos I followed the instructions incorrectly,
 but after deleting that I followed what to do the right way as stated. I don't think I've done anything wrong, is there anything in windows that I could run to check my registry is fine?</p>

<p>Lee,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There really is no need to check anything.&nbsp; You described what you did and no damage will have been done.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no tool that can check the Registry anyway [Microsoft binned theirs in about 2011].&nbsp; And don't be conned by some third-party tools that claim it is worthwhile &amp; effective as long as you buy their tools to do it with - they are con-artists who should
 be &lt;100 lines of invective removed by forum moderator&gt;.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Actually, I have only just seen your latest post.&nbsp; I have noticed that my list of current forum threads is being updated rather haphazardly but did not realise I was missing updates to threads I had been involved with.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I looked for this thread again was because I wanted to check whether or not your [corrected] Registry edit solved your problem and that the notification appears.&nbsp; I now understand just what the problem was.&nbsp; You can check the details in&nbsp;my post
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/usb-safe-to-remove-notification-missing/17b7c974-400f-4cf7-bfa0-72d3d7218640?page=5&amp;msgId=eee75e34-67d8-4097-a9eb-e0a90557f5ab">
Restore the USB Safe to remove notification</a>&nbsp;if you want but, in brief, you can set it by going to
</p>
<p><em>Settings</em>, <em>System</em>, <em>Notifications &amp; actions</em>, <em>Get notifications from apps and other senders</em></p>
<p>and setting this to On.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you did with the Registry edit was to work this in reverse - you changed the Registry entry and it changed the corresponding entry in the user interface.&nbsp; No harm done at all, I just wanted to point out why it worked. [Not all Registry entries can work
 in reverse but this one does]</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the best,</p>
