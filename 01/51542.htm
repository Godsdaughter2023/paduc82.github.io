    <title>How Do I Reinstall Windows App Store&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjhollywood  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I Reinstall Windows App Store&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am needing to reinstall windows app store. I also don't want to do a full reinstall of windows as I don't have enough bandwidth to download all my programs and games again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows store wouldn't install or update any apps, always came up with an error. I wasn't really bothered as I never download things from the app store. But now i want to download Forza Horizon 3, which is unfortunately only available through the app
 store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried most things on the internet about fixing the windows store including an inplace upgrade from windows 10 to windows 10, though it couldn't upgrade and failed. I came across something saying uninstall it then reinstall windows store. problem is
 when I try reinstall it, I get this error in powershell.-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-AppxPackage : Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF9, Install failed. Please contact your software vendor.<br />
(Exception from HRESULT: 0x80073CF9)<br />
error 0xC000003A: Deployment of package Microsoft.WindowsStore_11610.1001.23.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe was blocked by<br />
AppLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the above error after entering this into powershell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add-AppxPackage -register "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_11610.1001.23.0_x 64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\AppxManifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode</p>
<p>
</p><p>Powershell is running in administrator mode, SFC /scannow shows no errors, all other suggestions i have seen on the Microsoft answers suggests my computers files system is fine with everything i do completing successfully without errors displaying, i have
 also defragged my harddrive and scanned and fixed for errors. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't know what else to try.</p>

            <p>Hi CJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address this query, since that you've tried to reinstall the Store through PowerShell and didn't work, our last resort in restoring the Store is to create a new user account. It will restore all uninstalled built-in apps. You may refer to this link for
 the steps: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a local user account in Windows 10.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>That didn't resolve the problem, was no windows store in the new account. what i had to do was reinstall windows. so the windows store works again for now. if it works for more than 6 months this time, i might buy something from it, if it stops working again
 i will just uninstall it and leave it out of the system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>i think microsoft should make it like a software package which you can update or remove or reinstall with ease.</p>

    <title>Notifications STILL not working on Samsung S7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr.lawler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Notifications STILL not working on Samsung S7</h2>
                    <p>I have responded to and posted on numerous threads regarding this issue. I have even had several text chats with no resolution. Before you ask, ALL of my notification settings are set to receive notifucations from Skype, my phone settings are set to receive
 notifcations, i have checked to make sure the app is not battery optimized and my wifi never goes to sleep, I have cleared the cached, uninstalled and reinstalled the app several times, and my app is always on. I am using the latest Android 7 OS and Skype
 8.3.0.51670. I even installed the push notification app Skype recommended and signed out and back in to hangouts. I have great wifi reception.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until 2 weeks ago, even with the roll out of the new Skype i was receiving a sound, light, and tile notification even when my phone was locked as it should be. Then 2 weeks ago, and without me changing a single thing on my phone, all notifications stopped.
 I did begin receving a notification on my screen if my phone is on and the screen not locked, but no sound or light alert. This is so frustrating. I rely upon the sound or vibration to alert me to liok at mt phone for a message. That is the purpose of instant
 messaging. Please contact me and help fix this issue. The audio alert, even if the phone screensaver comes on, is extremely important. Not sure why this went away.</p>

    <title>CHK files recovery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lauren358  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHK files recovery</h2>
                    <p>I am hoping I can get advice on how to restore lost files while transfering&nbsp;jpegs onto a USB. I cut the 2000&nbsp;pictures and pasted into the usb&nbsp;which i then believed had gone on. However when I tried to open them on the usb&nbsp;I realised something had happened
 as only the folder was visable. After managing to restore the pictures, they were only available in CHK files, stores into a found000 folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there is any advice on how to restore these photos back to jpeg so that i can view them. Changing them to the file type to jpeg still didn't allow me to open the pictures so I am looking for further advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

            Probably not.
<br />
<br />The thing is, CHK's are not files as such. They are actually file fragments that have become "disassociated" from each other because the file system was interrupted before it could create the links required to link the blocks used by a file together.  The chkdsk utlity scans the disk to find these orphan blocks and names them CHK files.
<br />
<br />This page goes into more detail: 
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/282798/what-are-the-found000-folder-and-file0000chk-file-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/282798/what-are-the-f...</a>
<br />
<br />A CHK file represents "1 block" of storage on the HD.  Exactly how big that is depends on your total drive size. On current drives you can expect 4K, 8K, and larger.  If your file fits completely in a block/chk, then you stand a chance of being able to recover the file. But files that are larger than the block are a problem. If you can match the CHK files together great. I may be possible with text files. But for files like graphics, very unlikely you will be able to reassemble them.

<br />
<br />You can extract text, then piece the text found in separate CHK files back together, if you are familiar with the file content.

<h2>            RealTek Sound stutters in Windows 10, among other things.</h2>
                    This has happened to be about once a month, starting in October of 2017. After a computer restart, any audio that comes out of the computer (whether it be with or without earbuds/headphones) will have a strange glitch effect to it. I'm not exactly sure
 if this next thing is a byproduct or related to that, but my cursor will also skip and stutter. I have tried restarting, shutting down overnight, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, etc. No luck. If anyone has a solution, please let me know.&nbsp;

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.

            Hi Lena.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Sound Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.  If no newer then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If no Updates listed this could also be the latest Windows 10 Version 1709 Update which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About and if necessary roll back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide with the tool given above to wait for it to mature.  
<br />
<br />Or you can try the most stable method to update to the latest version (which you need anyway) by installing  Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Lena,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the previous replies, it seems that you have already exhausted quite a number of troubleshooting. Also, it is pretty evident that this is a hardware driver issue. At this point in time, we suggest that you get in touch with your PC manufacturer's
 support team, or RealTek to have the issue sorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

            I'm back. After this issue magically fixing itself nine days ago, it's been going on and off with no real solution. On some days it's fixed, and on others it isn't. The newest Windows 10 update is pending as of writing this, and I'm not sure that it will
 fix this issue permanently or not. I've also realized that downloading large things, such as Steam games, brings the issue back and the only solution is uninstalling said things. Any tips?

<h2>            Xbox 360 SmartGlass App gone from Windows Store&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I went to download the Xbox 360 SmartGlass App onto my Surface from the Windows Store today, and the app no longer appears to be on the store. The Xbox One SmartGlass app is there, but not the 360 one. Web links still point to the Xbox 360 app and have an
 'install' button, but when you click it you are navigated to the store--with no app available.</p>
<p><br />
Is this a temporary glitch, or has the Xbox 360 SmartGlass app been removed?</p>

<h2>            Windows XP 10 min bootup, then runs normal.</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>OK, so where do I begin? I've run into this issue with multiple PCs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Issue</span></b><span>: BIOS loads, PC hits the windows splash screen, then goes black for about 10 min. After that, it boots normally and runs great.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Troubleshooting:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I've ruled out hardware failure, as rebuilding the PC seems to fix this issue. But the problem with doing that is that it doesn't seem to completely resolve the issue in some cases. Eventually (say 2-3 months later) the issue will come back.</span></p>
<p><span>I've rebuilt 2 PCs for this issue, one of them, the issue came back, the other didn't.</span></p>
<p><span>Most users (as a work-around) will just wait the 10 min and/or never shut down their PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Most PCs with this issue have little in common other than Windows XP / Microsoft office 2003 / Citrix</span></p>
<p><span>Some PCs with the build experience the issue, some do not.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Event logs: They don't really tell me anything, considering the you can see in the log when all the services shut off, then 7-10 min later, all the services start up. And there is nothing in between.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've run chkdsk /r as well as a defrag, neither resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I've rolled back the&nbsp;registry&nbsp;using backup utilities to the day it was deployed to the user. The issue is then resolved, but nothing works... ie programs later installed, etc....</span></p>
<p><span>So I've narrowed my search to the registry.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I downloaded Microsoft Bootvis which has been helpful in&nbsp;confirming&nbsp;that it gets stuck at the registry. Also there is ZERO hard drive activity while it's hanging.</span></p>
<p><span>Disk utilization is at 0% while CPU usage is pegged at 100%. Very strange, the CPU&nbsp;fluctuates&nbsp;normally everywhere else in the Bootvis log than this spot, that lasts&nbsp;510-518 seconds</span></p>
<p><span>During this time it's loading "registry+pagefile"</span></p>
<p><span>I've turned off prefetch completely and the issue remains. (which loads completely before registry+pagefile)</span></p>
<p>I have also added more physical memory to the machine, and changed the pagefile.sys (virtual memory), neither of them have shown any effect on the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>In all honesty, the PCs act like they are waiting for something, but instead just timeout after the period of time, then boot normally.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Comparing the registry entries for both PCs (a brand new built machine, and the affected machine)</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Memory Management</span></p>
<p><span>They both have the same values for all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>All of them are Lenovo PCs running:</span></p>
<p><span>i3-2100 CPU</span></p>
<p><span>2 GB of ram</span></p>
<p><span>Windows XP volume sp3 32 bit (fully updated)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes and Trendmicro fully updated and 0 threats found on the PCs.</span></p>
<p>Again, rebuilding a PC with this issue will resolve the issue, but for some, it has come back. And all affected PCs use the same build, but not all PCs with the build experience the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for the help,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Chris</span></p>

            Thanks for the reply, I've been to 2 of the 3 websites listed above in an attempt to troubleshoot it earlier.
<div><br />
<div>The first link had some good info.</div>
<div>I used changed the value for ClearPageFileAtShutdown to 1 (true), this made no change to the boot delay.</div>
<div>As well as changing the StartupDelay to 40000 instead of 480000 under H<span>KEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\ContentIndex.</span></div>
<div><span>This didn't change anything either.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>For the most part, the websites listed above talk about windows after winlogon.exe has started.</div>
<div>It seems that this problem lies before that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here is the bootvis view:</div>

            It does happen when booting into safe mode.
<div>There is currently only 1 hard drive in the machine as well as 1 DVD drive.</div>
<div>Only 1 partition on the disk, also note that the boot.ini is unchanged between the problem PC and the freshly built machine.</div>

            <span>After reading the link here are my comments on the troubleshooting steps mentioned in that article:</span>&nbsp;
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><b><span>Configure Windows not to load the file or the service that is mentioned in the error message</span>
</b><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>-this seems to be referencing an error that occurs after winlogon.exe is run.&nbsp;
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><b>Determine if a new program was recently installed on your computer</b></span>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>-</span><span>it’s hard to determine when the PCs are out in the field, but the large majority of users do not have administrative privileges on the PC. Therefore the IT staff installs programs instead of the user. In which case no programs have
 been installed that seem to be directly related to this issue.</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><b>Start your computer in Safe mode</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-issue also occurs in safe mode.&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Use Device Manager to determine if the problem is related to a device driver</b></div>
<div>-all drivers are properly installed and working correctly.</div>
<div><b><span><br />
</span></b></div>
<div><b><span>Use the System Restore tool to restore the operation of Windows XP</span>
</b><b>&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-a system restore will fix the problem if I roll it back to the day the machine was deployed. But the PC rolls back the registry, meaning that a lot of newly installed programs stop working. The PC will act like the programs are installed, but none of
 them will work. Then it will tell me that those programs don’t have valid windows installation files making it so they are not removable as well as you can’t re-install over the top of them. Inevitably it’s better to just go with a fresh image. Which then
 leads to the possibility of the issue happening again (as said in the original post).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Use the Last Known Good Configuration tool to restore the operation of Windows XP</b></div>
<div>-this actually uses a fresh setup in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Controlset--- basically it rolls back to when the registry last ‘worked’ but even the prior reboot booted into windows (even though it took 10 min). In other words, it doesn’t change the
 10 min boot.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Perform an in-place upgrade to repair your installation of Windows XP</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>-this is something I will try, but I don’t hold high hopes for this being a permanent resolution. If it resolves the issue, it’s possible that the problem will come back on the same machine in the future.&nbsp;</div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><b>Confirm that your CMOS/BIOS settings are correct </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ­</div>
<div>-bios firmware along with all settings are the same between PC with the issue and PC without the issue.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Confirm that your hard disk or file system is not damaged</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>-hard drive is functioning, again re-imaging this PC resolves the problem, but it is prone to coming back.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After stewing on this issue for some time, I honestly think that there is some “timeout” limit set somewhere in the registry for this period of time. Exactly 500 seconds. Even as just a temporary fix, it would be nice to just set that timeout limit for 10
 seconds. With one registry key fix. Then if the user experiences the issue, I could have them double click on a .reg file and BAM issue resolved. (At least until our company starts rolling out windows 7, scheduled before the end of the year).</p>

<div>It placed a Character on the Microsoft Sign On Screen for Live ID. I found it here and the numbers look familiar in the Event Viewer reports. The character is an A with a mark above it. Are these fake Microsoft sign in sites? The programs schedule themselves

            <p>I found UTN USERTrust Object in the Trusted Certificate Store, issued on the same date as the ones from UTN USERTrust in the untrusted list. Did you look in the untrusted section of Certificates? There you will see them&nbsp;listed as fraudulent.</p>
<p>There is a link to an&nbsp;article here that DigiNotar&nbsp;was not the only one, there were 8 according to Microsoft, including 2 fake Microsoft Certificates.</p>
<p>I deleted the certificates this way, as directed on this site: </p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2011/09/04/protecting-yourself-from-attacks-that-leverage-fraudulent-diginotar-digital-certificates.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.technet.com/b/srd/archive/2011/09/04/protecting-yourself-from-attacks-that-leverage-fraudulent-diginotar-digital-certificates.aspx</a></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span>The steps for both removing the DigiNotar root from the trusted root CA store and clearing the cache are listed below.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Remove the DigiNotar Root from the trusted root CA store</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Click Start, click Start Search, type mmc, and then press ENTER.</span>
</li><li><span>On the File menu, click Add/Remove Snap-in</span> </li><li><span>Under Available snap-ins, click Certificates, and then click Add</span>
</li><li><span>Under This snap-in will always manage certificates for, click Computer account, and then click Next</span>
</li><li><span>Click Local computer, and click Finish</span> </li><li><span>If you have no more snap-ins to add to the console, click OK</span> </li><li><span>In the console tree, double-click Certificates</span> </li><li><span>Double-click the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store and click on Certificates to view all certificates in the store</span>
</li><li><span>Select the two DigiNotar Root CA certificates. You can confirm the right certificates by checking their thumbprints which should be “c0 60 ed 44 cb d8 81 bd 0e f8 6c 0b a2 87 dd cf 81 67 47 8c” and “43 d9 bc b5 68 e0 39 d0 73 a7 4a 71 d8 51 1f 74
 76 08 9c c3”</span> </li><li><span>Right-click the certificates and select Delete</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>To perform the above steps from the command-line, you can use the certutil.exe tools as follows:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>certutil -delstore authroot “c0 60 ed 44 cb d8 81 bd 0e f8 6c 0b a2 87 dd cf 81 67 47 8c”</span>
</li><li><span>certutil -delstore authroot “43 d9 bc b5 68 e0 39 d0 73 a7 4a 71 d8 51 1f 74 76 08 9c c3”</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>If you distribute roots in your enterprise using group policy, follow the instructions to remove a root across an enterprise network via group policy -<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786148(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc786148(WS.10).aspx</span></a>.
 In step 3 of those group policy instructions, choose the root CA in question here - DigiNotar Root CAs with thumbprints "c0 60 ed 44 cb d8 81 bd 0e f8 6c 0b a2 87 dd cf 81 67 47 8c" and "43 d9 bc b5 68 e0 39 d0 73 a7 4a 71 d8 51 1f 74 76 08 9c c3".</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Clear the cache to remove any older cached CTL</span></p>
<p><span>The simplest way to do so is to use “certutil –urlcache * delete”. This will clean up the cache for the current user. You can find further documentation on this step, including a Microsoft Fix It package to clean up the cache, at
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2328240" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2328240</span></a></span></p>
<p>-----------------------------------------</p>
<p>Note: I used the certutil -urlcache * delete by start &gt; and typing it into the address bar. It came up with a black screen and scrolled down through hundreds of urls. I am hoping this will solve the problem with the about:blank redirect, which I find is
 no longer replacing my home page, but I noticed I could not use Bing for that, only msn.com. I could not use live either. (Prior to performing the above actions) I have been seeing the about:blank redirect however from Microsoft Partner Network email links.
 It goes first to about:blank and then to the page. I still cannot download anything using IE9, only Google Chrome. I will try now that I have removed the certificates.</p>
<p>One important note: After creating the Snap In as above for Certificates, I found many more categories of items than can be seen on the Certificates page and noticed that my personal certificate I created to identify myself was not there. I did find 5 invalid
 certificates by opening all of the files to see what was in there. These were named kat-pers, kat11, kat12, etc... I right clicked and deleted them all after viewing them by choosing that option on the right panel of the snap in console and clicking open,
 which brings up the certificate information. It said the Digital signatures were invalid.</p>
<p>There was an article that talked about ActiveX controls and kill bits. It seems it is an Active X control of some sort that is preventing my from being able to download files using IE9?
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/whatwedo/killbit.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/whatwedo/killbit.aspx</a></p>
<p>Maybe Pa Bear knows.</p>
<p>Anyway, I removed the UTN UserTrust Object in the Trusted Certificate Store and also the expired HP one I found in the Trusted Publishers. I had removed it yesterday, but today it was back and could not be removed. As Cyberlink is part of the original HP&nbsp;installed
 on the computer, I assume they were&nbsp;using that somehow.&nbsp;I found out that&nbsp;refreshing the browser is the only thing that has been discussed, which reverts everything back to the manufacturers settings and does&nbsp;NOT remove Group&nbsp;Policy, so it is not really a solution.
 My guess is that Live Services had created a Group Policy or&nbsp;a man in the middle was able to create&nbsp;Group Policy on my computer, effectively locking me out&nbsp;of changing anything as administrator.&nbsp;They were scheduling tasks with the task manager and using the
 hidden administrator account, but&nbsp;they had to be a server in the middle, which the articles on the blog explain.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>The minidump files showed a SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e) stop error caused by the USBPORT.SYS.</p>
<p>Here is a "summary" of the error:</p>
<p><em>BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x7E_BAD_IP_<strong>USBPORT</strong>!USBPORT_InitializeDevice+131</em></p>
<p>The usbhub.sys&nbsp;was also involved in the&nbsp;crash..</p>
<p>The problem appears to be very similar to what was reported in<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/error-0x0000007e-0xc0000005-0xf89908e8-0xf89907ec/a16ce68f-6e74-45d7-bdfe-c54714a2672e"> this</a> thread.</p>
<p>So, as in that thread,&nbsp;try the following hotfix which will update USB drivers including the usbhub.sys&nbsp;:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969238" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/969238</a></p>

<p>There seems to be a problem with the<a href="http://www.osronline.com/ddkx/buses/usbsystem_3rjb.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> USB driver stack</a> on some XP SP3 systems and the above hotfix&nbsp;may address the problem.<br />

            Thanks a lot Divya M. My problem isn´t with the former W10. About two months ago I upgraded my PC from 8.1 to Windows 10 and everything had been working properly. A few days ago the former version was upgraded to version 1511 (SO 10586.3) and from that
 moment I cannot connect to any WiFi network. WiFi appears not available when I start my PC. I have tried without success your first and second recomendation and I hope to have a solution before needind to restore my PC.<br />

            <p>Thanks a lot Amit for your reply. I have already tried your suggestions, without success. Let me tell you the whole story. I have the problem with a Lenovo IdeaPad S10-3, during past JUne I received a notification from Microsoft tellin that this PC was compatible
 for upgrading to Windows 10 so I did the reservation for that upgrading. Durin the first days of august I received and installed Windows 10 and it was workink without any kind of problems until a couple of weeks before when was installed the new version 1511.The
 next day after that installation, when I satarted my PC the WiFi icon shower with a red X on it and from there it has been impossible to recover it. The wired internet connection works fine. Due to that issue I contacted and chatted with Microsoft support
 and finally they recomended me to go back to the former version so I did that and restored drivers, etc., but no way no WiFi and beside that other functions of the PC and even some Microsoft applications as Mail, Shop, etc stopped working. so I cannot use
 it properly. I don´t know what to do. ¡My PC has been "destroyed" by Microsoft!.</p>
<p>Thanks again and I will appreciate if you can give me any other suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hi El,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. Appreciate your efforts!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might also arise due to the firewall intervention from the security software installed in the system. I would suggest you to disable any third party security software (<em>preferably uninstall it temporarily</em>) installed in
 the system and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Important Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have
 to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            I had a similar problem when I upgraded from windows 7 to 10 in September. &nbsp;My desktop came up in windows 10 with airplane mode stuck "on". It was frustrating to say the least. I was instructed to troubleshoot network etc and nothing resolved the issue.
 There is some sort of bug in the upgrade that makes it impossible to turn off airplane mode. My only solution was to restore my previous version. Upon doing that, all my wireless was back in action. There is likely nothing wrong with your system, other than
 this faulty version of windows. I have no idea why it happens to some people and not others. Some solutions suggest updating drivers etc, which is impossible if your sole avenue to Internet is with wireless when airplane mode is stuck on. Airplane mode, on
 a desktop unit s just plain silly, but that was my issue. I ran from 10 and will not go back.

            <p>Thanks Lorene for your attention and interest. I agree with you, that is a Microsoft problem and they should look for a solution. In my case Windows 10 was working fine during two and a half months so I was not able to go back to my former Windows 7 (they
 only give you one months for that) ,at this time I should have to look for the recovery disks and lost all my files and applications.For that I'll wait some time and hope Microsoft or Lenovo people give me a solution.</p>

                    So I have a Windows 10 HP laptop that used to be my brother's, but I can't figure out how to use (for example) F3, which you need for some games, like Minecraft, but when I press F3, it just brings the brightness up the brightness.&nbsp; I was wondering how
 to use the actual F3 key, because I've tried ctrl + F3 and shift + F3, but nothing works.&nbsp; Thank you!

            <p>1. Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Update.<br />
2. In the left pane, click View update history.<br />
3. Find KB2556532 that has failed to install, and then double-click the update to view more information.<br />
Updates that have failed to install will display Failed under Status, next to the update name.<br />
4. In the Windows Update dialog box, next to Error details, review the error code for the failed update.
<br />
5. Either follow the links in the Windows Update dialog box under More Information or Help and Support to try to fix the problem, and then try installing KB2556532 again or&nbsp;in the alternative, post back with the error code/message so that it can be investigated
 further and hopefully someone may be able to assist further.</p>

            That's part of the problem it's not saying it failed to install. It's installed successfully 16 times now since 8/11/2011, so there's no error code I can give.&nbsp; Also the update history box says you can remove updates by going to Installed Updates but when
 i do it says no updates are installed.

<h2>            Put Indexing on Pause, Now I want it unpaused</h2>
                    While&nbsp;running the "<u>Indexing Options</u>"&nbsp;noticed I could watch it work by viewing the charts in the "<u>Resource Monitor</u>". To prove that possibility I paused the Indexing and sure enough the memory use dropped down.&nbsp; Problem is now, the
<strong>PAUSE</strong> button is grayed out and I don't know how to un-pause it.

<h2>            how do I find the outlook data files on a hard drive removed from a windows xp machine&#63;</h2>
                    My laptop in no longer functioning and while I was able to get most of the data from my backups they did not include my outlook mail accounts. I have the hard drive removed and got a hard drive enclosure. Problem is I can't locate the outlook.pst file.
 Do you know what directory it is in?

            <p>The default location is at C:\Documents and Settings\<em>YourUserName</em>\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook and the default name is Outlook.pst</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can put Outlook files anywhere you want so you might need to search for *.pst to find them all [assuming you created more than one].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to put them in&nbsp;a location that gets included in your backups in Windows 7 then:</p>
<p>1 Close Outlook after having used it at least once [the file is created on first use].</p>
<p>2 Go to C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Outlook [you will need to show hidden files to reveal the path to get there or you can just paste the path into the Windows explorer address box to go straight there]</p>
<p>3 <u>Move</u> the Outlook.pst you find there to a convenient location within My Documents.</p>
<p>4 Open Outlook.&nbsp; It will report that it cannot find Outlook.pst and give you the option to browse for it so point it to where you have put the file.&nbsp; [When you next open Outlook, it will look at the new location without any further prompting]</p>
