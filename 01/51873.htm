<h2>            Windows 10 1511 system thread exception</h2>
                    I have been running Windows 10 since it came out. I am assuming a recent upgrade has caused this.&nbsp; I have the auto download windows updates set. I cannot get to repair as each time it tries, it reboots and throws the same system thread exception not handled
 Amustor.sys. Anyone have suggestions on how to resolve this?

    <title>File History and the &#36;OF Folder on my External Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattpsu79  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History and the &#36;OF Folder on my External Drive</h2>
                    <p>I've tried doing some searching online and no one seems to be able to give an answer. I enabled File History on my new computer last night backing up to an external hard drive. This morning I checked to see if it was complete and under the Data folder in
 the File History back up there are two folders, 'C' and '$OF'. The C folder contains the majority of backed up files...but after sifting through the $OF folder I found it contains a lot (as in thousands) of additional personal files from my machine. These
 files have been renamed with a sequential number and timestamp and placed into sequentially numbered folders. I spot checked the files and found that it appears the files that have been placed into $OF are not in the C folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the obvious question is why? What does the $OF folder represent? My hope is that File History is still in the process of fully backing these up and over time, they will eventually get placed into the C folder with their proper name. I plan to monitor
 through the day if there are any significant changes to this folder. But my bigger concern is that there was an error of sorts copying these files over and that the backup will remain in this condition...which is obviously an issue as if I needed one of these
 files I'd have to sift through thousands of files to find what I want.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have an understanding of what exactly the $OF folder is and why it exists?</p>

            <p>Disappointing that I can't seem to find an answer for this anywhere. All I can find is a few other people who have posed the question on various forums without anyone being able to get to the bottom of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the contents of the $OF folder have not changed all day despite multiple runnings of file history, I presume all the files that ended up there are there to stay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thought I had, since the first thing that comes to mind when I see the folder $OF is offline...I thought maybe windows has an issue with how it handles files when the external drive is offline or unavailable. So I tried creating a file when the
 external drive was turned off, and attempted to run File History...and I got the message that the files would be stored locally until the drive was available again. I then turned the drive on and ran File History again...seeing if the newly created file might
 end up in the $OF folder...but Windows did properly catch the file and get it in the right spot in the C folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think the $OF may be files where there was an issue syncing/copying to the external drive. Given that our drive is a wireless one, its certainly possible the connection was interrupted at some point during the initial sync. I may try deleting the
 backup on the external drive and trying running FIle History again to create the backup from scratch. If that doesn't work and no one can help me out on what's going on...I'm just going to abandon using File History as a backup agent...sounds like there's
 enough issues with it that its worth looking for third party software to do the job.</p>

            <p>That didn't even answer his question about the $OF folder, just proves how useless you and the rest of Microsoft tech support really is. Mediocre.</p>
<div>
<p>All I backed up was Documents, Videos, Music, and Pictures. I have no idea where this $OF folder came from. It's not on my C drive at all. Upon looking into it, it seems the File History has put some of my pics and vids there instead of where they should
 be in their correct library folder.</p>
<p>Also, the backup didn't even back up everything. There were tons of files missing from folders. I think it's because the backup adds so much to the file names that it makes them too long. It didn't even warn me that things hadn't backed up fully.

</p><p>File History regularly backs up versions of your files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the

<p>If you want to backup the file stored in your download folder, you will have to copy the data that is saved on download folder&nbsp; to Documents or desktop&nbsp;folder.Refer the following links for reference:</p>

<p>
</p><p>FWIW, the contents of $OF shrunk by about 1200 files and 15 folders since yesterday. I guess I'll monitor for a few more days and see if the data eventually makes it to the 'C' folder.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>One last followup, even though I think I'm the only one following this thread. I got frustrated this morning to find out that the number of files/folders in $OF returned to what it was on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So finally I did what I should've done in the first place, instead of looking at the files exactly as they appear on the external harddrive in File Explorer...I browsed through the files using the File History Restore Personal File option. When I did this
 I found all files appear properly, even those that are renamed and stored in the $OF folder of the backup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at the end of the day, it's not clear what the $OF folder is or why files end up there...but the files can still be accessed and recovered easily through the File History window as opposed to going into the external drive manually.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing the information with us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>$OF folder is created by File History. It’s one of the file history system file. This folder is like a temp folder used for smooth function of file backup on File history. For more information on File history folders you can post your query at Windows 8.1
 TechNet general forum.</p>

            <p>I came looking for answers to the same exact question. I also use File History to back up to an external hd. &nbsp;In my case, the $OF file had over 67,000 files! I didn't look in every one but many contained DNG files from my "preview" file of my photo editing
 software library. Thought I had solved the problem when I deleted all those files, and told FH not to back up that file any longer. &nbsp;Yet now, it has created another 250+ folders. Strangely, most are empty but some contain SOME of my music files from my iTunes
 library. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Such odd behavior. Yesterday I had freaked when discovering that almost half of my music was missing on the BU drive. I ran FH again, and now they are all there but I still have those pesky $OF files. The songs in those files are NOT in the regular iTunes
 Media library folders (on the BU drive) where they should be. For example, in one album with 20 songs, 5 of them are in an $OF folder and not in the music library folder with the rest of the album.&nbsp;I don't get this at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another issue I have with FH - due to lack of space, I often have FH delete the older duplicate versions. It does not seem to be consistent. I still end up with several versions in many of the folders even after doing the clean up. I only want ONE version
 on the back up drive. Wish I could tell it to only copy NEW files, not keep making duplicates of everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last complaint, as someone else mentioned, is how many folders I have to click through on the back up drive to get to a folder. It's ridiculous. The file paths are way, way too long.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS I like your icon, John.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>According to some other forum posts, $OF holds files whose pathname is too long to be stored on your backup device.&nbsp; My guess is that "OF" stands for "OverFlow".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History tries to do a "mirror" copy of your user files and folders, preserving directory and file names.&nbsp; Windows has a 255-character limit on all pathnames, though, and File History adds a longish timestamp to all filenames when it makes its copy,
 so if you have a file near the name length limit, Windows will have to save it to a different name when it makes the copy.&nbsp; Also, if you back up to a network drive, Windows has to prepend the server and share names to each filename to build the UNC path, so
 the apparent length cutoff may end up being much less than 255 characters.&nbsp; If you've got long directory names or deep trees, it could be that a lot of your files end up in $OF.

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; May I assume that the social.technet.microsoft.forum would be a place I could go to get&nbsp;answers to some of my questions, as well? I'm Not a tekky by any stretch, but I&nbsp;would like to&nbsp;Try &amp; get an answer to one of&nbsp;my problems which is I can't even turn ON
 File History, but my Husband &amp; Son both CAN (on this same PC...!!)&nbsp; So far, I haven't found a similar question/problem, so I apologize now&nbsp;for intruding into your posts.
</p>
<p>We've run the HomeGroup Troubleshooter (no issues found), the App troubleshooter (fixed WindowsStore issues, which fixed windows Reader issues[!cool!], and Tried to get, use Microsoft Fix It tool, but the Download site would Not take us TO the 'download'...
 (it Kept taking us back to the Download 'start' screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I won't bore you with the multitude of mini-problems [that all seem to be tied to the fact that MS's Windows 8.1 will Not<em> truly
</em>support <em>multiple</em> accounts on a single PC...], just hoping for a little guidance in the right direction for a 'non-technically inclined'&nbsp;person.</p>

            <p>&gt;Windows has a 255-character limit on all pathnames</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not quite correct. Some legacy code in Windows has a limit - the so called MAX_PATH problem harking back to the very early versions of the Windows API (application interface) when memory was a much scarcer resource than it is now. MAX_PATH is a hard-coded
 constant and is actually 260 ASCII characters. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most file system can handle very deep (long) paths although there is sometimes&nbsp;a character limit on each individual folder - certainly the ones used on anything in the last 10 years. Which is where the problem occurs. You can create very deep (long) paths
 that some applications can't handle because they are still using the legacy API.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bizarrely, that most modern of application, PowerShell, which Microsoft puts a lot of effort into, is still hampered with MAX_PATH which is most perplexing considering it's a relatively modern bit of software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing the File History developers decided to play safe and implemented a system whereby they handle long paths in a way that covers all bases. However, as File History is only on relatively modern operating systems, the decision is a little difficult
 to defend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a "tip of the iceberg" problem :-) Throw in spaces, Unicode and special characters and you could devote a whole career to this topic!</p>

    <title>win32k.sys BSOD Intermittent Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> proteus1946  say:</h3>
<h2>            win32k.sys BSOD Intermittent Problem</h2>
                    I have been having a problem for the last several months with my computer suddenly stopping and going to the BSOD. The problem seems to happen when doing something on the InterNet, such as; Starting IE8/Google Chrome, accessing a new tab, using link that
 starts new tab, changing pages, and even just starting Email (Outlook Express). My system, in its present form, has run faultlessly since 2009. The BS complaint is always the same: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA, then indicating a problem with win32k.sys . This
 issue IS NOT preceded by a power interruption. I have a genuine XP Install CD with SP2 (since upgraded to SP3).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have attempted to locate the fault by using MemTest 86 (Booting from the CD when running test) and testing my RAM memory. No faults found in 10 tests run.</div>
<div>Once I got an indication that there may be a fault in Drive Z: . &nbsp;Drive Z: is a physically separate, 20Gb HD that stores most of the stuff from the InterNet like cookies, graphics, etc., and all files downloaded from the InterNet are saved to this drive
 (to avoid contaminating my system drive). I ran CHECKDISK Tool with both Auto-Fix File System Errors and Scan For And Attempt Recovery of Bad Sectors options checked. Ran the CHKDSK from startup as instructed. No problems found.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also use CCleaner v4.09 to clean off most of the detritus left by the InterNet (mostly on Drive Z:), and also checking the Registry for issues.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also zipped four Minidump.DMP files (using 7-Zip [.7z file]), but don't have the facility on this page to send the arced files. I do have File Front, but not SkyNet or whatever the other File Sharing location mentioned elsewhere is.<br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From my experience, the issue may be related to specific Lync server settings, such as internal DNS record for Lync mobile service or internal network proxy settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you’re using pure Lync server service and here we mainly support Skype for Business Online service, I suggest you seek help from the

<h2>            Windows 10 File Structure&#47;Location</h2>
                    <p>I had a program update to a Corel product go badly. In the end, I was forced to uninstall the program from&nbsp;the system (using the usual Control Panel app) and attempt to reinstall the program. The problem I've encountered is the Corel&nbsp;"Install Wizard"&nbsp;is
 looking somewhere and concluding&nbsp;the program is still installed on&nbsp;the system, then aborts the install process. I've scoured the hard drive and removed every trace I can locate of the uninstalled program files. I've also thoroughly scrubbed (as far as I can
 determine)&nbsp;the registry to remove all references to the program. The installer continues to&nbsp;detect the program as already installed and then&nbsp;aborts the installation. My suspicion is there is a Windows system&nbsp;file or log (used by Control Panel/Features and
 Programs) that I haven't been successful in locating where program/app data (e.g., app names, app versions, app data,&nbsp;etc.)&nbsp;is written/recorded for installed programs. I need the log or file name and location for that file or log&nbsp;(if in fact it exists).</p>

<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade&nbsp;or a Repair Installation.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key. It has to be the same 32 or 64 BIT OEM version of Vista. Also the System<br />
maker will usually sell the disk cheap since you already own Windows. Be sure to do a<br />
good backup or 3 (safety in redundancy).</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you want to upgrade to Windows 10. We will assist you with it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you have an issue in upgrading to Windows 10. I suggest to download the ISO file and install Windows 10 on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Where can I download Windows 10?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 by going to the Windows 10 Software Download page to download the Media Creation Tool. The Media Creation
 Tool can be used to create a USB or DVD media to upgrade your current PC to Windows 10 or install Windows 10 on a different PC.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions on Windows 10 Software Download page:
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10</span></a><span>
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: When upgrading to Windows 10 from
 media, you must run setup.exe from within your Genuine and Qualified version of Windows 7 or Windows 8. If you want to perform a clean install, you must have upgraded to Windows 10 previously. Performing a clean install of Windows 10 with media without upgrading
 to Windows 10 is not supported and will have activation issues.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Do let us know if your issue is resolved. For any further information, feel free to contact us.</p>

            Hi,  Andrew_797 
<br />
<br />You should repair the Operating System completely, before you should backup your files, check this link.

<p>Repairing the operating system fixed that problem. However, I have a new problem now. I can't seem to overwrite the corrupted file with the good file because it is being used by another process? I have chosen yes and all as responses to overwriting. See
 reference below.</p>

<p>In command prompt, it said the working file was successfully copied over. However, when I check the file version and product version of the ntdll.ll file in the system32 folder. It remained unchanged and wasn't overwritten. Thus, I am still currently crashing
 in Monster Hunter World due to fault module ntdll.dll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the file using ntdll.dll and its explorer.exe. Deleting it in safemode caused my background to go black. I was still able to restart the computer from doing alt+control+delete. Nonetheless, I wasn't able to copy over the ntdll.dll file because of
 that. I guess I'll just have to look into the other solutions posted unless you have a way around this.&nbsp;</p>

<div>From the description of the query, it seems like you get an error code “<strong>0x80070002</strong>” when you try to install English language pack on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would like to gather some information on this issue to help you in&nbsp;a better way:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>How are you trying to install the language pack? Is it from Windows update or using the download pack downloaded from Microsoft download center?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to install language pack from the control panel and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can follow the methods:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Important Note:</strong> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>

<h2>            Screen duplication from 21&#58;9 to 16&#58;9 for streaming purposes</h2>
                    So I'm trying to duplicate my 3440 x 1440 21:9 monitor to my capture card that streams and records at 1920 x 1080 but every time I try it sets my ultrawide monitor to 1920 x 1080 as well. I want the display to be duplicated just in a lower (downscaled)
 resolution. &nbsp;how can I do this?

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To address your concern, it is not possible to have 2 different resolutions when in Duplicate or Clone mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We recommend that you try to use the scaling mode in the AMD Radeon Setting or in the NVIDIA control panel.
</p>

<p>I was not really sure about this, but I also tried booting the my device in clean boot and safe mode. Any hope to get the touchpad work again.&nbsp;Any highly qualified TECHNICIAN of Microsoft can help me!!!!!!</p>

            <p>Hello BetterToday,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Windows Live Mail forum. First of, we would like to appreciate you for using Outlook Express. Since you are now using Windows Live Mail, we understand that&nbsp;you want to manage or sort your&nbsp;newsgroups with the same sorting option like in Outlook
 Express. Let's see what we can do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can sort or manage your&nbsp;newsgroups by&nbsp;Priority, Attachment, To, Subject, Sent and Account under the Sort option in View tab. You can refer to the image below for understanding.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/231dd9f8-8813-42e6-a190-abba990265b8" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In addition, you can sort them by Ascending or Descending using the Sort order option. I've also provided an image below:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03f8aaf9-c965-4e21-8391-ccc87827c4c2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how things turn out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Helene C.</p>

            <p>I suppose that by <em>Tagged</em> you mean <em>Watched... </em>If not, please explain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a fundamental change in the way that Windows Live Mail threads messages with the introduction of Windows Live Mail 2011 in 2010. In earlier versions, threads were placed in the message list according to the date of the OP; this is also what happens
 in Outlook Express. Now, threads are sorted by the date of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
latest</span> message in the thread. The reason for this is quite beyond my comprehension, and it takes a lot of getting used to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another problem is that threading also depends on the <em>Subject:</em> line, while ISTR that OE only uses the
<em>In-Reply-To:</em> or <em>References:</em> headers to thread posts. So if a thread wanders OT and someone changes the subject, the strand with the new subject becomes a new thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AFAICR, OE put the newest posts at the bottom of the list, so that reading using the spacebar naturally moved from older to newer; your simulated screenshot is upside down in my view. And I don't remember having been able to sort threads by watched/unwatched.
 Perhaps you'd better explain what you need without reference to other programs.</p>

            <p>Nope... As you can see from the following series of screenshots, there is not a single feasible sorting option available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only sorting option that's supporting threading is "Sort by SentDate". But that sorting option is not putting watched threads above threads not being followed.</p>

                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somehow while watching a movie on my tv via the HDMI port, lost the notebook display. &nbsp;And cannot use my display no matter driver update or try the reboot on safe mode. &nbsp;it is always the same, 10 sec. of display with the loading circle then nothing at all.
 &nbsp;I have to wait for the tv screen to show up so I can enter my password. &nbsp;I went on the HP support site and as this HP notebook HDX16-1056CA was purchased before August 2013 I got sent here on Microsoft support site. &nbsp;The part I don't understand is that I
 had updated from window 8 to window 10 since it first came out few months ago and watched movies the same way ever since before and only 1 week ago this happen. &nbsp;I am typing this now with my head stretched out toward the TV... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to see if the screen was separate or duplicate mode and it always show screen 1/2 as duplicate mode when click on identifier. &nbsp;Yes I did tried to unplug the HDMI cable for a startup but still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else is working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I revert to window 8? &nbsp;Or what do I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind help.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Yan, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I realize that you are facing display issues on your PC. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Disconnect the TV from the computer and then update the display driver from Device Manager. Once this is done restart the computer and then connect the TV to the PC using the HDMI cable to check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to update the Display driver from the Device Manager:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Press (Windows key + X) and click on “Device Manager”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Expand “Display Adaptor”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Right click on the video driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists then you may uninstall the display driver and restart the computer so that the latest driver is automatically installed on the PC. From Device Manager follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on the driver and then select "Uninstall".</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<strong>Scan for Hardware changes”
</strong>option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></p>
<span>Thank you.</span>

            <p>hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure how I can do this with no screen at all. &nbsp;But I did give it a shot at uninstalling the driver. &nbsp;The tv went black. &nbsp;I was not able to do the scan for change in action as such. &nbsp;It took a few hard power off and restarts to see if it would work
 but no. &nbsp;So I reconnected the hdmi to the tv and retried all this again to get back exactly where I was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could somehow this be done with a live agent who does this remotely? &nbsp;(i am not that cpu savvy but I saw a video of someone doing it before) &nbsp;Or maybe trying to revert to window 8?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>

    <title>32gb copy max from PC to SD Card &#47; USB Port question - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wwsras  say:</h3>
<h2>            32gb copy max from PC to SD Card &#47; USB Port question</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying diligently to copy all my music files/folders (about 50gb) to an SD card to use on a Chromebook. I've tried with both a SanDisk Extreme Pro 128gb Micro XC1 card and a Verbatim 256gb Micro XC1 card. In both cases once I reach roughly 32gb
 and continue to copying files, files over 32gb at first show up but then disappear. CHKDSK uncovers errors and fixes them and the folders are empty. I thought it might be one SD card but not 2, because it's at a certain point newly copied files run into a
 problem on either card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is whether my PC, running W10 but roughly 9 years old with USB 2 poses a limit on the size of data I can copy to an SD card, or a type of SD card. I've tried several USB ports with the same result. I don't see options in BIOS which might change
 any sort of USB limitations. I've searched in several places for answers and I'm hoping this forum might provide an answer or point me to where I might find assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>
<p>Walt</p>

            Try using a command method way to copy.
<br />Go to search and type powershell and then right click and select run as administrator.
<br />
<br />If your folder is in say c:\users\music and you want to move everything to say f:\Music this would be the command you would run.
<br />
<br />Copy-Item -Path c:\users\music -Destination f:\Music -force

            Thank you for the suggestion but unfortunately it did not solve my issue. I watched all the music folders copy to the sd card but after the copy was complete, many folders were empty and the 128gb card held approximately 32gb. There has to be some sort
 of usb or buffer or copy limitation on my pc that limits copying more than 32gb to a larger sd card. I just can't figure out what the problem is. I will keep searching.

    <title>My Home Xbox Reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ov3r51z3dwalrus  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Home Xbox Reset</h2>
                    <p>so I reset the my home xbox on November 1St. I contacted xbox support and they said they can't reset it again until October 31St, 2018. The thing is though is that somebody got into&nbsp;my account and kept on making their xbpx the my home Xbox. I had to change my password 5-6 times since November 1St. They still kept on getting into my account. I changed my password one last time. I Contacted xbox support and they said they can't reset it until October 31st 2018. I'm trying to gameshare with a close friend. And now they will not reset it. Wouldn't it be nice if they gave 2-3 resets a year instead of just one? The woman on the phone for zbox live support said they used to have it at 3 times a year. She then explained that people wanted it changed for security purposes. I just really want xbox to make it 3 times a year again so I don't have to wait until October 31, 2018 to reset it.&nbsp;</p>

            If you have read this thread, you will know that home xbox has 5 changes per rolling 12 months. There are no resets, as it is by design to reset by date used.

<p>It keeps annoying me with exactly the same thing. KB3186568 update is stuck. And I have even downloaded it and installed it manually in order to try to stop Windows 10 from restarting my computer every bl00dy day or asking to schedule a restart. I've tried
 to clear the Windows Updates cache as well. Obviously that didn't work, as it tried to restart my computer today again and still shows the "Update" commands in the Shutdown buton's menu.</p>

            It appears to be the same problem, so why should I start a different thread. After the seventh time it went through trying to install, including manually, McAfee stopped working. Spent a morning with McAfee to get my Virus scanner working again. If this
 is a conflict between the two then it should be looked into at the Corporate level, not just passing it onto users to troubleshoot.

            You must get windows 10 drivers from Lexmark and if there are none available you will need to buy a new printer. Printers are cheap. Ink is expensive.

<p>Hey there PhobicSwine4. &nbsp;Here are the steps for recovering your Gamertag:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Xbox Guide button on your controller (large X button in the center of your controller).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Download Profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note Not seeing Download Profile? Press X to sign out of your profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Enter the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox Live gamertag. If you don’t know your Microsoft account or password, see Find your Microsoft account or password.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note “Microsoft account” is the new name for what used to be called “Windows Live ID.” It’s the email address and password you use to sign in to Microsoft services (including Xbox Live). Find out more.</p>
<p>Now, enter your Microsoft account password.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note If your account is an Xbox Live child account, the parent’s Microsoft account information is required to download the profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select the storage device for your profile (for example, Hard Drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Your profile will begin downloading. Once your profile is downloaded, you can choose whether or not you want to require your Microsoft account password to sign into your profile.</p>
<p>Hopefully this helps and here is a support link as well! &nbsp; Good Luck and Happy Gaming!!</p>

<p>sorry but i don't really understand the problem here.</p>
<p>you lost your gamertag while unstalling your profile.</p>
<p>but what do you want? your old gamertag back?</p>
<p>well if so i'm sorry but for that you gonna have to buy a gamertag change. here is how:</p>
<p>How to change your gamertag on the Xbox 360 console, you can easily change your Xbox Live gamertag. If your gamertag during your first log on to Xbox Live for you is made (in other words, if you haven't chosen your gamertag), you can change this gamertag
 once free. Additional changes of the Xbox Live gamertag cost extra. Your Xbox Live gamertag sign on your Xbox console with the Xbox Live gamertag that you want to change.</p>
<p>Go to Social, and then select your gamertag.</p>
<p>Select Change Gamertag.</p>
<p>Note the price of the change, and then do one of the following: Select Enter New Gamertag. If the gamertag entered is already in use, you will be prompted to try another gamertag.</p>
<p>Select Get Suggestions about possible gamertags.</p>
<p>After you have entered a new gamertag or chosen, select Yes, use this gamertag.</p>
<p>When you have your new gamertag confirms, the change is automatically anywhere on Xbox Live. You do not need to tell your friends that you have changed your gamertag: their friends lists are automatically updated.</p>
<p>Did you make a mistake when creating your gamertag?</p>
<p>If you make a mistake when creating your gamertag and you want to change it, then you need to buy a new gamertag. All purchases of gamertags must be performed using the dashboard and cost extra.</p>

Looking into your accounts, it appears these each have a unique email address associate with them.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Bass settings gone after latest Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> valeweber2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bass settings gone after latest Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Good evening,</p>
<p>As I was just forced to restart and update my Windows 10, I noticed, when I used the PC again, that my sound settings seem to have gone.</p>
<p>I used the "Bass Boost" Feature under Sounds&gt;Playback&gt;"Speakers"&gt;Properties&gt;Enhancements to make the sound better. For some Reason this PC didn't have the Equalizer feature, my old PC had. So I just used the "Bass Boost" Enhancement.</p>
<p>After the Update the Setting was reset and disappeared from the menu. I couldn't change It anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I installed the latest Realtek High Definition Audio Drivers for my Mainboard and couldn't change it as well.</p>
<p>How can I change my Bass Settings back to normal? Am I using the wrong driver? Is there a possibility to get the Equalizer I used on my old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.</p>

            Sorry, should have set you reach Device Manager by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />I gave you everything that can be done to try.   But it's still highly likely a bug in Version 1803 which is why I also suggested roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<p><span>I presume you require the drivers for Pinnacle Instant DVD Recorder, is that correct?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I have the exact same issue. I can download some apps from the Store. I am trying to download the YouTube TV app. I am signed in correctly. I even checked my account and it shows this computer I am on now. This is a new computer I just purchased a Lenovo
 Yoga 920 with all updates applied.</p>
