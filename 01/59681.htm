            <p>That's a Windows Live issue and you need to ask in the appropriate forum here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.windowslivehelp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.windowslivehelp.com</a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>But I think you can likely ignore it.&nbsp; Windows Live comes with lots of Live bugs.</p>

<p>That would void the warranty of the device, it's not designed to be disassembled.&nbsp; In short, it's pretty much at your own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest using a anti-static computer cleaning swabs and carefully cleaning it without disassembly.</p>

            Thanks for the answer. &nbsp; I replaced the battery and that seemed to slightly improve the responsiveness but not totally.&nbsp; I posted another question how to troubleshoot the 3600.&nbsp; There is a link for the same question regarding the 3500 but the link failed?<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The System Update Readiness Tool creates a log file that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. The log file is located at the following location:
<br />
•%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.log <br />
•%SYSTEMROOT%\Logs\CBS\CheckSUR.persist.log<br />

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The system root is normally C. If the files are not there, check C:\windows\ logs\CBS.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You may need to change your settings in Windows to be able to see the file. To show hidden files type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings
 and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files" is unchecked. You may need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known
 file types" is not checked.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do not use Search to find the files. Open Windows Explorer (keyboard shortcut Win+E), locate and expand the file path (item

<p>Miscoroft has the XNA program, where indie developers can publish their games</p>

<p>You could also publish the game on XBLA, but you need a publisher for this.</p>

<p>hello there</p>
<p>indie developers can put their game up and can publish their own game</p>
<p>XBLA requires that your game is good enough for publisher to sponsor you</p>

<h2>            What happend to my &#34;camera&#34; capability on my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a Dell XPS laptop from Microsoft at&nbsp; Mall of America in Bloomington, Mn., in 2009.&nbsp; I have been unable to use this camera capability for some time---I can't even remember how to access it and I see&nbsp; nothing about it in my Users Manual...Naturally,
 this laptop still has the "camera lens" but what happened to the functionality of it?&nbsp; Where did it go?&nbsp; I have moved to Iowa from Minnesota but in July 2015 I put the laptop in the Microsoft shop in Mall of America and they were to have fixed it&nbsp;along with
 other issues but the "camera situation" was&nbsp; never done....what do I need to know &amp; do?????????????????&nbsp; This&nbsp;is a great concern and I am contemplating buying Apple if I cannot get this reconciled.&nbsp; Thank you,</p>

<h3> pressy55  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 losing internet &#40;wired connection&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded to Windows 10 on my laptop and Desktop PC. There have been many of the same questions that I have looked through on this community. Most are for WiFi issues which I have sorted out my laptop. But I can not find a fix that works on my desktop
 PC that is wired to my router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried installing new driver, it updated and I thought all was fine. 60 minutes later no connection again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled device and tried reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone into the network adapter properties and disabled the "allow computer to turn off this device to save power" option which has helped on a fresh start up or when it comes out of sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Network Troubleshooter says all is okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have been able to do to get it to reconnect is type ipconfig /flushdns in the command prompt. This fixes the issues for an undetermined amount of time. I might get anywhere from 2 minutes to 60 minutes of internet before it disconnects.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using mcafee total protection and defender is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am ripping out what remains of my hair. Any help appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<div>
<p>I have Windows Vista, and under the turn off option, it said windows needed to update.<br />
<br />
So I clicked on the option to turn off, and it said<br />
<br />
"Do not un plug or turn your computer off,<br />
<br />
Installing updates 1 of 1 (..) (..)<br />
<br />
So I turned the computer back on after it turned off, and it did all the interface and things,<br />
<br />
then it said preparing your desktop, and my files</p>
<p><span>The update was for Silverlight..(Which I don't use)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>There is also another update that wants me to update when shutting down computer, but I'm scared it will delete my files...
 (it was a definitions update for Windows defender, which i've now disabled after getting 100% task manager&nbsp;continuously)</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for reading, and if you help me with my problem, thank you sir/madam.</span></p>

<p><span>Anyone know how to make font bigger? :|</span></p>

Try the following:</p>
<p>1. Download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp;<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</a></p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. Now run this McAfee three-step fix:&nbsp; <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507</a></p>
<p>NOTE: Step #2 of the McAfee fix is running the removal tool you've already downloaded in my Step #1 above.</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT!! =&gt; After reinstalling the McAfee application (Step #3 of the McAfee fix), manually &amp; repeatedly update the McAfee application until you get a "no more updates" prompt.</p>
<p>5. Open Internet Explorer (only) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</a> &amp; run the Fix It.</p>
<p>6. Now open Internet Explorer (only) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> &amp; run that Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes. [1]</p>
<p>7. Reboot one last time &amp; test.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of Installed Updates.</p>

                    <p>Windows 10 Task bar will not Auto Hide even when the&nbsp;option&nbsp;is checked in Properties. This makes using the operating system difficult to use as it hides options and data. This has apparently been a problem for some time, I don't understand why Microsoft

            It seems I found, at least for me, that along with checking the Auto Hide feature AND checking Lock Task Bar...WORKS.

            I had this exact problem and I had both Auto Hide and Lock Task bar checked. &nbsp;What I found was that one of the "hidden icons", found by clicking the small up arrow at the right on the task bar, was active (no feedback that it was active - I just clicked
 them all one by one). &nbsp;Once I had clicked on it, it deactivated and then the task bar operated normally.

<p>The workaround I mentioned works for me.</p>

            I read the listed suggestions. Windows 10 being new does have some things most users are not yet use to seeing. The problem lies in the Action Center. This is on the task bar on the far right. It has an icon that looks like a rectangular speech bubble
 with lines inside it. If you open it up, I am willing to bet it has a bunch of notifications for your attention. Simply clear these out, and then your task bar will work as normal again. You can also select the "All Settings" option in the Action Center, then
 select "Notifications and Actions" and change when a notification is listed or what you get for notifications so you do not have the problem reappear later. Hope this helps.<br />

            Hi <span>LadyLynnChaste,<br />
<br />
For us to clarify the issue, are you referring to sending instant messages through Windows Live Messenger, or sending email messages on Windows Live Mail/Windows Live Hotmail? Please provide us more information like&nbsp;to who are you sending the message and&nbsp;what
 is the error messages that you receive.<br />
<br />
Also, please take note that Live Messenger is the instant messaging/chat program, while Live Mail/Hotmail is used to send email messages.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks,

            It is live Mail through craigslist response system to ads that are posted there. I also have tried to respond to other offers and messages and they are all sitting in the task box as failed messages. I have not tried to use Live Messenger but didnt know
 they were different, can you help me move the failed messages and help me clear the avenue to be able to use the system, please? Thanks.

            Hi <span>LadyLynnChaste,</span><br />
<br />
There are possible reasons why you are receiving such error message:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>You are not connected to the Internet or a network, or your mail server is temporarily unavailable.
</li><li>Your account settings are incorrect. </li><li>Your user profile in&nbsp;WLM is damaged. </li><li>An e-mail item on your POP3 server is damaged. </li><li>The configuration of your AV software is incorrect. </li><li>WLM&nbsp;was removed from the computer or the installation is damaged. </li><li>The configuration of your personal firewall software is incorrect.</li></ul>
<p>As an initial trouble shooting step to isolate the issue, we need to know if this issue only happens when you send to Craiglist or&nbsp;if it also happens to other email addresses you send emails to. It is also advisable that you check you check yuo internet
 connection, or try sending the emails by turning off your firewall. Please inform us of the outcome of the test. We still have a lot of work to do to isolate this issue and keeping us posted will be helpful.<br />

<p>It's up to you of course, but I strongly recommend against installing McAfee software.&nbsp; As far as I'm concerned, it has an adverse effect on your computer's performance and can also cause other problems. Stay with Defender.</p>

                    Why doesnt microsoft get push to talk feature in game dvr app on windows 10. I mean, its so obvious any gamer would want that feature. Currently i am required to turn the mic on by default (the toggle in the dvr settings) and that records all the other
 non desired sounds and disturbances along with my voice. We want push to talk feature that would turn on the mic only when a specific key is pressed. Dont you guys agree?

<h2>            Screen Resolution Simulator</h2>
                    How can I test a desktop resolution that is larger than my current one with my applications? Thus far, I have found
<a href="http://www.gimespace.com/gms.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="GiMeSpace Desktop Extender">
GiMeSpace Desktop Extender</a>, but it looks like&nbsp;it has probably been 3 or 4 years since that&nbsp;application has been updated, so I don't know if it will work well with Windows 10. Also, I have a spanned resolution. That might cause issues. Perhaps my best bet
 (if someone is unable to come up with any other such applications) (as my searching on Google&nbsp;returned mostly things relating to testing websites at different resolutions, which is not what I want to do) is to disable the span and install GiMeSpace desktop
 extender. Although, I would prefer an application that is at least known to work properly with Windows 10. Upon installing GiMeSpace Desktop Extender, it seems to working properly. However, I am finding that Windows Explorer is becoming unresponsive when attempting
 to use the preview pane. I am unsure if installing GiMeSpace Desktop Extender has caused the problem. Has anyone noticed that behavior with Windows 10?

<p><span><span><br />
I appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the methods below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Clean Boot.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></em></strong></p>

 to windows 10)</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><span><strong>Note:</strong> Once </span></em><em><span>you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in
</span></em><strong><em><span>"How to reset the computer to </span></em></strong><em><span><strong>start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> "to reset computer as usual.
</span></em><strong><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></strong></span><strong><em><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 2: Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to download the Microsoft Safety Scanner from the following link and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-gb/default.aspx</span></span></a></span></p>

</p><p><strong><em><span><span>Note: The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If issue still persist then the program might not be designed for Windows 10 hence you might be facing this issue. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hence</span><span> I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer for the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would also suggest you to </span><span>use <strong>Task view </strong>

            <p>Upon uninstallation of GiMeSpace Desktop Extender, Windows Explorer behaved normally with the preview pane shown. However, upon reinstallation of it, Windows Explorer still behaved normally. Also, upon the first uninstallation of GiMeSpace Desktop Extender,
 it informed me that my computer needed to be restarted (and I was informed about a strange error (which I think Windows called a "serious error")&nbsp;related to the Start Menu and Cortana while attempting to restart the computer).&nbsp;Upon uninstalling it the second
 time, I was not prompted to restart my computer.</p>

<h2>            LOCKED - My 10 year old son banned for modding his avatar</h2>
                    
<p>My son got his XBox for his 10th birthday. He also got a prepaid 3 month Xbox live card. He filled in the info and agreed to the terms. But he is 10, he didn't read it...like most kids his age. He modded his avatar. Now, he is banned til 12/31/9999. I think
 he should be banned for a couple of months. But not for the rest of his life. You can't take something a 10 year old signs to court and it be upheld. Xbox should have like ipods, iphones or ipad has where you can't do anything til there is a valid credit card
 # on the account. That way, parents can read the terms before they start playing online. I don't understand how xbox can hold a 10 year old responsible for not reading their terms for xbox live, where they do nothing to actually the users age agreeing to it.
 His banned gamer tag is mort 2016.</p>

<p>I got banned for the same thing a few months back. I tried to get it my suspension down to something a little more reasonable but they didn't do anything and I'm sure the won't do anything for you either. But I agree, a lifetime ban for something as small
 and harmless as changing your avatar's skin color is outrageous...I had been a member for over 3 years and they give me a lifetime ban

<p>No disrespect intended but this is where you need to be told to "Parent up." &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was your responsibility to read and explain to him what was acceptable on this service and ensure that he followed said rules. &nbsp;Parents can still read the "terms" without the need for credit card info. &nbsp;Also, I find it rather mind boggling that you would
 attempt to pass the responsibility from yourself to your ten year old.</p>
<p>I weep for the future.</p>

 had a look at it, they could't do anything because we had the account. Maybe xbox needs to have a little better security. So thanks Mr. "KNOWITALL" for your input.</p>

<p>It's called principle people. If you let one person do something as trivial as modding an avatar you just can't be expected to get off light. There are several other people that have done this, so if they do it for one they have to do it for everyone....which
 would be unfair. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And also your son's account was not hacked. He was phished by giving away his info.</p>

<p>Funny you mention credit card info when the only part of the number displayed on eather the xbox or the billing.microsoft page is the last 4 numbers. Unlike what happened to Sony in the last few months, the only way someone could access your accout is by
 eather giving someone, ie. "Trusted Friend" your accout info or by not using a secure password and changing it on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As for &nbsp;your son modding his avatar, it is your responsibility for explaining things to him by takeing the time to read the terms and condition on anything your going to be paying for. After all your responsible for your sons actions.</p>

<p>Hahahahaha, Mr. Knowitall. &nbsp;Funny you should sink to name calling when your inability to police your own child is pointed out to you. &nbsp;I chose the Gamertag Knowitall to annoy those that call me a know it all when I point out their errors or ineptness, so
 you basically walked right into it and you're welcome.</p>
<p>As for your account being hacked, I don't believe it. &nbsp;1. &nbsp;You're first post mentioned that "Xbox should have like ipods, iphones or ipad has where you can't do anything til there is a valid credit card # on the account," &nbsp;meaning your &nbsp;credit card info
 wasn't on your XBox. &nbsp;2. &nbsp;If your card info was on your XBox, you cannot say "That way, parents can read the terms before they start playing online," &nbsp;without showing that you entered it and then still neglected to read the terms before they start playing
 online, as you yourself said you would. &nbsp;So which is it? &nbsp;As someone above pointed out to you, it was phished, again your fault for not monitoring your child after letting them loose on the internet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The internet/XBox console/Live is not a babysitter. &nbsp;If you cannot police your child's actions on the Live service, Live's XBLPET will do it for you with the rest of the XBox community and my help. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I pay good money to Microsoft in the form of yearly membership fees to keep children, children of children and adults that act like children away from me while I game. &nbsp;I am glad that his account was suspended and hope he doesn't get it back until both he
 and his parents understand what kind of behavior is acceptable on the Live service.

<p>[/quote]<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It's not their fault it's yours.&nbsp; Instead expecting better security on Xbox's side, maybe you should teach your child not to give his "friends" personal information such as the email address and password (which you, not
 him should have FULL control over).&nbsp; There was no "hacking", your son was simply too trusting.&nbsp; If you phoned Xbox support when this account breach occured, they could have investigated it, and prevented any further CC purchases.&nbsp;

<p>Hacking, cheating and modding is the biggest threat to online gaming as a whole. And ANYONE, regardless of age, who can and will mod their avatar, are giving a direct indication that they can, and most likely will, alter or attempt to alter the playing conditions
 of games. We see it all the time and it is RAMPANT on the PS3 network, which is free. We all PAY for XBL to have a gaming environment without these hackers, cheaters and modders; and while it is impossible to stop them all (and we do still see it on XBL as
 well), banning for life ANY person caught modding their system in ANY way is an absolute necessity.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You acknowledge that we offer “Family Settings” on the Service and the Xbox 360 console, and also offer “Parental Controls” for Windows Vista and Windows 7, that are intended to help you limit access to material that may be unsuitable for minors. &nbsp;By
 applying Family Settings to an associated account at sign-up, you may, among other things, help to prevent any user of an associated account from making additional purchases and from having access to voice and video chat, which is intended to diminish the
 ability of such user to communicate with other users. &nbsp;You may view or revise your Family Settings in the “My Xbox” area of your Xbox 360 console, or by logging into your account on www.xbox.com. &nbsp;Additional information about Family Settings is available at
 www.xbox.com; and</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;You are responsible for any material to which a user of your subscription either gains or is denied access (including as a result of your use or non-use of Family Settings or Parental Controls). &nbsp; You acknowledge that use of Family Settings, Parental
 Controls, or both, is not a substitute for your personal supervision of your minor children or minors for whom you are the legal guardian.</p>
<p>If you use an associated account, you acknowledge that the holder of the Service account has full control over your associated account. &nbsp;This control includes the right to end the Service, close or alter your associated account at any time, access and modify
 Family Settings for your associated account, and, in some cases, control purchasing options from your associated account and to request and receive device and Service usage information related to your associated account. &nbsp;As an associated account user, this
 contract applies to your use of the Service, except for the following Sections: 5 (excluding this paragraph); 6; and 17.5.</p>

<p><b><span>If YOU had read the XBL Terms of Service you would have seen the above. As a parent you are responsible for your childs actions up until he is the age of 18 in most states in the United States and some
 countries. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>You didn't think it odd that your child was moving his profile from the console to the pc and back again? ALL children under the age of 13 years should be monitored when they are using this or any online
 service. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Either way, the contract outlined above keeps MS from accepting any and all responsibility for your sons actions.
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>You should take a few moments to explain to him that what he did was not acceptable and that he will have to start all over again (should you choose to buy him more Live time to create another account)
 with everything since a permanent account suspension means he looses everything associated with that account including; Live time, ms points, gamer score, download content, and game saves. I hope it was worth it. Most people have alot of money invested in
 an account. What a shame. </span></b></p>
<p><b><span>It is nice to see MS uphold their contract regardless of the offenders age, race, religion, etc...not many companies do that these days.

<h3> arau8  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 does not wake from sleep&#47;power safe mode</h2>
                    Having updated from a perfectly fine working Windows 8 version to 8.1 yesterday, on a 3 week old Sony SVP133A1CM,
<div>the computer does not wake again after entering sleep / power saving mode.</div>
<div>Mouse movement, keys, power button, all has no effect.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Only pressing the power button for longer time and restart from scratch brings a reaction. Of course, all open files and not safed data is gone then.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Re-install windows 8, then 8.1, all drivers uptodate, BIOS uptodate, does not help.</div>
<div>Adjusting the power settings does not help either. Even setting to "never sleep" has no effect. Computer goes into sleep and does not wake again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I browsed help-sites but could not find any solution to this. All help is appreciated.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron Laptop which had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It failed to wake up from sleep for about 4-5 mins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabed Intel Rapid Start Technology from the BIOS menu during start-up and that worked like a charm for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck!&nbsp;</p>

<h3> gabe219  say:</h3>
<h2>            My bitlocker recovery key is not backing up to my Microsoft Online account</h2>
                    <p>I need to clarify that I am not having issues with the BitLocker encryption. My matter deals solely with the online backup of my recovery key. I am able to access my computer's hard drive with the BitLocker pin just fine, and I am able to then log into my
 user profile on my computer. I am able to see my BitLocker recovery key on my computer as well, so I have zero problems with BitLocker encryption. I have attempted to backup my recovery key online multiple times. It looks like it is going through the process,
 as there are no errors reported. However, I do not see my recovery key has updated when I log into my Microsoft online account. I need to know where my key is being saved online, and I need to find out how I can change that location if it is being uploaded
 to an account that I would prefer it not to be uploaded to.</p>

            I haven't done too much with xbox clubs but from what I have looked up it sounds like you only have the option to create a private club when it gives you the options when first creating the club. I did some looking myself and both times I created a club,
 whether it started out as private or public, there was no way to change the club type when managing the club.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Cyber,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. We understand you are trying to change the privacy of the club. Unfortunately, at this time there is not a feature to change this setting. You would need to re-create the club as a private one.</p>

<h2>            Controller for CoD Boyfriend</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to get a fancy sensitive controller for my boyfriend, the best Call of Duty player in the world.</p>
<p>It's pretty much all he plays but he's tentative about buying a fancy controller himself. I found the Evil Controllers website ("the world's fastest buttons and triggers?") but would prefer the expert opinion of you of this forum.</p>
<p>I'm willing to spend a bit of money because he got me the new iPad. But not that much money.</p>
<p>THANKS SO MUCH!!!</p>
<p>P.S. While I'm here, what's the best headset? He has a SteelSeries Spectrum 5xb but it bu<span>z<span>zes a lot unless he turns the volume up so loud that he might as well not be using a headset.</span></span></p>

<p>this threads obviously dead... and old.. but anyone reffering to it.. evil controollers.. like someone said.. specializes in "modded" controllers.. giving you an edge of most peple in COD (even tho alot of kids use them nowadays) makes you shoot faster..
 reload faster.. etc. that type of thing... usually runs you about $125-$150 with the mods.. but one good thing about them.. is they now have Pro Features.. which are NOT mods.. almost like scuf.. itll run you about the same as a scuf... like $100-$120... but
 you can completely customize everything from the color of the buttons.. what kind of analog sticks.../color.. controller coller (regualr colors like blue/red/green/chrome/etc.. and also designed color.. like black with white sculls etc.." as far a customization
 goes.. evil controllers is the best in my opinion.. you can make it "YOUR" controller.. and also.. with an addition of $29.99 i believe.. you can have your name or gamertag engraved into it with w.e. color you want. which is cool... unless you ever plan on
 selling it.. ok.. enough rambling on.. just ordered mine.. should arive in a couple weeks</p>

    <title>Why did my computer reset and why do half of my apps not work&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aliciawolaver  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why did my computer reset and why do half of my apps not work&#63;</h2>
                    Okay here's what happened, in order.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows updated on May 23. Once that happened my searching and indexing wouldn't work, my xbox music app uninstalled itself and wouldn't load my music up again. I attempted a system restore, which never worked or went past the "initializing stage" I actually
 had to hard reset (which I HATE doing) just to use my computer. Two days ago, the 28th, I went to turn my computer on after a proper shut down about an hour and a half before and the computer acted as if it was just starting up for the first time. Window's
 was preparing to launch and all that jazz. After my computer finished doing that and opened up, my windows app screen had barely anything on it, I had to search through my computer and manage my folders just to recover my music, movies, downloads, school information...EVERYTHING.
 I can't open the windows store, I can't find half of my apps, I cannot do a system restore, all of my restore points are gone, windows searching and indexing still won't turn on, File folders remain unresponsive in the "manage" function but I can now at least
 find my stuff. What the heck happened, and how the heck do I fix this!?!?! If it helps I have an HP laptop and I bought it in March of this year. If anyone has any ideas on what I need to do to fix this I would appreciate it. I'm hoping that I don't have to
 erase everything and reinstall windows completely to fix this problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>

</div>
<div>Thank You</div>

    <title>Readyboost option missing from new Windows 10 computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yorkshirepud82  say:</h3>
<h2>            Readyboost option missing from new Windows 10 computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello there i recently got a HP&nbsp; X2 210 tablet/convertible machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it runs windows 10 x64 and has a built in 2GB of ram, it also has a 64gb eMMC type hard drive. the perfromance from it is quite fine for what i use it for, however i decided of course it would be a good idea to make use of the memory card slot and have purchased
 a suitable memory card to expand the secondary storage. I also decided that i could make use of the readyboost function should this become neccesary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>however it would appear that the readyboost option is completely missing from this computer as it came from the box! I have investigated as throughly as i can, the card being used IS readyboost compatible, i have confirmed this on another computer. I have
 tried many other readyboost compatible sticks and cards that i have and in each case i cannot use them. Under drive properties the "Readyboost" tab is just not present therefore i cannot enable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked under the services and there is no readyboost service present, however the "superfetch" service is present and running (i am led to believe from my investigating that this is a requirement). And to the best of my knowledge i cannot locate
 a registry entry for readyboost on the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spoken with HP and had remote assistance from them, they have failed to resolve the problem and washed their hands of it basically saying the eMMC drive removes the need for the readyboost function. i strongly disagree with this, regardless of whether
 it removes the need for it, this feature should be available for me to use as i see fit. The other computer i have tested the memory cards on for readyboost compatability has a SSD drive and although readyboost is disabled on this computer the tab for readyboost
 IS present. so why is it missing on my Windows 10 machine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help with this matter would be appreciated, while i have had no performance issues with this device i would like it to have the functions that by default should be present.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with the required information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have already tried all the troubleshooting steps and still the issue persists, the issue might be with the 64gb eMMC type hard drive itself. We suggest you to contact the manufacturer of the hardware and check if it supports Readyboost.

 is similar. and the readyboost option is available here.</p>

            <p>this does not help unfortunately. Again i will restate what i have said before:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The readyboost function is missing from my windows 10 computer, yes this device does have an eMMC hard drive installed but this should not matter, the service should still be present and it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have a windows 7 dekstop computer using a SSD hard drive. the readyboost function is present on this computer and has been disabled. so why should it be present on one windows machine and not on another?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29876.how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows-10.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/29876.how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows-10.aspx</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>

<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>

            Not all hardware is ReadyBoost compliant or setup to support it. Some devices do and some don't. In all likelihood the one you are trying to use it on doesn't.
