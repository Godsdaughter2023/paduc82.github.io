            Hi MP.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You must be talking about the DVD player!  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/how-to-play-dvds-in-windows-10-for-free.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2953724/windows/...</a>  We've been advising VLC here for years.
<br />
<br />Good luck on getting a refund.  Try here first:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/28808/microsoft-store-contact-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/28808/...</a>.  Tell them it doesn't work, which is reported by many.

<h2>            Download Folder Points to System32 path instead of SysWOW64 path</h2>
                    <p>This is a long standing problem that I have ignored and worked around for years. But now I am considering an upgrade to Windows 10 and think I would be asking for trouble if I don't fix it first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that my Downloads folder points to&nbsp;C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\Downloads instead of&nbsp;C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\Downloads. When I actually download something it goes to the SysWoW64 location. I have a link to it on
 the desktop and such as workarounds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>I am baffled by your current settings.&nbsp; I cannot imagine how it all went so drastically wrong for you.&nbsp; You are not using the Built-In Admin account are you?&nbsp; You'd have to stop that before upgrading to Windows 10 or you would be likely to lose all your
 user files permanently as this account is completely deleted then recreated by Windows 10 [there were some user reports of this last year].</em></p>

<p>I am using Windows 7, Internet Explorer 9, and Office 2010 professional version. The Franklin County Recorder saves all multi-page deeds as .tif files and I am unable to read them, save them, or print them. The Recorder recomments a third party tif viewer

<h2>            Microphone Level Keeps Resetting to 0</h2>
                    Hello, since the latest Microsoft OS update, I've been experiencing an annoying bug/problem with my microphone level. Since the update, I've noticed that it keeps resetting to zero, and despite putting it back where it was, it will go back to zero again.
 I've tried changing to a different port with the same issue. My microphone does not use any drivers and the mic I'm using is a Blue Yeti Blackout Edition. Any idea why this is happening? Any advice/help on this would be appreciated.

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.

<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hey King_DavidNY,
<br />
<br />Hopefully I can help here. I sort of had the same issue with my Audio Technica ATR-2100, a simple removal of my driver made quick work of that. I honestly don't know what is causing it, but I'd like for you to try this and tell me how it goes:
<br />
<br />Since your microphone is USB, I would think it has its own driver. When you go to the Recording tab in Sound (Control Panel item), double-clicking it, then going into Properties under Controller Information, clicking Change settings on the bottom left, then going into the Driver tab, do you at least get any options to uninstall it? Does the name of the driver match your microphone or is it a generic driver?
<br />
<br />Go ahead and uninstall it. Go to Device Manager (Windows key + X &gt; Device Manager) and go to Action (top menu item) &gt; Scan for hardware changes, and let it detect the driver.
<br />
<br />I'm going to keep tabs on this and hopefully I can solve your issue. Good luck.       
        </p>

                    <p>I recently changed the hard drive on my Toshiba SatelliteC655 laptop. Since completing the system restore, Window update and the troubleshooter will not work. I tried completing a clean reboot, but that did not fix the problem. Any suggestions? My OS is

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Maybe this can Help.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wire card entry.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a><br />
<br />
If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wire card's Drivers.</p>
<p>----------------------------------</p>
<p>Try to install the latest drivers of the card from the support page of the&nbsp; manufacturer.<br />
<br />
Download the drivers and unpack them to a folder of your choice.<br />
<br />
In the Device manger, right click on the adapter.<br />
<br />
Click on Update Drivers, and choose the Browse my computer for drivers, <br />
<br />
Choose let me pick from a list, Click on&nbsp; Have a Disk and point to the folder with the Drivers.<br />
-------------------------------------</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Local Area Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
Log to the Router's menu from a working computer and make sure that the DHCP is On and it is configured to assign IPs that can cover the number of computer that are connected (few more will be even better).<br />
<br />
Switch Off the computer and the Router, Reboot the Router, and the computer.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.</p>
<p><strong>On IP status.</strong> <br />
<br />
TCP/IP and its variables typically look like this.<br />
<br />
Right click on the Wire card Network Connection, choose Status, Details, and see if it got an IP and the rest of the settings.<br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>Description</strong> is the card manufacturing data.<br />
<strong><br />
Physical address</strong> is the card's MAC number.<br />
<br />
The xx should be a number from 0 to 255 (all xx same number).<br />
<br />
yy should be from 0 to 255<br />
<br />
zz should be from 0 to 255 (all zz the same number.<br />
<br />
<strong>The lease date</strong> should be valid to the current time.<br />
<strong><strong><br />
*Note 1.</strong> IP that starts with 169.xxx.xxx.xxx is not valid functional IP.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>*Note 2.</strong> There might be an IPv6 entries too. However, they are not functional for Internet traffic or LAN. They are needed for Win 7 special HomeGroup configuration.</p>
<p>------------------------</p>
<p>Also Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called
 the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled)</strong> . If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.
 If the 3rd party software is uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>

    <title>Xbox wont eject disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aleph797  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox wont eject disc</h2>
                    I have an xb1x that "had" a game disc in it. When I went to eject the disc, it makes the "no disc" beep noise. I can't find the disc anywhere I put it, and I know I didn't eject it from the console. I have rebooted the console since this first started
 happening and it still claims that there is no disc in there. Also, it has been treating the game as if it was a digital download, not a disc install. I can start and play the game fine, but it still says there is no disc in the disc drive. Thanks in advance.

<p>Hi Aleph,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I would like to clarify one thing here, do you get an error message or error code? Also, if there were to be a disc stuck inside the console the console wouldn't be able to accept any other disc to be inserted as the disc would be blocking
 the entrance. Have you double checked to see if the disc was misplaced in a different disc box by any chance? Or maybe you own the game digitally on a different account that could of been set up as the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
'Home Xbox'</a> feature on your console. The Home Xbox feature allows you to<span> share purchased games and Gold with others only on your home Xbox.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and double check this information, and let us know how it goes.</p>

    <title>PC is not detecting headphones, puts out sound through HDMI - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riffee  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC is not detecting headphones, puts out sound through HDMI</h2>
                    <p>I recently built this computer and after installing windows and all my relevant drivers, my PC is not putting out sound to my headphones or even detecting them. I have Realtek HD audio, and when i plug in my headphones the Realtek device manager supposedly
 picks this up and opens the audio manager. The diagram of various audio jacks on the right side of the manager window indicates something has been plugged in by filling in the color on the appropriate image, while also showing in the bottom right of the screen
 "You just plugged a device into the audio jack." However, when the Realtek HD Audio window asks me "Which device did you plug in?" and I select headphones, the middle of the window states "You are seeing a blank page because there is no audio devices plugged
 in the system. To activate GUI, please plug an audio device in the system." Additionally, my playback devices menu displays no audio devices plugged in, even when I enable the "Show disabled devices" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer does, however, output sound to a TV I have plugged into the HDMI plug-in on my video card. I have apparently downloaded the latest drivers, I tried disabling/enabling AMD High Definition Audio Device in my device manager, and I still get no sound
 to my headphones. The headphones themselves work on my phone, and I have used other headphones on the computer and no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that Realtek tells me it's detected me plugging headphones in with the notification in the bottom right, indicates I've plugged something into the jack with the diagram, asks me what kind of device I've plugged in (defaulting to headphones), yet
 tells me that I've plugged nothing in, while my computer detects nothing at all, is highly confusing and after much searching I have found no answers. As far as I can tell, I have plugged everything in properly to the motherboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me.</p>

    <title>Buzz during audio playback caused by svchost.exe &#40;swprv&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wesstevens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buzz during audio playback caused by svchost.exe &#40;swprv&#41;</h2>
                    During audio playback of any kind, whether streaming, playing a CD, listening to iTunes, using any media player, etc., I get an occasional buzz that lasts only a second or so, but is very annoying during playback of symphonies, etc.&nbsp; After trying different
 device drivers, moving wires, and all sorts of other fixes, I finally monitored what processes were underway on the CPU during playback and have discovered that each time the buzz occurs the program "svchost.exe (swprv)" suddenly comes out of nowhere, pops
 up to the top of the list of processes running, and then disappears or drops down the list as soon as the buzz disappears.&nbsp; This occurs no matter what playback device-- speakers or headphones-- or form of audio playback I am using.&nbsp; The problem is clearly
 caused only by this svchost process.&nbsp; It also is not using a large amount of CPU when it happens.<br />
<br />
The process is an essential Microsoft copy program and cannot be removed from the system.&nbsp; How do I make this stop?<br />

            <p>Hi WesStevens,</p>
<p>I had the very same problem as you and was driving me crazy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd tried&nbsp;everything from&nbsp;virus scans with malwarebytes,&nbsp;Microsoft security essentals and spyware&nbsp;hunter all&nbsp;to no avail.&nbsp; Installed the most recent important and recommended windows updates
 still the annoying random&nbsp;buzzing.&nbsp; Did disc clean up and deleted all the recommendations. The only thing that fixed it and am now buzz free was doing a defrag of my c drive!&nbsp;&nbsp;My machine was only 1% fragmented but now I can happily listen to any audio via
 media player, youtube etc without any&nbsp;buzzing. </p>
<p>Hope this simple solution of a defrag works for you too.</p>

    <title>Browser home page default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> baron_968  say:</h3>
<h2>            Browser home page default</h2>
                    I am trying to set Google Chrome as my default browser. In control panel, the option to set the current page is greyed out and can't be changed. Every time I turn my gateway on it defaults to MSN home page. I do not want this. I want my home page to be
 Google Chrome. When I try to set it as my home page, using the "set home page" in win 10 "choose default settings" the action is not completed and remains greyed out with a + sign. If I set it to Microsoft Edge, it works. Bit I do not want to have that setting.
 Does MS10 not allow users to set up their OS as they wish or are we being dictated to?

            Yes, thanks for the reply. I tried all that, but the function "set dafault browser" remains greyed out and will only change if I select the "reccomended for windows 10" app, Microsoft Edge, which I do not want. When I open my browser, it now starts up
 in Google Chrome but asks me to set as the default browser. I select this function and am directed to the Windows 10 folder to do the change first mentioned above. This is just a merry go round and I get nowhere. Also in the internet options window, the "use
 current page" function for setting default browser remains greyed out and can't be used. Thios function in previous versions of windows would work perfectly. I get an uncomfortable feeling when an OS providor forces mw to do things I don't want to do, particularly
 whilst online. Want do you think?

            <p>I find this very interesting. Maybe try reinstalling Chrome? Or even reinstalling Windows itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently running Chrome as my default browser, on Windows 10. Which is a small hint that a simple re-installation of the operating system make resolve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, please keep in mind that even though you may like chrome, Edge is recommended for Windows 10.</p>

<p>@ Grey1wa, hey buddy, completely delete the game [folder] if you have download the add-on pack move it too your Cloud Storage... clear cache / turn off your 360 / re-boot console / consider using a wired connection to your 360 if not [or can't] make sure
 no other devices are using your BB / install game / let it update [depending on your speed abt 10 mins on average] total file size is around 6GB.</p>
<p>Good Luck ;]</p>

<p>I have also had this issue. 1.98 GB in progress (this may take a while)</p>
<p>Is has been taking three days. Each day it has lasted over 4 hours till I get tired of nothing happening and I stop it. I went to look through some of the system, storage, harddrive,games and apps, Destiny files, and it says ( Destiny Compatibility pack
 07 corrupt and yellow). Do you all have this also?</p>
<p>And....</p>
<p>For some reason it will not download or install, (DESTINY EXPANSION 1) under downloaded Items.</p>
<p>It doesn't give any errors just says unable to install an skips over it.</p>

<p>I have also done all the required actions requested above. But come on now, I have never had any issues or special actions to do with any other game or app before. I am starting to look for refund information so I can just download the other version instead
 of the collectors edition. I just really like this game and the extras it came with. Then only ten dollars more for this addition, it was a no brainer...but if they can't fix this issue soon. I am asking for a refund.</p>

<h2>            Unknown USB Device &#40;Port Reset Failed&#41; - Error 43 Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying and trying to fix this issue. Even Microsoft Support has been unable to help, and in fact, the problem has gotten worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Brother printer decided to suddenly stop working one day, and I was told to uninstall my USB devices from the devices manager list and restart. I did this, and now none of my devices work at all, including my Type Cover. My Device Manager now contains
 three "Unknown USB Device (Port Reset Failed)" entries, and I can do nothing about it. I have tried a system restore, I have tried uninstalling again, I have tried installing new firmware, I tried changing USB settings in the BIOS, I tried windows update,
 I tried everything. Support eventually hung up on me and closed for the day, leaving me out to dry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please please please someone help me, my Surface Pro 3 is less than a month old and is now effectively useless. This is EXTREMELY URGENT!!!!!</p>

            <p>Okay I've got a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, Microsoft is not interested in helping with this problem, as I contacted them again and they told me to ask for a return, which I do not qualify for. After following the same steps over and over, I finally gave up and decided to try something
 else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the drivers can't be reinstalled manually, I did a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
System Refresh</span>, something I was not familiar with (I'm used to Windows 7). To do this, simply do the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Swipe in from the right and tap settings.</p>
<p>2. In the bottom right corner, tap "<strong>Change PC Settings</strong>".</p>
<p>3. Go to the menu option "<strong>Update and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Recovery</strong>" on the left. Select&nbsp;"<strong>Recovery</strong>".</p>
<p>4. One of the options in the main window is "<em>Refresh everything without affecting your files</em>".</p>
<p>5. Tap "<strong>Get Started</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give the computer some time to do this, and it will re-install all the factory default files, including drivers and registry entries. All USB devices now work just fine, including the printer that caused the whole problem. All my files are still intact,
 and it only took about 15-20 minutes to reinstall all my programs and preferences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough, several hours of Google searching and calling tech support did not even come close to providing this solution. Hopefully if anyone has this problem in the future they can solve it using this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you guys for your help. I wouldn't have thought of this option without Rick's suggestion, so thanks for that! :)</p>

<div>First, do you have a case number?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Second, if the USB ports don't work, you won't be able to reimage the SP3. Call</div>
<div>support and see if they will arrange an exchange, ask for an advanced exchange -</div>
<div>you may qualify for that. They'll take a credit card number but won't charge you</div>
<div>unless you fail to return the broken SP3 within two weeks or so. </div>

<p><span>Hi James Tam,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community Forums!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:-</strong></span></p>
<p><span>You might be able to complete the rip by turning on error correction.</span></p>
<p><span>&gt; In Windows Media Player -&gt;Click on Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Devices, click the CD burner, choose&gt; Advanced, and set the error correction
 to On.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:-</strong></span></p>
<p><span>There are two ways to change rip settings while in the Player Library. You can insert a CD into your CD drive and click
<span><strong>Rip settings</strong></span>, or you can click the
<span><strong>Rip Music</strong></span> tab in the <span>
<strong>Options</strong></span> dialog box. The Rip Music tab in the Options dialog box offers additional options that aren't available on the Rip settings menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To rip music from a CD, do the following:<br />
<br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>For best results, make sure that you are connected to the Internet before you begin.</span></p>
<p>
<span>When your computer is connected to the Internet, the Player attempts to retrieve media information about the tracks being ripped from an online database. The Player then adds the information to the files during ripping.</span></p>
<p>
<span>Note that you can rip a CD when your computer isn't connected to the Internet. However, the Player won't be able to identify the name of the CD, the artist who created it, or the names of the songs until you go online.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Insert an audio CD into the CD drive.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>(Optional) If you want to select a different format (for example, MP3 instead of WMA) or bit rate (for example, 192 Kbps instead of 128 Kbps) for the files created during ripping, in the Player
 Library, click the <span><strong>Rip settings</strong></span> menu, and then click
<span><strong>Format</strong></span> or <span><strong>Audio Quality</strong></span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>(Optional) If you don't want to rip every song, in the Player Library, clear the check boxes next to the songs you don't want to rip.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the <span>
<strong>Rip CD</strong></span> button in Now Playing mode or <span><strong>Rip CD</strong></span> in the Player Library to begin ripping.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>Use a search engine in an attempt to find discussions that deal with this subject.</li><li>Take a copy of the SAM, then create a hint. Now take another copy and compare the two versions, using fc.exe /b.</li></ul>

<h2>            Slow downloading</h2>
                    <p>Since yesterday and today I have been having issues with apps and games downloading extremely slow. I’ve ran tests to see what the download speed is and it is showing extremely slow. But when I pull my laptop or phone out to test the speed it shows to be where it’s supposed to be but for some reason my xbox isn’t getting those speeds. I’ve tried hard resets and resetting the intrnet router and modem but nothing is helping? Is there anything else I can do or are there issues with content usage at the moment? Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>An added bit here. Detailed network statistics show my download speed to be .07 mbps whereas when I run a speed test on my laptop hardwired it shows it to be in the mid teens of mbps. Upload speeds show to be the same on both platforms.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>You could try extracting the file from your W7 DVD ( If you have one ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Extract the version from your DVD to a new folder, then rename the old XPSprint.dll to say XPSprint.old and then copy in the new extracted version.

<p>
</p><p>Then see if that helps. <em>You may need to run an update check afterwards in case that DLL has been fixed by a previous patch.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe XPSprint.dll is located in C:\windows\system32. The version on my Netbook ( W7 starter ) is 6.2.9200.16492 from its properties details tab. I don't use IE much and I'm still on IE10, so
<em>IF</em> this is an IE related file and you have IE11 it may be different I guess?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant see it having a major adverse impact on the PC, but you could backup your system first, just in case.<br />

            <p>Thanks George222(2)</p>
<p>I followed your instructions and I believe I have extracted the original XPSprint.dll from my installation disk.</p>
<p>However it is dated 2009 and only half the size of the corrupt version can I just copy it in? Will it upgrade itself to the current version?</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help so far.</p>

            <p>That's probably too old. Trouble is, I'm not sure when the file was updated, if it was with say SP1 or with a specific update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any backups from your PC from a time when it was working OK? If so can you extract it from there?</p>
<p>If not, if you right-click and properties your XPSPrint.dll file, and look in [previous versions] tab, are any listed there?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> <em>(This is not really scientific, but)</em></p>
<p>Later, what I did find, is that in the "C:\Windows\winsxs\" folder, I appear to have copies of XPSPrint.dll.</p>
<p>Now, is your system 32 bit or 64 bit? If its 32bit then your system will only have one version ( the system32 one ).</p>
<p>This system I'm on is 64 bit and so has a XPSPrint.dll in C:\windows\system32 and C:\windows\syswow64. On this system both are version 6.2.9200.16492, and both dated 13/03/2013, but the one in system32 is 1.6MB and the one in syswow64 is 1.1MB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the C:\windows\winsxs folder I have various copies of XPSPrint.dll with different dates, and two copies dated the same 13/03/2013 as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>C:\Windows\winsxs\x86_microsoft-windows-printing-xpsprint_31bf3856ad364e35_7.1.7601.16492_none_9ec29e48fab6a73c</em> = 1.1MB version</p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>
<p><em>C:\Windows\winsxs\amd64_microsoft-windows-printing-xpsprint_31bf3856ad364e35_7.1.7601.16492_none_fae139ccb3141872</em> - 1.6MB version</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you may be able to look on your system for something similar to possibly copy the file from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also for my system the following was installed on that date 13/03/2013, so I guess the XPSPrint.dll file I have came with one of these:
</p>
<p>IE10 for W7 64bit</p>
<p>KB2807986</p>
<p>KB2791765</p>
<p>KB2809289</p>
<p>KB2814124</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if all else fails, it may be worth looking those updates up and trying to see what is in them, or just remove and re-install the version of IE you are using (assuming it comes with IE ).</p>

<h2>            BSOD at about every two days on Windows 10 Fall Creators Uodate</h2>
                    <p>I receive constant BSOD's about every two days as "reliability history" shows. Today's one:</p>
<p>
The computer has rebooted from a bugcheck.&nbsp; The bugcheck was: 0x0000007e (0xffffffffc0000005, 0xfffff801e62c9eb0, 0xffffbc8a49d09a78, 0xffffbc8a49d092c0). A dump was saved in: C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP. Report Id: 7bb943c3-b3ac-402b-8952-7bb7b9668f95.<br />
</p><p>
</p><p>I upload the minidump if can help, maybe is a driver but I can't identify it. The Windows is a clean install not much 3rd party software on it, worth to mention "VMware 12" and "PGP Disk".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The minidump is here:&nbsp;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNg2_FjIozYUqZVOtweXhGbjsN9P0YDv/view?usp=sharing</p>

<p>Hello Busteo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A stop error (also called a "blue screen" error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly. These errors can be caused by both hardware and software issues. The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check has a value of
 0x0000007E. This bug check indicates that a system thread generated an exception that the error handler did not catch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you with your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Confirm which build is currently installed on your device. To check, follow the steps below:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows key + R</strong></em>, then type in <strong><em>winver</em></strong>.</li><li>Click <strong><em>OK</em></strong>.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>What is the make and model of your device?</li><li>Verify if you've tried overclocking your computer.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest performing the steps in this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article
</a></strong>to troubleshoot blue screen errors on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>

<p>Busteo, I feel for you, because I am going through similar problems. Creators spring was fine, fall has been giving me multiple BSODs. I did have a Microsoft tech on here help me out and he suggested trying driver verifier, but in the end he gave up and
 suggested a clean install. I’ve read elsewhere that that’s unlikely to help. But maybe the driver verifier itself could give you some clues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/t/576333/driver-verifier-bsod-related-windows-10-81-8-7-vista/</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to BSODs, here’s mine (this is pretty typical from December 11 onwards). No BSODs today but then it’s Sunday and I’ve not been at my computer.</p>

            Thank you for your kind reply. I will try again with Driver Verifier with the steps in your link, I tried before but selected all drivers (Microsoft ones too) and that made my Windows unable to boot.

            Hi Busteo, for me the unbootable Windows was part of the process. I didn’t select the Microsoft drivers, rebooted, Windows BSODed twice during the next phase, then it went into recovery mode. It then did a system restore. The minidump that results is the
 one the specialists want to see.<br />
<br />
I’m not an expert either—just a regular guy going through similar stuff—but it seems some of the experts are failing us … though the Bleeping Computer folks seem to be more persistent than the Microsoft ones in helping us track down the problem.<br />
<br />
One thing: make sure you create a restore point before embarking on this—even multiple restore points. I really don’t believe Windows selects the last restore point, based on my experience over the last month.
<br />
<br />
There was an admission by one of the techs here that some of us who are “early adopters” of this latest update could get problems. It seems they know they have released another lemon.

<p>I'd suggest to consider following the basic troubleshooting techniques below:</p>
<p>

<h2>            What Are Radeon Settings And Why Are 6 Opening Every Time I Start My Computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What are Radeon Settings, and why do 6 open every time I start my computer?&nbsp; I never chose to install it, so I am assuming it was part of the last update I got, because they appeared right after that update.&nbsp; They show up in my hidden icon tray, and there
 are 6 of them.&nbsp; If I try to open them they do not open so I can't close them.&nbsp; They are also slowing down my computer a lot with most things I am trying to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They also seem to be blocking other programs from opening.&nbsp; As an example, if I do not open Steam as soon as my desktop loads it generally does not open.&nbsp; I never had this problem before these Radeon Settings appeared.&nbsp; I end up having to restart my computer,
 and opening Steam as soon as my desktop loads just to be able to open it.</p>

            Hi Allyka.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's driver bloatware that you can uninstall or at least turn off at Startup since nothing needs to start with Windows except Windows itself and maybe a sync or scanner on standby.  All others are freeloaders that can cause issues and use resources affecting performance.  
<br />
<br />If you go into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features and look for the software, check if there is a Modify or REpair button for it other than just uninstall.  This may also be an AMD or Radeon Install Manager.  You want to modify the installation to include only the driver and nothing else since it's all unneeded bloatware.  
<br />
<br />But more importantly turn off all AMD Radeon in the four places where Startup freeloaders nest, covered in Step 4 of this Performance checklist:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you have any questions about these or any other startups you want answered before deleting them, either google them to find out what they are (not needed in 95% of cases) or ask back here with a screenshot so we can see what you're talking about:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Radeon settings would be related to your video card device software
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video card device driver and associated software they recommend to resolve this for you . . .

<p>Hi Greg, thank you for the info. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 4 went slightly differently then it says on the link. I typed msconfig and opened System Configuration.&nbsp; I do not have to choose to Run as Administrator, I don't even actually see the option.&nbsp; I did go to the Services tab, clicked the Hide all Microsoft
 services button and disabled everything else in that tab, and I did open the Startup folder and it was empty.&nbsp; Is that correct and I just have a slightly different version of windows then in that article?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed the Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Startup, there are 7 programs there.&nbsp; I turned Steam off, it does not need to open on start up.&nbsp; There is also HD Audio Background Process, HP Message Service, Microsoft One Drive, Realtek HD Audio Manager, Realtek WOWL
 Utility, and Windows Defender notification icon.&nbsp; Should I turn any of those off or leave them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Settings, Apps, Apps &amp; features the program AMD Software has the same symbol as the ones in my hidden icon tray.&nbsp; Only it is grey instead of red.&nbsp; When I click modify I have 4 options, AMD HDMI Audio Driver, AMD PSP Driver, AMD SMBus Driver and AMD Start
 Now Technology ACPI Driver.&nbsp; There is no repair option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also based on what just happened I am hoping I did everything needed.&nbsp; There was 8 of the Radeon Setting icons in my hidden icon tray, I just opened it and went to hover over them, and they all disappeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for the reply and easy to follow steps in the article you wrote.</p>

            Right click on System Configuration result in Search to Run as Admin.  
<br />
<br />You can turn off all Task Mgr Startups except Defender and OneDrive if you use it to sync files. 
<br />
<br />I'd just leave the AMD as is in App Settings.  If you have a tray icon for it you can right click to access Settings to turn it off at Startup.  But it sounds like you already did that.

<h3> kenj62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Mouse inconsistent behavior of scroll wheel and button</h2>
                    Microsoft Comfort Optical Mouse 3000 is a wired, USB mouse connected to an ASUS MB w/Intel Quad-Core system running 32 bit Windows 7. Driver updated today to v7.10.344.0. Mouse wheel scrolling and scroll-wheel button assignments are fully functional in
 all other apps including Office 2007, IE8 and Firefox 3.6.3.<br />
<br />
Mouse scrolling is NOT active in Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 Platinum Edition although cursor blinking stops while the wheel is being rotated.
<br />
<br />
Scroll-wheel button is not active for any programmed function in the email client Incredimail 2. Developer INSISTED it was the mouse software!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>Hi KenJ62,</span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try the following steps given in order and see if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Test the mouse by using the Mousinfo diagnostic tool</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The Mousinfo diagnostic tool is installed together with the IntelliPoint software. If you do not have this software, you cannot open the tool.</span></p>
<p><span>To open the Mousinfo tool, follow this step:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start-&gt; Click
<strong>All Programs</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Accessories</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Run</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<strong>Open</strong> box, type mousinfo, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong><span>You may try changing the mouse wheel settings and check if that helps in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Mouse Properties by clicking the
</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, and then clicking
</span></span><span><span>Control Panel</span></span><span><span>. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span>mouse</span></span><span><span>, and then click
</span></span><span><span>Mouse</span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<span>Wheel</span> tab, and then do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To set the number of lines the screen will scroll for each notch of mouse wheel movement, under
<span>Vertical Scrolling</span>, select <span>The following number of lines at a time</span>, and then enter the number of lines you want to scroll in the box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To scroll an entire screen of text for each notch of the mouse wheel, under
<span>Vertical Scrolling</span>, select <span>One screen at a time</span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If your mouse has a wheel that supports horizontal scrolling, under
<span>Horizontal Scrolling</span>, in the <span>Tilt the wheel to scroll the following number of characters at a time</span> box, enter the number of characters you want to scroll horizontally when you tilt the wheel to the left or right.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link for more information:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Method 3 : Uninstall any conflicting mouse software</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have any other mouse software that is installed, such as Logitech or touchpad software, that software may conflict with the IntelliMouse
 software. </span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall the other software, follow the step mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>Open
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> in <strong>Control Panel</strong>. To do this, follow this step:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start. In the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box, type appwiz.cpl. Press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Find any other mouse software in this list, and follow the instructions to remove the software.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4: Remove and reinstall the IntelliPoint software</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>View the list of programs that are installed on the computer. To do this, follow the appropriate steps for your version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><strong><span>Windows Vista or Windows 7</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
Open <strong>Programs and Features</strong> in <strong>Control Panel</strong>. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Start. In the
<strong>Start Search</strong> box, type appwiz.cpl. Press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Remove Microsoft IntelliPoint. To do this, follow this step:</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Microsoft IntelliPoint</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Uninstall/Change</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Yes</strong> to confirm that you want to remove the program.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 5: Determine whether it is application specific</span></strong></p>
<p><span>With newer “high-resolution” mouse devices, some applications may not correctly interpret partial scrolling messages. When low resolution wheels
 scroll up and down, the mouse driver sends a scroll magnitude of 120 for each tick of the wheel up and 120 for each tick down. According to the official documentation, a scrolling value of 120 (or -120) indicates one line of scrolling. If the application receives
 less than a full line, it should either scroll part of a line (which is what Microsoft Word and some other applications do) or if that’s not possible, save up the value until a total of 120 is reached (which is what Notepad does). Most current Microsoft mouse
 devices are designed to give a smoother scroll experience, so the wheels are higher resolution and send four times as many scroll events, but at one-quarter of the magnitude. So instead of 120, they send 30 (or instead of -120 when scrolling back, they send
 -30). This should result in scrolling at the same speed, just more smoothly. <br />
<br />
Some applications may not handle this correctly. <br />
<br />
For example, they may ignore partial scroll events, or they may interpret a partial (30) event as a full line (120). There have been instances of some applications that actually combine both of these incorrect behaviors. For example, some applications may ignore
 the positive partial events and treat negative partial events as a full line, which would result in slow scrolling forward and fast scrolling backward.
<br />
<br />
To test whether this is an application-specific problem, compare the behavior in that application to how scrolling works in Notepad or Microsoft Word.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for the reply,</p>
Method 1: Mousinfo indicates all is well. (Took me awhile to see that 'mouse' was spelled 'mous' !
<p>Method 2: Already tried different mouse settings including turning off horizontal scrolling - no joy.</p>
<p>Method 3: There is NO conflicting software. MS Mouse support built-in to Win7. Driver update was made available only recently - no change in symptoms.</p>
<p>Method 4: See 3 above.</p>
<p>Method 5: The scroll rate in the driver is adjusted via a slider. There are no indications for speed other than a relative rate - slow.......fast.</p>
<p>Original post states the problem IS application specific.</p>

<span><span>Hi KenJ62,</span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>As the issue is application specific please contact the application vendor and check with them if there are any scroll settings that has to be
 taken care of. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue occurs with many games as well since the game vendors will have their own settings and shortcuts to be followed in the game. This may

<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my original post, "Scroll-wheel button is not active for any programmed function in the email client Incredimail 2. Developer INSISTED it was the mouse software!"</p>
<p>In fact, when I begged to differ with them (politely, of course) they told me in no uncertain terms that the Incredimail 2 application was not the problem and closed the topic! Seemed rude to me.</p>
<p>So, let's see here. I have a motherboard from a major, mainstream manufacturer (ASUS) with Intel CPU and components and a Microsoft mouse. I have Microsoft Windows 7 and driver software from Microsoft for their mouse. The hardware and the software work perfectly
 together with Microsoft applications and Firefox applications - in fact, with all other applications except for Vegas Studio and the 2nd version of Incredimail (version 1 worked!).</p>
<p>I was curious if application development often made mistakes with mouse support. I suppose no one will ever confess such. My conclusion is the developers are at fault. And, it seems they don't care.......</p>

<p>It's a known problem of incompatibility with this mouse model and Win7 (search with Goolge "microsoft notebook mouse 3000 mousewheel problems")! There are many different programs/games&nbsp;where&nbsp;mousewheel&nbsp;is unresponsive (e.g. Oblivion PC game). It's not a
 bug in the applications but in Win7 OS drivers. Infact on the very same PC with Vista or XP it did work perfectly!</p>
<p>This is a great mouse! But MS need to release a better (Intellimouse?) driver or fix it in Win7 itself!</p>

            Install the corresponding Intellipoint drivers.&nbsp; You will then have additional settings that will help with the mouse controls.

<p>Thank you for the additional replies. Since my last post here I discovered a new release of the IntelliPoint driver version 8.0.219.0 dated 6/29/2010. The inability to scroll-zoom in/out of the timeline with Sony Vegas Movie Studio 9 remains in the new version
 10. The Incredimail email application still does not respond to the scroll wheel.</p>
<p>I would be most happy if I could get the scroll feature to work in Sony VMS. The problem has been discussed on the video oriented DVInfo forum and the results are mixed. Some have the same problem and some do not. And there seems to be no particular common
 system to highlight the specific incompatibility. Some 32 bit had the problem and a few 64 bit. This is a very elusive symptom.</p>
<p>I have already tried older Microsoft mice as I indicated in my original post. But, I am willing to try another model if necessary. I guess I could buy a new mouse on the contingency that it must work or I get to return it. Are there any outfits that will
 do that for an electrical device? So, are there any suggestions for another model that might work properly?</p>

<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>It's not an old-drivers problem at all, it's a bug in Win7. Nothing changes using&nbsp;latest IntelliPoint or even uninstalling them completely and using std Win mouse drivers: the mousewheel will still have problems with some applications/games: Word 2003 (CTRL+mousewheel
 zoom in/out won't respond unless you scroll the wheel insanely fast), Oblivion (game, scroll menus), FallOut&nbsp;(game, scroll menus) and more.</p>
<p>Tested on different PCs with Win7 and the result is always the same using: Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 3000, Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500, Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000.</p>
<p>Using another Windows version (e.g. Vista/XP) or another mouse model (also the old Microsoft Wheel Mouse Optical) + Win7 there are no issues instead.</p>
<p>It's clear it's a bug in Win7 mouse handling MS should be warned about! We need a fix for Win7 or IntelliPoint.</p>

<p>Well, thanks for the new information. It would help if the problem was consistent and, as I said earlier, some folks report no problems will the same configuration. I wonder if the ASUS P5KPL-CM motherboard I used could be a problem?</p>
<p>What do you suppose would be the best way to escalate this problem to Microsoft so it gets through all the "noise" coming from end users? My best option right now appears to be buying a different BRAND of mouse. Do you hear that Microsoft? &lt;he said in his
 most provocative tone&gt;</p>

<p>I doubt they have the same mouse + Win7. I've reproduced this issue on 3 different Win7 PCs with 3 different MS mouse (Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 3000, Microsoft Wireless Mobile Mouse 3500, Microsoft Notebook Optical Mouse 4000). Doesn't happen instead
 connecting&nbsp;them&nbsp;to Win7/XP or Vista machines (dual boot, identical HW! Only under Win7 they have this mousewheel issue) or using other mouse models with Win7. 99% it's simply a driver problem and MS should provide a solution for&nbsp;its own&nbsp;products.</p>
<p>A&nbsp;Logitech Wireless Mouse M305 solved all problems for me! ;(</p>
<p>Shame on MS not supporting its own products, strange but true. The sad thing is that there isn't a specific&nbsp;HW support address to report the bug and ask for a quick-fix (= Win7 driver update/Intellimouse driver).</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to have the computer not lock&#63;</h2>
                    The locking feature in Vista is a little weird since it doesn't appear to do anything but take up time.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when I open my computer it says it has to lock, then it spends time locking, and when it's done all I do is click on the Gerbera daisy picture that it supplies, and it opens.
<br />
<br />
So, I'd like to eliminate all that time taken doing the locking. I mean, anyone could click on the flower and it would open, so the value of the locking is lost on me....<br />
<br />

&nbsp;When you close the lid on your laptop (depending on make/model)&nbsp;in most cases this will lock the computer.&nbsp; I would verify with your manufactuer if this can be changed.&nbsp; Also, you might want to check your Power Plan options.&nbsp; Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />

<p>Thanks for providing the Hardware Ids. In line with your concern, we'd like to know if you've already tried installing an older driver for the sound device to isolate the issue. If you haven't tried it yet, we suggest that you click this
<strong>downloading </strong>and <strong>installing </strong><strong>Realtek Semiconductor Corp. - MEDIA - 5/31/2017 12:00:00 AM - 6.0.1.8172</strong> which can be seen first on the list.</p>

            Thanks for your help (and sorry for the late reply D:) but this doesn't work, and trying to install that says that I already have the best drivers available&nbsp;for the speaker.&nbsp; It seems like it's something to do with the individual&nbsp;games (as some games do
 not mute themselves when unfocused) when I tested other games and programs.&nbsp; Thanks for your help, though.

<h2>            Windows Vista Install taking forever</h2>
                    Hi, I bought a new hard drive and im using my Vista Install disk to install it onto the computer. It's been going for many hours now. about 16 to be exact. The screen is black but i can move my arrow still. I read online that it is in a step that when
 done will show a blue circle on the black screen and then go to a screen where I input a username and password... Is this normal to take so long (ive never done this before) and if something is wrong how do i stop it short of pulling the plug? I dont what
 to ruin anything..<br />
<br />
Also this computer's old hard drive and hardware had vista on it (bought it in 08) and the new hard drive is compatable it said on the box...so as far as i know everything should work with it.

            The installation has failed so you might as well abort now.<br />
<br />
Failure to install an operating system is usually caused by (in order of probability):<br />
<br />
1. You are attempting to install with other devices connected to the computer. Disconnect them before trying to do an installation.<br />
<br />
2. Faulty installation media. Check the installation CD/DVD for scratches, smudges. Test in another machine.<br />
<br />
3. Faulty optical drive. Test with another bootable CD/DVD or swap it out for a known-working one.<br />
<br />
4. Faulty RAM. Test with Memtest86+ from <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> . You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. Burn the file with third-party burning software* - as an image, not as data. Then boot with the media you made
 (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.<br />
<br />
*It is not necessary to have third-party burning software in Windows 7 since Win7 can natively burn an .iso. Other operating systems require it. A good free choice is ImgBurn from
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.imgburn.com</a> .<br />
<br />
5. Faulty hard drive. Test with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. Burn the file with third-party burning software (unless you have Windows 7, which can burn .isos natively)
 - as an image, not as data. Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.<br />
<br />
6. Other hardware components are faulty.<br />
