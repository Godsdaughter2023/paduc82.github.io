<h2>            MICROSOFT TREASURE HUNT PROBLEM</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone tell me the correct procedure to follow to report this problem about Microsoft Treasure Hunt?&nbsp; Just a half hour ago, as I was playing Treasure Hunt, the game shut down.&nbsp; I started the game again, and all lives, tools, and gold amounts had disappeared, restarting me at level 1.&nbsp; I can't even remember what level I&nbsp;was playing at, somewhere in the 80's.&nbsp; All tools were at full level, and all items had been purchased with the coin I&nbsp;earned in the game.&nbsp; Really this is upsetting, though it be only a game.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hi Rajah,<br />
<br />
<br />
You may access the Windows Recovery Environment by making your computer think that the startup is failing. The
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</strong> is a recovery environment that can repair common causes of unbootable operating systems. To do so, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on your computer.<br />
</li><li>When you see the loading dots, immediately turn off your computer.<br />
</li><li>Repeat steps one and two. Thrice will be enough for the computer to think that you are having issues with startup.<br />
</li><li>Once the computer boots up for the third time, you will see the loading dots on the screen and the message "Preparing automatic repair".<br />
</li><li>Afterwards, your PC may turn blank then it will show "Diagnosing your PC".<br />
</li><li>It will ask you to restart or choose Advanced options, select <strong>Advance Options</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're in the Windows Recovery Environment, you may go to <strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings</strong> to access
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and we'll assist you further if needed.</p>

<h2>            How to unlock a computer that shows incorrect password message&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div>Some time ago my Windows XP Pro got infected by viruses. Then occasionally (some days yes, some days not) &nbsp;it started to make comparitively loud noise when turned on. Then I did not turn it on for a while (about a month). When I tried to turn it on today,
 it showed me that the password I entered is incorrect although I had it written down and it should have been correct. Can an antivirus rescue disk help at this point or should I do something else? I am not a big expert at computers so please explain me things
 in plain text if you have a clue. By the way, I am the only administrator and there is no chance to get onto the computer using other accounts...</div>

            <p>In addition to an <em>administrative</em> account, i.e. the one you say is your account, there is also
<strong><em>the</em></strong> Administrator account (unless you have circumvented mechanisms designed to prevent its deletion).</p>
<p>If you see the welcome screen at start up hit ctrl-alt-del twice to get to a text input screen.</p>
<p>In the text input logon box you will see a user name box and a password box. You can use the user name box to see if you are typing the password correctly (passwords
<strong><em>are</em></strong> case sensitive). Once you are sure you are typing the password correctly change the user name to
<strong>Administrator</strong>, leave the password field blank and try to logon.</p>
<p>If you successfully logon you can change the password for any account, including your
<em>administrative</em> account by Control Panel/User Accounts.</p>

Hello again,
<div>I thought my computer had XP Pro on it, but when I turned the PC on, it showed me "just" Windows XP, without "Pro" or "Home" specifications. When I hit ctrl-alt-del buttons at the startup, it led me to some BIOS screen that scared me a bit (I don't know
 why). I saw quite a lot of features there, but I did not see the Safe Mode or User Account managing corner there where I could change the password... Any ideas what to do next? I am quite desperate...</div>

            <p>Ordinarily you cannot determine XP Pro or Home from the boot screens.</p>
<p>If you have XP Pro, the time to hit ctrl-alt-del twice is when you see the Welcome Screen, i.e. the screen where you can logon to Windows. It would seem you are probably trying ctrl-alt-del at boot time, just after switching on the PC, you must wait for
 the Windows logon screen to appear first.</p>
<p>ctrl-alt-del means hold down Crtl and Alt and <em>while holding them down</em> hit Del.</p>
<p>As an alternative you could try logging on as <strong><em>the</em></strong> Administrator in safe mode - keep hitting F8 twice a second after turning on the PC until you get the boot menu where safe mode is selectable by the up/down arrow keys, then hit
 enter.</p>
<p>In safe mode, logon as <strong><em>the</em></strong> Administrator and you change the password for any logon from Control Panel/User Accounts.</p>

<h2>            Something on my laptop is attempting to login to account.live.com with old account credentials.</h2>
                    <p>Something on my laptop is consistently trying to attempt to log in to my Microsoft account. &nbsp;When i log in to my account online, i see my most recent login as successful, but multiple failed logins (typically in sets of three a few minutes apart from one
 another) occurring when the machine is running. &nbsp;I visited the AnswerDesk in the Microsoft Store, but they did not have any ideas beyond either a) outside hacker, or b) virus. &nbsp;The IP address this is coming from is my IP address with the failed password coming
 through Internet Explorer. &nbsp;Here is what i have done so far. &nbsp;</p>
<p>* Turned everything off overnight - there were no attempts - trying to make sure there was not outside hacking attempt</p>
<p>* Downloaded a tool from Microsoft to clear all passwords stored in IT</p>
<p>* Turned off all add-ons, etc.</p>
<p>* Turned off IE in Windows Settings</p>
<p>* Ran Bitdefender, Windows Essentials (in Microsoft Store), and Spybot -found no viruses</p>
<p>* Turned off a few things in Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>* Suspected Skype app and removed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this has helped. &nbsp;Does anyone have any ideas. &nbsp;This is driving me a bit nuts. &nbsp;I depend on OneDrive to keep items synced between machines and these login failures cause OneDrive to stop syncing.</p>
<p>

<p>Picked this up on one of the related threads and it this should not be causing the problem, but it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My exchange email address is the same as my Microsoft account alias. &nbsp;I saw in another thread that someone changed their passwords for both to match, even though their email was hosted by someone other than Microsoft and the Microsoft account has nothing
 to do with their hosted Exchange. &nbsp;After this, their failed login attempts stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the exact same experience - now i see the same amount of login attempts as before, but now they show as successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step one - go in to credential manager and remove credentials related to Outlook/Exchange.</p>
<p>Step two - change password for Exchange to match Microsoft account password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is clearly something here with logic/code that needs to be addressed, but this workaround does solve the issue.</p>

<div>This happens when more than one version of Office is installed (or was </div>
<div>installed). The simplest way to deal with it is to let the installer </div>
<div>finish. Once it is done, you shouldn't get the message again unless you </div>
<div>try to use a different version of Word. See, for example, </div>

            I am having the same problem with a non-microsoft program.&nbsp; It not only happens when I run the program, but even if I don't run the program, a "Please wait while Windows configures..." pops up when I am shutting down and I have to click cancel several
 times.&nbsp; Then it happens when I am booting up.<br />
<br />
I can't follow through with it because it then asks for a CD with the installer from the program.&nbsp; But I downloaded the program on the internet and don't have the CD.&nbsp; So I tried locating the .msi file for the program.&nbsp; I located it but it doesn't recognize
 it as valid!<br />
<br />
Any way to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Rick<br />

<h2>            Intel Driver Update Utility Installer</h2>

 cover such problems but don't always and some helpful people on here have mentioned using the Intel site. There is&nbsp; Intel Driver Update Utility Installer - am I safe to run this on windows 10 64 bit?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To address your concern, it's safe to run the Intel Driver Update Utility Installer if it's compatible with Windows 10. If not, you can run it in
<strong>Compatibility Mode</strong>. Regarding with the error "USB controller has failed or not working", refer to the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device Manager.</strong></li><li>Uninstall the <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</li><li>Right click on any device in the Device Manager, and click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong>. It will automatically reinstall the Universal Serial Bus controllers.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Hold the POWER Button down until it shuts off is one way. <br />
<br />
Be sure to check with the System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation, and their forums<br />
(if any).<br />
<br />
<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />

<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />
Product Key.</p>
<p>In-Place Upgrade<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>
<p>This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a Vista DVD<br />

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>

<p>REBOOT to Windows</p>

            Hi Andre.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You should install the latest driver and software for the Audio controller for your PC from the 1) PC model or 2) Device Maker's Support Downloads webpage.  Sometimes PC makers customize these so try the PC Sound downloads first.  
<br />
<br />This may or may not remove the DTS Control Panel but if you dont' want it then it should be able to be uninstalled in Settings&gt;Apps and Features.  There is more about this here including replacement download if needed:  <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Audio/DTS-audio-control-panel-missing/td-p/6202451" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Audio/DT...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Here is a picture for more information. I was asking the above because I don't think I need both drivers. If I can remove the Realtek one and keep the Logitech.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a1d916a-217c-4ae8-864c-78db5fd91f75" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7a1d916a-217c-4ae8-864c-78db5fd91f75" /></a>

            The Realtek appears to be your Audio controller which is not the same as the headset and must be present if you want audio because it drives the audio adapter installed on your PC.  
<br />
<br />The Logitech is solely for the headset.  
<br />
<br />Make sure you have the latest driver for both from the PC Support Downloads webpage, and from Logitech webpage for the headset model.  
<br />
<br />The DTS Sound control panel is bloatware from HP that comes preinstalled from factory.  There is more about removing it here:  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3rc9yz/disable_dts_studio_sound_enhancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/3...</a>
<br />
<br />I would first check in Settings&gt;Apps and Features if it's located anywhere there to unintsall.  
<br />
<br />Next check Step 4 in this Checklist to search any place it may be set to Start with Windows and disable it from doing so:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that while HP has great hardware their factory install is the worst in the industry, larded with bloatware like utilities that duplicate and cause issues with better versions built into Windows.   You can get rid of all of it and have a much better install from this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

            I don't have problems with the audio like the people from the Reddit post who wanted to remove it. I just want to remove it and the steps are not really that clear and making a clean install is not an option as I don't have a CD or USB with the version
 of Windows I am using and the links you provided give tips only for Windows 10. My only solution is to wait half a year to buy a laptop that I will be using for study. If you could tell me the steps to remove the DTS Audio Control Panel better explained than
 in the post I would appreciate that. It is alright either way just looking for different options. Thanks.

            Andre -
<br />
<br />I've now given you multiple steps to try which have not been replied to.  
<br />
<br />Did you check Settings&gt;Apps and Features list for the DTS Audio to uninstall?
<br />
<br />Did you update the Sound controller driver from the PC's Support Downloads webpage to see if it removes it?  
<br />
<br />Did you turn off DTS at Startup following Step 4 in this Checklist? <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br />
<br />If you're in doubt about what can go then google the listing or post back a screenshot showing the full lists.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />You can always get the latest bootable installation media from Media Creation Tool:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install the tool to run it from Windows to upgrade to latest version by the most stable method.  
<br />
<br />If you need to stay with older versions for now then their media is available here:  <a href="https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/67-microsoft-windows-and-office-iso-download-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-scienc...</a>
<br />
<br />As I said there is also an automated Refresh which Windows 10 developers included for the first time as a tip of the hat to enthusiasts who would never run a Factory or Upgrade Install because they'd expect endless issues.  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

    <title>Video streamed&#47;cast to Xbox One is far too dark - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louthelou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Video streamed&#47;cast to Xbox One is far too dark</h2>
                    
<p>That is, it lacks brightness.&nbsp; Playing the video in VLC player in my Windows 10 machine displays the video perfectly.&nbsp; Playing the video in Movies &amp; TV on my PC results in a slightly darker image (though still very much watchable), but no audio.&nbsp; Casting
 the video to my Xbox One (which plays in the Movies &amp; TV app on the Xbox) results in a
<em>very</em> dark display (like the brightness is turned <em>way</em> down), but the audio is fine.</p>
<p>The movie is in MKV format, which I realize causes problems with Microsoft apps because Microsoft can't seem to keep its codecs straight.&nbsp; However, this has to be a new problem, because I previously cast this exact same file to my Xbox without issue.&nbsp; At
 the time, though, I was not using the new Xbox Preview Dashboard, as I am now (the Windows 10 preview update).</p>
<p><br />
This probably wouldn't be an issue if the associated codecs were actually supported in Microsoft apps; unfortunately, much of the time, a third-party app is required to play MKV files, because even though they've been around forever and are used quite commonly,
 Microsoft apparently doesn't want to support those codecs.</p>

<p>Well, I apparently can't edit my post anymore, so I have to comment to amend/add something:</p>
<p>I actually didn't cast this to my Xbox before without issue. &nbsp;What I did - and what I am doing now - is hooking up an external HD to the Xbox with the file on it. &nbsp;The Xbox then uses Media Player, rather than Movies &amp; TV, to play the video - and it works
 perfectly. &nbsp;Audio is fine, and the picture looks perfect.</p>
<p>So, yeah. &nbsp;It's either the process of casting from Windows to Xbox, or the new and totally unnecessary Movies &amp; TV app, that is messing up the display while attempting to cast the video from PC to Xbox.</p>

<h2>            Disabling touch screen for Acer Aspire V 15</h2>
                    <br />

<div>
<p>I currently have Windows 10pro on my Acer.&nbsp; There is no damage to the screen but during an update from 8 - 10 the screen starts ghosting with bubbles of what look like pressure points. There is no way to stop it and you cannot get into any of the control
 or other programs. I was once able to delete the device for the User interface, but every time I do a windows update, it comes back. I need this deleted permanently. The Laptop is unusable at this point.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I go through Bios or some other management BEFORE it gets to the login in order to delete or disable the screen?</p>

            <p>Hello Chin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret form the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to&nbsp;work through the steps below to identify the cause of the problem.
</p><p>The problem could lie with:</p>
<ul>
<li>The connector cables/connections - are they securely fastened? Are they in the right place? Are all the electrical sockets in good working order?</li><li>The DVD disc itself - Check if a different DVD works</li><li>The DVD Player's optical reader (the lens which 'reads' the data from DVDs)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check if decreasing the speed of your burner while writing the disk help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope the above information holds good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer, but it didn't work. I went through the process but it made no difference. However I solved the problem by abandoning the upgrade and downloading the entire myob file again. Before I installed the file I right clicked and selected
 "run as administrator" and it installed perfectly.</p>

    <title>stop&#58; c0000142 &#40;dll initialization failed&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dagmarka  say:</h3>
<h2>            stop&#58; c0000142 &#40;dll initialization failed&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had my Windows 7 64 bit VAIO laptop in a hibernation mode while open two days ago. Going to sleep I just closed the laptop’s screen as I usually do.
<br />
I opened the screen and pressed Power button to wake up the laptop the next evening = yesterday (as I usually do when it’s in hibernation mode). I got a low memory message while trying to use Firefox. I did not have anything else open nor connected to the laptop,
 just a Microsoft Mouse 6000 as usual. While I couldn’t close anything to free up the memory, I wanted to turn the laptop off. It wouldn’t respond to the turn off. I didn’t even think that an update could be running as I didn’t see any pop-up notification for
 updates. No I didn’t look at the Systray if one is running. So I pressed the Power button to close the Windows. It closed, however it restarted itself and that is when I received an error. I proceeded with the Startup Repair.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have the exactly the same problem as mentioned in&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system/blue-screen-error-message-c0000142-dll/64434631-3d61-42b9-aac3-05533d128edd<br />
</p>
<p><br />
As to your suggestions:<br />
<u>Step 1:</u>&nbsp; I have nothing connected to the bare bones laptop, not even a mouse.
<br />
<br />
<u>Step 2:&nbsp; 1) </u><span>&nbsp;</span>Tried the&nbsp; Startup Repair. It was running for over 12 hours. The screen was on the whole night; however; the laptop wasn’t even warm and I could tell it is not doing anything, just the hard drive light was blining. So I turned
 the laptop off with the Power button today in the morning, even there was a message not to turn it off. This resulted in CheckDisk, which I let run<br />
<br />
Upon restarting the laptop while pressing F8 a blue screen of death error appeared:<br />
STOP: ‘C0000142 {DLL Initialization Failed}&nbsp; Initialization of the dynamic link library winsrv failed. the Process is terminating abnormally’<br />
<br />
When restarting the laptop, nothing happens while pressing F8, the same error as above pops up.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>When another computer’s Windows 7 Professional installation disk is in the CD-Rom</span> while booting and pressing F8, it wants to install that particular Windows 7<br />
<span>When another computer’s Windows 7 Professional installation disk is in the CD-Rom</span> while booting and pressing F8, it wants to install that particular Windows 7<br />
<br />
Canceling the installation, I was able to get to the Advanced Boot Options menu. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Clicking on ‘Repair Your Computer’ brought up ‘Windows Error Recovery’ menu. Selecting ‘Launch Startup Repair’ seemed to be having the same issue as the original ‘Startup Repair’.
<br />
<br />
I did turn off the laptop with the Power button again. I restarted the PC once again using ‘Start Windows Normally’ in the Windows Error Recovery. This results in the : ‘STOP: C0000142 {DLL Initialization Failed}&nbsp; Initialization of the dynamic link library
 winsrv failed. the Process is terminating abnormally’ Error.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<span>When my laptop’s VAIO Backup DVD is inserted in the CD-Rom </span>while booting and pressing F8, it brings up ‘Windows Boot Manager’:<br />
<span>When my laptop’s VAIO Backup DVD is inserted in the CD-Rom </span>while booting and pressing F8, it brings up ‘Windows Boot Manager’:<br />
<br />
Selecting ‘Repair Windows 7’ started ‘System Recovery Options’. Choosing recovery tools for Windows 7 did not fix anything.
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I did “Send information about this problem” report&nbsp; to Microsoft because of the pop-up menu&nbsp; ’Startup Repair cannot repair this computer automatically’. The ‘View diagnostic and repair details’ lists Bad Driver for Problem Signature 07. The ‘View advanced options
 for system recovery and support’ lists Error code = 0x2 <br />
<br />
<u>Step 2:&nbsp; 2) </u>&nbsp; System Restore ended up in this message ’The System Restore can’t help fix problems that might be making your computer run slowly or stop responding’; ‘No restore points have been created on your computer’s system drive. To create a restore
 point open System Projection’<br />
<i><u><br />
</u>How could this be?</i> <span>&nbsp;</span>I checked my restore points earlier this week and I had 17 days daily restore points listed. I did set up the larger capacity of restoring volume as I didn’t like having only 17 days-worth of restore points. I don’t
 need daily restore points, but monthly for sure.<br />
I have also a message ‘Your computer is running on a limited diagnostic state. If you use System Restore in this limited state, you cannot undo the restore operation.
<span style="color: rgba(192, 0, 0, 1)">This makes me believe selecting higher volume (I believe to 10%) for system restoring created my laptop’s problems</span>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Running ‘Windows Memory Diagnostic’ brought up Windows Boot Manager’ again. <br />
<br />
Executing ‘Safe Mode” brought up ‘Vaio Care Rescue’ with there were two options:<br />
-Start VAIO Care Rescue<br />
-Repair Windows 7<br />
<br />
Starting VAIO Care Rescue’s Safe Mode has three options:<br />
-Start recovery wizard [Recover your system using a step-by-step process]<br />
-‘Tools’ [Maintain your system using custom recovery options and utilities]<br />
-‘Exit’/ [Choose to shut down your computer or restart Windows.<br />
<br />
‘Start recovery wizard’ needs [u]72 hours[/u] attention due to restrictions in Windows PE. This can’t be possibly done, I canceled this option.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The Last Known Good Configuration (advanced) from the ‘Advanced Boot Options’ started ‘System Recovery Options’ resulted to the : ‘STOP: C0000142 {DLL Initialization Failed}&nbsp; Initialization of the dynamic link library winsrv failed. the Process is terminating
 abnormally’ Error.<br />
<br />
I didn’t try the other options from the Avanced Boot Options’.&nbsp; Using Safe Mode will not start Windows in the safe mode at all.<br />
<br />
I am not able to find out how to reset the System Restore volume to its original percentage. Please help.
<br />
Thank you</p>

    <title>Which Government Agency Regulates Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Which Government Agency Regulates Microsoft</h2>
                    My laptop will only boot to a black screen with no cursor as a result of an attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8. I have called tech support multiple times to no avail. The long wait times are unbusiness like in my opinion. The customer service
 agents passed me off from customer service agent to customer service agent. At the end of the day my laptop will not work due to Microsoft's update and lack of customer service. What I want to know is, which government agency regulates Microsoft so I may file
 a complaint?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the computer few times and check. Sometimes black screen may appear for more than few hours while the installation is going on.</p>
<p>
<span>Got a Black Screen while installing or upgrading? This does not mean activation progress has stopped. Some PCs may need a long time to download Windows 10. Give it time!

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><strong>Tip</strong> - If you get a black screen with a blue circle at the 30-39% range, this means Windows 10 is downloading dynamic updates. Let it progress!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><strong>Tip</strong> - if your Windows 10 upgrade is at 96%, Windows is busy backing up your data. Do not stop progress!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Tip</strong></span><span> - If your Windows 10 download seems sluggish, try disconnecting any USB devices and extended display cables that may be connected to speed up the download!</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then rollback to Windows 8.1 and then try the steps below and re-install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Disable (preferably uninstall) your Antivirus utility before attempting the upgrade.
<br />
2. Restart a few times and try again. <br />
3. Disable General USB Devices (example - Smart Card Reader). <br />
4.&nbsp;Do a clean boot and try again. </span></p>

<br />
7. If that does not work, try using the .ISO file to upgrade if possible. <br />
8. If you are connected to a domain, switch to a local account <br />
9. If you have any external devices attached to the machine, disconnect them (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">example</span>, gaming controllers, USB keys, external hard disk, printers, non-essential devices).

            <p>Hello Kalpana Shankarappa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply but unfortunately what you posted is not in-line with the question. To be honest it is a little insulting. I would say about 90% of what you posted is useless for someone in a black screen. Nonetheless, I have tried all that I can
 try. I need tech support to help troubleshoot these issues. I am not getting that from Microsoft at all. What I am getting is links to forums that anyone can post in, mmmm...sort of like....well me. Might as well provide a link to a Wikipedia page......I would
 like my computer back!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why can't you just provide consumers the right answer and give them the correct avenues to make formal complaints.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It would be nice if these people would allow you to file a complaint with them and take it seriously. It's like we're under the rule of the Gestapo with this company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got some fast action when I wrote a letter to the BBB, although - you guessed it - my problem was merely escalated to a tech who worked on it for days (after my computer was totally shredded following the Anniversary Update), not resolving the multiple
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the great cure is to overwrite the download of the download of the download. They've screwed up the inner workings of our computers and won't fess up to the fact that they don't know how to fix the problem. I'm so angry that I could scream.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I found this (typical) failure to answer the same question I have. I'm wondering if the FCC would be the agency? If you find out, please post on here and I will do the same...</p>

<p>This is not the complaint department and Microsoft won't even see your post.&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a volunteer tech forums where you can get your problems solved if you're interested in solutions rather than just venting.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If your Upgrade failed it's likely due to the qualty of the underlying install which is what matters most in Windows 10.&nbsp; Since we don't know how far the Upgrade got, and it won't roll back which means it still has track of your old install, then what I
 would do to save time is follow <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10&nbsp; </a>which compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you need to make the bootable media as one of the first steps in the link above, you can also boot the media per the illustrated Steps, but at the second screen choose Repair Your Computer to try a Startup Repair or see if there is a choice in Advanced
 Troubleshoot Options to Roll back to old Version, or Reset.&nbsp; If none of these will resurrect your old install or the Upgrade itself, you can also use the booted media to

<p>You are correct there: "...your Upgrade failed it's likely due to the qualty of the underlying install", which was from the Windows Insider Program to the Anniversary Update. I have several computers and a friend under the same scenario that this occurred
 with simultaneously, whereas no one else I know had this problem who installed it fresh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done most of the above - thanks for your input. My final attempt at recovering my computer was to totally reset it with a fresh install of Win10. Though I did save my files to an external HD, the thing somehow recategorized them (? - a Seagate), which
 I shouldn't have needed anyway because I checked the option 'to keep all files'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the thing: I've been trying to deal with Microsoft for nearly a year now, to no avail. My computer is screwed. And, there is no avenue to complain to them directly - no phone number, no email - if you ask a service tech to pass along a message to
 a manager or what-not, you get the run-around. Thus, the original question: Which federal agency regulates Microsoft?!! We can't get an answer anywhere else, so I was pleased to see this question posed and disappointed to see a discombobulated reply that did
 not pertain to the original poster's question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've wasted more time on this than I can begin to detail. Thank you for your suggestions and please let me know - anyone - if you find out the best place to go to in order to file a complaint against Microsoft. I'm pretty sure Bill Gates would have cared
 about this! heehee</p>

            <p>Hi Trish,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thanks for posting the question.</span></p>
<p>As per the description provided, it looks like you get the bluescreen error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we need some more information about the issue to assist you better.</p>
<p>Please help me answer this question.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When exactly did you get this bluescreen error?</p>
<p>2. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try the steps mentioned in the link and check:</p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> </span><span>System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file. If you have backups of your files, you can restore the files from a backup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>You may have to post the minidump files which are present in this location:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c:\Windows\minidump</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive: to upload the files in MS Community.<br />

<p>However, I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check:</p>

<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>

<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to set the computer in clean boot:

            Hi Erhan,
<br />Microsoft said in <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/11/13/windows-10-quality-approach-for-a-complex-ecosystem/#I0GVrKCTu65XCX2d.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/201...</a>
<br />If we detect that your device might have an issue, we will not offer the update until that issue is resolved.
<br />So I think the best solution is to wait until 1903 will be supposed in updates.

            Hi Erhan
<br />
<br />Honestly, version 1903 is very stable, probably the most stable feature update to Windows 10 yet.
<br />
<br />It is being released slowly and currently, you must click 'Update Now' to get that update . . .
<br />
<br />The 1903 update will check your system prior to installing and if a hardware conflict is found, the update will not install
<br />
<br />All-in-all, on these forums we are usually flooded with bugs and complaints when a feature update is released, this has not been the case with 1903, so you should go for the update . . .

            Honestly I would just wait awhile. It will roll out to you in due time. Keep an eye on the forums for problems people are encountering. Be sure to make an image backup of your drive to safeguard your data. Macrium Reflect Free is a very good choice. No
 matter how careful Microsoft is being with rolling out 1903 problems can and do happen. There is really no need to hurry and get it, but if you do want it now just be sure to backup. I have had it since May 25th and it is a pretty stable release, but having
 said that there are some problems being reported.

<span>OS Build 17763.557 which was the last update for v1809. </span>It took me 4 attempts to install 1903 then and once it installed (5+ hours later) as the windows update didnt work and I had to revert to the
<span>Windows 10 May 2019 Update now available</span>, then and even with that, it took 2 attempts to FINALLY have the v1903 OS Build 18362.175 installed but, this was not the end!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once it installed it didnt recognise my 4 number PIN? Tried several times 'didnt work' then tried 'Password' for my Microsoft Hotmail account and that didnt work also, I had to change my Hotmail password before and eventually it let me into my Win-10 Pro
 Op but, this was not the end, I got into my OP and 90% of it was missing??? and my comp was about 50% slower, all my previous files were missing and nowhere to be seen or recovered, not even in windows.old??? Rebooted the comp once again and magic, magic my
 files came back and all sorts of funny graphic related problems started to happen, especially in explorer where, it would leave the options bar permanently frozen into the top, even when I existed explorer?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All in all v1903 has slowed my system down by at least 20-30% in file explorer and office applications (the office applications are very slow and launching them takes ages e.g. word) also MS Edge is slow and unresponsive, it just refuses to launch at all???
 The v1903 has "no real advantages" yes I know, that the latest comp systems with the latest 7th, 8th gen and 9th gen Intel blah blah components the 1903 wouldn't affect and/or make any difference but, 3rd gen and 4th gen Intel systems are affected and I would
 not recommend this update to those. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, I've installed all <span>v1903, </span>the security updates, the 2009-06 cumulative update for Windows 10, office updates, adobe updates&nbsp; etc etc and they didnt make any difference.&nbsp;</p>

            Disconnect from the Internet (wired or wireless) then wait to see if it progresses. You can also press Windows key + A then toggle on Airplane Mode.

<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD

            Well, this means it has restarted. You will need to exercize some patience. Give it a good 5 to 7 hour wait to see if it progresses. 
<br />
<br />If it does not progress after 7 hours, do the following:
<br />
<br />Check to ensure there is disk activity (look at the hard disk LED light to confirm. If there is, keep waiting. 
<br />
<br />If not...
<br />
<br />Power down the computer. Unplug it, then wait 10 mins. 
<br />
<br />If you are using a laptop, remove the battery if the option is available.
<br />
<br />Disconnect it from the Internet (unplug Ethernet and/or turn off Wi-Fi).
<br />
<br />Plug it again, ensure it remains disconnected from the Internet then start computer.
<br />
<br />See if it completes setup.
<br />
<br />If setup completes and you see the desktop with the ability to click Start and launch programs, proceed to reconnect to the Internet.

<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates.
