    <title>High DPC Latency with System Audio Through Audio Interface. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            High DPC Latency with System Audio Through Audio Interface.</h2>
                    <p>All of my system audio is running through the Focusrite Scarlett 18i20 USB 2.0 audio interface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While running PreSonus Studio One v3.5 (Digital Audio Workstation software), and while playing back an existing mix, the audio plays back at a slow, fluctuating rate. At best the audio is playing at 90% normal speed with a high amount of popping and crackling.
 At worst, that audio is playing around 50% normal speed with an extreme amount of digital artifacting, and the audio sounds smeared and unlistenable. The CPU performance meter in Studio One reports an overload state, while the Windows Task Manager reports
 only 14% CPU usage. Studio One also reports the latency from my interface as 42.7 ms. There was nothing else running, aside from the normal background processes from other applications I have installed, at the time of the test.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Outside of Studio One, other system audio from web browsers and games exhibits pops and cracks to a lesser degree, but are still significant. However there is no fluctuation of playback speed, in this case.<br />
<br />
LatencyMon reports that USBPORT.SYS, ndis.sys, nvldddmkm.sys, and dxgkrnl.sys all exhibit overly long execution times (these are the top four listed in the Drivers tab, sorted by highest execution time). USBPORT.SYS had a maximum execution time of 17648.650833
 Âµs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's is the link to my Windows Performance Recorder results. I followed the instructions in the appropriate Wiki on this.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The concern you have encountered may be due to a corrupted file or a misconfigured setting.<br />
<br />
Many audio problems on a computer can be caused by DPC latency.&nbsp; DPC stands for Deferred Procedure Call.&nbsp; In its simplest form, it is the part of your Windows system that handles driver efficiency.&nbsp; If there is a driver that is taking longer than normal to
 process, it may prevent other drivers from being processed in time.&nbsp; The worst case is that it can cause your audio interface driver from responding in time and can cause clicks, pops, distortion and dropouts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest to update the driver of your audio card. Generally speaking, updated drivers deliver better functionality and improved performance. For the most part, you certainly want to upgrade your drivers unless you have a very specific reason for not wanting
 to do so. To perform the task, simply follow the steps provided by <strong>Andre Da Costa</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on this<span>

<p>Thank you for your reply, Alden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My audio driver is a version past the one that is publicly available, which Focusrite's support provided me as an attempt to correct my problem (there was no change in behavior with the new driver), and I took this afternoon to confirm that all of my other
 drivers are updated. I did notice that my BIOS is out of date, but that's a riskier process. I'd prefer to rule out all other issues prior to that, and/or formatting my system drive and starting clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should note that I've only had this issue since upgrading to Windows 10, and I did not have it with Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Weird Spooky Noises Coming From Laptop</h2>
                    <p>My HP laptop With a Pentium Processor has started to make really weird spooky noises.</p>
<p>The noise starts during the boot and wont stop until I force shut down my laptop using the power key.</p>
<p>The laptop has Windows 10, and I have recently updated the same to a latest version until which the laptop seemed to be working fine.</p>
<p>After around an hour of the update there has been noises. These noises would stop if I mute the sounds of the computer.</p>
<p>Could it be some virus?</p>
<p>Also, the noises are very well designed. Whenever i move my laptop there is scratching noise as if the hardware is about it fail. Rest of the time its weird spooky noises. Further, my voice is being echoed as well in the computer. If I say something i hear
 the same in an echo like tone from the computer but i never turned my microphone on. I believe its a virus because no noises come after I mute.</p>
<p>What could be a possible solution?</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>Hello Darian</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding to my query. I checked the ventilations and they all seemed fine. I had recently updated my Windows 10 to the latest update. I was wandering around the PC and went to sounds, for I felt that it might be a problem related to sound.
 There I found that the microphone always had 2-3 bars. I searched for Microphone making weird noises and found that it was a common problem, and found the solution as well. I disabled the microphone, and uninstalled it. Then I got prompt to restart my PC and
 I did the same.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be resolved now. Guess it was a microphone problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

            Hi OpaePepene,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Run video play troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Video playback &gt; Click and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />2. Use VLC Media Player
<br />It is better to use VLC Media Player which has all the codecs required and will play all the audio and video files.
<br />
<br />To download VLC - <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html</a>
<br />
<br />3. For Browsers  i.e. online videos
<br />For Firefox
<br />Click 3 horizontal bars on top right &gt; Options &gt; Under Performance uncheck use recommended performance settings &gt; Uncheck Use hardware acceleration when available
<br />
<br />For Chrome
<br />Click 3 vertical dots on top left &gt; Settings &gt; Click Advanced at the end &gt; Go down and under System, switch OFF Use hardware acceleration where available
<br />
<br />For Edge
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type following and Enter
<br />inetcpl.cpl
<br />Advanced tab &gt; Check Use Software rendering instead GPU rendering (This is the first option appearing beneath Accelerated graphics)

<h2>            What can I purchase with Microsoft Points</h2>
                    

<p>I have about $50 of MS points attached my account and I was wondering what I can use them for? I no longer own an xbox so purchasing dlc isn't really useful. I thought about buying a disc based xbox game or controller for a friend but unfortunately that
 transaction takes place on the Microsoft store where Microsoft points can not be used ( doesn't really make a whole lot of sense). It seems I can only purchase downloadable content, music or Window phone game apps, none of which I can use. I miss when the
 XB marketplace was attached to games for windows live, at least then I could buy pc games.</p>
<p>Is there anything I can purchase that may be useful? Can I purchase something and gift it to a friend? That doesn't seem to be an option. Perhaps MS will offer me a refund?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Neosmart contains the contents of the Windows Vista DVD's "recovery center," as we've come to refer to it. It cannot be used to install or reinstall Windows Vista,
 and just serves as a Windows PE interface to recovering your PC. Technically, one could re-create this installation media with freely-downloadable media from Microsoft (namely the Microsoft WAIK kit, a multi-gigabyte download); but it's damn-decent of Microsoft
 to make this available to Windows' users who might not be capable of creating such a thing on their own.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Read all info at the website about creating and using it</span><span><span>.</span><br />

<p><br />
<span>It makes a very good Vista Startup Repair Disk.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You can do a Startup Repair, System Restore, etc from it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reinstall disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And the 32bit is what comes normally on a computer, unless 64bits requested.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your computer</span></span><span>.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by
 selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
</span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Toshiba Recovery:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the Toshiba recovery partition, power off the laptop. Hold down the 0 (zero) key and turn the laptop on. Keep holding down
 the zero key until the TOSHIBA logo appears, where you should start tapping the zero key repeatedly. Stop if the unit beeps or when the TOSHIBA logo disappears. The screen should flash ** HDD RECOVERY MODE ** for a split second, then load the Toshiba recovery
 program right from the hard drive.<br />
<br />
Note that this erases all data, and reloads all factory default software. Be sure to back up all your important personal data beforehand!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can also make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Driver failure or System Crash, when you are up and running
 again.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their way of making Recovery Disk/s.<br />
<br />
Or borrow a proper Microsoft Vista DVD(not Dell, HP, etc).<br />
A proper Vista DVD contains all Vista versions.<br />
The Product Key determines which Vista&nbsp;version gets installed.<br />
<br />
There are 2 Vista disks: one for 32bit Operating System, and one for 64bit Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a clean install is required with a proper Vista DVD (not HP, Dell Recovery Disks):</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go into your Bios/Setup, or Boot Menu, at startup, and change the Boot Order to make the DVD/CD drive 1st in the Boot Order, then reboot with the
 disk in the Drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>At startup/power on you should see at the bottom of the screen either F2 or DELETE, to go into Bios/Setup, or F12 for the Boot Menu</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, and read/save your Data from there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Put your Hard drive in a USB Hard Drive Enclosure, plug into another computer, and read/save from there.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Download the Vista Burning software from the above link.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After installing above ISO burning software, right-click on Knoppix ISO file &gt; Copy Image to CD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Knoppix does not install on your PC; just uses your PC's resources, RAM, Graphics, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Change the Boot Order in YOUR computer/laptop to make the CD/DVD Drive 1 in the Boot Order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plug in a Flash Drive/Memory Stick, BOOT with the Live CD, and you should be able to read your Hard Drive.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>When the desktop loads, you will see at least two hard drive icons on the desktop (one for your hard drive and one for the USB drive).
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the hard drive icons to open them up and figure out which drive is which.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Right-click the USB drive icon and choose "Actions &gt; Change read/write mode" so you can write to the drive (it's read-only by default for security reasons).</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Now find the files you want to back up and drag and drop them to the USB drive. When you are finished, shut down the system and remove the USB drive.
</span></p>

    <title>Question about Xbox Live account. &#40;Information and advice&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soulbelmont64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Xbox Live account. &#40;Information and advice&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I recently made this post in the forum</p>
09 - Xbox 360 Account Suspensions &amp; Console Bans
<p>But after sending a PM to one Enforcement Team Member and make a public post, like this one, I read this on the FAQ of the forum.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><b><span>Do not</span></b><span>&nbsp;post statements or threats of legal action
<strong>or other legal inquiries.</strong> These&nbsp;<b>cannot</b>&nbsp;be addressed via this forum.</span>
</li></ul>
<p><span>I think I made a mistake doing this action on that forum and PM an Enforcement Team Member, I am very sorry for the inconveniences.</span></p>
<p>I would like to ask you a question directly and make up my mind. It's a long story so I want to say to you "Thanks in advance" for read my message.</p>
<p>Please take note I am not a native english speaker, but I have english knowledge. I will try to explain my situation the best I can. Sorry if I make grammar mistakes or if I make sentences without so much sense.</p>
<p>I am a new user of XBL. My account was created last Monday (06/22/2015) . I needed to call the XBL customer service here in Spain , whose telephone number is 900 948 952 because I had issues to connect my Xbox 360 to Internet. They assisted me the best they
 can and also they offered to help me in my account creation . Finally I could connect my console to Internet.</p>
<p>Because of they offered to assist me, I wanted to confirm that all my data was correct. They confirmed me that indeed all data was correct and that I was prepared to enjoy XBL service from now on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am very excited because in my opinion, I realized that is the BEST place to play. Many many reasons: customer care, the way that XBL deals with cheaters, our politics... In short. ALL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because I am literally a newbie here, I had an issue with my account. I was checking all the options that XBL service offer to their users and I wanted to check out the "Cloud storage" . Because of I had no idea about how the system works, I uploaded and
 deleted around 5 times the data of my first game (Lost Planet 2) and I checked out the option works excellent.</p>
<p>Then I called again Xbox Live customer service to have more references about "Cloud Storage" and they say me all the data is stored in Microsoft servers, so I can't lose any data. 15 minutes later I was worried because of that constants uploads and deletes.
 I am a perfectionist person and I read "Terms of Use" , "Code of Conduct" and "Console Ban" texts in enterity before accept.</p>
<p>Here I have a statement that I got of the terms of use that made me think about this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Damage, disable, overburden, or impair the Services (or any network or Authorized Device connected to the Services</strong>)
</li></ul>
<p>Because of that, I was worried about the word "Overburden" , considering the actions that I did previously (those constants uploads and deletes) , so I called so many times XBL customer service and I used the online chat feature here on this web. All of
 them said me that I do not need to worry because this is a feature that Microsoft offers to their users and as a user, you have free to manage this. (In the MOST professional way that I have ever seen, I am just AMAZED with your Customer Service, they even
 send me a link to Enforcement page to check out all the things that could make you get an account suspension)</p>
<p>The point is I am a hardcore gamer, so I give the word "Gaming" and all things connected like this (accounts) a huge importance.</p>
<p>Due to I called customer service so many times and they opened a lot of incidences and also I was very repetitive in each call asking about this (I asked the employee in the last call 3 times if that action could make me my account suspended because of the
 obsessive importance that I give to all things connected with Gaming like I previously said to you) . I know that this does not make sense but I can't avoid to think that my account is not &nbsp;"100% safe" . I started my way on XBL on Monday, I only have 180G
 and I wouldn't mind to cancel this account and make another. I read this on Terms of Use:</p>
<p><b>6.10.&nbsp;</b><b>Canceling the Services.&nbsp;</b>You may cancel the Services at any time, with or without cause. Information and direction on how to cancel your Services is provided on the Billing and Account Management website
<strong>&nbsp;[(ii) you may be obligated to pay cancellation charges]</strong></p>
<p>Am I forced to pay these charges? I only have a Xbox Live Gold Membership associated with my account. I know that you are not able to tranfer your Xbox Live Gold membership from an account to another.&nbsp;I would not mind buying it again and ensure my complete
 tranquility.</p>
<p>But now I have 4 questions:</p>
<p>1- If I cancel my account I lose my right to access Xbox Live forever with this system, as if it were a ban or can I regain access to the services with a new account? .</p>
<p>2- If I can make another here is a statement which has massive importance (I read this in the Code of Conduct)&nbsp;<strong>Trying to avoid suspension by creating alternate new accounts may result in the permanent suspension of the new user account and a possible
 escalation of punishment to the original account, all related accounts and any device you are using to connect to the service.</strong></p>
<p>Do I need to send proofs or something else or the enforcement team will check out this account and all the activity to ensure that I didn't do anything that can be against the rules?</p>
<p>3-&nbsp;&nbsp;Can Microsoft ban my new account for taking the decision to create it in my desire for perfection (the customer service didn't recommend me to do this) or as set out in 6.10 of the usage rules I have full right to do this with or without cause?</p>
<p>4-&nbsp;<span>If I</span>&nbsp;do the order to cancel my account , XBL does not remove the account permanently until 60 days after. Is it possible to register a new account with a different email but again containing all personal data that this account
 has (which is previously shut down) or should I wait 60 days because of data coincidences (something like multiples accounts detected on the system) ? .</p>
<p>I would call again customer service to assist me in my acount cancellation and I would give them the new e-mail associated with my new account if it's necessary to prove that I am not trying to make a new account in order to avoid a suspension like I previously
 said. They would have my credentials, but this time without a bunch of incidences related with the same problem and right now that I know how to use perfectly the services I would finally rest completely assured.</p>
<p>Thanks A LOT again to take your time to read this huge message.</p>
<p>I wait patiently your reply</p>

<p>Greetings and have a nice day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Yes you can create another account and use Live on the same console </p>
<p>2. That is in reference to if youhave been banned already on one account and are trying to create new accounts to dodge the first ban. That has nothing to do with your situation.</p>
<p>3. No. They will not ban you for creating a new account </p>

    <title>Bluetooth auto-transfer of files in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevincurl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth auto-transfer of files in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    It seems to send/receive files in Windows 10 via bluetooth you now have to manually click through a series of steps to send/receive files between devices (such as a phone) individually, and acknowledge the file name and location as well.&nbsp; Is there a way
 to set this process up automatically for known/paired devices as was the case in previous OS?&nbsp; This is extremely frustrating and counter-productive, making bluetooth almost worthless.

            <p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Bluetooth transfer file workflow has changed with Windows 10.&nbsp; To transfer files, you must&nbsp;send and&nbsp;receive each file.&nbsp; What you are seeing is the way it currently works.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide feedback on your experience in the Windows Feedback app.&nbsp; This will make sure that we work on what is most important to our users.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Explorer photo thumbnails will not refresh when moving photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jr1971  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Explorer photo thumbnails will not refresh when moving photos from one folder to another.</h2>
                    
<p><span>Recently I decided to organize my photos a little better. So I created folders for each year and month for all my photos to be organized
 in. Then I began to move the photos. However, when I moved the files/photos from one folder to another the icons for the files would not refresh on the screen while using windows explorer.&nbsp; As it turns out the only way to get it to refresh is to click to another
 fold and come back or press F5 to refresh. Under normal circumstance I would expect the icon to disappear once the file is moved. I have already tried deleting the thumbnail cache and it worked for a few movements but then I was right back in the same situation.
 I haven't seen this problem for windows 7 so I figured I would post it. There are tons of posts out there about this put not for windows 7. The VISTA hot fix for this also does not apply. Suggestions?</span></p>

<p>Hi JR1971,</p>
<p>I tried to reproduce the scenario here on a Windows 7 machine. I tried copying a picture to the desktop and it was displayed there without needing a ârefreshâ. I wasnât able to reproduce the issue.</p>
<p>For now I would suggest you to boot into safe mode and try repeating the same and check if the issue repeats or not.<br />
Safe mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state.</p>
<p>Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words Safe Mode appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps to boot into safe mode with networking:</p>
<p>1. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.<br />
2. Select Safe Mode option when the Advanced startuo Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more details:</p>
<p>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>Let us know if the issue recurs in safe mode or not. We shall proceed with the troubleshooting accordingly.<br />

<p><span>Varun,
<br />
I'll try safemode as you indicated. However, I will note that the problem does not seem to be present on the desktop itself.&nbsp; Only in the folder I am moving from. MSCONFIG also does not work in this case. I have removed all non-Microsoft services and startups
 and no help there. Safe mode&nbsp;IS a pretty good option though and will eliminate the video driver as a possibility. I'll let you know how it turns out. Probably take a day or two to get back to it. Thanks for the recommendation.<br />

Not sure if this is due to a Corrupt profile and another thing is that I roughly read through your post.

In addition, you must open two windows in order to move files to new directories. Why on earth file explorer was updated to be worse than the old version is beyond me. It really is cumbersome. A total pain in the neck. I hate it.

<p>
</p><p>TIP =&gt; Ideally, you would never, <em>EVER </em>use System Restore to "undo" an update, Service Pack, or IE upgrade (which often leaves the system in a "confused" or "torn" state)! Instead, uninstall the update, Service Pack, and/or IE upgrade &amp; reboot. If
 that doesn't correct the problem, <em>then </em>try System Restore.</p>

            First off welcome to the x family lol I love my onex. But yeah that stinks not having a game transfer over that youve already paid for. My first recomendation would be to make sure to check under My Games And Apps and look in the Ready to install tab.
 If you've already done this let me know. Because I had same thing happen with my dlc for fallout 4 (i have the physical disc) but when I switched consoles i had issue with getting my dlc to play and it turned out it was hiding in the ready to install section.&nbsp;

    <title>Can you access cortana without it opening&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can you access cortana without it opening&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I often play games in fullscreenmode, so it takes quite a bit of time and it can be rather annoying for cortana to open, if all i want to do is make it change song, play a certain song, etc, on spotify.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i say "Hey Cortana" and Cortana respons, it will open the search tab for cortana and tab me out of the game. Is this possible to disable?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you access Cortana via "Hey Cortana" voice command, a small window will pop-up which you can use to search something by typing in the widow or by using another voice command. It is the design of Cortana in Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, are you playing games which were downloaded from the Windows Store, or are you playing games that you've installed using an installation disc or games that you've downloaded on an online store? Also, what do you mean by "it will open the
 search tab for cortana and tab me out of the game"? Does the game in full screen mode minimizes when you access Cortana using a voice command?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're playing Windows Store games, they will not be tabbed out when you use the "Hey Cortana" voice command. They will continue to run without tabbing out because these kind of applications are designed to work seamlessly with the other features of Windows
 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're playing games that you've installed using an installation disc or games the were purchased from an online store, these application will be tabbed out when you access Cortana using voice command. They will be tabbed out because you're instructing
 the computer to run a new application which is Cortana. When running these kind of games, Windows 10 is treating them as a whole process. Windows 10 will tab out the game in full screen mode to give way to the new process which is the Cortana search function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional question, kindly reply to this thread.</p>

<h2>            I have Linux installed.  I want to dual boot with Windows 7.</h2>
                    It is easy to dual boot with Linux, if Windows is installed first (at least with XP and Vista).&nbsp; I have system with Linux installed already in a couple of ext3 partitions.&nbsp; I want to install Windows 7 (using purchased install media) in a free partition
 which is not the first partition. and which is formatted to NTFS.&nbsp; But I do not want to disturb the existing Linux install.&nbsp; What is the best way to do this.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have searched for help in this matter...while plenty of support exist for dual booting from a pre-existing Windows install...<br />

<h2>            Clock time is off by 7 hours</h2>
                    <p>I have more than one computer which I have updated to Windows 10 and two of them, maybe more, keep jumping ahead by seven hours on the time. When I notice the time is ahead by seven hours, I reset it and some time later it will be ahead by seven hours again.
 I also have Ubuntu 14.04.4 on these same computers and the time is correct when using Ubuntu. I am in the Pacific Time Zone and that is&nbsp;selected correctly.&nbsp;Does anyone know why my Windows 10 computers are doing this and how I can correct the problem?</p>

<p>hello !</p>
<p>you should format it back to NTFS ! a 320GB partition can give problems with FAT32. you can either make multiple partitions or try reverting back to NTFS or if you are using Windows 7 try right<strong>click computer -&gt; manage -&gt; disk management</strong>
 -&gt; now check if your disk is&nbsp;there.&nbsp; you can also use exfat.</p>

<h2>            Split audio output Realtek HD Audio</h2>
                    I would like to get music through my speakers and gaming sound through my headphones. I already checked the box "Make front and rear output devices playback two different audio streams simultaneously". But I can't get it to work. I can check my headphones
 or speakers in general, but that makes all the sound goes through one output device.

    <title>Stop, skip, and back MCE Commands not working in Windows 7 Media - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wilky13  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop, skip, and back MCE Commands not working in Windows 7 Media Center</h2>
                    <p>I have a home built HTPC with Gigabyte GA-Z68MA-D2H-B3 motherboard with i3-2100 CPU, running Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I have three different input devices:
</p>
<p>1) Logitech MK320 bluetooth keyboard and seperate&nbsp;mouse</p>
<p>2) Lenovo N5902 bluetooth keyboard/mouse remote</p>
<p>3) Logitech Harmony 890 remote which interacts with the HTPC via a HP USB MCE IR Wireless Receiver (used for almost 95% of all applications)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been running Windows Media Center (WMC) for 1 year now through the HTPC for&nbsp;LiveTV, Music and RecordedTV.&nbsp; I also use the Netflix&nbsp;plug-in and I have Media Browser (MB) for playing all my movies.&nbsp; Everything was working perfect and then about 2 months
 ago STOP, SKIP, and REPLAY stopped working on the Harmony remote.&nbsp; I've done some extensive troubleshooting and found the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) If I reboot the machine, <em>sometimes</em> the STOP, SKIP and REPLAY buttons on the Harmony and Lenovo work for a while, but eventually (maybe 15-30 minutes later they will stop working), closing WMC and restarting WMC has no effect.</p>
<p>2) When the STOP, SKIP, REPLAY buttons are not working, every other command still works (PAUSE, PLAY, FFW, REW, REC, EXIT, etc.).</p>
<p>3) When the 3 buttons stop working on the Harmony they also stop working on the Lenovo, however hitting CTRL+B (REPLAY), CTRL+F (SKIP), and CTRL+SHIFT+S (STOP) on the MK320 or Lenovo still properly executes those commands.&nbsp; Also, using the mouse and clicking
 the STOP, SKIP or REPLAY button at the bottom right of WMC still executes those commands.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>1) It is not the USB&nbsp;IR Wireless Receiver or Harmony Remote, because the bluetooth Lenovo also stops working.&nbsp; The Hid drivers for the IR Receiver and Bluetooth dongles are all up to date.</p>
<p>2) The problem lies within Windows.&nbsp; Perhaps the registry?&nbsp; I have installed and uninstalled several programs on this HTPC.&nbsp; I've used CCleaner and Registry Defrag with no help.&nbsp; I am sure doing a complete clean install will fix the issue, but I'd like to
 avoid that if at all possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone have a solution or seen this problem before?&nbsp; If not, can someone atleast point me to the Registry keys for these 3 actions and what they "should" be?&nbsp; Maybe I can pinpoint a difference.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Problem Solved!!</p>
<p>Leave it to Apple to mess up your Windows PC!!</p>
<p>I had iTunes running minimized to the taskbar so I could use the "Remote" App on my iPad and iPhone to play music on the HTPC. Well, iTunes was hijacking the STOP, SKIP, and REPLAY MCE Commands. Once I closed iTunes, everything worked fine. Freaking Apple
 products, urghh!!!</p>

<h2>            Creating hotspot causes systemsettings.exe to crash</h2>
                    I am attempting to create a hotspot via my mobile broadband connection in Windows 8.1. &nbsp;After entering PC settings, and selecting Network, my mobile broadband connection is listed at the top. &nbsp;However when I select it, the screen drops back to the start
 screen. &nbsp;The application log in the event viewer reports the following:

            Hi Ganesh, thanks for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>Answers to your questions:</div>
<div>1. &nbsp;No third party tool. &nbsp;Am using the (new) built in ability to share mobile broadband to create a hotspot in Windows 8.1.</div>
<div>2. &nbsp;Using PC Settings, Network in the metro interface. &nbsp;Best example of the steps I'm following is this video:&nbsp;https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=3&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CD4QtwIwAg&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrQN8TBcatxo&amp;ei=hjljUrLTOs-PiAfln4HIDg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEo8KCase_l6at2-0b6dop-WUbUvA&amp;sig2=7Gx3XP8MAZbA_tC0vadNSg&amp;bvm=bv.54934254,d.aGc</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried your suggestion, and created a new local account on the machine, logged in and tried the same steps to create the hotspot, but the settings interface crashed again, returning me to start, and creating the same error in the application event logs.
 &nbsp;As further information, I am using a Sierra Wireless 4G USB dongle, which is running latest drivers, and latest version of software (checked after the upgrade to Windows 8.1.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other ideas?</div>
<div>Thanks again</div>
<div>Benn</div>
