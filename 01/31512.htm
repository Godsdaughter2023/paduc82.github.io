            <p>I am having the same issue. We've been using Windows Live mail with Godaddy for three years without a problem and all of a sudden yesterday we received the error message that the server could not be found. With the help of the godaddy online support, we
 removed and re-added our account and changed from pop to imap settings- ensured that the port numbers are correct (we use SSL, 465 for outgoing and 993 for incoming. Now, I don't receive an error message, only the mail I try to send out sits in the outbox
 and never moves to the sent folder. I'm receiving messages just fine. I've done all the suggestions earlier in this post... I have no idea what to do from here.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your cooperation. From the information you've provided, you might need to upgrade to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Live Mail latest version which is 2012</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you've mentioned: </p>
<p><em>When we are trying to send, the log in screen pops up again and asks us to input the username/password. When we put the information in and hit ok, it continues to pop up as if we've not entered anything or the information is wrong but it's not. We're
 using the exact same log in as the online version of the godaddy.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be caused by additional security code for your account or domain name. Have you tried contacting your domain administrator for this issue? If you are the domain administrator, have you contacted your domain registrar for this settings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you an idea, we at Microsoft uses additional security code which is the Two-Step Verification. If we enabled it, we would need to create an app password to access email programs such as Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this didn't work, you may try these steps for possible resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>.</p>
<p>2. On the <em>Servers</em> tab, ensure that <em>My server requires authentication</em> is selected.</p>
<p>3<em>. </em>On the <em>Advanced </em>tab, ensure that the server port for outgoing mail is 587.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how things turn out!</p>
<p>

<p>Helene C.</p>

<h2>            DMA mode and no channels</h2>
                    How do I enable &nbsp;disenable DMA mode. According to all the forums I have read, in device manager, I should have channels available under the IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers. I only have one item listed under that, it is: Intel(R) 5 Series 4 Port SATA AHCI Controllernable
 or disenable DMS?

<p>
</p><p>1) Which version of Windows 10 professional is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to install the Windows XP mode on Windows 10, then you can do it by using Hyper-V functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have Hyper-v then your computer should be 64-bit version and you should enable Hyper-v option from Windows features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more information, you can post your query in Windows TechNet forums for further assistance.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 ASUS, blank screen when waking up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angusjk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 ASUS, blank screen when waking up</h2>
                    <p>Computer works fine and goes to sleep fine, however on attempted restart, the laptop fires up, beeps, but the screen stays black. This results in the only thing i can do is hold power button to restart, in which the computer then turns on fine. This has
 happened every single day for the past few weeks, not sure what has caused it.&nbsp;Such a waste of time to have to do this every single morning.&nbsp; Ive tried most of the suggested fixes but none seem to work. I cannot update or roll back any of the graphic drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS X555UJ, Intel HD Graphics 520 and NVIDIA GeForce 920M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bought Brand New approx March 2016 from local PC shop, have had no other troubles with it. Windows 10 pre-installed.</p>
<p>Has had McAfee, but not removal tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows version 1703 (OS Build 15063.726)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have tried the following:</p>
<p>Fiddling with sleep time settings, and disabling hibernation.</p>
<p>Disabling IMEI driver</p>
<p>Have attempted to update drivers but no luck. Cannot roll back either.</p>

<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />4. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />5. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

            What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<p>@Gypsy...believe it or not, the ball is in HBO's court. It is their perogative as to how, where, if, and/or when to release their app. Microsoft does not own Netflix, HBO, Hulu, Starz, USA, Xfinity, etc. MS can approve their app when they (or the software
 company they hired) submit an app.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 logging to temporary profile</h2>
                    I tried to fix my computer but I made it worse. See I messed up when windows was updating to 8.1 in which I thought froze but it went back to 8 and was just a temporary profile. I tried to fix it by what everyone said on the discussions but now I can't
 access my account or even create a new one. In fact I'm stuck on Administrator and the metro stuff is gone. Someone please help.

            <p>Typically this would be a Wifi driver issue. Check with your manufacturer for updated drivers for Windows 8.1. If the newest drivers do not work, you can install Windows 7 drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When you say that you have internet access, do you mean that you have internet access through a wired connection or that you have internet access even though the wifi is not listed as connected?</p>

<div><br />
<div>I have tried with the updated driver from the manufacturer, though it is not able to solve the problem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And regarding the internet access through WIFI, it is showing that connections are available but no internet&nbsp;access..!!!</div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>Moreover, it is not even showing the connection name or signal regarding the availability.

            Windows wants to blame everyone but themselves for all their software issues.&nbsp; This is a problem with Windows 8 and up and not a driver issue.&nbsp; It looks like windows gets confused with Cisco wifi and similar.&nbsp; Updates are not fixing the problem and it
 is an issue for most people with Windows 8 and above.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't like to take blame and wont likely accept this reply even because of how messed up they are.

    <title>Windows Folder Icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jmg_bck  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Folder Icons</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I am wondering why I see different folder icons in my windows installations. I have windows 10 home installed on my desktop and windows 10 pro installed on a laptop. Both of these are relatively new, with no customization and are up to date. In addition I verified
 that the folder settings are identical on both machines.&nbsp; I would prefer they both look like the one labeled Desktop below. Here are some screenshots.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any help<br />
<br />

            Hi Jmg, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />I'll give you a couple steps to see if you can get the icons back to how they should appear:
<br />
<br />- On your laptop, click Start and type Themes.
<br />- Click the result named "Themes and related settings"
<br />- Under "Apply a theme", click on "Windows".
<br />- See if the icons change to the right ones.
<br />- If not, try the theme entitled "Windows 10"
<br />- Check the icons again.
<br />
<br />If they still don't change to the right ones, you can check what version of Windows 10 you're running by searching Start for "winver" and running that command. Compare that to your desktop to see if there's a version difference.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know how you go!

            Hi JMG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you're referring to how the folders appear under OneDrive, they will not have the shell User folder insignia unless you move them into OneDrive using Folder Protection which is explained here:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn-off-folder-protection-onedrive-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/116029-turn...</a>
<br />
<br />If that's not what you're referring to, please clarify so we can help you better.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Graeme, <br />
<br />
Thank you or your advice.&nbsp;I tried the options you gave and&nbsp;neither change the icons. However, there is indeed a version difference (thanks for that tip):<br />
<div><br />
Desktop: Version 1809 OS build 17763.379</div>
<div>Laptop: Version 1803 OS build 17134.648</div>
<div><br />
If that's the issue I'm not really sure what to do about it since they are&nbsp;both respectively all up-to-date according to the system. I do find it a bit odd that the folder icons would change with the with new version.&nbsp;And I guess I really mostly want to understand
 why they are different.

            Greg,<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for responding I put OneDrive in the screenshot because those have the same structure on each computer and I thought that would be clearer, not because of OneDrive per se. All the folders on the laptop have that "open" look and all the folders
 on the desktop have what I would call a "closed" look. And the icons for all the other shortcuts, "Folders", "Documents", etc. look quite different.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for the link. I'm not familiar with Folder Protection and will give it a read to see if that is the issue.

            I believe some PCs are updated before or after others due to hardware differences, but I wouldn't know exactly what the difference would be in your case I'm sorry!
<br />
<br />You could try resetting the Windows Update components manually, which might trigger the laptop to update to the same version as your desktop. Here is a tutorial on how to do it:

            What version of Windows are you using?<br />
What file types are you including?<br />
Was this working normally in the past?<br />
<br />
You may try putting the computer in a clean startup and try again to see if another program is interfering.<br />

In addition, if this was working previously, you may try a system restore.<br />

<p>Hello Julie</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer, I am not sure which Skype version it was. I uninstalled it and I have tried the Beta version in the Play store. It working better now. The problem was that I could not get the mic working with Skype. And all other applications works
 good, like Messenger Google now etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet it is brand new and it is with android 7.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again and have a great day.</p>

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers latetly - check in Control Panel -<br />
Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below<br />
and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can<br />
cause this error.<br />
<br />
Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's&nbsp;Support as there could be known<br />
issues -&nbsp;also check in their forums.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode : 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116</strong><br />
<br />
The VIDEO_TDR_ ERROR bug check has a value of 0x00000116. This indicates that an attempt<br />
to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed. <br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116&nbsp; &lt;-- read this<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/Attempt-to-reset-the-display-driver-and-recover-from-0x00000116-*1275.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.faultwire.com/solutions-fatal_error/Attempt-to-reset-the-display-driver-and-recover-from-0x00000116-*1275.html</span></a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The inclusion the 116 error code in the troubleshooter is only coincidence and holds no specific<br />
meaning (other than driver caused bluescreens do occur with some frequency).<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />
<a href="http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.computerperformance.co.uk/vista/vista_event_viewer.htm</span></a><br />

-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />

Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Play and Charge Kit doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;don't know what's wrong with the Play and Charge Kit, but my Xbox One Controller doesn't charge. If i plug the controller on the pc (with the cable from the play and charge kit) i can play perfect. But when i unplug the controller (after 2 hours of "charging"), the controller turns off in about 20 seconds. And i noticed, the led doesn't work anymore. On the first day when i tried the play and charge kit, everything worked fine (the led too).</p><p>And what i can't believe: I bought&nbsp;the controller and the play and charge kit not&nbsp;even 2 months ago!</p><p><br /></p><p>(I also tried to put batteries in the controller, and everything worked fine)</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            MWSnap 3.0.0.74 won&#39;t load in W7Pro</h2>
                    <p>I've been using this tool for years (mwsnap.exe, http://www.mirekw.com/winfreeware/mwsnap.html) and when I upgraded to W7P, it worked just as it had otherwise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until now. &nbsp;It worked this morning, and won't, now. Uninstall and reinstall, and then applying XP(SP3) rules didn't make it come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I was able to start it - once, but it disappeared after a couple of minutes, before I'd gotten the screen I wanted to capture up/available.</p>

            <p>As for your screen capture, use the built-in snipping tool that comes with Win7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press WinKey + R</p>
<p>Type 'snippingtool.exe' (no quotes)</p>
<p>Press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can take your screen capture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for MWSnap, Use your search engine to find either their forums or a solution.</p>

<p>
</p><p>A few days ago, I use the backup tool in Win10.....<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">create a system image</span></strong> and save d that to my external hard drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not opt to create a system repair disc.......aarghhh.....should have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At startup I pressed f12 and tried to boot from USB external drive, but it just sits on that black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't locate the disc that came with it the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How bad is it........?</p>

<p>
</p><p>So somehow the win 10 OS got confused or HD got scrambled a little.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The above link says I will need my win 10 product key, which I don't have. Can I skip that during install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 14gb of data I have from win 10 when I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>created a system image , </strong></span>does that not house the product key somewhere. Can I don use this data to restore my system?</p>

            <p>That is exactly what am doing......<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>&gt;<strong>Advanced Options</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I get a message "Windows cannot find a system image on this computer.&nbsp; Attach the backup hard disk or insert the final DVD from a bckup set and click retry.&nbsp; Alternatively, close this dialog for more options.&nbsp; Retry gives me the same message.&nbsp; Tried
 starting with drive attached, not attached, same result.&nbsp; Click cancel.</p>
<p>Next option selected is "Select a system image."&nbsp; No system image listed.&nbsp; Hit refresh, still nothing.&nbsp; Top of screen says "Click Advanced to add a network location or install a driver for a backup device if it does not show up in the list below."&nbsp; I click
 on the Advanced tab.&nbsp; Option to "Search for a system image on the network" or "Install a driver."&nbsp; I select install a driver.&nbsp; Find the right driver for the&nbsp;Seagate HD&nbsp;and when I click on them I get "The specified location does not contain information about
 your hardware."&nbsp; Click OK.&nbsp; Can't find how to load these drivers I am being asked for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing is that on the screen where I search for driver I can see the external HD connected to the system.&nbsp; I can also see the system image files but when I click on them I get the same error message, "The specified location does not contain information

<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>The 1st 2 replies in this&nbsp;link below&nbsp;have a lot of good info, but still not able to see the system image. Not sure what the 1st reply is meant to accomplish. I did what it says, I see the external drive via the command prompt, but then what do I do?</p>

    <title>Windows Connect and WiFi Network Conflict - Windows 10 Laptop can no - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardwilliamszg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Connect and WiFi Network Conflict - Windows 10 Laptop can no longer find Epson SX535 AllInOne Printer</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo G50 laptop which was upgraded to Windows 10 about a year ago. For about 6 months after the upgrade to Windows 10 there was no problem in using the printer (Epson SX535 WD - WIFI printer/scanner/copier). However around 4 months ago the laptop
 stopped being able to find the printer over WIFI. I now get a message saying there is a conflict between Windows Connect and the WIFI network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's windows 10 laptop has no problem finding the printer, and I can find it on a Android Tablet, and on a Windows 7 laptop, and even on a friend's XP laptop.
</p>
<p>I can also find the Epson Scanner which is part of the same machine from my laptop. The drivers for the printer are up to date!</p>
<p>
</p><p>From searching on the internet I can see that this problem with Windows 10 is quite common, but there do not seem to be any solutions, apart from blaming the printer's manufacturers, which is obviously rubbish, as my wife's Windows 10 laptop does not have
 the problem, and mine can find the Scanner, which is part of the same printer, and a few months ago I did not have the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anybody from Microsoft or anybody else actually have a real solution to this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community and being a part of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in accessing the printer on your device. Do not worry we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know the complete error code/ error message of this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have occurred due to corrupted/ outdated printer drivers and services. Try the below troubleshooting steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong>If the device is not detected on your computer try to&nbsp;run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hardware and Devices troubleshooter
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">checks for common problems and makes sure that any new device or hardware connected to your PC is installed correctly.</span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows
</strong>key from the keyboard, type <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>and select it.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>view all</strong> option on the upper left corner of

</strong>options from the list.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click Next to run the
<strong>Hardware and Device </strong>Troubleshooter.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>I suggest you to check the status&nbsp;of
<strong>Print Spooler service </strong>and check.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Print Spooler service</span></strong><span>, spools print service and handles interactions with the printer.
</span></span></span><span><span>If you turn off this&nbsp;service you won’t be able to print or see your printer.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Steps: </span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>to open <strong>Run </strong>command, type
<strong>Services.msc </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Search for <strong>Printer Spooler</strong><strong> service</strong>, right click on it and
<strong>Start </strong>the service.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Also, set the <strong>Startup type </strong>to <strong>Automatic</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Now check if you are able to install the driver.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>I suggest you to run the printer troubleshooter on your device and check if it helps.</p>

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you very much for your speedy reply. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately I have seen these suggestions as solutions before from Microsoft. I have done these things before, and have done so just now again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These trouble shooters cannot detect the problem. See at bottom of reply for one of these reports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today I cannot get the error message to appear, it just won’t find the printer via wifi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I have got a error message, it is of the form <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Conflict found: Windows Connect Now and Wi-Fi Access Point are on different Wi-Fi channels. Performance might be degraded.</span>, there was no error number.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everything involved in this is up to date, the printer drivers, and Windows Updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I said originally, </p>
<p>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>the laptop can find the same device as a scanner (via WiFi or directly by cable) &nbsp;but not as a printer.</p>
<p>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>My wife’s laptop (Windows 10) has no problem with the WiFi printer</p>
<p>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If I connect it by cable to the laptop, there is no problem, it is a problem via WiFI on this laptop.</p>
<p>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I used to have no problem with accessing the WiFi printer under Windows 10 until around December or January 2015-16.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">I have seen your suggested solutions before as answers to other people with similar problems with WiFI printers on Windows 10. I have also seen in further comments on the same pages, that these solutions do not solve the problem.
 Nor do they solve my problem.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">I assume what has happened to my machine and to several other peoples, is that one of the Windows Updates has screwed it up.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">Additional information.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">The ISP is Virgin, so there is a relatively new Virgin router( but older than the laptops) attached to that is a Belkin WiFI, and in addition there is a Netgear WiFi booster. The printer is on the booster version of the network
 as are all of the computers I have mentioned.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">The laptop a Lenovo G50, is just over a year old, it came with Windows 8, and around a year ago I upgraded it to Windows 10, without any obvious problems. The laptop has the McAfee security system on it, as supplied by the manufacturer.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">Have a look at this, have you ever seen this sort of thing before? I suspect that this type of problem happened about the same time as the WiFi problem with the printer.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">Something has screwed up the Tile for the Windows Store (and any other way of firing that app up) and several other things too.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">This is another problem which is quite easy to find complaints about it on the Internet, but no solutions seems to exist as far as I can see. ( I can get round all this group of problems).
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95d21bc4-514a-4796-9e92-729d9d95a04c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95d21bc4-514a-4796-9e92-729d9d95a04c" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">The result is when you click on any of these tiles/links whatever you want to call them for the window store (and some other things), you get this for a few seconds, then it does away and nothing happens.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b8f63f0-dacc-4ab4-a39d-596807a4f296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b8f63f0-dacc-4ab4-a39d-596807a4f296" /></a></p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">System Restore</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">I thought a System Restore might help, but it won’t</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">As you can see the available restore points cannot help, as the problem is older than late April 2016.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">There used to be more, but they seem to have gone walkies, that seems to be another known problem with Windows 10.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 18pt"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee2dda90-e6d8-4ebb-bbde-309674716f9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ee2dda90-e6d8-4ebb-bbde-309674716f9a" /></a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you’re unable to login using Microsoft account after updates. Let me ask you couple of questions before we proceed.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Could you login using live account and access emails from another computer?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the exact error message?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you remember what is the exact KB# of the update?</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you’ve have any other account on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s restore the computer’s settings to a date and time when it was working fine earlier through Windows 8 installation disc.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Insert the “Windows 8 disc”.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the language and click “Next”.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Accept the “terms and conditions”.</p>

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click “Advanced Options” and select “System Restore”.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Follow the “on-screen instructions”.</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I have a similar problem. I recently purchased a HP Pavilion m7-1015dx entertainment PC (Notebook) with Window 7 home Premium. I took advantage of the Windows 8 Professional Upgrade Promo. I upgrade from the Net, so I do not have the Installation CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything worked fine until this evening. Because Windows 8 comes with a generic audio driver, I decided to visit the HP Software Store and downloaded, IDT (I think) Audio Drivers. After the install, I was instructed to restart the notebook. I went to
 log in and was informed that I had entered the wrong password. As the original poster did, I attempted numerous times. My original password was all numeric, 8 digits. I was informed by a message below the password field that I could visit the accounts.live/password/reset
 site. I attempted to reset to the password that I had been using, but discovered that Windows Live no longer accepts number only passwords. I reset the password following the rule suggested. I attempted to logon again, with no luck.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I thought I could do a system restore, but I cannot interrupt the boot process. It appears that HP set the default to Fast Boot, and when I attempt to press F2, F8, or F12, the notebook begins to beep really loud.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please help me regain control of my laptop. Up to this point, I was ready to brag about Windows 8, Windows Live, and Outlook, but not now. Please help me</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you.</div>

            I actually took it back to bestbuy.. My dell does not come with a windows disk.. They did not understand what had happened. (They Think im stupid and couldnt remember my password or follow the on screen instructions) so they did reset on it. But i refused,
 and got a new one. So far no problems.

            I am currently communicating with a MS MVP and he is suggesting a re-install. I do know that MS previously permitted numeric only passwords but now they do not. This is as recent as a week ago that they did. I tried to do a reset but my HP machine had
 the Secure Boot on by default.
<div><br />
<div>I will likely take it back to Best Buy tomorrow to do a reset. If the MS MVP informs me of the same thing, I will return and provide a favorable vote. If I learn of a work-around, I will inform the community.</div>

            Hello Again,
<div><br />
<div>Finally, after many&nbsp;aggravating hours, albeit partly due to bad eyesight, I finally discovered how to recover without professional (ha ha) intervention.&nbsp;I did speak with two Microsoft (hereinafter MS) MVP's, neither of which could assist. I would say there
 is about 4 man hours involved in that respect. Neither could understand why I could not log on to my Computer after resetting the password to my Windows Live Accounts.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It appears to me, that MS very recently updated their Password Protocol. No longer can it be just numeric, as I have for some time, and now requires a combination of letters and numbers and or symbols, case sensitive. Somewhere a link between the Live
 Account and the Computer User Account Manager was destroyed. I must also say, the one thing that I did do, just prior to losing control to my machine, being an HP Pavilion m7-1015dx Entertainment PC (Notebook), is that I download from the HP Software Store
 a replacement Audio Driver that was said to be compatible with Windows 8. When I was asked to restart the Computer, as is typical when a new driver is installed, I could not log on after the restart. It is quite possible the Driver caused an integrity issue
 with the OS.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I must also say, that I had purchased the machine Out-of-Box, off the shelf, at Best Buy. I did not purchase the Geek Squad Package, as I never used it on the last machine that I purchased there. I did take it back to Best Buy last evening to do a System
 Restore, as I could not interrupt the Boot process by following all the Online Forum Suggestions (Shift+F8). Windows 8 is a Secure, and Fast, Boot process. After I was billed for the service, they then informed me that it could take upwards of several days,
 and I said that is&nbsp;ridiculous. I am IT (A+) Certified through Windows 7 Professional. I have never not been able to repair any of my own machines. As I speaking to the Technician, I noticed that he had already entered the HP System Restore Manager. I asked
 him what the key combination was and he said Shift-F8, and I disagreed. He said it was all in the timing. I told him to stop the service and refund my account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Returning home disappointed, I attempted to speak with another MS MVP, to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I performed numerous cold boots, and when I pressed the Shift-F8, or any other key, the alarm went off. I then did a warm boot, and noticed a small sliver of a black line that appeared, that went away just as fast as it appeared. Albeit, eyesight slightly
 impaired, I looked really close on the next warm boot, and behold, press the ESC... Shazam!!! The HP System Manager appeared, that had the expected options available, to which I selected System Restore to the original state. During the process, I was asked
 if I wanted to backup any of the files, yes, and proceeded (make sure you are connected to and external drive). The backup process took awhile, but the System Restore itself took about 35-40 minutes, and returned the machine to its factory state (Windows 7
 Premium). I had already downloaded the Windows 8 ISO Files, and installed the new OS, keeping all my files and settings. The OS Install took about 25 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Two mistakes that I made. 1) I did not create an Admin Account in case I needed to fallback to it. Second, I did not create a System Restore Point after upgrading the machine to Windows 8.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Outside of that, the only other issue is, that Windows 8 does not come with the Wireless LAN Drivers, so you will need to connect via Ethernet LAN, or tether your phone, and download the Drivers to do so. For my HP Machine, I downloaded the RALINK Drivers.
 all works well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope the community finds this helpful.</div>

            <p>same here, the worst scenario was that I was showing my final presentation for my professional degree and my laptop didn't let me check my work because an incorrect password ... a password we all work daily, and desperately a got the wrong password for around
 50 times.</p>
<p><br />
the solution was to use another laptop (wow this tells how great Microsoft luv the users)<br />
<br />
Finally in home, checking the net on my desktop PC, my only choice to get access to my laptop was a reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, the point is that I don't want to be rebooting my laptop time after time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My best bet is to change this horrible OS for the older one Win7 (way better than Win8)</p>

            <p>Hi Gerardo!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How unfortunate it is to discover that your presentation layer isn't functioning at the most inopportune time :/</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will protect yourself by insuring you have a "Local" User Account, as is typical with previous OS's. The mistake with 8 is that it immediately asks you if you want to change it to a Microsoft Account. If I were the developer, and I am&nbsp; but not with OS's,
 I would have counted the number and types of accounts already added to the OS and if there was only one, or there were no Local Accounts with full
<br />
Administrative Privileges, then the option to convert would not be available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I am not quite sure as to why I was unable to log on, I am pretty sure that it was a result of Microsoft changing their password protocol. Previously, while not recommended, all my pwd's were all numbers, that way I could hack them right from the number
 pad.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for restoring the computer, they don't really like to tell us all the little tricks. The advertised method did not work for this laptop, and every other computer I have ever owned used one of the 'F' keys to interrupt the boot process. For this HP Pavilion,
 it is the ESC Key. Having the ability to restore is vital. Also vital,&nbsp;having an external Backup&nbsp;Drive and activating System Restore after the first Boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Win8, I am beginning to like it. It takes time getting used to it. Everything is pretty much the same, but that the Taskbar Start Button was changed into a Page of its own. You can access the typical Admin Options by right clicking the Start Tab at
 the bottom left (run mouse into bottom left corner to activate the start tab, then click your right mouse on it to activate the popup. It is really sensitive, you must click exactly in the corner).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do like the new IE 10, but it has its limitations. Like when listening to music at Pandora and browsing on another page. The music turns off. I do think however that I did see a property somewhere that I could change to enable threading from inactive pages.
 If you like to browse videos, security had been tightened, and only MS signed links will pass through the gateway. I do like this, but if you need to see videos unrestricted, you can click the tool icon on the bottom popup and open on desktop (the typical&nbsp;IE
 8 or 9&nbsp;browser). Personally, I still like Google Chromes speed, so I make it my default browser on occasion and open it in Win8 mode, which removes the Min/Max/Close buttons. I chose a theme that rhymes with Win8 for a pleasant visual experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the current time, I have all my Social sites connected to my Microsoft Account, and that I like. No more subsystems. Microsoft has done a nice job wrapping this up, and continues to collaborate with others to bring them into the Windows Live family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Key Needs from within this thread:</p>
<p>1) ESC interrupts the Boot Sequence to enter the Computer Management Console on the HP Pavilion, not the advertised Shift+F8, in order to do a System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Have an External Backup Device and hopefully you have backed up all your files by this time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Immediately activate System Restore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just cannot see wasting precious hours talking to an MS MVP that has a high level of education but little experience. Do not waste your money taking the computer to the Geek Squad at Best Buy. In addition wasting money, I have witnessed them mistreating
 the computers they are working on in the back room; almost as if they were doing a Samsonite Test!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most people can repair their own computers, it is just a matter of finding the proper help&nbsp;on the Internet.

            <p>thanks for answering. I used the option #3, and I usually do stuff like search or ask to solve the issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But as a costumer this doesn't give me satisfaction, 'cause as one, you expect not to worry about things like this (I know they happen on almost every OS&nbsp;nowdays) but if i'm&nbsp; going to give it as a gift to somebody that doesn't know&nbsp;how to solve this kind
 of issues... it's going to be like the worst gift (and i'm going to give one).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, I think that there's still PC/laptops that sells with Win7 on stores ... and going to find that out for sure, even, as you told, we can search to solve this issues and may be I'm going to change the the win 8 for Win 7 as we know it can do.</p>
<p>This is for faster ways to work with docs...&nbsp; changing apps is for tablets or cell phones (if you ask me).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And again, thanks, it's good to know that we user help each other.</p>

    <title>users cant logon unless they have been given administrator rights - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill4704  say:</h3>
<h2>            users cant logon unless they have been given administrator rights</h2>
                    
<p>After&nbsp;the last windows update, I am the only one that can log on to my user account. All other user accounts that do not have administrator rights can no longer log on. If you attempt to log on to an account that does not have administrator rights it starts
 to log on, then it logs off, and then goes back to the screen were you choose which user you want to log in as. If I give the other user to administrator rights they can log on, and everything seems to work fine.&nbsp; But I don't want to give administrator rights
 to other users just so they can log on (this is a quick and easy way for my kids to mess up my computer).</p>
<p>What can I do to fix this?</p>

<p><span>Hi Bill,</span></p>
<p><span>We usually come across such scenarios:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 after installing updates the security for certain programs get enhanced and it doesn’t allow you to log-in to the user accounts which doesn’t have administrative rights. As a result it will log you off from the user account when you try to log-in to the account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Also,
 it sometimes cause due to virus and malware.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Boot the computer into safe mode and check if you are able to log-in to the standard user accounts. Safe mode will start Windows
 Vista with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs does not run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed, follow the steps to boot the computer in safe mode with networking:</span></p>
<p><span>i. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Start tapping F8 key.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. You will get advanced boot option window.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Select the option “Safe mode”.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com<span>/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t have any problem in safemode, perform clean boot which should resolve the issue. Clean boot will start Windows Vista
 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>1) Perform clean boot (Check the link for performing clean boot).</span></p>
<p><span>2) Enable half of the services.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Determine whether the problem returns.</span></p>
<p><span>4) Enable half of the startup items.</span></p>
<p><span>5) Determine whether the problem returns.</span></p>
<p><span>6) Repeat the above steps until you find out which service or program is causing the issue</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please
 ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the step 7 from the article: How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows7:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></a>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also, run an online virus scan from the link given below. If you have any antivirus software installed on your computer please install
 the latest update for the software so that it works properly.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-nz/default.htm?mkt=en-nz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-nz/default.htm?mkt=en-nz</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong></p>
<p><span>As a test you may also create a new standard account and check if you are able to log-in to the new account.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a user account</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Create-a-user-accou<span>nt</span></span></span></span></a></span></p>

<h2>            Using xbox one controller causes dwm to hang and mouse movement bleeps</h2>
                    <p>Since the last update, every time I play a game with the xbox one wireless controller causes DWM to hang, resulting in me having to force shutdown my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the device manager it clearly shows an exclamation mark "!" on the xinput HID device after usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went as far as doing a reset on Windows 10, however the issue still persists.</p>

            <p>Hello Panda. I had the same problem with little to no help from Microsoft. Their support, needs their own support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that downloading the Xbox accessories app from the windows store and updating my controller through there fixed my issue. If that does not help then I'd go into task manager and kill off the Xbox controller task before unplugging the controller.
 Hope this helps you.</p>

            <span>Hello,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for giving us an opportunity to assist you with the query.</span></p>
<p><span><span>I apologize for the inconvenience caused to you, I realize this may be frustrating.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now that you have me with you let me take care of this. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you have any third party antivirus software installed on the computer?</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>This issue could have occurred due to conflict between third party antivirus software or corrupted system files.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Initially, I suggest you to check if the <strong>Action center</strong> is on, under the option
<strong>Turn system icons on or off.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>Start</strong> menu, type <strong>Turn system icons on or off</strong> in the search bar and click on Turn system icons on or off from the search bar results.</span></li><li><span>Turn the <strong>Action center</strong> on.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Let us try the following steps, and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong><span>: I suggest you to disable the antivirus (third party) software and firewall on the computer as a test and check if that fixes the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong><span>: Antivirus software helps protecting your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software and\or troubleshoot any pertinent issue, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to malware attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer: <strong>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the problem does not exist in safe mode, try to perform a clean boot and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 3: </strong><strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the article How to perform a clean boot in Windows in the below link and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Applies to Windows 10 as well).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section
<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Step 4</span></strong><span>: </span>Let us run <strong>
SFC scan </strong>and see if it&nbsp;brings any difference.</span></span></p>
<p><span>The <strong>sfc /scannow (System File Checker) </strong>command scans all protected system files, and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>X </strong>keys. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click on <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> to bring up an elevated command prompt.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note</strong><span>: Click <strong>
Yes</strong> if it prompts for permission.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the <strong>command prompt</strong> type in the following command and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>

<h2>            No Access to Startscreen</h2>
                    I am unable to access my start screen. My swiping is not working, I am not able to swipe in from the right or switch screens with a swipe from the left. The key on the keyboard doesn't work and neither does the icon on the desktop. When i turn the computer
 on, it goes straight to &nbsp;the desktop. I have tried changing that setting and restarting and it wont work. Any suggestions?

            Before <span><a href="http://www.windowsitpro.com/windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 8</a></span>, resetting a PC was a complex and time-consuming affair. But thanks to Push Button Reset, you can now “nuke it from space,”
 as I think of it, and return the PC to its factory-fresh state in just minutes. Too good to be true? Not at all. In fact, this is one of Windows 8’s best new features.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of what I do for a living, I test a lot of software, and generally beat up my PCs enough that I end up resetting them pretty regularly. Coming into this month, I felt like both of my main-use PCs, an HP tower desktop
 and a Samsung Ultrabook, were in need of a little spring cleaning. And during a recent trip to Microsoft’s Redmond campus, I resolved to nuke the Ultrabook when I got home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doing so is now a lot easier—and less time-consuming—than it used to be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With previous versions of Windows, you had two choices for nuking the PC: You could use the PC maker’s restore routine, either via a built-in partition on the disk or separate optical disc, or you could boot the PC with a Windows
 Setup disk and install a clean version of the OS, albeit one that would probably require some additional driver installation after the fact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though there are exceptions—Lenovo’s ThinkPad PCs are notably clean of crapware, for example, and of course Microsoft Signature PCs are pristine—I’ve generally preferred the latter option in order to ensure that the Windows
 version I’m starting with is the one Microsoft released, and not one over-burdened by unnecessary utilities and applications. But with Windows 8, new options are available under the umbrella of Push Button Reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You won’t see the term Push Button Reset anywhere in Windows 8: That’s what this set of functionality is called internally. Instead, this technology is exposed as two features in the OS, PC Reset (“Remove everything and reinstall
 Windows”) and PC Refresh (“Refresh your PC without affecting your files”). Which you will choose is based on your needs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both offer the same basic functionality: They will remove and then clean install Windows 8 in a very fast manner, returning the OS to its default configuration. (More on that in a moment.) But PC Refresh adds a twist by copying
 your Metro apps, personalizations, and personal files to a temporary location during the process and then returning them to the new Windows install when done.</p>
<p>“Default configuration” varies from PC to PC. If you installed Windows 8 using Microsoft’s installer yourself, you’ll get a base install of Windows 8 as God intended. If you bought a Windows 8-based PC from a PC maker, that default configuration will include
 PC-specific drivers. It can also unfortunately include crapware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a future tip, I’ll explore how you can modify this system image to your needs, but in the meantime remember that the old way of doing things still works. That is, you can reset your PC, remove any crapware, and then backup
 the newly-clean configuration using the old-school backup routine from Windows 7.
<a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-8-tip-use-windows-7-system-image-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 8 Tip: Use Windows 7 System Image Backup</a> explains how.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For whatever reason, I tend to use PC Reset, not PC Refresh. Mulling this over, there’s actually no good reason for this, as I end up repopulating my documents via SkyDrive each time anyway. But either way, the process is the
 same: You can trigger PC Reset or Refresh from the Metro-based PC Settings or via Control Panel. Or if your PC isn’t working, you can use the Recovery environment. (Check out
<a href="http://winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-tip-create-recovery-media-144098" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 8 Tip: Create Recovery Media</a> for information about creating a bootable disc for this purpose, though your Windows 8 Setup media will work too, if you have that.) Since the Metro version is the most obvious, let’s look at that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find the Push Button Reset options in PC Settings under General, near the bottom of the list of options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose the refresh option, you’ll be prompted with an explanation of what’s about to happen. Click through this full-screen notification and Windows will be reinstalled, with your personal data, personalizations, and
 Metro apps all backed up and reapplied to the new install automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The entire process takes just several minutes, though anything added by your PC maker will stretch things out a bit. In a test of my Ultrabook, which was first reset as described below, it took about 10 minutes for the refresh
 process, including moving about 8 GB of data back and forth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you choose to reset, you’ll be prompted with a much shorter explanation as you’re essentially performing a clean install of the OS, or that “nuke from space” scenario I described earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But once you get past that first stage of the wizard, you’re presented with a second option: Do you want to fully clean your drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you’re just resetting the PC for your own use, choose “Just remove my files,” as the process is much faster. The second option, “Fully clean the drive,” is there for when you are giving or selling the PC to someone else and
 you want to ensure that they can’t use a PC forensics utility to mine data off the supposedly erased hard drive. It’s much more time consuming than the first option, but also makes your PC safe for transfer to a new owner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reset process is even quicker than refresh, unless of course you choose the full-clean option. On my Ultrabook, I was able to nuke from space in 7 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One thing to realize about Push Button Reset is that it won’t retain your PC’s drivers; the process literally installs Windows 8 from scratch whether you choose PC Reset or PC Refresh. So unless your PC maker has included those
 drivers as part of the process, you’ll likely need to install missing drivers after the fact. This works as it always has: Use Windows Update first and then, if necessary, check your PC maker’s support web site for individual drivers or, hopefully, a driver
 install front-end application </p>

<h2>            Stuck on &#34;Getting files ready&#34; while using the Windows Installation Media Creation Tool to download Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I want to update my pc from Windows 8 to 8.1 but when I tried using the store it failed giving me a error message. So I managed to get the Windows Installation Media Creation Tool and it downloaded the ISO and when it reached 100%&nbsp; it said Getting Files
 Ready and its been loading that for more than 5 hours now and its stuck at 48%. So I`m not sure if this process requires an active internet connection thus implying that my internet connection may be a bit slow or is there something else the matter?</p>
<p>I`m not what to do now or maybe I should cancel and try downloading the ISO through my browser and then creating a bootable disk?</p>
<p>Help me out guys.&nbsp;</p>
