<h2>            Task Scheduler - Selected Task &#34;&#123;0&#125;&#34; no longer exists &#40;Fix&#41;</h2>
                    
<p><br />
Windows 7 Home Premium 64 (OEM, All updates, HP-Laptop)</p>
<p>When the Task Scheduler is started, I got the dredded,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The selected Task "{0}" no longer exists. To see the current task, click Refresh".</p>
<p>I searched through the MS forums and tried several solutions (e.g. deleting tasks in C: \windows\System32\Tasks). Some</p>
<p>solutions worked temporarily. During this time I noticed that the Event Viewer could not access the Security log, I</p>
<p>received,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; "4201 The instance name passed was not recognized as valid by a WMI data provider".</p>
<p>Searching for a fix for the Security log I found this link,</p>
<p><a href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/windowscompatibility/thread/c75ae899-d05b-411d-a7f2-00fdd33b8589/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/windowscompatibility/thread/c75ae899-d05b-411d-a7f2-00fdd33b8589/</a></p>
<p>(See Gary Bouchard and running SUBINACL).</p>
<p>When the fix was executed, both the Task Scheduler and the Security log functioned normally. The problem was an ACL</p>
<p>(Access Control List) corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I restored the tasks that&nbsp; were deleted from C: \Windows\System32\Tasks (see other&nbsp;solutions above) and the Task Scheduler</p>
<p>recognized them. Somehow Windows changed its access to the Tasks and the Security log, it then could not access them</p>
<p>and lied about what was happening. The original cause(s) of the ACL corruption is still out there and could strike</p>
<p>again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I may have iniated the problem by performing Defrags in Command Prompt (eg DEFRAG C: or DEFRAG C: /B) or MS could have</p>
<p>caused it through a downloaded update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOTE: This worked for me. Its drastic. Try at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The problem is with the Scheduled Task defined for Windows Disk Defragmenter and the solution goes something like this: -<br />
<ol>
<li>Close any open <span style="font-weight: bold">Task Scheduler</span> windows</li><li>Browse to <span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Windows\System32\Tasks\</span></li><li>Rename the file <span style="font-weight: bold">ScheduledDefrag</span> to <span style="font-weight: bold">

            Hi,
<br />You can use an Skype Number even if you don't live there. If there an US number, calls from US will be local calls. Some countries required proof of resident:
<br />" some countries require proof of residence, so unless you have a valid address there, you won’t be able to get a number for that country. These countries include:
<br />
<br />Brazil
<br />France
<br />The Netherlands
<br />Switzerland
<br />South Korea (Skype Numbers in South Korea must be purchased through our partner, Daesung.)
<br />Verification of your registered address may vary across individual countries."

<h2>            Seagate FreeAgent Desk 1TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive, connected to home network through usb in netgear wireless router, hard drive not accessible in windows explorer, device not ready</h2>
                    HI,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; I'm a nube with some knowledge but in need of totally explicit instructions.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; I have a Seagate FreeAgent Desk 1TB USB 2.0 External Hard Drive that I use to store all my music. &nbsp;I'm running Windows 7 (32-bit) on my laptop. &nbsp;I have a Netgear wireless router (model WNDR3400v2) to connect to my wireless network. &nbsp;I recently discovered
 that plugging my Seagate into the USB port of the router would allow me to have wireless access to my stored music files however, I cannot access those files by way of a mapped drive. &nbsp;I don't think there is a problem between the router and the HD b/c I can
 log into the router and see the HD connected, but my only options (options that successfully work) are to access the files via http:// or via ftp://. &nbsp;In the router GUI I can see the HD defined as drive U:\ however, when in windows explorer, there is no drive
 U:\. &nbsp;I have done some tinkering trying to fix my situation but may have gotten things messed up in the process, but as it stands now, when in windows explorer, under my network folder I can see my FreeAgent Drive but I cannot open it. &nbsp;When I attempt to open
 it, I get an error:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;"FreeAgent Drive is not accessible. &nbsp;You might not have permission to use this network resource. &nbsp;Contact the administrator of the server to find out if you have access permissions. &nbsp;The device is not ready."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a personal laptop on my personal network. &nbsp;There is no administrator except me, but I don't know how to give myself permission or change the settings on the network resource to make it accessible. &nbsp;Please help. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you,<br />
Apollo827</div>

    <title>Realtek HD Audio driver does not recognize FRONT inputs on new Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Realtek HD Audio driver does not recognize FRONT inputs on new Win 7 Ultimate x64</h2>
                    
<p>I have an HP Pavillion in which Realtek HD Audio worked perfectly in WinXP. After installing new HP branded Windows 7 Ultimate x64&nbsp;the software does not recognize FRONT inputs. New and old Realtek and HP branded Realtek HD Audio drivers do not fix it. Cleaning
 the driver and registry and reinstalling new system does not fix it. The setting in the Realtek software can be changed in to automatically recognize Front Inputs but by observing the Windows Registry no change is made within registry. Indeed looking at the
 registry I am not convinced that it installed all the switches correctly.</p>
<p>HP, MS and Realtek do not take it seriously and there are hundreds problems like that on Internet.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi LGold,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Are you bale to use rear panel inputs?<br />
2. When you plug the headphones in the front jack does the information get displayed for it in realtek manager?<br />
3. Do you get any error messages for the driver in device manager?<br />
4. What is the model number of the Hp computer?<br />
<br />
If the realtek manager is detecting the device then the issue might be with other applications involved in the playing the music.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to use the below provided troubleshooters and check if they list any issues-</span></span><span><br />

<h3> sgtbattleaxe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manufacturer warranty or Best Buy&#38;&#35;39&#59;s&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Just bought a new console and (of course) the reps at Best Buy were telling me that their warranty was better - that it covered more and you receive your console back in much, much less time if sent out for repairs. &nbsp;One thing I didn't like is that they
 said it ran consecutively with the manufacturer warranty the first year. So, I'd be getting only 2 years of coverage, instead of 3, which doesn't sound appealing to me. &nbsp;So, I decided to look into it a bit more before making a decision. I was wondering which
 one you guys thought was better. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately the decision rests on you. &nbsp;Do you want 3 years of a warranty or would you prefer to have 2 years alongside what the Best Buy people told you?</p>
<p>In my opinion I would go with the 3 year warrant because most companies tell you what you want to hear just so they can get a little more money out of you. &nbsp;Not ALL companies are like this though and Best Buy might actually be telling the truth. &nbsp;If anything
 find some reviews on google and see if that persuades you.</p>
<p>Personally your xbox might not mess up till well after the 2 year mark anyways depending on if you take good care of it or not. &nbsp;So the 3 year warranty seems like the best option.</p>

<p>Best Buy is, far as I'm aware, a Product Replacement Plan (PRP). If it breaks, you bring it in and they give you another one. My understanding is that this is a one-shot deal, so if your console fails after nine months and you opt to use BB's PRP, the PRP
 warranty expires and you'd need to buy a new one to cover the replacement console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft's warranty covers anything in the console kit. If you send your console in after, say, 14 months, the replacement is covered by the balance of the extended warranty - 22 months.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have multiple consoles and can afford the downtime, go with MS's warranty. If not, and your BB is close by, BB will have you up and running faster at a potentially higher cost overall (assuming you add a PRP to the replacement).</p>

<p>Clark Howard the finnancial Guru(LOL) says almost never get store warranties. He says their over priced and when they are not in any way involved with the manufacturers there is to much to chance that your going on the word of the store. I wouldn't do it.
 Xbox has been good in fixing my xbox after it god the red ring oh death a year or so back. I would just use the xbox one.</p>

<p><span>I'm an old-school mmo player, I’m old and I played Everquest in 99, and I’m missing the $15 dollar a month subscription fee because Neverwinter's Economy is killing me. &nbsp;Everything seems like it's behind a paywall, like I’m trying to exchange Dollars
 to Euros then to Rubles, then to Francs, finally to Rupees. &nbsp;Losing Value every step of the way. &nbsp;I mean $1.25 for a key to open a chest,, I’m dying of a thousand cuts here. &nbsp;It's not even a week old to me, and I know I’m fighting 2 years’ worth of updated
 content so I don't see the full picture yet. &nbsp; I know it sounds like I’m just b ‘itching, I am. &nbsp;I just want to be able to grind for good armor, weapons, and companions without it costing hundreds of real dollars. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So are are Asteral Crystals the end game resource that ties all this together. &nbsp;I there anything I can't acquire without spending cash on besides Dragonborn and Drow?</span></p>

<p>I made a thread asking how "Neverwinter" makes it's money if you don't have to pay for it.</p>
<p>I'm reliably informed by everyone who's played the PC versions and betas that there is nothing in the game that you can buy that cannot eventually be unlocked by simply playing the game.</p>
<p>The economy is still a mystery to me... would be handy if someone could either explain it or post a link to somewhere that breaks it down for those who aren't looking for a "Pay To Win" model.</p>

<p>I rather pay the $60 or $15 a month and get a ful game then play this garbage with micro transactions.</p>
<p>This isnt even micro transaction. This is pay to win.</p>
<p>Once the achievements are done i wont touch it again. IF this is how mmo's are going to be i wont ever play one again.</p>
<p>I spent $50 on keys for a mount or something useful and got Robbed. On top of that i had to pay tax on the transaction.</p>

<p>It's not pay to win.</p>
<p>Why pay for zen&nbsp; with real money when you can earn it in game? It just takes a little longer.</p>
<p>You weren't robbed,you were just impatient &amp; spent real money when you didn't have to.</p>
<p>It tells you on the tyrannical lockboxes that there's a chance of getting certain items,not your guaranteed to get them.</p>

<p>Daft is on point in the fact you don't have to spend a dollar to play/advance or have any of the cool items in this game...I earned so much Zen over the first couple of days just by running my daily missions and buying it on the exchange. This works the
 same way as their Star Trek Online...The Micro Trans is created for the lazy player that doesn't want to grind or can't understand how to grind.

            <p>The key to getting Zen in game (without buying it for $) is acquiring Astral Diamonds. AD and Zen are convertible to each other. You earn AD from many sources, from simply "praying" once a day to performing quests, participating in skirmishes (PVE or PVP instanced events), running dungeons, and several other ways. The Auction House is entirely denominated in AD, so you can buy low/sell high to get an AD profit, or just sell stuff (at higher levels) that you don't need.</p>
<p>It starts to make a bit more sense around level 11 or 12, after you get the Invoke (pray) action. My character is lvl 14 and has like 10 Tyrannical Lockboxes and zero keys. But I'm accumulating Astral Diamonds and will, eventually, convert them to Zen and buy some keys.</p>
<p>Check out this great guide to the various ways to acquire AD: <a href="http://nw-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?567591-Trace-s-Guide-to-AD-Creation-and-Wealth-Building" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">nw-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php</a></p>

    <title>Network notification icon not responding to left-click. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keith d.c  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network notification icon not responding to left-click.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all. My network connections icon in the notification area all of a sudden seems to be unresponsive to left-click. This should obviously be opening the "Currently connected to" connect/disconnect type menu, i.e:&nbsp;<a href="http://i.technet.microsoft.com/ff847520.Davies.CG.0710.Fig1(en-us,MSDN.10).jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.technet.microsoft.com/ff847520.Davies.CG.0710.Fig1(en-us,MSDN.10).jpg</a></p>
<p>Here's a few things I've checked:</p>

<ul>
<li>Left-click works on other icons. </li><li>Right-clicking the icon (which works), going to the network and sharing center and clicking "Connect or disconnect" works in triggering the proper menu.</li><li>Disabling the icon and re-enabling it. </li><li>Apart from that the icon appears fine, and all my networking appears to be fine too.</li></ul>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</div>

<h2>            100&#37; Disk Usage &#40;C Drive&#41; on Win 10 - Dell Optiplex 7010 - No Fixes Working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any ideas on how I can regain control of my PC, would appreciate any insight or advice.&nbsp; THANK YOU!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been dealing with this 100% Disk Usage issue for months now.&nbsp; My C Drive randomly shoots up to 100% Disk Usage and stays there for awhile, maybe 10 seconds, maybe 30 seconds, etc.&nbsp; This makes my entire PC freeze for that same period of time.&nbsp;
 It's a huge headache.<br />
<br />
I've tried all the recommended fixes (i.e.: everything listed here -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-100-disk-usage-in-task-manager-improve-pc-performance-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-100-disk-usage-in-task-manager-improve-pc-performance-on-windows-10/</a>&nbsp;and
 everything listed in this phorum).&nbsp; I spent hours and hours trying to fix the issue and nothing corrected it.&nbsp; I assumed it must be my SSD that's causing the issue and so I ordered a brand new SSD and did a clean install of Win 10 directly from Microsoft.&nbsp;
 Guess what, it still did NOT correct the issue!!!&nbsp; Seriously!?!?!&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; What a joke!!!!&nbsp; A brand new SSD, plus a clean Windows install with just my core programs (MS Word, Adobe, Chrome, Norton, Malwarebytes, etc.), and the 100% Disk Usage issue will not
 go away!!!&nbsp; &nbsp;I cannot figure it out, but I at least think I've found a possible culprit - GOOGLE CHROME...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I believe the issue is being caused by the Chrome Browser b/c that is the program in use on my newly refreshed Dell Desktop PC when the C Drive shoots up to 100% usage and freezes for a period of time.&nbsp; I uninstalled ALL Chrome extensions
 thinking that may be the problem, and I also cleared all Chrome history and cache, but that also does not solve the issue.&nbsp; Chrome gets stuck w/ a "waiting for cache" message in the bottom bar of the browser, the page doesn't load for a period of time (maybe
 10 seconds or more), the C drive gets rammed up to 100% usage, and the PC becomes unusable.&nbsp; Sometimes the 100% usage issue lasts 5 or 6 seconds, sometimes it lasts 30 seconds, sometimes one full minute,&nbsp; no rhyme or reason to why it's happening and/or the
 how long the system gets caught up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have come to the conclusion that there is NO fix for this issue.&nbsp; It is a glitch in Win 10 in regards to how it interacts w/ Chrome and my specific Dell system.&nbsp; I also have a Toshiba laptop w/ Win 10, a SSD, and all the same software, and that
 machine NEVER has this problem.&nbsp; It's limited to my Dell OptiPlex 7010 Desktop.&nbsp; If I am missing something here, please let me know.&nbsp; Otherwise, I assume my Desktop will basically be unusable until Win 12 comes out in 2019.&nbsp; Clearly, I am extremely dissatisfied
 w/ Dell, Microsoft, and Google right now.&nbsp; Not sure who to blame, but I can definitely say that I will NEVER buy a Dell PC again.&nbsp; Pure shiite!</p>

<p>Hi Lando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's start your device in a clean boot environment, this way we can identify the program that's using up the disk capacity of the drive. To do this, we suggest that you follow the steps provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>support article</strong></a>.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Is A Bully - Windows 10 Taking Over My PC Settings &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spenda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Is A Bully -  Windows 10 Taking Over My PC Settings &#38; Apps</h2>
                    <p>I have kept my old PC, which is still working fine and which I upgraded to Windows 10 last year, inheriting all of the usual problems everyone else ran into, but nothing major like some experienced. &nbsp;My experience wasn't too bad - more annoyance than anything.
 &nbsp;Ten days ago I purchased a 2nd PC, brand new, with Windows 10 already installed. &nbsp;I went through and uninstalled,
<em>(using a very good Application),</em> all of the bloatware, the crapola and the bullcrap and pared my system down to only what I wanted on it. &nbsp;I didn't touch System files, the Operating System or the Registry. &nbsp;Nothing like that. &nbsp;Just removed the Applications
 I don't want on my PC, such as Cortana, One Drive, The Entertainment Music &amp; TV,
<em>(I prefer the simplicity of Windows Media Player)</em>, Messenger and a whole host of other bloat junk, etc. etc. &nbsp;I also went through every one of the settings categories and turned off a heap of stuff to do with sharing, reporting, notifications, remote
 access, syncing and the like. &nbsp;I do not trust these companies with my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also a wee bit 'Big Brother' paranoid, since Obama has Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Google and others jumping when he whistles, who are now removing sites and any material which expresses anything which puts the White House and Islam in a "negative"
 light, according to his own instructions to them. &nbsp;Same instructions were issued to anything the mainstream media can and cannot publish on the White House and Islam. &nbsp;So, couple that with NSA surveillance, I am feeling our freedoms are being indirectly threatened,
 but back to here and now - What happened next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After about a week Windows 10 told me that it was auto-upgrading the version of Windows 10 on my newly purchased PC, because it was not the latest version, so it started this massive download which went on for some hours. &nbsp;After it rebooted, I found that
 most of the Applications I had removed had been re-installed. &nbsp;Forget the fact I am on a monitored data usage plan!! &nbsp; My privacy settings had also been changed, yet not all, so that suggests it had the capacity to 'read' what my settings were. &nbsp;Why did it
 change the particularly sensitive ones only, concerning privacy, sharing, reporting, my preferred search engine, my preferred home page, my dictionaries and access to my PC microphone, camera, remote access controls, etc? &nbsp;The upgrade changed these back to
 the default position of being enabled, when I had set them as disabled, yet there were many other settings it did not change back to the default? &nbsp;Why some and not others? &nbsp;Why did it re-install some of the Applications I had uninstalled, but not others? &nbsp;Again
 that suggests it could 'read' what I did not want, but why ignore that? &nbsp; Why are some Applications "default" Applications and others we can easily uninstall, given an uninstall button beneath their icon? &nbsp;In truth, we should have the right to choose or not
 to choose between <em><strong>all</strong></em> of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system then told me, in the Notifications side-bar, that the third party Application which I had used to uninstall all of the crapola in the first instance, would have to be un-installed, because that Application was no longer working properly. &nbsp;Really?
 &nbsp;I did not uninstall it, however. &nbsp;Instead, I ran it and uninstalled all of the crapola again, that the Windows 10 upgrade had re-installed against my wishes. &nbsp;And the Application removed all successfully and properly. &nbsp;Why did Windows 10 suggest this Application
 was faulty when it was not? &nbsp;I am wondering if ever I do have to re-install this Application, whether Windows 10 has somehow placed something on my PC, to interfere with its effectiveness in the future? &nbsp;Sure, that may well be paranoia on my part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is my overall complaint? &nbsp;My problem is this. &nbsp;Before Windows 10, one could buy a computer, set it up and get it the way we liked within a few hours. &nbsp;Today, trawling through the Windows 10 settings, you need a fu*cking PhD in Psychology and Technology.
 &nbsp;It is a mind-bender. &nbsp;My biggest gripe is the time spent - three days now wasting almost 5 or 6 hours per day. &nbsp;I feel enslavened to bloody Microsoft. &nbsp;For busy people this is anathema. &nbsp;The number of settings, the options, the way they are worded and framed,
 and the extent of them is preposterous. &nbsp;The OS is preposterous. &nbsp;Finding some settings, you wish to disable, is like looking for a grain of sand on a beach, only to find there is more than one place that the same setting must be checked or unchecked, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now too, I have this enormous folder called "Windows Old", on my PC which I wish to delete. &nbsp;Do you think I can? &nbsp;Even the whizz-bang uninstaller that I use, can't uninstall it. &nbsp;I have attacked it from various angles, but still it doggedly remains. &nbsp;Unless
 you bypass the system's defaults, and find other ways, most of the Applications I did uninstall, would not go easily and gracefully, either. &nbsp;I met with resistance all along the way. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Although, a few of the packaged Applications that come with Windows
 10 had the option to uninstall them, why not the rest of them, e.g. One Drive and Cortana, etc.? &nbsp;What happened to freedom of choice? &nbsp;Why does Microsoft think it can dictate to me what
<em><strong>Microsoft wants </strong></em>me to have on my PC? &nbsp;I vehemently reject and resent this. &nbsp;I don't even want its freekin' bloody predatory "shop".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe technology is enslaving us, not liberating us. &nbsp;With all of this cross-syncing, all of this ID sh*t and sharing stuff, plus these RFID chips
<em>(or whatever they are called) </em>and&nbsp;the NSA spying, etc. etc. I honestly think it won't be long before Big Brother will know every time we go to pee in the bathroom. &nbsp;The phone companies now put a chip in our mobile phones, that NSA can tap into if it
 should so wish. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, I respectfully ask that you lead by example the revolt against these abominable breaches of the First Amendment and alter your "default" Applications, your Add-ons, and your OS "default" settings etc. so that all become a matter of choice. &nbsp;Further,
 that the OS be delivered with DEFAULT settings regarding the likes of&nbsp;sharing, public access, remote access and syncing, etc. set in the default position of "OFF" rather than in the default of "ON". &nbsp; I also respectfully request that settings text be simplified
 and worded in layman's terms, in a civilised and rational, common sense rhetoric. &nbsp;Perhaps employ a non-techie, non-nerdie, normal human being to write these??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hopping mad about the entire approach. &nbsp;I think that every citizen should be questioning all of this very seriously and rising up and revolting against it. &nbsp;Moreover, Windows 10 has cost me, since I first downloaded it last year, nearly $1,000 in excess
 data usage penalties. &nbsp;I refuse to be bludgeoned into moving up to an unlimited usage plan, when I know my browsing habits have not changed, when I know I used the same limits for 13 years, lucky to use half of the allocated usage in all of that time. &nbsp;I refuse
 because I know it is not me using up my data, but that it is Windows 10. &nbsp;How about a refund Microsoft?</p>

            This did not work. &nbsp;Pin or password still required. &nbsp;This is very annoying. &nbsp;I would like to just use my computer without this security feature which I do not need.

    <title>Windows 10 Maps freezing after updating to 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lance-addsys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Maps freezing after updating to 1809</h2>
                    <p>We used to recommend windows maps application to our customer. But recently after updating to 1809. We received reports from our customers that the maps application is freezing and sometimes crashing when losing internet connectivity. We already tried to
 download the offline maps but that doesn't solve the problem. We're still experiencing the map to freeze at the middle of turn by turn navigation.

    <title>Wi Fi Problem with Kodak ESP 5210 Printer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wi Fi Problem with Kodak ESP 5210 Printer</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have a Toshiba L650-12P laptop which is connected to the internet via wi-fi to a netgear DG834G router.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have recently purchased a Kodak ESP 5210 all in one wi-fi printer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have followed the installation instructions and can confirm that the printer is connected to the router via wi-fi however my laptop is unable to print to it (error message reads printer is not responding) the printer is not listed under network
 devices.</strong></p>
<p><strong>However if I connect my laptop to the router via an ethernet cable I am able to print.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This suggests to me that the printer is connected and working properly and that the printer software is correctly installed but that a laptop setting (possibly windows 7) is blocking the wi-fi connection?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hope you are able to help me.</strong></p>

<p>For Windows Vista:</p>
<p>(On the computer you're trying to print from)</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel</p>
<p>Click Windows Security Center</p>
<p>In left column click Windows Firewall</p>
<p>In right box click Change Settings</p>
<p>Click continue button</p>
<p>Go to Exceptions tab</p>
<p>Click Add Program</p>
<p>Browse to your printers program</p>
<p>Find it and click OK</p>
<p>Back out of everything you've opened by hitting OK or Close and try to print</p>
<p>That worked for me anyway</p>
