<h2>            Content download is incredibly slow</h2>
                    
<p>I posted something similar in the suggestions forums because I'm not sure whether this is a technical flaw or just an area for improvement:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have never achieved the same download speeds on either of my Xbox 360 as I have on my other devices. In fact, I think I am getting about 10% download speed compared to my other devices. I have tried the 360 elite direct-wired to the router, and the 360
 slim directly-wired to the router, wireless using the native wireless card, and I have purchased the Microsoft wireless N adapter and tried that (5 ghz band, only device, router in wireless N mode only). I've had full strength connections, no NAT issues, minimal
 distance/obstructions between the device and the router. I've tried different ISPs, different modem/router devices. I've increased my internet speed. I've checked with my router manufacturer and Xbox support forums to make sure that I have the correct ports
 open on my router for the Xbox 360 (again, I had no NAT/Connectivity issues beyond poor download speed). I've reconfigured the MTU size on my router to match the 360's specifications. I've turned off all other devices so the 360 is the only device on the network.
 The router I use is brand-new and fairly high-end, and I have no download speed issues with any other device, wired or wireless. I'm sure I've tried half a dozen different work-arounds that I've forgotten to list here.</p>
<p>I have about 32megabits/second download speed right now, which means I can download at 4 megabytes/second. It should take me 5 minutes or less to download&nbsp;1 GB of data. It in fact, takes between 30-60 minutes. I've tried background downloads in the hopes
 of seeing increased download speeds. No dice.</p>
<p>I have a particular game with an in-game patcher that lists current download speed. It rates at 0.40 megabytes/second, which is a joke. It also corresponds with my experience of seeing 1 GB of data require nearly 60 minutes to download.</p>
<p>So, I'm having trouble believing that the 360 download speed is not&nbsp;capped or throttled (I'm assuming that the 360 hardware is outdated and not capable of downloading at the higher speeds, or the problem is server side). Alternatively, there may be something
 wrong with 2 of the 360s I've owned.</p>

<p>Hey there Sirbobby,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear you're having issues with your download speed.&nbsp;It really sounds like you've tried just about everything but the kitchen sink.<br />
<br />
A couple things that come to mind:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Have you tried connecting to LIVE with your <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Hard Drive removed</a>?</strong> </li><li><strong>Have you tried your consoles on a different network? (ex: friend's house)</strong>
</li><li><strong>Is it only your profile that has slower downloads or is it any profile you try to download with?</strong>
</li><li><strong>Have you tried circumventing your router and direct wiring into your router?</strong>
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know and we'll go from there.</p>

<p>I have not tried connecting to Live with my hard drive removed--but without the hard drive, I don't exactly have much space to download a file. I guess I could try it.</p>
<p>I haven't tried any other profiles, because my profile is the only profile associated with the 360. I don't have any other xbox live gold profiles or even any silver profiles to test.</p>
<p>I have tried my console on a different network. I have tried an original Xbox 360 elite on several different networks. I have tried my 360 slim (which replaced the elite) on at least two different networks. I originally had it direct wired on a network,
 but I have since moved and changed providers (from AT&amp;T U-Verse). I do not and have not tried direct wiring it yet with my current ISP/network configuration. Both the elite and the slim had subpar download speeds in all configurations.</p>
<p>I can try direct wiring my 360 slim to my modem in the current ISP/network configuration as a temporary, purely diagnostic workaround, but I do not want to even try it unless it is the only possible remaining diagnostic test (very inconvenient and would
 require either dismantling the entire home office or purchasing a lengthy Ethernet cable). It is absolutely not possible to permanently remove the router from the network setup. I doubt I could convince my girlfriend to run an ethernet cable across the living
 room to the adjacent office to permanently wire the Xbox 360 to the router, so wireless is likely the only networking solution for the 360. The modem has to remain in the home office with a work computer, and I need a router to connect a Vonage device to the
 network. I may need to contact my ISP to reconfigure any settings for the modem, anyhow, which exacerbates attempts to direct-wire to the router.</p>
<p>I'll try to give more info about my network setup:</p>
<p>ISP: Roadrunner via Time Warner Cable. Rated 30mbps down, 5mbps up. &nbsp;I made time warner replace all of the wiring for the internet in the condo when we moved in last year, so the actual coaxial cables should not be degraded, damaged, or defective, either.
 I guess I could add that to the list of solutions I have tried.</p>
<p>Ubee Modem/router (I'm not entirely sure of the model but I believe it is this one:
<a href="http://www.ubeeinteractive.com/products/cable/ddw3630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.ubeeinteractive.com/.../ddw3630</a>) provided by Time Warner Cable for Road Runner internet. Device is set to bridge mode. I am aware of the awe-inspiring technical failure of the device to function as a modem/router with more than one device on the network,
 so I have a separate router that actually works as a router.</p>
<p>Router: Cisco Linksys EA4500. Dual-band, 450mb up/450mb down, support for 30 devices on the network, if I remember correctly. It might be worth noting that the router worked out-of-the-box with the 360--open NAT and no connectivity problems other than the
 slow download speeds I have been experiencing as long as I can remember.</p>
<p>Router is wired to modem via Ethernet cable. From the router, I have an Ethernet cable connecting to a laptop that is never powered on at the same time as the 360 (and thus never on the network at the same time). I have an Ethernet cable connecting to a
 Vonage internet phone device (required for the home office work PC). I have an Ethernet cable connecting to a home office work PC (used during regular business hours, so the PC is off-line when the Xbox is in use). I realize that I have not tried disconnecting
 the Vonage device from the router when I use the 360, but the Vonage device has never been used for a call or the like while the 360 has been in use. I can try removing it after work hours to see if it is possibly leading to a bottleneck (on just the 360 but
 apparently no other devices).</p>
<p>We have a handful of devices like smartphones and tablets (and a printer which is powered off and verified off the network) which have access to the 2.4ghz wifi network, but those are rarely used actively in conjunction with the 360.</p>
<p>Speedtest via speedtest.net via 3 different PCs and a Mac (trying wired v. wireless) generally reveal that even with other devices on the network, I can routinely expect 32 mbps down, 5+ mbps up, and around 25 ms ping.</p>
<p>The 360 slim itself is currently equipped with Microsoft Wireless N adapter. it is connected wireless to the network on the 5ghz channel (which means it is the only device on the band in the area) of the Linksys EA4500 (and I named my 2.4ghz and 5ghz networks
 different SSIDs so the console could identify and correctly connect to the 5ghz network). The 5ghz channel for the router is set to wireless N mode only (the 2.4 ghz channel has to be set to mixed to accommodate any of the other wireless devices should they
 be active). There is a single interior wall between the router and the 360. No intervening electronic devices. Approximately 20 feet between the 360 and the router. 6 network connection tests have all shown maximum strength signal for the 360's wireless connection.</p>
<p>The 360 is housed in an entertainment center with a very open niche. There are no other devices near the 360 (except of course for the wireless N adapter). I even separated the power brick from the console to reduce heat and any electromagnetic interference
 issues. I don't wear any sort of wireless headset when downloading files. Again, I typically eliminate any devices from the network when using the 360.</p>
<p>The wireless N adapter was a recent addition to the network, and brought no discernible changes to download speeds, though I did notice significantly improved latency in one (and only one) multiplayer game--but I'm not certain I can attribute it to the adapter
 or to server-side overhauls by the game developer.</p>
<p>I accessed Bandwithplace.com via Internet Explorer for Xbox and it reported a hilariously slow 3mbps download and 4.5mbps upload speed. I think the 360 probably gets closer to 6 or 7 mbps download speed (which is still less than 25% of what my speed is rated
 by my ISP and realized on my other devices).</p>
<p>I'm confident that my internet speeds/connection are generally stable--if I knew how to go back and record download logs for Steam, I could show you a log in which I downloaded 80gb+ of data and maintained a stable speed between 3.8 and 4.1 megabytes/second
 (on a PC of course).</p>

<p>Holy guacamole that is wall of text! Let's see if we can improve your connection.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I did some digging on your network device, and it seems all clear. First off I would suggest removing your HDD, and trying to download to another storage device, such as a USB drive. This will help us isolate the issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I would also suggest checking out our<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/connecting/slow-performance-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Slow Performance on Xbox Live</a> support article. There are some great steps in there that may help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This was a super frustrating process. To make a long story short, I removed the hard drive and downloaded to my Xbox flash drive (one of those official Microsoft Xbox 360 16gb flash drives). I've downloaded stuff to my flash drive before and had the same
 download speed, so I wasn't expecting an improvement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I did as you suggested. Based on the time to download, I calculate my average download speed to be about 2megabytes/second, which is about half what I should expect for my internet speed, and correspondingly about half what I get on my other
 devices.</p>
<p>And my gamertag appears to have somehow re-associated itself with an old Microsoft email account. Great :/ .</p>

            <p>Hey there!<br /><br />Based on what you've told us it really just sounds like that's as fast as your console is able to download. I've seen others perform similar tests to this and the download speeds they reached on their console was usually much lower than what their speedtest.net results were. This is usually just due to the Xbox 360 console having come out in 2005. I expect the download speeds that the Xbox One will be able to achieve will be much different in comparison. =)<br /><br /><strong>However, the last sentence in your post is certainly odd. How do you mean that it re-associated itself with an old Microsoft email account?</strong><br /><br />Let us know and we'll see what we can do to get that sorted.</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that the results I posted were typical--I estimate that I typically see about 0.40 megabytes/second (so, you know, about 10% of the speed I should get and do get with other devices)--and thus a game like Defiance which requires regular updates
 is essentially unplayable, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The frustrating part is that I have the 360 slim, so I already had a wireless capability. I bought a Microsoft wireless N adapter after speaking with some tech support people who indicated that it should result in an improvement.</p>
<p>re: re-associating with an old Microsoft account--something happened when I removed my hard drive, and somehow my profile (which is stored on my Xbox 360 official flash drive) became corrupted. A year or so ago, my XBL account was associated with a different
 microsoft email address. The account was technically flawed and unusable across metro platform devices, i.e. windows phone, windows tablets, windows 8. I had to create a new account, and I re-associated my gamertag with the new account (again, about a year
 ago). So, when I performed the steps listed above to check my download speed, my gamertag started displaying my old (incorrect) Microsoft email address from about a year ago. Don't know how or why, but I was able to (at least as far as I can tell so far),
 fix the issue with a call to Xbox tech support.</p>

<p>Hey there SirBobby,<br />
<br />
As Mister Cerb said, the way that your console connects to the XBL servers is different than how other devices access the internet. Some people can experience slow download speeds, especially with larger sized files. This is something we hope to improve in
 the new Xbox One console.<br />
<br />

I'm glad to hear you were able to sort out your account weirdness with Phone Support.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>When I open a folder with video files I have to wait while the hundreds of video clips get their thumbnails regenerated. Which is fine, if it happened only once. But after I reboot, and open the same folder, the thumbnails have to regenerate AGAIN! What

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a solution to this, which is working for me. Keep in mind, that this solution needs the use of&nbsp;<strong>Registry Editor</strong>. I suggest making a backup before doing any changes. Follow these instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First let's create a backup of your registry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press&nbsp;<strong>Win+R&nbsp;</strong>to open up&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong></li><li>Type&nbsp;<strong>regedit</strong>&nbsp;and press&nbsp;<strong>Enter</strong></li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>File</strong>, then&nbsp;<strong>Export</strong></li><li>Type in a file name and select your preffered location, make sure that the Export Range is set to&nbsp;<strong>All</strong>, then&nbsp;click&nbsp;<strong>Save<br />
</strong></li></ul>
<p>Now on to the solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\Thumbnail Cache</li><li>Look for&nbsp;<strong>Autorun</strong> and double-click on it</li><li>Change the value data to&nbsp;<strong>0</strong> and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong></li><li>Next navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\VolumeCaches\Thumbnail Cache</li><li>Look for Autorun and double-click on it</li><li>Change the value to&nbsp;<strong>0&nbsp;</strong>and click&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong></li><li>Close Registry Editor and restart your computer</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it does the trick. If it worked, please mark the answer as helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sten</p>

If you want to remove a single program from the taskbar, right-click on the unwanted program and click on delete.<br />
Note: this will not remove the program from the computer, just the taskbar shortcut.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You may check the Add or Remove Programs, and check if you see that untitled program. You may remove it from here.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As I understand, you are getting a red X on the screen tray of taskbar. You may try the steps and check if you are able to post a screen shot.<br />
I would suggest you to zip the file and upload it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please refer to the these steps on how to zip a file:<br />
<br />
1. Locate the file or folder that you want to compress.<br />
<br />
2. Right-click the file or folder, point to Send to, and then click Compressed (zipped) folder.<br />
<br />
A new compressed folder is created in the same location. To rename it, right-click the folder, click Rename, and then type the new name.<br />
Once you're done, please refer to the links and try to post the screen shot.<br />
<br />

            <p>​Hi,<br />
<br />
Try these steps and check.<br />
a. <strong>Open the Snipping Tool</strong>. The Snipping Tool is found in Start/All Programs/Accessories/Snipping Tool.<br />
b. <strong>Choose the kind of screenshot (snip) you would like to take</strong>. "Rectangular Snip" is chosen by default.<br />
c. <b>Select the area that you want a screenshot of</b>. If you chose "Window Snip", select a window instead. If you chose "Full-Screen Snip", go to the next step.<br />
d. <strong>Save the screenshot by clicking the floppy disk icon in the window that pops up</strong>. Type in a name for the screenshot and change the "Save as type:" field if desired. Read the "Tips" section for information
 on file types. You can now send the screenshot by email or put it on a website.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t reach optional updates&#63;</h2>
                    I recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. During the monthly&nbsp;update process, the update program reports a number of "optional" updates. They are all hardware updates, printer drivers, pointing device updates, etc. I would like to accept them but I can't
 find how to approve and install them. Win 10 automatically processes the critical and recommended ones, But I can't find anyway to get to these optional others. Help.

            <p>The reply did not resolve my problem. These updates are not sent by Microsoft but by the hardware provider (in this case Lenovo. They keep the hardware compatible with changes in the operating systems. The devices can't be unplugged and reconnected. They
 are built in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But although the update process shows that these "optional" updates have been send, I can find no way to reach them and authorize their installation. That was my question, which remains unanswered.</p>

            Your only option then is to go to the hardware vendor and get them directly. &nbsp;In this case, Lenovo as you said.

            Overwrite means you REPLACE something with something new.<br />
for example. If you have a file called "XYZ.txt" (which you previously saved).&nbsp; And now, you created another file (notepad?). You can save it as a different file name (say XYZ2.txt).&nbsp; However, if you choose the save it as XYZ.txt again, notepad will ask if
 you want to Overwrite the file.&nbsp; If you say YES, that means you will REPLACE the old content with the new one (loosing the old content).<br />

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Listed below are a couple of very good FREE Programs for Data/File Recovery.<br />
<br />
Read their reviews, and make your choice with which one you are happy working with.<br />
<br />
1. Stop using that computer; as you will overwrite the lost files, which are not&nbsp;lost, until they are overwritten..<br />
<br />
2. Preferably Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, install one of the Recovery Programs in that computer, and read your Drive from there.<br />
<br />
3. Or put your Hard Drive in a USB External Hard Drive Enclosure, attach it&nbsp; to another&nbsp; computer, and do the same as in 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You can install the software and run it in your computer, but that risk of overwriting the “deleted” files
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>is still there.<br />

Try Recuva 1st:<br />

    <title>IOAC STOPPED WORKING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k m acharia  say:</h3>
<h2>            IOAC STOPPED WORKING</h2>
                    <p>For many days I having a problem warning that IOAC stopped working. I do not know what it is. I referred this to the computer manufacturers who advised system recovery to factory installed setup and than upgrade to windows 8.1. It is a very long and difficult
 task.</p>
<p>The problem started that the screen will freeze and computer will not shut down other than by keeping the power button down.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>However it corrected itself and is working but the above problem is reported every time I switch the computer on.</p>
<p>Please help and oblige.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks for your prompt response. I see that 'msconfig' on my laptop is always set to selective startup. Despite setting it to normal startup and reboot it never comes back to normal startup and stays on selective startup giving the following options:-</p>
<p>Load system services</p>
<p>Load startup items</p>
<p>Use original boot configuration (although ticked but greyed out)</p>
<p>Is this a cause of problem?</p>
<p>Using Windows 8.1 regularly updated.</p>
<p>Ultrabook in use: ACER ASPIRE S7-391. Intel core i5-3337U CPU @ 1.80GHz, 4.0GB RAM, Intel HD Graphics 4000.</p>
<p>Problem:</p>

            IOAC is apparently part of Realtek audio drivers.&nbsp; You should be able to download the Realtek driver package from the PC manufacturer's website.&nbsp; Uninstall the current drivers in Device Manager, then install the drivers you downloaded.&nbsp; You can also just
 reboot after uninstalling the current drivers, and Windows will locate and install the correct drivers.

    <title>Two Finger Scrolling Bug on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul534  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two Finger Scrolling Bug on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently upgraded to Windows 10, and after the update the two finger scrolling direction on my touchpad had been reversed (i.e. move the fingers up to scroll down and vice versa). I preferred it when it wasn't reversed liked this, however I didn't think
 it was much of an issue as it can be easily changed back to the direction it was previously in the settings. However since the update the direction is reversed after every time I load up my PC, meaning I have to change the settings every time. Anyone also
 had this issue and/or know how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

            Possible solution&nbsp;go to "Devices" and select "Mouse &amp; touchpad". Then select "Additional mouse options" this opens a mouse properties window. Select the tab called "TouchPad" select the button called "Setting" this opens a Synaptics Control Panel. Select
 the tab called "Scroll" in the section called "Two Finger Scrolling" uncheck the box "Switch Direction" click "OK".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            It sounds like you have a driver issue . . .

Let's see if we can get you into the Windows Recovery Environment:

Start your Notebook, just as the HP logo disappears and Windows attempts to load or the spinning dots start, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down

Do this twice

On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.

Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to

If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your drivers are up to date
Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally

If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
Choose to keep

            If I understand you were able to get into Windows and it crashed again with a blue screen with error Bad Pool Header.

If this is the case, try to get into Windows again, open Windows File Explorer, navigate to C:\Windows\Mini Dumps. Zip up the contents of this folder and upload the zip to the cloud (One Drive, Dropbox . . . etc.) and post a link here. Someone should ba able to analyse those for you . . .

    <title>Computer randomly wiped out... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Computer randomly wiped out...</h2>
                    Hi, I am an intermediate user. Windows 7 pro refurbished PC-possibly compromised.&nbsp; About a month ago my neighbor said her computer was wiped out. She started her computer and she got something similar to the update screen prior to logging in saying "windows
 is reconfiguring." All her personal information and pictures are gone and it is like a brand new version of windows.&nbsp; When she bought the computer i noticed there was no back-up partition (unless it was hidden.) I believe the profile has been corrupted because
 I have seen this before but this is a little different.&nbsp; Also, PUP's are installing themselves on the PC without permission. I'm pretty sure the system is compromised. I would like to reformat the computer however I dont have a backup partition or disc. Can
 i get one from Microsoft still or do I need to buy one from a third party? I have done scans with malwarebytes, Eset, and ADWcleaner and am still finding PUP's that have been deleted before. I don't have much time to work on it so it is easier to reinstall
 and reformat but I would like to get some of the personal stuff back for her if possible... thank you<br />

            <p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;apologize for the delay in responding. Are you still facing this issue? If yes, it is better to&nbsp;perform a clean install to reinstall Windows. This will format all her personal stuff, but it is safer as the personal file might contain a copy of the malware
 or virus that caused the issue in the first place. You can download&nbsp;Windows 7 installation files from the following link and create an installation media:</p>

</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You will have to enter the product key that you purchased to be able to download the ISO files. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Sure sounds like you are correct.&nbsp; A rebuild is in order.&nbsp; There should be a hidden factory restore partition.&nbsp; Let me know make/model and I may be able to give you instructions on how to access it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.canadiantech.info/for-techies/re-build-windows-7/</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp;
 You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you are likely into a re-install.&nbsp; Takes a lot of time, but not all attended time.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64)</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Audio Problem IDT Plays through speakers and headphones</h2>
                    <p>I have recently taken possession of my brother's old Windows 7 Dell Inspiron N5040 that runs IDT HD Audio as the sound driver, the problem is that even when the headphones are plugged in, the computer still plays sound through the speakers, I have tried
 uninstalling and reinstalling the driver, updating the driver software, and I still can't fix it. I thought that maybe the problem could be fixed with Sound in the Control Panel, however, I can't find the device labeled "Headphones", the only two devices listed
 are "Speakers/Headphones" and "Communications Headphones". How do I make it so that the system only plays sounds through speakers when headphones aren't plugged in and only plays sounds through the headphones when they are?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a49616b6-4599-4eb2-b9ad-9c8db47bdfe0" /></p>

<h2>            I get a System_Service_Exception 0x000000003b shortly after boot...&#40;possible external drive, possible graphics driver&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<div>
<p>Not Entirely sure the cause.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was in the shower, my wife tried using my computer and it went to both monitors going black screen. I hardbooted it off.&nbsp; when it booted up my vga monitor showed the bios loader, the windows loader, then double black screen for about 10 seconds, then it
 reboots.&nbsp;</p>
<p>i reboot with only the vga plugged in, i started getting chkdisk running on one of my External USB Harddrives.&nbsp; I would get to the login ui and choose admin/default profile and before the screen goes to desktop it gives bluescreen with the above error, about
 10 seconds passes, it reboots.</p>
<p>I unplug my external drives and still only vga, (and it only ran chkdisk on just one external, not both my externals, and not on either of my 2 internals.)&nbsp; and boot it- I get to login ui- i can choose either my profile or my guest/wife profile and it goes
 to desktop- before it finishes loading all the taskbar stuff, bluescreens on me, same error, and reboots after 10 seconds.</p>
<p>I bootup and go to safemode still only vga, i get desktop on my profile- but safemode is no way to really 'use' a computer. it is stable, so i hope someone kind enough here can help me get it back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other Moderately Pertinant Info.</p>
<p>Its Windows Vista 64bit Acer<br />
4GB system/video shared<br />
Nvidia 9200 series card<br />
AMD Phenom triple core<br />
Bestfit resolution on VGA is 1440x900<br />
Bestfit resolution on Polaroid HDMI connection HDTV is 1920x1080<br />
Normally the HDMI is my primary video display</p>
<p>for the past 2-3 weeks I've stayed on my profile, have rebooted it a few times, and everythings been groovy.<br />
about 2-3 weeks ago I updated a bunch of patches, one of which was my nvidia drivers.&nbsp; -THAT was a huge issue.</p>
<p>I had the HDMI only plugged in at the time of the update. after the update- it set the default resolution to like 13xxby768.&nbsp; my tv doesn't like this resolution and cannot scale to it- so it glitches out my tv and says it has a resolution of 1p. It also
 disabled dual monitor support after the patch, though it is used to running it dualview seperate monitors.&nbsp; I had to unplug hdmi, have only vga in.&nbsp; change it back to its best fit of 1440x900.&nbsp; the damn nvidia driver doesn't let you set resolutions for nonhooked
 up displays, and it won't let you turn on cloneview or dualview without both things hooked up.&nbsp; so i hovered my mouse over the resolution choices box, removed the vga, plugged in the hdmi, clicked on a random selection, and hit ctrl+A to apply it. after the
 monitor flickered and stayed black, i knew i had another nonscaleable to resolution, i hit down arrow, ctrl+A again, and got it on my second try- some ridiculous low resolution, then scaled it back up to its best fit 1080p goodness.&nbsp; Since this time, I did
 not go to my wife's profile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think its possible she bumped my usb cable making the external drive come unplugged.&nbsp; Or it may have been when she 'switched user' instead of 'log off' like I repeatedly tell her to not 'switch user' it had a huge conflict with trying to keep my resolution
 and possibly default resolutions on her profile that was forced by the patch(but doesn't explain why i can get back to my desktop with nothing plugged in for a few seconds, and it is the right resolution for the vga).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried reading other posts on this forum and it seems that this can be associated with both graphics cards and with dismounting harddrives.&nbsp; all the stuff on dismounting drives though seemed to apply to winserver 2003 though, i could be wrong.&nbsp; I'd like
 to myself a an extremely capable user but drivers and hardware are 1up from me.&nbsp; Thankyou very much in advance, to anyone who can help me.&nbsp; If i need to do a dump or something, to give you more info, please tell me how to do it- I don't know my way around
 safemode very well.</p>

            <p>Migrating from 32&gt;64 or 64&gt;32 bit is only done via a clean Install, which makes you loose everything including files and applications.</p>
<p>But before that you would need the desired 32 or 64 bit media. As MS doesn't provide one now for OEM licenses-you need to arrange one before.</p>

</p><p>According to MS TechNet if you have OEM factory installed 64-bit Windows license that license will not transfer to 32-bit so you will have to buy another license.</p>

            Hi Peace From The Middle East,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
I’d suggest you to connect your external hard drive to a different USB port and try copying and check if that fixes the issue.
<br />
<br />
Also, boot into safe mode and try copying the same and check if you can successfully complete the copy operation without any errors.
<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details on how to start computer in safe mode:<br />
<strong><br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
If you’re able to successfully copy the file in safe mode, it indicates that one of the third party application or start up item is causing the error.
<br />
<br />
You could put your system in clean boot state and check if any third party application or any services is causing the issue and hence the error.<br />
<br />
Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may go ahead and disable or uninstall the same.<br />
<br />
Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:<br />
<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
2. Click Start, type <strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
Once the system is in clean boot state, try to copy the files and check if you’re able to copy files without any errors.<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details:<br />
<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
3. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
<br />

<h3> james4621  say:</h3>
<h2>            reinstall Windows 7 Professional without loosing data &#40;winsxs directory is corrupted&#41;</h2>
                    Helloworld and MS,<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Re: How to FIX or rebuild permanently corrupted files in the "WINSXS directory" (already used SFC /scannow) - or alternatively reinstall Windows 7 Pro to prevent loss of data and programs (Format or clean install not an option)
 when you have used a Windows Anytime Upgrade and have NO Windows 7 Pro DISC </span>
<br />
<br />
My Windows 7 Professional on a new computer (done by anytime upgrade with&nbsp; no instal disc), is now sadly corrupted as the operating system.<br />
<br />
I say corrupt because the windows 7 store directory used to build the OS as the C:\Windows&nbsp;&nbsp; - "WINSXS" directory has corrupt files that cannot be recovered.<br />
<br />
Yes i have used safe mode and run SFC /scannow several times and the log shows several files such as dot net framework, media player and other files as non recoverable. I believe these important WINSXS directory files were recently nuked by a virus that got
 through several of my defenses. <br />
<br />
Although my basic Windows 7 Pro operating system still starts and works relatively well, I want to recover the many broken and corrupted files, as the OS shows signs of being unstable.
<br />
<br />
I will NOT recover or reinstall the computer via the Gateway recovery disc, as the only Gateway option is a complete format and placing back all the bloatware this computer came with or alternatively waiting 1 -2 weeks and buying a Windows 7 Home disk from
 them and also starting all over.<br />
<br />
In fact, as most of us well know, due to the amazing number of hours to build up a new computer (with dozens of programs installed that remain clean and were not impacted by the virus) I need to find the "best quick" solution to get the Windows 7 Pro OS working
 again by restoring the WINSXS directory. <br />
<br />
Please help me with the best available option to regain the integrity of files in WINSXS.
<br />
<br />
After all, I am a legitimate licensed user of "Windows 7 Pro" that has essentially paid for the OS, but was not given a disc which I understand has an upgrade option that I could use to simply and quickly rebuild the OS without loosing the data and setup links
 to the programs.<br />
<br />
BTW - I am relatively well versed and can handle options that use advanced tech recovery methods<br />
PS - I was advised by MS tech support to post my problem here, in part so as to avoid a $59 fee as my 90 day warranty period of support has now ended.<br />
<br />
I sure hope some of the wizards here can point me to a download site or assist without merely telling me to format and begin all over again which I see as not a viable option.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any assistance.<br />

            <p>You are between a rock and hard place. Because an Anytime Upgrade does not represent retail or full version upgrade, you can't use a retail disc to do a repair upgrade which would refresh all broken operating system files.
</p>
<p>The unfortunate truth is, if you really want this fixed, after trying using the built in tools such as System File Checker and Check Disk, you will have to backup and do a back up of your personal files and settings, then recover the system using the built
 in recovery tools that came with your Gateway. </p>
<p>Yes, you don't want to hear this, but there is no other way to do it than to spend $200 on a Windows 7 Professional upgrade then attempting a repair upgrade.
</p>
<p>The recovery will be a inconvenience, but if planned well, you can reduce some down time by doing a backup:</p>

<p>Also do a standard backup:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p><br />
After you have restored your system to the factory state, do the Anytime Upgrade to Windows 7 Professional again.
</p>
<p>You will need to reactivate by telephone because the license was previously in use:</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4</p>
<p>2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard</p>
<p>3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person. <br />

</p>
<p>Restore your personal files and settings from the Windows Easy Transfer backup, then reinstall your applications.
</p>
<p>If you don't like this option, then purchase a Windows 7 Professional upgrade for $200 and do a repair upgrade:</p>

            Hi rl1979,
<br />
<br />This may be indicative of keyboard failure. What you can do is switch to a known good keyboard and see if this would work. Alternatively, try to unplug the keyboard and plug it back into a different port. This seems to me a hardware issue, so attempt this before you continue.
<br />
<br />Best of luck!

From screen shot both shift keys are held down on the virtual keyboard and just to add I have tried two keyboards and same&nbsp;

            That's strange. Try this: hit both SHIFT keys at the same time twice, close the On-Screen Keyboard, then try opening it again. Let me know if this yields any results.

<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations

            Well, the next option then is to try a repair upgrade. I know this sounds like I throwing solutions at you hoping one sticks.

    <title>How to connect to tfs&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marlonregenhardt  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to connect to tfs&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently realized, the company training me has an MSDN subscription, which also lets everyone use 130€ each onth on Azure, so I wanted to try some things.</p>
<p>Since I got my VM up and running, I set up a TFS for me and friends to more easily work together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem now is: I can't connect to it. I was hoping 
this would help me, but it's really only the simple way, which only works when you're in an already set up environment, where the admin already did pretty much everything else for you.
</p>
<p>Since I'm the one setting everything up, I need to learn to do it myself. Unfortunately, this article just states :</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If the drop-down list is empty, click the <span>Servers</span> button to manually enter the Team Foundation settings. Contact your Team Foundation Server administrator or team project administrator for the correct Team Foundation Server
 connection settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>That doesn't help at all, because if I had an administrator, I would have asked him in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a DefaultCollection on the server:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also the TFS integrated itself in the IIS, probably through the wizard:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also put an HTTPS rule at the Azure configuration:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this provided info helps, since all of the URLs I tried didn't work.</p>
<p>My VM has an xxx.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com URL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I'm surprised there isn't an Azure or dev or tfs category I can choose to post this to. I'm really tired right now, sorry if this is the wrong place to ask this.</p>

            <p>Is it just one particular .wmv file or all .wmv files?</p>
<p>If its just one and it won't play in any program that should be able to play it then its possible the file is corrupt.</p>
<p>Also, where did it/they come from/how was it produced?</p>

<p>Hello TE33ER,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for posting on the Xbox forums. Is your console enrolled in the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Insider Program</a>? Which troubleshooting steps have you attempted so far? Does this issue occur when you try using a different HDMI cable, or when you attempt to plug the HDMI cord into a different HDMI port on the television? Be sure to let us know
 the results!</p>

<p>In the Xbox One's 1710 update, Microsoft introduced new screen dimmer features to the console. Some of these features include large notifications that let you view invites at a glance, when you might not be paying attention to the TV, but also,
 a special technique designed to prevent against OLED burn-in and other types of image retention.</p>
<p>By the Xbox One screen dimmer, it will induce a screensaver of sorts, that not only defends against burn-in over longer periods of time but also "scrubs" image retention from the screen.</p>

<p>It's not a screenburn, its a problem with the video out signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to restart your console, check the cables and see if you can see/use other devices without that problem.</p>

            First thing I would do is try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.&nbsp; Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.&nbsp; Plug the power cord
 back in and restart the console.

<h2>            BO2 Create-A-Class System and Items</h2>
                    
<p>From <a href="http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/8/14/3241436/all-of-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-2-create-a-class-options-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> (linked by Mister Chompski in another thread; thought it deserved it's own) :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</i> incorporates a new way of creating multiplayer classes, letting you slot in 10 options at once to build the warfighter of your choosing — and an extensive list of options was shown at a Gamescom event last night in Cologne,
 Germany.</p>
<p>We quickly jotted down all of the options available to players using <a href="http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/8/14/3239603/call-of-duty-black-ops-2-multiplayer-custom-classes-perks-scorestreaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the new Pick 10 system</a> so far, save for a few primary attachment options on different types of guns. Keep in mind that the game's not out for another three months, so this likely isn't a final list — but as of right now, there's more than plenty to choose

<p>Some of the scorestreaks are interesting...Hellstorm Missile, Lightning Strike, Escort Drone, Warthog, Lodestar. I'm curious to see what those are like. All brand new to CoD.</p>

<p>I dont understand the "Use additional second perk, etccc" thingy? Maybe its like Specialists? Or you can use "points" to obtain more than three perks, but you wouldnt get equiptment or KSRs?</p>

<p>out of all the killstreaks (scorestreaks) that stupid Orbital VSAT looks like its going to **** me off like that stupid Blackbird did unless they have a legit counter for it. a stealth chopper seems kind of pointless considering all anyone has to do is look
 up to see it. the rest seem ok but sure most will be abused after a few months</p>
