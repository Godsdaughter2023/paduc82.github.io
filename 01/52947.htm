<p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a Microsoft account, you can reset your password online. For more info, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=238656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>
<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>
</li><li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;RT&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to contact your PC manufacturer.

<h2>            Stuck in the middle of intallation&#58; &#34;could not update registry data&#34;</h2>
                    My hard drive had a hardware malfunction and had to be replaced altogether. I just received my new hard drive, and after formatting it tried to install vista home premium 32b, which came with my dell inspiron 530 computer. About 10 minutes into the installation
 a message announcing that "windows could not update registry data" and that "installation was canceled". This repeated itself a few times. Any ideas why and how to resolve?<br />
Thank you.<br />

            HI-<br />
Other people who have had this problem report that choosing NOT to do the updates during install is allowing install to complete. They are then installing updates after the install completes. Are you seeing an option to not install updatesa as a part of the
 install?

<h3> kahepi  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIndows 10 Start Menu Tiles problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm currently using Windows 10 Home Single Language Version 1703, OS Build 15063.413 (Just installed yesterday)</p>
<p>Everything works perfectly fine except the Tiles on my Start Menu is not saving its location as I arranged it and it kept reverting back to where it was before I changed it.</p>
<p>I tried searching for solution for a while and I really have no idea how to fix this to be honest...</p>
<p>Oh and before I discovered this I did uninstalled a "few" apps that I do not need, wonder if that has anything to do with the problem.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me please. Thank you in advance. Have a nice day. (sorry for any grammatical errors)</p>

<h2>            HELP &#42; BSOD &#42; IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#42; ntoskrnl.exe &#42; Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any help I can get with this.&nbsp; I am, for all intents and purposes here, a layman.&nbsp; However, I can follow instructions well and get anyone all the info they may need (DMP files, etc.).&nbsp; I've been reading on here for a few days to try and figure
 out my problem myself, but it is beyond my scope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting multiple BSOD crashes over the past few months.&nbsp; They have increased in every way (frequency, time before death, etc.)&nbsp; I have seen multiple ones and at all different times, but let's start with the most frequent and hopefully the rest
 will fall into place afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL more than the others.&nbsp; It's a stop failure of the 0x0000000A type.&nbsp; The 4 parameters are:&nbsp; (ox0000000000000000,0x0000000000000002,0x0000000000000001,0xFFFFF800032980CF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After beating my head against the wall for weeks, I finally found BlueScreenViewer and downloaded it tonight.&nbsp; It associates those multiple IRQL errors with the ntoskrnl.exe driver, or what it calls NT Kernel and System.&nbsp; There are other crashes and errors,
 and they're all associated with .sys files, so I'm hoping this measly driver is the real culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further research hasn't helped me.&nbsp; There was a downloadable tool on one site called **** that claimed it could fix it. &nbsp;I got that.&nbsp; It ran a scan and found thousands of errors.&nbsp; Registry and everything.&nbsp; This is right after my Norton 360 finished
 scanning and found no registry errors or other problems.&nbsp; Anyway, it wanted me to register and I figured I better solicit help before I do anything drastic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did recently backup everything needed during an unusually long period of staying booted up.&nbsp; So I could do a full re-install if needed I guess</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I guess I should stop there and see what anyone recommends.</p>
<p>Thank you so much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Adam</p>

</p><p>I also didn't do the Speccy thing until now.&nbsp; 3rd time:</p>

</p><p>Easy.&nbsp; Symantec is killing netio.sys.&nbsp;&nbsp; IMHO it (symantec) is rubbish.&nbsp; I would remove it and use MSE in its place.&nbsp; You also have quite a few old drivers needing updating</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Symantec&nbsp; is a frequent cause of BSOD's.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>
<div><strong><br />
</strong></div>
<div>I would remove and replace it with Microsoft Security Essentials AT LEAST TO TEST<br />

            <p>Excellent.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I will begin your recommendations right away and see how far I get before I have to go to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere else on another site where someone like yourself recommended the same (or nearly the same) for an individual experiencing the same failures as me.&nbsp; That person also thought Norton was junk.&nbsp; Sounds like a general consensus out there, eh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny how companies like that with good advertising can make so much money.&nbsp; Am I off, or aren't they one of the top 2 or 3 right now selling protection software?&nbsp; What would you recommend as an overall replacement?&nbsp; I really enjoy some of their identity
 safe features.&nbsp; I also have Norton on my and my wife's smartphones.&nbsp; I'm sure there's plenty of options out there.&nbsp; I don't even mind paying annual fees for peace of mind of always updated virus definitions etc.&nbsp; I need something that does run in the background
 constantly scanning incoming e-mails, downloads and looking for phishing/malware.&nbsp; I leave my computer on for days at a time.&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is good cause my Norton is up for renewal end of March.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, is there any good test to verify&nbsp;these steps&nbsp;helped after I uninstall N360&nbsp;and setup temporary protection?&nbsp; It's crashed so many times at different times.&nbsp; I know it did it a lot while playing games, so I was afraid my new high dollar video card
 was doing it, but then it started becoming more random.&nbsp; I was surprised, in fact, to wake up and find my machine still running this morning and your reply waiting for me.&nbsp; It hasn't remained booted up overnight in several days.&nbsp; Pure luck I guess cause Norton
 has been on all night too I imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know running Dell's Support Assist scans...any of the more sever "stress tests", especially on memory kept crashing it the last few days.&nbsp; Any ideas of some tests I can try?&nbsp; Other than that, I know it's just a matter of waiting and letting time do it's
 thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, is that short list of .sys files the ones you say need updating?&nbsp; I need to try and figure out where they are (what they belong to/run) and how to update each of them.&nbsp; Hopefully each has a software tool for auto searching and updating.&nbsp; If not,
 I'll need to figure where to go in cyberspace and get them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you thank you thank you so much!!!&nbsp; I was about to unplug and tote this thing into a shop (which is a chore in and of itself as I live at least 250 miles from any reputable computer shop).&nbsp; I hate that.&nbsp; I fix all my own stuff from changing a lightbulb
 to fixing my kids toys and my wife's gadgets to overhauling engines to repairing appliances&nbsp;to, in most cases, straightening out my computer.&nbsp; This one just beat the heck out of me.&nbsp; I sure hope this helps, but in any case, I'm so appreciative of your time
 and effort to help people like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respectfully,</p>

</p><p>I/we are happy to help.&nbsp; frankly I learned how to do this because I was tired of the crashes myself.&nbsp; Have been in your shoes and it is why I volunteer here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most people who analyze DMP files are in consensus these three are to be avoided.&nbsp; Symantec, McAfee, &amp; Kaspersky.&nbsp; Almost anything else will work.&nbsp; There is a reason they give those away (almost) on new machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div><strong>How To Find Drivers:</strong>
<div><strong><br />
Search</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Google for the name of the driver<br />
<strong>Compare</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>the Google results with what's installed on your system to figure out which device/program it belongs to<br />
<strong>Visit</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>the web site of the manufacturer of the hardware/program to get the latest drivers (DON'T use Windows Update or the Update driver function of Device Manager).<br />
If there are difficulties in locating them, post back with questions and someone will try and help you locate the appropriate program<br />
<br />

            <p>Excellent excellent excellent help.&nbsp; I was going to wait to ask my final question until after I finish all this, but while I have you on the hook, so to speak, here it is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were there any issues found related to OTHER problems?&nbsp; I only went with the IRQL problem first cause it was happening at least 1000x more than the others.&nbsp; I also recorded the following BSoD errors over the last few weeks (these are only the ones I was
 sitting there long enough to see/remember):</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>fltmgr.sys</p>
<p>SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION (this one was immediately after trying the driver verifier)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did those popo out in your skimming of the DMP files?</p>
<p>Am I to be concerned of any other hidden issues after Symantec is gone?</p>

</p><p>Symantec is rubbishware.&nbsp; If you have stopped crashing you can assume the problem is resolved.&nbsp; You do need to update "those" drivers.&nbsp; If you continue to crash upload those DMP files.</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this might be opinion only, but what about Bitdefender?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been researching reviews and independent labs ever since I started this. &nbsp;It gets a lot of the highest reviews. &nbsp;Unfortunately so do the big 3 you mentioned, but Bitdefender seems to be surpassing them in performance etc. &nbsp;Are they safe(er) on Windows?
 &nbsp;Less crashes? &nbsp;Just want an opinion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I'm only talking about an all-inclusive internet security suite here. &nbsp;I'm sure you knowledgeable guys probably use individual proprietary programs for each task (ie antivirus/malware, phishing, repair, password management, parental controls, firewall,
 etc. etc.)</p>
<p>Thanks so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and I did have trouble getting all those drivers still. &nbsp;I posted a separate thread to see who can help with that.</p>
<p><br />
So far, no crashes since removing Norton and using MSE as a test. &nbsp;Awesome!</p>

</blockquote>
What is happening is that you are not holding the power button down long enough to effect a forced shutdown. All you are doing is sleeping or hibernating the sp4 so when u power up you are at the same point as when you thought you were powering down. &nbsp;What
 you need to do is hold the power button down for 20-30 seconds, release and then press the power button for a second or two to power up.

<p>Whether or not you have the latest driver is not what matters ... what matters is whether you have a driver for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000005526/graphics-drivers.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this web page on Intel's website</a>, Intel doesn't support your graphics chipset on Windows 10. That
 means Intel hasn't tested it on Windows 10 and hasn't kept the driver up-to-date with Windows 10. For this reason, Intel really doesn't know whether that graphics chipset will work properly on Windows 10, or if it will work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing that Microsoft can do about this, because only Intel can maintain its hardware and write drivers for its hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a hardware manufacturer stops supporting its hardware, that doesn't mean that the hardware immediately stops working. It will continue to work, sometimes for years, until its unsupported driver can no longer keep up with the changes to Windows. That's
 when it begins to fail, and the only thing you can do is replace it.</p>

<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.

<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

<h2>            Disconnecting xbox live from my profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Today I wanted to download an update for Skyrim, so I finally made an Xbox Live account seeing as that is the only way I could download the update. However, this changed my normal profile to an Xbox Live profile with some stupid gamertag. How do I return
 my account to a normal account with my own name, seeing as I have zero interest in playing online or using Xbox Live for any service whatsoever? I just want my profile to have my own first name again, but this isn't possible because it's now connected to Xbox
 Live and somebody else online already has it.</p>

<p>Now that it's been connected to the server, you can't undo anything. You can just remain disconnected in order to not use the service, but since someone else on Live already has your gamertag, you would not be able to change the gamertag back to that.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">Xbox LIVE allows you one free gamertag change from the system-generated tag that you were given. &nbsp;You may, however, be unable to get exactly the same gamertag you had previously
 due to the fact that someone else on Xbox LIVE apparently already has your old profile name/gamertag.&nbsp; You can, however, get something similar... maybe add some numbers or something to the end of it.&nbsp; If you insist on having the same name, you can, of course,
 create a new offline profile with the same name but you would, unfortunately,&nbsp;lose all your achievements and gamerscore points.&nbsp; If you do want to change your system-generated tag just follow these simple steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can easily change your Xbox Live gamertag. If your gamertag was created for you during your initial Xbox Live sign-up (meaning, you did not choose your gamertag), you can change the gamertag once for free. Additional Xbox Live gamertag changes
 cost extra. <b>To change your Xbox Live gamertag</b></p>
<ol>
<li>On your Xbox console, sign in using the Xbox Live gamertag that you want to change.
</li><li>Go to <b>Social</b>, and then select your Avatar. </li><li>Scroll right and select <b>Change Gamertag</b>. </li><li>Note the <b>Price</b>of the change, and do one of the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>Select <b>Enter New Gamertag</b>. If the gamertag you enter is already taken, you will be prompted to try another gamertag.
</li><li>Select <b>Get Suggestions</b> to view possible gamertags. </li></ul>
</li><li>Once you enter or select a new gamertag, select <b>Yes, use this gamertag</b>.
</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 153, 1)">After changing your tag, I would highly recommend you cancel auto-renew on your Xbox LIVE Gold account.&nbsp; Even if you have a 30-day free trial, you are typically asked to provide
 credit or debit card information and by accepting the terms of use you are authorizing Microsoft to charge your card on auto-renew for your monthly subscription.&nbsp; If you cancel auto-renew your account will be downgraded to a free "Silver" account at the end
 of the billing cycle.&nbsp; Here is a link that provides info on how to manage your Xbox Live Gold subscription and auto-renewal options.&nbsp;

</p><p>It would help to know what you saw.&nbsp; E.g.&nbsp; if your setup is supposed to be Second Screen Only&nbsp; CursorUp would be going to Extend.&nbsp; Then if you weren't looking at the primary screen, "doesn't seem to work" would mean trying to use the existing problem resolution
 could not be used with that mode either.&nbsp; I was actually imagining that you would be in Extend already with a PC screen primary in which case CursorUp would have caused a Duplicate state with the PC screen's resolution.</p>

            I have a similar problem with a new HP laptop with the new I5-8250 processor. It works fine in 1703, but on 1709 connecting to the HDMI port yields a message similar to the above on a Samsung TV and a complete garbage screen on my Panasonic. I've tried
 multiple cables and have tried updating to the latest Intel display driver. None of this fixes the problem. As mentioned above the HDMI port works fine with Win10 1703 and I have other computers with 1709 that work fine with the televisions.&nbsp; I've tried all
 the possible resolutions and display options (extend, duplicate, 2nd only) and the problem persists.

<p>
</p><p>That's a symptom the "magic bullet" can help with. &nbsp; Press Win+Ctrl+Shift+B&nbsp; (more than once is often needed in my experience).&nbsp; Also, since you are not able to know what you should be seeing you should enable Narrator (press Win+Ctrl+Enter) to get more
 clues about what is actually there.&nbsp; In fact, sometimes, merely enabling Narrator is enough to resolve the symptom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

<p>Thank you for your suggestions. I l have tried both with no success. I don't really need narrator since I was duplicating the laptop screen, but I turned it on anyway with no change on the television. It appears that there is something with Win10 1709 that
 interferes with HDMI on some computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had contacted HP tech support and they passed the buck to Microsoft. I guess my question at this point is whether I should return the computer to the place of purchase for a refund (I have that option) or keep it and expect Microsoft to eventually fix
 the problem. Do you or anyone else have any experience with the likelihood of their doing that?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
That message means the drive is not even formatted. <br />
<br />
Plug it into another computer to see if it is recognized. <br />
<br />
If not then the USB enclosure itself could have had a failure. Or something, possibly malware, removed the volume on the drive.<br />
<br />
Why did you have to Reset that computer? Could that issue be related to this drive issue?<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps. <br />

            Hi Eagle. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Was the drive plugged in when you Reset Windows?  Did you do the deep clean reset?
<br />
<br />Have you tried the drive in another PC?
<br />
<br />Look over the suggestions here:  <a href="https://www.easeus.com/resource/disk-unknown-not-initialized.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/resource/disk-unknown-no...</a>
<br />
<br />If it wasn't wiped then you can try a Partition Recovery software like this one that has saved other drives that weren't formatted but lost their partitions:
<br /><a href="http://www.partitionwizard.com/help/partition-recovery.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partitionwizard.com/help/partition-r...</a>
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then you can try Data Recovery software like this free starter program:  <a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva/features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/recuva/features</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>What's your make and model of laptop? You will most likely need to install drivers provided by the manufacturer. Take a look at this troubleshooting guide and see if it helps to resolve your issue:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Completed both steps with no resolution. Was very scared to go in and turn off all the start up stuff but did it, then after restart enabled again like direction said to do. I am thinking I will just look for other ways to get a stupid game of freecell to
 waste time with. </p>

            Well, what do you know, one day as I was going about other business, all of a sudden a message comes up that the Microsoft Solitaire program was downloaded. I guess you need to ignore it and it will eventually do what it is supposed to do! Thanks<br />

<p>1. Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<div>2. Did you check the speed by just connecting this computer to the router and disconnecting all the other device from it and check?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please try the following methods and check if that resolves the issue:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1</strong>: Run the Internet Connections Troubleshooter and Network Adapter Troubleshooter</div>

            You obviously did not understand the question.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with&nbsp;internet connectivity.&nbsp; Edge is frozen and is unusable because of whatever caused the message to appear.&nbsp; It cannot be undone.&nbsp; When you select ok it takes you to another page that
 also cannot be undone.&nbsp; I can open Internet Explorer and it works just fine.

            The same thing happened to me. It's one of those browser blocker scams. Do not ever call the phone number that's listed or you'll have even more problems. Please help us get rid of this. Mine has affected Microsoft Edge. I had antivirus software running
 at the time but it didn't help stop these scoundrels. I have run an AV scan, Malwarebytes, and Hitman Pro, all to no avail. The only solution I have found so far is to have my computer reset to factory state. No deal!!!

<p>After opening the popup, Narrator is not reading the popup content and still reading the background web page&nbsp;content tough it is disabled [ We are using windows 8 and Narrator shortcut key is

    <title>Trouble synching mapped network drive Windows 8 over VPN - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fineal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Trouble synching mapped network drive Windows 8 over VPN</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I have recently bought a Sony Vaio Pro13 with Windows 8. I have also just upgraded to Windows 8.1. I have another laptop running windows 7 to which I have mapped the network drive at my place of work. On the W7 computer, files are available offline and I can
 synchronize them without any problem using the VPN. <br />
<br />
I mapped the network drive to my new laptop running windows 8 but only about half of the offline files were made available offline and it was not possible to synchronize. I then started again, by deleting the mapped drive, deleting the offline files in the
 CSC folder, moved the folder elsewhere and increased the space available for offline files. I then successfully mapped the drive and copies of all offline files were available on the laptop (after about 2 hours of synchronizing!).
<br />
<br />
However, I have not been able to synchronize the files since. The VPN works for other things (e.g. subscription websites which need a VPN connection) but the network drive is showing as either offline, or when I try to synchronize, the process begins and then
 I get a 'failed' message (currently 'the username or password is incorrect'). This can't be the case, or I wouldn't be on the VPN or accessing emails via Outlook - and in any case, it worked once with exactly the same credentials. I double checked in the windows
 credentials as well. The sync centre also says that the drive is 'offline (background sync)'.
<br />
<br />
My IT administrators do not have any suggestions apart from removing 8 and installing 7 because they do not currently support Windows 8...<br />
<br />
Do you have any suggestions as to why the VPN works, the files have been made available offline, but the networked drive will now not sync?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
Liz<br />

            Win 7 will automatically detect the NIC drivers but not the wifi card drivers. The easiest way is to attach a network cable to your computer and run windows update. This will update your display drivers(I have geforce go6800 and it worked) and your wifi
 card drivers. So now you will have proper display and wireless internet. Now you can go to dell website and download sound card drivers for i9300(xp version). Run the drivers in compatibility mode for win xp and you will have sound on your computer.

<p>I have the Entertainment For All Plan, and about a month ago (YES, I have been waiting for almost a month...), I tried signing in and was told my account had been suspended until I update my payment option. So I tried doing this on the xbox website, and
 I continuously get the "oops, it appears you've found a glitch in the system" page every time I attempt to update my payment option.</p>
<p>I eventually updated my payment option via the microsoft website, and now I get a message on my console saying "This payment option cannot be used, please select another". I know I can't use paypal for the EFA plan so I used my credit card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it's been about a month since I've gotten in touch with xbox support, and I still haven't heard back from them. I was being patient, using a secondary account to play. But here's where it gets ugly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I turned on my xbox and a pop up appeared stating that "This console cannot play until your subscription payments are up to date". This is absolutely ridiculous, I have the money on my card to pay my balance but it wont let me. I'm losing both patience
 and faith in Microsoft here. Someone please help me out. I'm currently waiting for a phone call from support, so I'll add any details that may help once I get off the phone with them. But this will be my fourth time calling them regarding this issue so frankly,
 I don't have high hopes for a resolution...</p>

<p>Suggest you contact a Billing Agent. You can choose Option<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"> 1</span> after</p>
<p>finding your country's support line: See <a href="http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://tinyurl.com/XBLnumbers</a> -</p>
<p>but a faster way to speak to a Billing Agent is to go to <a href="http://xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://xbox.com</a> -</p>
<p>sign in there if you can - then go to</p>

<p>Well, my experience with phone support was a devastating failure. The first time I called, I had a rude person on the other end who couldn't help me at all, had no idea what I was talking about and "accidentally" hung up the phone and never called back.(His
 name was Adrian, if Bill Gates is reading this I suggest you have him fired lol) The second time I called I talked to a lady with an unnecessary attitude who said everything was fine with my account, no outstanding balances whatsoever( so why is my console
 bricked until I pay my subscription off?????) and implied that I had done something wrong and to check with my bank. The bank said everything was fine with my payment option, my account had more than enough to cover the $15 monthly payment. It also accepts
 zero balance transfers and recurring payments so the second lady I talked to clearly was no help at all. She literally told me to call the bank and then got off the phone as fast as she could. At this point in the evening, I was more than aggravated to say
 the least. So FINALLY I was connected to a nice, well mannered lady who actually knew how to do her job. We made progress determining the status of my account, and unfortunately we were not able to open an escalation because there was already one in progress.
 But heres the thing. This nice, patient young lady took a look at my investigation and found that NO ONE HAD INVESTIGATED IT SINCE DECEMBER 17TH 2012.</p>
<p>Let me do some math real quick. </p>
<p>This problem began approximately December 3rd of 2012. By the 5th I had MS helping me out (or so I thought) and an escalation report was filed. I patiently waited to hear back from microsoft, but it obviously wasn't going to happen so I called on January
 2nd only to deal with 2 rude employees and a nice one who just plain told me she couldn't do anything,
</p>
<p>So lets add this up. </p>
<p>Dec 5th - Jan 6th (today) 33 days of microsoft taking their sweet time not helping me.</p>
<p>(Last time my issue was looked into) Dec 17th - Jan 6th (today) means that Microsoft hasn't even bothered to resolve or take a look at my problem in 21 days/ 3 weeks</p>
<p>I've been with microsoft since windows '98 and the original xbox. Me and Microsoft go way back.
</p>
<p>And to take the problem of a long time supporter such as my self and put it on the backburner for 3 weeks is nothing less than unacceptable. It is absolutely insulting. Words cannot describe how disappointed and frustrated I am over this quagmire of a situation.
</p>
<p>I'm gonna give them a call today and see if any progress has been made since the 17th but at this rate, maybe I'll be able to play again in 2017 if I'm lucky.

<p>I surely do understand your frustration. I would make sure to ask the agent who calls you next for replacement time to offset your frustration.</p>

<p>Dude, I am in the same boat as you except I never even bought the Entertainment For All Plan. I bought my xbox brand new from ebay and I receive the message: "Sorry this console can't play until your subsciption payments are up to date.".</p>
<p>I've talked to support multiple times and they have been unable to help me. They said they need to bring in a "specialist". Which they said could take a week or so. I still haven't heard anything and my console is bricked. I am really frustrated with Microsoft
 and their whole support system. </p>
<p>Hopefully I get a response. I have two games from Gamefly that have been sitting on my desk for two weeks because my Xbox is useless.

<p>Potato Joe, your problem is significantly different. These D-I-Y forums work best when you create a new thread with a first post of your own, as the original poster's problem and solution, although similar, could be very different in detail. It's great that
 you're researching here, but the quickest path to a solution is your own thread. That being said, only the Billing Agents can help you at this point, and evidently they needed to review the data to look to see what's got your account jammed up.

<p>I have this same issue. The difference for me is that I paid for a 12-month Xbox Live subscription in November, and in December cancelled the card due to fraudulent activity. Now, even though I already paid the money, it's giving me the message you got,
 not allowing me to play Live for almost a month now even though I already paid for it. The payment management section of the website gives me the glitch error every time, so I can't change my credit card info. I contacted support, and was simply told that
 they couldn't even find my account and that they couldn't help me. That was it. I'm going to try contacting them again, and hopefully they'll credit me a month of Live since I haven't been able to do anything.</p>
