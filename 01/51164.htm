<p>Apologies, but you do not receive an email invite. &nbsp;The invite is sent out via an Xbox LIVE message and if you fail to accept the invite before the message expires, you will unfortunately not be able to participate. &nbsp;The Preview Program invites have slowed

    <title>Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download NBA Virtual Currency, error code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thenephites221  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download NBA Virtual Currency, error code 80153003 HELP&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I've spent an hour on the phone with xbox support, and another 3 hours talking to four different people on xbox support chat online. They've offered few solutions and got me nowhere, so I'm here for some help from ya'll.</p>

<p>I'm trying to purchase NBA virtual currency from NBA2k13, and as soon as I confirm the download, it brings up error code 80153003 and tells me that it's having trouble downloading the data/download from live. It urges me to clear my cache and if the problem
 persists to contact xbox.</p>

<p>A quick google search reveals that other people who have this problem have just called and had their problem resolved. I have not. I've cleared my cache several times, cleared the active download queue, restarted my system after each cache clear. Deleted
 the marketplace cache data. Quadruple checked my network. Checked my hard drive and checked deletion suggestions for any corrupted or incomplete files that were downloaded with a yellow exclamation point. Added a new payment method and tried to pay with that
 new one (paypal.) Still get the same problem.</p>
<p><br />
Now here's some extra information. I was on a family live account, and just got migrated to a new account recently. Points leftover from my gamertag got translated into currency. I haven't purchased anything since then, so this is my first attempt. I have tried
 multiple times to add a credit card to my account, but my bank isn't authorizing the card, so I'll be handling that soon. So I don't have a credit card attatched, but I do have a paypal connected to my account.</p>

<p>I have not tried to download anything else from the marketplace, or from anywhere else in the NBA game, or on xbox live, as there's nothing else I want to purchase, and I'm not trying to waste money. But i haven't tried to download anything free either,
 but I have had to download a required game update everytime I clear my cache, so I can still download some things, I think it's just purchases that won't work.</p>

<p>Again, please help. So far I've got nothing, and I'd love to be able to spend money with microsoft but they're making it so difficult for me to do so. Take my money!</p>

            <p>Hey there Nephites! <strong>Thanks for making such an awesome post with all that information and detail!</strong> That definitely helps us get a better handle on your situation. =)<br /><br />Okay then, the first thing I'd like to do is isolate where the purchasing issue lies on your account (NBA 2k13 content, paid content, or all content).<br /><br /><strong>If you can, please go onto the Xbox Live Marketplace and try "purchasing" some free things.</strong> <em>For example, Halo 3 is the current free Game with Gold so (age permitting) you should be able to purchase that for free.</em> Snag up some free games/demos from the marketplace and make sure to mark down if you get any errors.<br /><br />That will help us find out if the issue lies with all content or just with paid content on your account. From there, we might be able to narrow down what exactly is going on. So hit us back with that information and we'll be standing by to hear from you. ^_^</p>

<p>I can download free things, I even purchased and downloaded an add-on for black ops 2. So evidently the problem lies specifically with the NBA game, so I'll contact 2k sports to see if they know, it's just so odd that it immediately refuses the transaction
 and gives me an xbox live error code.</p>

<p>RESOLVED. To anyone finding this post, 2K sports stopped selling VC on NBA 2k13 on October 15th 2013, but didn't make it very well known or any good announcements about it. This is extremely unfortunate as my first attempt to download VC came on October
 16th 2013. ....Really? Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            Elite controller falling apart</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox elite controller from around launch time about 4 months after owning it the rubber grips started to bubble. I contacted support and they told me they could do nothing for me because I&nbsp;was out of warranty. Fast forward a year later and one of my joysticks started acting funny getting loose and doing the wander I've heard so many complain about. I called back again and still no help I'm out of warranty and Xbox no help. despite the fact I&nbsp;bought their elite system brand new for 500.00 and spent countless on their games and Xbox gold membership. Now we reach present day i'm reading online that somewhere around the start or Mid of 2017 they extended the elite controller warranty. It's now march of 2018 and I&nbsp;call back yet again wondering why I&nbsp;hadn't received notification of this extension.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was then told they still could do nothing for me and when asked to speak to a supervisor i was met with ever excuse not to let me. This is horrible all I&n

    <title>Remove windows security update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrew-1111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove windows security update</h2>
                    <p>Windows recently installed a security update on my desktop (security update for Microsoft .NET framework 4.5.2) that is not installed correctly and I believe is causing problems. Windows 7 on my desktop freezes upon reaching the starting windows screen.
 I would like to remove the security update to see if that remedies the issue but every time I try an error message appears saying the Uninstallation did not succeed. (Attempted removing it while in windows safe mode) Need help figuring out how to uninstall
 it. Appreciate any help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>NEED TO RECOVER Accidental CMD deletion of folders and important work - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            NEED TO RECOVER Accidental CMD deletion of folders and important work on my desktop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm 16 years old and I'm in the middle of my GCSE's at school!</p>
<p>This morning I happened to come across a file that I had saved to my desktop screen that was not deleting and so I found instructions online to help me with this problem and I did so using CMD ADMIN.</p>
<p>It happened that: instead of deleting the file that wouldn't delete, it deleted everything on my desktop screen, including all of my GCSE work . My projects for school that were on there have gone and there is no way to find them in rubbish bin or previous
 versions.&nbsp;<strong>Please! I need to recover these files from where ever they are!! My future depends on them!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Help would very much be appreciated ASAP!</strong></p>
<p><strong>I will list what I did on CMD ADMIN:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>cd /d C:\Users\*****\Desktop</strong></p>
<p><strong>dir /x</strong></p>
<p>(And then it showed me a list of folder/file names from my desktop screen. The file that I presumed was the file was named "." (which is a DIR?) and it was the most recent folder on the list so that's why I went on to type)</p>
<p><strong>rmdir /q /s .</strong></p>
<p>(and then my entire desktop was wiped clear of all of my folders and so I really need to undo what I have done!!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My assumption now is that "." with DIR next to it meant my entire desktop!:(</p>
<p>If anyone can help me, it would mean the world to me!!<br />
Many thanks,<br />
</p>
<p>Charles Chetwynd<br />

<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Rmdir</span></strong><span> command is same&nbsp;as deleting a file or folder, when using this command you can use two parameters<strong>
 /S</strong> and <strong>/Q</strong>, where the <strong>/S</strong> removes all directories and files in the specified directory in addition to the directory itself. Used to remove a directory tree. However,
<strong>/Q</strong> quiets mode, do not ask if ok to remove a directory tree with /S.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To retrieve the deleted data, you will have to run a data recovery, which you can do by using any third party software.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Microsoft doesn’t recommend it.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Based on your account, it&nbsp;looks like you have merged a Microsoft email address to your Skype account. Did you link the same email address connected to these two accounts: live:AccountName and live:AccountName_2 to your Skype account (AccountName)?</p>
<p>If you did, then you just need to wait for 90 days for the other live IDs to be deleted. Live ID&nbsp;accounts are being automatically deleted by our system if not accessed within 90 days.</p>

<p>1. Some processes were taking most of your processor share (upto 50% or more for example avp.exe, svchost.exe).</p>
<p>2. A graphics card intensive application is running (eg. Games).</p>
<p>3. There is large amount of dust in the PC so there is problem of ventilation which makes the PC hot and trigger the far to speed up to cool the PC.</p>
<p>4. The cooler or heat sink is not functioning properly or it is somehow disconnected from the processor.</p>
<p>Solution</p>
<p>1. Run Task manager and sort the process list based on processor share and see which application is taking the highest. Once identified, repair, remove or end the process.</p>
<p>2. Stop playing games or other GPU intensive application or use cooling pad if you still want to use them.</p>
<p>For 3 and 4 Take it to a nearby hp service center and tell them the problem.</p>

<h2>            Apps&#47;Games Won&#39;t Launch Anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My computer has, as far as I know, been functioning fine until the recent Windows 10 update. On Friday January 13, 2017 (Friday the 13th? Coincidence?), the update was installed. Afterwards, the computer struggled with booting. When I went to click on the
 Start button, it would reboot. This happened a number of times, until I got a blue screen and message that said Windows had failed to start properly and asking me what I wanted to do. I tried to restore to prior to the update. It didn't really help, and neither
 did doing a safe start. Eventually, I was able to get the computer to boot, and I could launch Edge to go on the internet. I couldn't run any games, however. The game launcher would run, but when you click to play, the game wouldn't launch or it would cause
 another reboot. Reboots can also happen just after it has been running for awhile. I then tried a complete reset of Windows 10, but the problems remained. I tried downloading a new video driver, but no help there either. I've done clean boots and it didn't
 help. I'm not sure what to try next. I don't understand why everything has been fine up until now since I got the computer in June. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            I have already done this reset. It did not help. The problem of unlaunchable apps remains. The constant crashing and rebooting has stopped, but I still can't launch things beyond Edge. Windows tells me everything is performing correctly, but I am wondering
 if there is a hardware issue. Still, seems like Windows should know if the graphics card is not functioning as intended.

<h2>            use an external screen while the surface book is closed</h2>
                    On an advertisement from Microsoft, I have viewed a picture of someone working on their surface book, using an external screen while the surface book is closed. How can I do this? I bought a mini display port - hdmi adapter for my surface dock, connected
 it to an external screen which then shows what is on my surface screen. When I close the lid of my surface, the picture also goes out on the external screen. How can I keep working while the lid is closed?&nbsp;

<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this up. To help you out, type <em><strong>'Control Panel'</strong></em> on the

<strong>Control Panel</strong> window, select <strong>System and Security</strong> then choose
<strong>Power Options</strong>. From the left panel of the window, click <strong>
'Choose what closing the lid does'</strong>. Look for the <strong>'When I close the lid'</strong>, click the dropdown list then select
<em><strong>'Do nothing'</strong></em> under <strong>"On battery"</strong> and/or
<strong>"Plugged in"</strong> whichever you are currently using. Once done, click
<strong>'Save changes'</strong>.<br />
<br />
Should you need additional troubleshooting, press <strong>Windows key + P</strong>, then you may choose either
<em><strong>'Extend'</strong></em> or <em><strong>'Second screen only'</strong></em>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it turns out.

<div>I recently bought a new computer running Windows 8, and tried to install Civilization IV on it. &nbsp;The computer now tells me that it cannot run the program. &nbsp;Is there any fix for this? &nbsp;Is Windows 8 not reverse compatible?</div>

            <div>Hi Tony,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and giving us an opportunity to assist you on this issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>From the description of the query, it seems like you are unable install the game ‘Civilization IV’ on the computer as it prompts that it cannot run the program.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would like to gather some information on this issue to help you in a better way on this issue:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Which version of Civilization IV game are you trying to install on the computer?<br />
2) What is the exact error message that you get when you try to install the game?<br />
3) How are you trying to install the game? Is it using a media or using a downloaded file?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since, the installation fails and prompts that it cannot run the program, lets’ check if the game is compatible with Windows 8.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can check of the compatibility using Windows compatibility center. Refer to the link to check:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the game is not compatible with Windows 8, we can install the game in Windows compatibility mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can refer the link to install the game in Windows compatibility mode:<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the section “<strong>Apply a compatibility mode</strong>”:</div>

            <p>Hi there!&nbsp; I got it running just fine on mine, but you'll have to do a complete reinstallation, from disk or download, and re-enter your registration key.&nbsp; Even sets up tiles on that awful screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It autoinstalls just fine, but after you do (and before you launch it the first time, right-click on the tile (or tiles, if you have several versions), choose properties, then set it to always run in compatibility mode.&nbsp; THEN launch it for the first time.&nbsp;
 It'll take&nbsp; while to launch because it's reading your system and configuring itself.&nbsp; Thereafter, it'll launch in a reasonable amount of time.&nbsp; Repeat process separately for each version you have--Warlord, Beyond the Sword, and so on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sigh.&nbsp; If I could only figure out how to make Zork run again! :)</p>

            Thanks - I feel like you got me halfway there, but it still does not load. &nbsp;I have it set to run on compatibility mode with XP service pack 3. &nbsp;It starts to load, but then asks me to put in the correct CD and try again - even though I started the program
 WITH THE CD using autoplay. &nbsp;Any thoughts?

            <p>Most popular strategy game in the history of gaming.&nbsp; But was last update was 2004 which xp sp2.&nbsp; The only version that will work on 64 bit systems is the download version from directtodrive and a few other places.&nbsp; that loads the already updated version
 into yoru computer you can't cd it and then upgrade it won't work didn't even in windows 7 64bit&nbsp; windows 7 32 bit worked just fine.&nbsp; There was originally some 16 bit code in the game installer as this game goes all the way back to windows 3.1 for DOS 5.0
 which as 8 bit.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If Microsoft would like to be a help not just for games but other devices and software a 16 bit emulator for 64 bit windows would be of great use for corporate upgrades.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please take the time to understand the question before giving advice would also be of help when trying to overcome problems encurred by forced market upgrades by the Microsoft corporation who's only interested is you buying from their new store app.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>compatibility mode will only jump 1 level of bit compatibility.&nbsp; 32 bit software can emulate 16&nbsp; 64 can emulate 32.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no built in windows 64 to 16 compatibility.</p>

            If anyone is still looking for this, windows ten will have the same problem, this is because certain .dll files are missing, these can be msvcp or msvcr71 among others such as python24.dll or boost_python.dll. To solve this I would refer you to this page:
 http://modiki.civfanatics.com/index.php/How_to_Install_the_SDK<br />
<br />
The section "installing the tools" when fully downloaded should have provided any .dll files that are missing and therefore allow the game to run.

<h2>            Change SurfaceGo photo file name format</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Good afternoon all,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>My phone and Go upload the photos I take with these devices to my Onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>The phone uses a file name format like IMG_20180920_134314.jpg , but unfortunately the Go uses a format like WIN_20180919_15_26_07_Pro
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>How Do I make the Go format the same as the phone format, or at least change the WIN to IMG ? ?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<span>&nbsp;</span>Alright, let me explain it further to you. If you are taking and saving Picture on your Surface Go the format will be

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I deleted my skype account by mistake I thought I was uninstalling it from my old&nbsp; pc and it turns out I deleted my account. How do i reactivate it? Also I am living in a different country now from when I had signed up so I cant verify the country&nbsp; lived
 in when I set it up over 7 years ago and the information I used to create the account 7 years ago was very limited so there isn't much information I can verify. Also I hardly use the email I had set up skype from and I always signed in with my skype name.</p>
<p>I really need to reactivate my account asap the family members I contact are elderly and I cant get their information, everything was set up with my account automatically.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

</p><p>You have to ensure that the account you logged in to is the account you accidentally processed a deletion for. You do not need to do anything else as the cancellation will automatically be cancelled once you sign back in to the account.&nbsp;</p>

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; First try a different TV or monitor to see if that helps.&nbsp; You could also try power cycling the console by holding the power button for 10 seconds till it shuts down.&nbsp; If all else fails you can also try factory resetting the console.&nbsp;
 There's an option to keep installed games and apps so you won't need to redownload them

            Microsoft do not have solution for this issue this is a scam...Only solution is now to purchase a new TV to solve this issue and to view your purchase movie which Microsoft had you paid for and now you cannot view on your new xbox upgrade console, unless
 now you upgrade you TV set.....Xbox and TV manufacturers are in cahoots with each other...all they want is consumer to purchase new products....why upgrade if o e device is not compatible with the other device....why make new console evry two to three years
 if its not going to be compatible with people TV sets....can so.eone at Microsoft explain...

<h2>            Problemas com o Magic&#58; The Gathering &#40;antigo&#41; depois de migrar.</h2>
                    
<p>Olá! Após migrar minha conta, não consegui mais jogar o Magic. Quando entro no jogo, ele diz que é versão trial, e não importa quantas vezes eu faça o download novamente, ele nunca sai desse estado de Trial. Já tentei excluir as DLCs, mas não deu certo.
 Será que se limpar o cache da certo? E como faz para limpar o cache? O que mais vai acontecer se eu limpar o cache do game?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valeu!</p>

<p>limpando o cache vc vai limpar todas as atualizações do hd ou seja, no seu caso acho q não serve pra nada mas se quiser limpar o cache msm assim:</p>
<p>acessar a opção "Memory" do sistema, colocar o marcador em "Hard Drive", apertar "Y"' para mostrar os detalhes e então apertar a seguinte sequência de botões: &nbsp;X,X,LB,RB,X,X Se o procedimento for feito corretamente, será exibida a mensagem: "Do you want
 to perform maintenance on your Xbox 360 storage devices?" ("Você deseja executar a manutenção em seus dispositivos de armazenamento do Xbox 360", em português) ele vai limpar o cache sem formatar o HD</p>

<h3> vja142  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Photo Editor Changes November 2016 - Completely Dislike New Version</h2>
                    <p><strong>I just sat down to edit photos and I'm completely</strong><strong>&nbsp;shocked and in a panic by the new changes to Photo Editor... I really hate this new version. I cannot use it in this new format at all.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I do a lot of photography, loved and solely relied (past tense) on Windows Photo Editor.. I have edited hundreds and hundreds of gorgeous photos over the past year with the former version of Windows 10
 Photo Editor. (see below)&nbsp;</span>I don't use filters. I loved the way I could control all aspects of tweaking the photo just right whether it was adjusting shadows, color, light or crispness. I do a lot of bird photography and one size does not fit all!! Even
 the button where you could toggle between the original and edited version before saving is gone. Who did Microsoft make this new version for???&nbsp;<strong>Is there a way to get the former version of Photo Editor back???</strong></p>
<p><br />
With the prior version I did not need to use PhotoShop or Lightoom but now I will have to. This version is unusable for me and like I said, I'm in a panic because I just sat down to comb through several hundred photos with hopes of perfectly editing ten or
 so prints.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft, how could you do this to serious photographer hobbyist???? I guess it's time to bite the bullet and go to Adobe Lightroom... ugh.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Update to my original post on Sunday:</strong> I was really upset at Microsoft initially, however now I should thank them for giving me the push I needed to advance to a better editing platform.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased Adobe CC Lightroom, spent an afternoon learning the basics and all I can say is WOW, far superior results and I will never go back to MS. With MS Photo Editor I was taking the easy way out. After working with Lightroom for a couple of days, I
 went back and re-edited a couple of older photos and compared versions... <strong>
Adobe Lightroom is far superior, giving a photographer much more creative control. No wonder serious photogs rely on Adobe, I get it now!</strong> As a photography hobbyist, Lightroom ups the game. It was a little overwhelming at first, found a great YouTube
 tutorial for learning Lightroom 6 basics, it's the way to go! Five stars and two thumbs up for Adobe CC Lightroom 6.</p>

            <p>VJA 142, I agree with everything you have posted here about the new photo editor. I can understand making changes if it is going to make improvements to the program, but this newer program has less to offer. I also love photography and had thousands of pictures
 that I was in the process of editing. It was so upsetting to start working on my pictures and see that the format had changed and I couldn't do half of the things I used to be able to do with the program. I to am now going to have to shop around for a new
 program. It is such a disappointment. </p>
<p>By the way, your photo of the bird is absolutely stunning!</p>

            I was very unhappy with the automatic/unwanted update as well. I found a note on another site and the advise given was to go to your control panel, then system and security, then security and maintenance, then recovery, then open system restore. I restored
 to a date before the update took place, which was 11/13/16 on my computer. I now have the previous version and was able to edit photos as I had done on 11/12/16. Yeah!!!!! I then went to my Microsoft store settings and made sure the automatic update button
 was toggled off.

<p>Thank you so much AnnUn! I had just sat down to edit my day's bounty of photos as well and was so dismayed with Microsoft's new version of Photo Editor that I had to walk away. Bit the bullet, did some research and downloading the free 1-month trail version
 of Adobe Lightroom right now as I'm writing this, to see how I like it. Most of the reviewers say it's very intuitive and easy to use. I used Windows Photo Editor every single day and I'm simply stunned the way they completely changed and dumbed it down. It
 had been so reliable, intuitive, easy and great to use... it's like losing an old friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we all have to go through the painful time suck of researching and learning a new program. I guess the good thing about actually purchasing a professional program is that I will own the software and can use it until I decide to change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!!</p>

            I completely agree! I sat down to edit photos for my blog the other day and was horrified by the changes. I am with you; I really appreciated all the tweaks available with the old photo editor and liked the simplicity of it over Lightroom/Photoshop. Now
 I don't know what to do! Ugh.

            <p>I feel your pain RachelJaneP! I ditched Microsoft Photo Editor in a panic yesterday and purchased Adobe CC Lightroom. Found a great tutorial YouTube video by Anthony Morganti on how to quickly use the basics; Learn Lightroom 6, Episode 1, Quick Start. I
 took notes on the 6 or 7 basic steps; used them on each of the photos I needed to edit last night and was very pleased with the results. It's a time consuming learning curve, however I couldn't wait around for MS to see what they are going to do.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks so much for the tip on the video! I am going to go check it out. I also just re-purchased Lightroom, as I think it will be the best option for me. Even if we can't get our old photo editor with Windows back, I was glad to find this forum and know
 I am not alone!

 I restored to a date before the update took place, which was 11/13/16 on my computer. I now have the previous version and was able to edit photos as I had done on 11/12/16. Yeah!!!!! I then went to my Microsoft store settings and made sure the automatic update
 button was toggled off. </blockquote>

</p><p>Ok.. good to know!! I will try this too!! Thanks so much!!</p>

I too dislike the latest update, for the Windows 10 Photo viewer/editor.<br />
It was totally un-necessary, and I do not like the new and complex features.<br />
What happened to just basic features?<br />
If you use the mouse scrolling wheel to enlarge a picture, it immediately reverts to it's normal size.<br />
The features are complicated and there is no need for them.<br />
I totally dislike the control at the bottom of the photo viewing area, as they actually cover up part of the photo that I am viewing.<br />
Please stop these updates, they are not needed, and keep life simple.

            <p>I agree this update is a backward step, I&nbsp;have Lightroom which is far superior, but the old MS photo editor was great for a quick edit, hopefully they will see the error of their ways one day, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>They probably don't read this stuff anyway.</p>

            I totally agree with your view. Though I just make few changes on my photos, the new version completely drives me crazy with less and less function to offer. This may be nice and convenient for public, however for some of us, not at all. I appreciate this
 as it has more filters. In contrast, I dislike that the original function like 'contrast', 'brightness', 'shadow', 'highlight' were all disappeared.
<strong>HOPE THERE IS A WAY TO GET THE OLD VERSION BACK AS SOON AS POSSIBL</strong>E:(
