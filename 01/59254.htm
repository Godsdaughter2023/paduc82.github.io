<h2>            Can&#39;t use any Win 8 Apps due to UAC error</h2>
                    I installed Win 8 on my laptop and can't use any of the desktop apps that come with it (Store, Photos, Messaging etc) and get prompted "This App Can't Open While User Account Control is Turned Off." &nbsp;I click on the link "Turn On Account Control" and all
 it does is let me set when I'll be notified that something is trying to change my computer settings. &nbsp;Try the app again and get the same. &nbsp;Tried&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off - Can't find "<span>&nbsp;</span><span>Use
 User Account Control (UAC) to help protect your computer</span><span>&nbsp;" from step three. &nbsp;</span>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It seems that you’re having a hard time with Windows 8
<b>Metro app.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
I would suggest you to temporarily disable antivirus program and firewall and check.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Warning:
</span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you are using the Built-in Administrator Account – This automatically disables UAC. Sign out and sign in with a user
 account that has Administrator account privileges.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Download and run Modern interface App troubleshooter and check.<br />
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong>
</p></span>
<p><span>Set the correct date and time and check.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow the steps to set the date and time:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Press <strong><span>Windows key + C</span></strong> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.<br />
b. Type “<strong><span>Date and Time</span></strong>” in the charms bar search.<br />
c. Click <strong><span>Change date and time
</span></strong>button.<br />
d. Click <strong><span>Apply </span></strong>and
<strong><span>Ok </span></strong>to save the date and time.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using any Proxy connection, then try disabling the proxy connection and check.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Follow the steps to disable proxy:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a. Open <strong><span>Internet Explorer
</span></strong>on the desktop and press <strong><span>Alt
</span></strong>button.<br />
b. Click the <strong><span>Tools </span>
</strong>button, and then click <strong><span>Internet Options</span></strong>.<br />
c. Click the <strong><span>Connections
</span></strong>tab, and then click <strong><span>LAN
</span></strong>settings.<b><br />
</b>d. Uncheck the option “<strong><span>Use a proxy server for your LAN</span></strong>”. f. Click on ‘<strong><span>OK’
</span></strong>and ‘<strong><span>Apply’</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the issue still persists, proceed with the next method.
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Method 5: Clean boot</span></strong><b><br />
<br />
</b>Perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup
 items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each
 startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service
 list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that
 are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes
 the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem,
 repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup
 Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that
 are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item
 that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></strong><b><span><br />
<br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be
 resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 7:
</span></strong><b><span><br />
</span></b><span><br />
<strong><span>Note:
</span></strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 6:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a new User Account</span></strong></p>
<p><span><br />
To create new user account, type the following command in the command prompt with admin rights.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
<strong><span>Net user username password/add</span></strong></span></b></p>
<p><span>(Replace “user name” with a custom name and “password” with a strong password)</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><br />
<strong><span>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we can help you better.</span></strong></p>

 </blockquote> <p>Interesting.&nbsp; Might be an app error, so I think we should pass it along to the devs.&nbsp; On the App, down at the bottom on the fly out menu should have a smiley face icon for "Feedback"&nbsp;.&nbsp; Please report those issues through there.&nbsp;You can also report on your Console if you're Xbox Insiders, or just have the Xbox Insiders app installed,&nbsp;using the Report a problem via the dashboard or the Feedback Hub on Windows 10.&nbsp; It also wouldn't hurt to submit those problems/ideas/fixes to feedback.xbox.com</p>

</p><p>Literally just posted about this too. Its only when you're using it through looking for group. Ive changed all settings per the instructions in the reply with no success. It sucks because I only play PUBG makes looking for a squad much more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like MS has no idea how to fix it based on what I'm seeing, and the lack of troubleshooting they have for the problem.</p>

<p>Interesting.&nbsp; Might be an app error, so I think we should pass it along to the devs.&nbsp; On the App, down at the bottom on the fly out menu should have a smiley face icon for "Feedback"&nbsp;.&nbsp; Please report those issues through there.&nbsp;You can also report on your
 Console if you're Xbox Insiders, or just have the Xbox Insiders app installed,&nbsp;using the Report a problem via the dashboard or the Feedback Hub on Windows 10.&nbsp; It also wouldn't hurt to submit those problems/ideas/fixes to feedback.xbox.com&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Transfer of emails and folders from Windows Live Mail to Mail app in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After years of use I have a lot of emails and folders in my Windows Live Mail. How can transfer this to the new Mail app in Windows 10?</p>
<p>There is an export function in Windows Live Mail, but no import function in Mail app for Windows 10. &nbsp;Drag and drop does not work.</p>
<p>Do I have to continue with the "obsolete" Windows Live Mail 2011 or to run two mail programs?</p>

<p>Just keep them. Each one is an individual .eml file that you can read in File Explorer with a display not much different from that in Windows Live Mail:</p>

<h2>            Movies &#38; TV App not working</h2>
                    <p>I've recently used the movies &amp; tv app from windows and all of my videos are mostly .mp4 and .mkv files.
</p>
<p>For some reason, when I wanted to watch a video that is under .mkv and my movie &amp; tv app opens up, the audio is on perfectly but my screen is just fully blank all the way through the video run time. This happens to me specifically for this video in this
 file I downloaded. </p>
<p>Can anyone help? Thanks in advance.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I even tried to install the VLC app and try to watch videos from there but it keeps crashing instead. Is there something wrong with my client or the video file?</p>
<p>I have an example of the .mkv file:<em> The.100.S01E013.720p.WEB-DL.2CH.x265.HEVC.mkv</em></p>
<p>I'm on windows 10 by the way.</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Fernando. I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to guide you with a recommendation on the information you are seeking. 
<br />
<br />JPX file is an old format that can be opened with many different softwares.  Here is a link to the mainstream softwares that will open your files.  Once you open them, I would suggest saving it in the new format.

<h2>            Letterbox issue</h2>
                    <p>I just had an update on my xbox one, I do not have a hd tv so I stream to my laptop using the Xbox app. I have been using the app in this way for nearly a year with no issues. Since the update today I am getting a letterbox screen with no apparent way to change it back. I have tried all resolution options on my laptop that is available and I have tried changing the resolution on the Xbox (there is only one option (640 x 480)). I also cannot find an option in settings on the app itself.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 will not wake.</h2>
                    If I forget to turn off the computer at night, the screen stays in hibernation mode yet the computer is on and must be manually rebooted. &nbsp;Then it goes through the proper blue screen trouble-shooting mode and then blank for several minutes while, I guess,
 it's updating. Will there be a patch for this issue?

            <p>To Parth Patel,</p>
<p>I tried Method 1 running the Troubleshooter and that window had a Red X and stated that the screen saver should be disabled so I went to switch it off and it was already off. &nbsp;So that wasn't the problem. I like fast start up (Method 2) so that's not an option.
 Method 3 I'm still fooling around with. I reset to factory settings and now must sign in after each sleep period so will have to deal with that. Anyway, I printed the instructions so that I now know how to reach those utilities by typing the search terms you
 gave me and I'm thankful for that. &nbsp;Every version of Windows I've had has been a learning experience and 10 (an improvement on 8.1) is no different so thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            can windows 7 run on a 40gb hard drive, so i can leave my two 1tb hard drives free to run raid 1 for my files</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I am buying a new computer and just wanted to know if by having three hard drives installed,<br />
two 1TB hard drives<br />
and one 40GB hard drive,<br />
could i install windows 7 home premium off the 40GB hard drive,<br />
so that i could leave the two 1TB hard drives free to run a raid 1 set up for my files.<br />
the reason for using a 40GB hard drive is so its cheap to buy and replace,<br />
thanks.<br />

            <p>It may install, but 40GB will leave very little room for applications and if you have a 64Bit OS with there will be even less space remainig. If you can affort it I suggest at least a 80GB drive and perferably larger.
 Remember to small cheap drives may also be slow (5400 RPM) and not have the quality you expect.</p>

            Windows 7 uses approximately 6 to 10 GBs of disk space, that will leave you with about 30 to 34 GBs for applications. You have to take into consideration Windows Updates, application updates, temporary files, you can run out of space in no time. 40 GB
 is really small, Mechanical Hard disks are very cheap these days, you can likely get a really cheap 250 GB drive for under $30 just estimating, could be less.

<h2>            How do I install windows store apps so they are available to multiple accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I have three accounts for each of my family members. I would prefer to purchase an app once per computer rather than once per account. Also, it would be better if I did not have to install the app multiple times taking up disk space.

            Hi. Thanks for trying Windows 8.
<div>
<p>Here’s how.</p>
<p>First, configure your own account normally, using the Microsoft account you wish to use for app and game purchases.</p>
<p>Then, configure one or more secondary accounts.</p>
<p><span>These accounts can be local accounts or Microsoft accounts, it doesn’t matter.</span></p>
<p>Sign-in to a secondary account and launch Windows Store. Then, choose Settings (WINKEY + I) and then Your account. In the full-screen interface that launches, click the Change user button (or, if it’s a local account, the Sign in button). Here,
 you can configure a Microsoft account that will be used only for purchases. Use the Microsoft account you prefer (usually the one you sign in with.)</p>
<div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwinsupersite.com%2fsite-files%2fwinsupersite.com%2ffiles%2fuploads%2f2012%2f12%2fwstore-sign-in.jpg" /></div>
<p>If the sign-on account is for a child, you should also consider setting the option “Always ask for your password when buying an app” to Yes. That way, your kids can’t make purchases without your permission, and they’ll need to ask you to enter that
 password to approve those purchases.</p>
<p>A couple of notes about this process.</p>
<p>First, the Microsoft Store account is not connected to the Xbox apps (Xbox Music, Video, and Games) or any of the other apps that come pre-installed with Windows 8. So unless you change the sign-in on those apps, they will continue to use the sign-in
 account (or, for a local account, will await a separate sign-in).</p>
<p>Second, while using the same account in Windows Store across multiple sign-in accounts on a PC provides access to all of the apps and games you’ve purchased, none are installed automatically. And if you purchase and install an app or game in one
 account, you will still need to install it in the other accounts separately: They are literally installed in different places on the disk. (You will also need to update them separately, once in each account, going forward.)</p>
<div>
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwinsupersite.com%2fsite-files%2fwinsupersite.com%2ffiles%2fuploads%2f2012%2f12%2fwstore-purchases.jpg" /></div>
<p>To do choose and installed apps and games, visit Windows Store, then choose Your apps from the app bar (WINKEY + Z). This interface provides a list of all purchased and downloaded apps and games, with the most recent titles listed first.</p>

            <p>has the situation changed for windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>it has not been said here, but I believe I read about this same issue in another thread, that having windows store app install multiple times for a single machine is CLEARLY a waste of space, especially if one has expensive SSD drives installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Closest best practice to this is Android where the main application file is shared across multiple users but data files are kept for each user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This of course is possible in Windows 10 as apps installed outside windows store (e.g. office) are able to do this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate there is DRM to be thought about but isn't that the point of Families in your user registration system?</p>

<h3> deesandoval  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted program files without uninstalling them. What to do now&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Acer Aspire V5-561P-6823</p>
<p>64x bit </p>
<p>1000 GB HHD</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what info to give, this is my first PC (laptop) ever owned, 3/4 years with it, trying to learn the ins and outs. I'll&nbsp;TRY to keep this short.</p>
<p>As mentioned I have 1TB of HD in my&nbsp;PC&nbsp;and was about to install a game when I got a message about 'not enough space in memory'. In 3 to 4 years I've filled almost all 1TB of hard drive memory. Looking to delete "stuff" I decided to start with games I don't
 play anymore as those seem to be the things that take up the most memory that are single item, everything was going fine until I got to the&nbsp;"Watch Dogs" (part one) game. Couldn't find an uninstall method, no uninstall exe, couldn't do it by right click on
 "windows" icon and going to "programs and features" as it wasn't listed there, couldn't find it in the metro apps&nbsp;list&nbsp;even with the FULL apps list that lists&nbsp;apps AND system&nbsp;programs. Online research revealed, aside from sites pushing to sell 'special'&nbsp;uninstallers,&nbsp;I
 had to log on to "Uplay" and let that site uninstall... I have TOO MANY subscriptions/registered in TOO MANY sites for limited use, I was not about to register to&nbsp;one more&nbsp;third party site JUST to uninstall a game I do not want anymore on MY OWN PC. So I deleted
 the entire folder. Aside from the comments of people on forums that say 'it's not such a good idea but sometimes there's no other way' it didn't seem like a big problem, further more comments said it would create unused/lost bits of data in my registry. Aside
 from the "if your NOT 100% sure about it, don't 'fix/erase' it" comments I&nbsp;read to use a registry cleaner like CCleaner to clean up my registry from left over data that was left behind after just deleting a folder/program you couldn't just&nbsp;uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Want&nbsp;is gravity of deleting a game (folder) without uninstalling it? Is it bad, or is it REALLY bad?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do I&nbsp;need to clean my registry, or will it take care of itself? ...the same way you don't really need to defrag anymore (at least on win8.1 from what I heard) as it dose so automatically every so often.</p>
<p>I like to keep my PC as clean as possible even if it only makes things better by a&nbsp;minuscule&nbsp;fraction, this laptop isn't meant for gaming so every little bit to make it run/perform faster&nbsp;helps. If the choice is to leave a tiny bit of data there forever
 or manually cleaning it, I'd rather clean it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I just downloaded WinDirStat but I haven't had time to use it. I have deleted other folders from things I couldn't uninstall normally ('Wild Tangent' bloatware that came with this laptop), I pretty sure there is left over code(?) from these other&nbsp;deleted
 folders, I want to clean ALL&nbsp;THE JUNK (data)&nbsp;that is&nbsp;obsolete ANYWHERE on my PC. What is recommended&nbsp;to do this? Is there a program to download that is useful? Is there a process that is better?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. What happens&nbsp;IF I leave all that data in my registry?&nbsp;What are the possible&nbsp;effects on my PC? What's the worst that could happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other info or advice would be greatly appreciated. Keep in mind that I am new to the terms and workings of a PC.</p>
<p>Thanks to any and all in advance who offer tips and advice.</p>

<p>For uninstalling I have always used "Revo"( a free download is available as well as a paid for pro version) and always without any problems. If you follow the instuctions and tick all their emboldend suggestions it will go through the process of removing
 every last bit of a program where ever it might be hiding. That's my experience of using this uninstaller.</p>
<p>The only problem that might arise for you is that the specific program you want to uninstal may not appear in revo's list of programs (if it's a tricky and devious program).</p>
<p>I would be interested to hear if you get the result you want. Good luck.</p>

            Believe me, I treat the registry like the barrel of a gun... unless I know FOR A FACT that there's not a round in the chamber I won't take a look in it. In this case if I'm not 100% absolutely sure of something I'm doing in the registry, and then some,
 I'm sure not going to risk My Precious.

    <title>Windows 10 build 1703 update reboot issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelnorris1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 build 1703 update reboot issue</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP computer that came with Windows 7. The free upgrade to Windows 10 came and it upgraded and worked fine at build 1607. Another update came that was build 1703. It tried to update but said it could not configure some device and had to restore
 the previous version. It did this several times with the same result except for last Friday. During the restore to the previous version, the computer rebooted. Now, windows will start to load and then a rectangular box will flash on the screen, then a message
 appears, "Attempting to recover installation", then it will disappear and another message appears, "Restoring your previous version of windows." Then it reboots and the process repeats forever. Is there a fix for this?</p>

<p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>I used the media creation tool and then inserted the USB drive in the computer and booted it. I answered to perform a clean installation. I clicked next and the new box said install now or there was a "repair your computer" in the lower left hand corner.
 I chose to repair. The next box has the following:</p>
<p>Continue</p>
<p>Use another operating system</p>
<p>Troubleshoot</p>
<p>Turn off your PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose troubleshoot - Reset your PC or see advanced options</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked troubleshoot, only advanced options appeared. There is no option to reset the PC. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the selections are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Restore</p>
<p>System Image Recovery</p>
<p>Startup Repair</p>
<p>Command Prompt</p>
<p>Go Back to the previous version</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose Startup repair</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now a screen appears with three boxes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The top box has a dialog box icon in it</p>
<p>The box below it has a windows logo and to the side says windows 10 on volume 2</p>
<p>The box below that one is identical to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to choose which? I assumed the very bottom was my original installation so I chose it. The next screen had diagnosing your computer and after awhile changed to repairing your computer. Then at last, the screen it could not repair the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the other boxes with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must save my data at all cost. Is there a reset the PC function available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A funny thing hopefully unrelated is a phone message on my answering machine that said my windows registration had expired and Microsoft has disabled my windows. I cannot believe this is true but just on the possibility it is true, do I need to purchase
 a product key to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need this thing fixed as soon as possible and frankly at this day and age I cannot believe the only option would be to wipe the entire machine and start over. With the media creation tool, I can get to the command prompt. Isn't there any program I can
 then run that will fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

    <title>Aspect Ratio of Windows Live Movie Maker not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephs609  say:</h3>
<h2>            Aspect Ratio of Windows Live Movie Maker not working properly</h2>
                    <p>When using Windows Live Movie Maker on my Windows 10 PC, I am trying to record a Widescreen (16:9) webcam video. I am using a Logitech C920 HD Pro webcam. Whenever I go to the "Project" ribbon, I change the aspect ration to (16:9), but all that does is keep
 the same video aspect but with black bars on the sides. I am sure my webcam is widescreen because it works on other camera applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In support I was told to go to the tools tab, but that's not showing up. So instead I was told to go to the Movie Maker Options/Advanced section and change from NTSC to PAL, but nothing like that shows up.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e584bf96-59af-4cf3-bbed-5f3b3d0ea080" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e584bf96-59af-4cf3-bbed-5f3b3d0ea080" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b40859d-e1c5-4ea4-930a-497edb037328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2b40859d-e1c5-4ea4-930a-497edb037328" /></a></p>

    <title>Brand new controller keeps disconnecting every ten seconds - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Brand new controller keeps disconnecting every ten seconds</h2>
                    Okay I have an Xbox one S battlefield 1 edition and as of recently my controller started to lose its connection continuously every ten seconds,&nbsp; so I tried 5 different brands of batteries, tried checking for any updates for my controller only for my console
 to tell me my controller is up to date, I tried using a USB to connect it before unplugging my USB from my controller once connected with fresh Duracell batteries and my controller kept disconnecting again after two minutes. So thinking it was the controller
 I went out and bought a BRAND NEW controller and IT STILL DISCONNECTS EVERY TEN SECONDS!! I even tried all the same techniques as I did with my original controller. I tried googling the solution going through thread after thread on every site I could find,
 alot of them kept telling me to turn off device association on my laptop I did that and im still having the same issue. Ive never used a PC for gaming so I didn't understand as to why that would have anything to do with it

<span>Try performing a hard reset EXACTLY like this. Hold the power button on the console for 8 seconds or until the power shuts down completely.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Plug the power cord back in and restart the console.</span></p>

<p>Hi XdeviousdmanX,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about your controller disconnecting.&nbsp; How long ago did you purchase this controller because if its new you shouldnt have all this issues.&nbsp; It seems like you tried a lot of solutions and more than likely people will only tell you do the same
 thing that I am sure you have tried already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reccomend you returning it from where you brought it and get a new one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi There</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had a similar issue with my controller that disconnects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Xbox One S was connected on the 5Ghz band and I thought to myself just to try the 2.4Ghz Channel. So far I have not had any disconnection issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have watched many YouTube videos and read on many forums and support pages that it might be caused by interference. I've also solved this on a friends console by changing the wireless channel on the router.
<strong>If you know how to do this, give it a go as a last resort and consult your router manual. If you don't know how to do it, consult an IT specialist.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So yeah, give it a try (If you have a dual band router - 2.4 GHz &amp; 5 GHz)</p>

<p>Hi, have you tried leaving the controller connected to the usb and see if it disconnects after so long while connected using that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does sound like it could be the console that does need returning..... also one silly thing to try maybe is if others have suggested other devices could be affecting it then try the xbox and controllers in another location that has power, ie a friends
 house so that its not connected to any wifi or no pc around for the controllers to be paired with.</p>

            First of all I have read all of the suggested things to do below, I have had the same problem with a brand new pure blue controller..same issues you are having, I also have about 4 other friends who have the same issue. Two of us have xboxone x, one has
 the "s" and the others have the standard xboxone. It is not your console. I think there is a problem with the battery unit casing in the controllers themselves, not sure if tech have had a change in design but this is an issue I have heard from many others.
 We all have tried with updates for all hardware and power reboots etc. In the end I sent mine back and got a replacement stating problem with it and new one works a dream. So conclusion and best result for me was to return product. Sorry if this is not best
 news as I know none of us like to have to wait to get a replacement when we could be playing games. All the best my friend with this issue.

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to the Forums for advice on what to do when faced with this situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that the console is not staying connected to either controller after the troubleshooting that you've done so far however if this problem is occurring with any controller that you connect to the console, it would seem that your console is in
 need of service for a hardware problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            File permissions&#58; How to set &#34;Must be a member of group A AND group B&#34; to access a file</h2>
                    
<p>Basically i have this file, but i don't want any users to see this file unless they are members of both groups A _AND_ B.</p>
<p>If they are a member of ONLY group A OR ONLY group B they won't be able to see it.&nbsp;&nbsp; They must be members of BOTH groups.</p>
<p>They need to be in the intersection of groups A and B to have access to the file.</p>
<p>Is there any way to do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Documents won&#39;t copy&#59; they&#39;ll only move, or replace</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My files or documents, and not just those of Microsoft Word but all files, will not "copy"; they'll just move. It's been going on since I did a factory restore on my computer two weeks ago. I don't know what the problem is, but until recently I was able
 to copy a file, keeping both. For example, I have a MW document I keep on my desktop for convenience, because I add changes to it on a regular basis; but, now, when I want to "copy" it to the same file (same name) that's in my&nbsp;OneDrive folder, it'll just replace
 it instead. It will&nbsp;neither copy it&nbsp;nor give me&nbsp;a choice. It will allow&nbsp;me, however,&nbsp;to keep both files, but then a number is added &nbsp;to the "moved" file. And&nbsp;the same&nbsp;situation happens with more than &nbsp;just&nbsp; MW files and&nbsp;OneDrive. I just tried, for example,&nbsp;to
 copy a NitroReader file from my desktop to my Documents folder and the same thing happened. I do not know how to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>That's the only way to make a copy, is by changing one of the names.&nbsp; You can never have two files with the same name, so this is normal.</p>

            <p>Maybe I didn't explain, but I'm copying from one "area" to the next. What's on my desktop would always copy to the Onedrive without having two names, and then it just stopped.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I don't know if a screenshot will do anything, but I'll try better to explain what's happened. I keep a document on my desktop (Windows 8.1) that I add new sentences to almost every day.&nbsp; About once a week I then like to copy that document to the SAME document
 in Onedrive, so I can be sure it's saved in the cloud. So I have two of the same documents. One of them on the desktop and the other in my Onedrive folder, which I keep in the File Explorer. Until I did a factory restore on my computer about a month ago, I
 could always copy the Desktop file, let's call it "PicNik" to the "PicNik" in Onedrive and both would still be in their respective places of origin after copying, but now when I copy the folder from the Desktop to OneNote, the Desktop "PicNik" disappears.
 To get it back I have to right click "copy" on the OneDrive "PicNik," which I just copied from the Desktop "PicNik" a second before and the do a PASTE back on to the Desktop. It's becoming tedious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left out that when I initially COPY the Desktop "PicNik" to the OneDrive "PicNik" I do so by dragging it to the OneDrive "PicNik," at which point a message pops up that says "Moving 1 item from Desktop to OneDrive and then beneath that it says "The Destination
 Already Has a File names "PicNik": then beneath that it gives three choices:</p>
<p>Replace the file in the destination</p>
<p>Skip this file</p>
<p>Compare info on both files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always choose the first, "Replace the file in the destination," because the others don't do anything. I just want to copy one to the other and keep both, and I can't understand why I can't do that since I've done it a million times before.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, if it has to do with the way my OneDrive folder is set up. Perhaps before it was in another location. I just don't&nbsp;know and I wouldn't know how to move it anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>It seems as if the default action for dragging&nbsp;files has changed from "Copy" to "Move" in Windows, but I'm not sure if that would affect files that you drag to the OneDrive window.</p>
<p>

            <p>No, haven't tried upload link. I just realized if I can copy and paste the document back onto the desktop, I can just as easily copy and paste it from desktop to OneDrive and that's what I'm doing. Thanks for all your help.</p>
<p>If the default action changed, I can probably change it back if I do another system restore, because it can't be right that a "drag" now means move.</p>

<p>I'm okay with copying and pasting now. I've had a few problems with pressing links on Microsoft Forums. Once someone asked me to put in my password to see the information&nbsp;within the link, and stupidly, I did.</p>

            I recommend an in-place upgrade repair.
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then follow the instruction here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1903.
<br />In a nutshell you just download the media creation tool &amp; choose to upgrade now.
