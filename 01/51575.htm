<h2>            MS Call Quality Dashboard Unclassified Address Ranges</h2>
                    <p>I exported call data the CQD Details Reporting for all calls that had no First Building Listed. But you can see</p>
<p>that "Second Network Field" has 172.29.48.0 and that matches one of the rows in my building upload CSV</p>
<p>which was uploaded some time ago. So I don't understand why it's showing up as not associated with a building.</p>
<p>Any thought? Could it be a problem of over-lapping building CSV files? There are a total of eight that have gotten</p>
<p>uploaded over time. Can I delete the older ones if my most recent has all the internal subnets?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Exported record from CQD Details Report where no First Building is present (column 2)</p>

<p>Hi Claus SteenSÃ¸rensen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, dates cannot overlap between each building file. When you upload the network information you specify a date range. You can look at the date range as the validity period of the network information. That is to say only
 one building file is in effect even if you have multiple files. If the most recent file has the correct information, you can set the time period properly and leave it as the only building file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Huni</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Is there a way to remove icons from my desktop without deleting the associated files when right-clicking the icon doesn&#39;t offer that option&#63;</h2>
                    Most icons that&nbsp;appear on my desktop&nbsp;after I download new&nbsp;application files can be removed without&nbsp;uninstalling or deleting the associated files.&nbsp;&nbsp;But when I right click on icons&nbsp;that appeared after reinstalling&nbsp;Panda Internet Security and downloading
 an Adobe Reader update there is no option to remove the icon,&nbsp;rather there is a prompt asking if I'm sure I want to move the file to the recycle bin---which I don't.&nbsp; When I look at "properties" I see that the location for both is my desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm trying to
 reduce visual clutter, is there a way to do it?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Right Click the Icon - Properties - General tab - Type of File - if it is a LNK then it is only a
<br />
ShortCut and if you DELETE it then only it is removed and the underlying program is not<br />
affected. To see where the program resides check the ShortCut tab - Target :&nbsp; .<br />
<br />
If it is not a LNK and is a .EXE, .COM, .BAT and some others then if if you delete the file<br />
(which is not a shortcut) then the program will not run. Usually ShortCuts have ARROWS<br />
on them in the lower left corner. <br />
<br />
For programs that are stand-a-lone (were copied to the Desktop and not installed) you
<br />
can make Folders elsewhere and copy them (and any other parts such as .DLL or .CFG
<br />
only as examples and some will have no other parts) to that then remove them from the
<br />
Desktop. If you have programs that were installed to the desktop you need to uninstall
<br />
them and them re-install elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />

                    <p>Original title: Unable to install ChessBase 12 on Windows8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bought a new laptop with WIndows 8.1 from the Microsoft Store and tried to install Chessbase 12 on it (which works fine for me on my old Windows Vista machine). I'm getting the same error as the original poster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions above:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* It is a desktop application</p>
<p>* It is specific to Chessbase 12. I have successfully installed many other progams</p>
<p>* I tried installing directly from the DVD as well as copying it to the hard disk first, but both result in the same error message</p>
<p>* The full error text is :</p>
<p>The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with this package. The error code is 2753.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* I also made sure the Windows Installer service is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated very much</p>

<p>Don't worry about the text that says these are network installs, or the text that says not to use if you are only updating one PC, it works just fine for any XP installation.</p>
<p>Install SP3 by executing the download.</p>
<p>I would suggest that you post another question about windows updates if it still won't work after getting SP3 installed.</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS is Windows 10 Pro (version 1511). While scanning my PC using anti-virus, it displayed a result that WinRE.wim has been infeceted by an adware as -&nbsp;Detected: "EE:Malwr.Heur.fu8"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The complete path &amp; its virus detection is as under:</p>

Detected: "EE:Malwr.Heur.fu8"&nbsp;
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using Quickheal Total Security (version 17).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, while rescanning my PC, I had selected an option in my antivirus program to delete a virus (if detected).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the above file (winre.wim) has got deleted &amp; is not found in my PC - even under&nbsp;C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\SafeOS\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it pose any problem for my system?</p>
<p>Plus, how can I restore winre.wim file without formatting my PC. There is no restore point created as well.</p>

<p>
</p><p>In response to your query, please be informed that you may not be able to retrieve the deleted files due to antivirus scanning. If it is a system file, it will warn you before you delete it however, if it is a manually installed program, it will not pose
 any threat to your system. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any Windows related queries in the future, let us know. We will be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not real sure what's on your driver disk, but a lot of times you can get older stuff to work by using "Compatibility Mode" on the installer file. You can also try using "Troubleshoot Compatibility"</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access both by right clicking on the installer after opening, not running, the disk...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshoot Compatibility will be on the menu when you right click, and you will see a Compatibility Tab if you click on Properties...</p>

            Are you talking about when you play it in Windows Media Player?&nbsp; Perhaps you have WMP set to loop?&nbsp; Try pressing
<strong>Ctrl+T</strong> in Windows Media Player to toggle it to only playing once.

            It keeps looping as you watch the preview, but when you save it to a movie file and play it in a player, it goes just once unless you use player options to have it loop.

            Hi <span>Eyesleft,<br />
<br />
When you made the movie, did it play again automatically during the preview? What program are you using to play the video? Have you tried the suggestion provided by considerate_guy? Let us know if it worked for you.
<br />

            Perhaps you mean when you are previewing it in full screen mode?&nbsp; I hadn't actually tried that recently but it seems to loop.&nbsp; PapaJohn is right that this is just for the preview.&nbsp; You can click the 'pause' button at the bottom to stop the playback. When
 you save it as a movie (Alt+F, Save Movie) it should only play once (unless your media player is set to loop, as I noted before).

We'd like to know if you have made any changes on your computer prior to this issue. If so, can you tell us what are those changes so we can isolate your concern?</p>
<p>

We'll wait for your response.</p>

            Me too. Admin right click every time. Disk Cleanup, sfc /scannow multiple times. Even tried dism restore health. Tried everyting on Google search!&nbsp; Don't bother to make a suggestion as it won't work!!!!!! Maybe the problem will resolve after upgrade to
 1709, if it does, it will come back eventually since Microsoft doesn't fix problems, just creates new ones.

    <title>Unresponsive after resume from Hibernate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterpan5  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unresponsive after resume from Hibernate</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I've got very slow and unresponsive laptop after resume from hibernate. It lasts up to 15 minutes after resuming and the HDD led is constantly glowing during this process. It is a much slower resume than my very old laptop with Pentium M processor
 and slow 540rpm hdd. </p>
<p>What can be done about it.</p>
<p>Laptop: Lenovo X220, core i5, 8 Gb RAM, 7200rpm HDD. Windows 7 Pro x64.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kind of guess of the reason - lots of RAM on x64. Big hiberfil file. BUT I do not notice such behaviour on ANY other machine I've owned or worked on. They can resume slower or faster but after resume they are resposive as they where before hibernate mode.
 I'd prefer to have it this way on the laptop also. This laptop is not, it continues to do some reading from HDD making it absolutely unusable during tis process.
</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Thanks again. <br />
The process that caused the strange behavior was PWMTR64.dll Which is some background service of ThinkPad Power Manager . Turning it off resolved the issue. Resume from hibernate is normal and all the programs are responsible right after the resuming. Haven't
 noticed any decrease in functionality of the power management after turning off this startup item in msconfig.<br />

<h2>            Eon Xbox one s bundle</h2>
                    hello i recently purchased the xbox one s eon fortnite bundle for my son for christmas tomorrow and when i opened ro see if everything was there i noticed that there is no eon card with the code in the box at all and he really wanted this skin. I have
 the reciept but they wont accept returns or a refund because they think i redeemed the code my self already now i dunno what to do becasue this is all my son wanted. I have picures but have crossed out some or my personal details.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd823d63-577c-434a-90cf-c329666520bf?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cd823d63-577c-434a-90cf-c329666520bf?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53555a05-ae36-4986-bbee-23557ecbd4c4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/53555a05-ae36-4986-bbee-23557ecbd4c4?upload=true" /></a>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't know, but sometimes a single code can result in multiple items to be linked/acquired<br />
So are you 100% sure there should be a separate leaflet for the skin itself?<br />
Does it contain a leaflet/code for the 2000 vBucks for example, it might be bundled with that code too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this isn't the answer, but since I don't know, I'm merely stating what I've seen myself in the past, that items can be bundled under 1 redeemable code.<br />
</p>
<p>Side note: Keep in mind that once redeemed it will be attached to the account that was used to redeem it.</p>
<p>

            It suppose to come with a leaflet with a 25 digit code that allows you to unkock the eon skin glider pickaxe aswell as 2000 v bucks . Isnt there something you can do for me it was the main reason i bought the bundle for the eon set.

<p>Hi, double check the contents of the box the Xbox came in, sometimes those code cards slip into one of the flaps, it could also be inside a box inside a box if you catch my drift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a card with a code for the game then make sure you have competely removed all the silver scratch off parts as those can have multiple codes on a single card.</p>

            I AM SO SORRY! I think you'd have to bring this one up with Epic Games if there truly is no card. Still, your son will be VERY excited to be getting a new Xbox. Maybe, when you first start Fortnite on your Xbox, it will recognize the IP address as bundled
 and give you the items? My Xbox isn't a bundle, but we always get the newest FIFA when we get it (just a coincidence, supposed to be random). See if after you unfold the box, separate all parts of the box that are together to see if the code is in some kind
 of little flap. It also may be on/near the Xbox in the packaging, and it may be wrapped up with it. I am so sorry for what's happening right now and I wish I could do more.

            In this case it is actually down to the retailer to have good customer service. You can try to contact Xbox Support, but I wouldn't think they could do much, as it is up to the retailer.

<p>Hey Corbyn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. Unfortunately here in the forums we don't have the tools to assist with something as specific as a missing Fortnite code. It is usually on the retailer's end to ensure you receive everything you paid for.
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support</a> may be able to assist, as we have protocol for such situations if certain criteria is met. I see you have pictures of both the bundle and the receipt, make sure
 to provide those to the support representative. Cheers :D</p>

<h2>            System_service_exception &#40;ks.sys&#41; after updates in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows updated automatically yesterday, then rebooted automatically. However it then seems to get into a loop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Log on</p>
<p>2) Runs for a few minutes, then say "Your PC ran into a problem and being fixed ... search online for system_service_exception (ks.sys)" (not exact wording)</p>
<p>3) Reboot automatically</p>
<p>4) Repeat 1-3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I boot into Safe Mode and as far as I can see the updates installed yesterday were for Office 2013 and Adobe Acrobat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Followed this "http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/window-10-upgrade-system-service-exception-error/656ab9e3-58f3-4c52-bb4b-34c300b6093f?auth=1" however the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It stays in safe mode without rebooting for a longer period, so I suspect maybe a driver problem. However it's hard to try to diagnose when it reboots every couple of minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Donald&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your quick and very helpful reply. I have followed your instructions, over several days as I only manage to spend a little bit of time&nbsp;and also my PC kept restarting every minute or so, making it more time consuming than usual. Below are
 the results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: No effect</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:</p>
<p>1. Started in safe mode with low-res video - no restarting</p>
<p>2. I only use the integrated graphics (Intel HD Graphics 4600) - tried uninstall but still restarted frequently</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3:</p>
<p>Tried to installed Intel driver "IntelÂ® Graphics Driver for WindowsÂ® 10 [15.40][4th Gen]" (<span>15.40.10.64.4300) dated Oct 16. 2015 - could not complete&nbsp;my PC just kept restarting during the installation</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I decided to bite the bullet and did a clean reinstall of Windows 10.
</p>
<p>1. It initially worked fine with Driver came with Windows (ver 10.18.15.4279), i.e., without restarting.
</p>
<p>2. I then installed the above Inter driver but that resulted in a restart shortly after.</p>
<p>3. I then uninstalled the Intel driver and reverted to 10.18.15.4279, and my PC no longer restarted frequently.</p>
<p>4. However,&nbsp;Windows often displays a notification&nbsp;that "graphics driver has been restarted" (to that effect, not exactly wording), mostly during video editing using Adobe Premiere Pro.&nbsp;The PC itself&nbsp;does not restart, however either the PC&nbsp;would&nbsp;freeze or
 Adobe Premiere Pro would crash usually while exporting video. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing the editing and exporting of same projects and videos on a different laptop works fine so I suspect something on my PC is not working well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think all is pointing to a problem with graphic driver or hardware. Is there anything you can help me to diagnose this further? I do understand you may not be able to help with my specific hardware but any general troubleshooting help would be very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My motherboard is Gigabyte GA-H87-D3H, with Intel Core i5-4670 CPU, 8GB RAM, and Windows 10 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>Donald</p>

            <p>Hi Donald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for mentioning the steps you have tried to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From what you have described, it does looks like there is a&nbsp; compatibility issue with the Intel Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, were you able to install the driver in compatibility mode after clean installing Windows 10?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have tried that, I would suggest you to try the steps below and check if you have the option to rollback the driver to a previous version by following the steps below:</p>
<p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open the run command. </p>
<p>2. Type <strong>devmgmt.msc </strong>and press <strong>enter </strong>to open device manager.</p>
<p>3. <strong>Expand </strong><strong>display </strong><strong>adapter</strong>.</p>
<p>4. <strong>Right click </strong>on the driver and select "<strong>properties</strong>"</p>
<p>5. Click on "<strong>driver</strong>" tab.</p>
<p>6. Click on "<strong>roll back driver</strong>" and click "<strong>ok</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the issue persists. </p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Wungraileng,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't install the driver in compatibility mode&nbsp;- I misunderstood that was necessary only if the driver was designed for previous version of Windows. Since the Intel driver was&nbsp;for Windows 10 I thought I could just install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I try to&nbsp;install it in compatibility mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I rollbacked the driver following instructions above (to 10.18.10.4252) and PC seems to be stable, however I haven't had the chance to work on Adobe Premiere Pro much so I will keep an eye on that in the next few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However Windows Update attempted to update the graphic driver (my setting&nbsp;was to automatically update all&nbsp;updates), which caused my PC to restart. I followed this thread (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930) to hide that update, which seems to
 work ok however it was said to be a temporary measure so is there a permanent solution for that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also set my update to "Notify", hoping that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Donald</p>

            <p>Hi Donald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your effort in trying to resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that Windows and driver updates are meant to enhance and improve the functionality of the computer. However, these updates may sometimes cause some temporarily problems. Although, it does cause an issue at the moment, the next time you install
 the same update, the issue may not arise therefore since the issues are temporary, there is no permanent solution to disable the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated about the issue. We will be glad to help&nbsp;should you need further assistance. &nbsp;</p>

Grazie Gent-ma Laura</div>
<div>Purtroppo ho giÃ  seguito questa strada senza successo</div>
<div>Ho provato, seguendo il consiglio ,su MVP di Leonardo Bai a cancellare la sottochiave "WindowsBackup" e riavviato il PC.</div>
<div>Ora il backup funziona mentre i punti di ripristino no.</div>
<div>Mi esprimo meglio:il PC crea automaticamente i punti di ripristino ma non mi permette di ripristinare con un punto precedente dicendomi "non si puÃ² creare un file se questo esiste giÃ  errore 0x800700B7</div>
<div>Questo Ã© successo dopo aver acquistato ed installato (seguendo i consigli del produttore) un paio di mesi fa ,un harddisck esterno da un tera il nome di questo Ã¨ Mypassport della WD.</div>
<div>Nelle istruzioni si viene invitati a scaricare dal sito della WD un programma di backup ,cosa che ho fatto . Da quel momento il PC non faceva piÃ¹ ne backup
</div>
<div>e non ho potuto piÃ¹ ripristinare un punto precedente .Dopo aver disinstallato il programma ho cercato nei registri di cancellare tutte le voci inerenti MYpassport probabilmente non ci sono riuscito.</div>
<div>Mi viene il sospetto che ,come ho letto sul web ,che nel programma scaricato ci sia un file che mi impedisce di disinstallarlo completamente</div>
<div>Scusa la lunghezza spero di aver esposto bene il problema e sopratutto che tu possa aiutarmi</div>

<p><span><span>Hello orca66,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you get this blue screen randomly on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Do
 you get any error related to memory, this does not appear to be the complete error message?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This appears to be hardware issue, I suggest that you run the Memory diagnostic tool on your computer. To run Windows Memory Diagnostic</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, click All Programs, and then expand Accessories.<br />
2. Right-click Command Prompt and select Run elevated from the context menu.<br />
3. At the command prompt, type mdsched.exe. If you are prompted, allow the action. You can choose to restart the computer and run the tool immediately or schedule the tool to run at the next restart.<br />
4. Windows Memory Diagnostic runs automatically after the computer restart. Windows Memory Diagnostic allows you to choose among three test suites of varying thoroughness.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also make sure that you have the latest drivers installed on your computer. You can check out the below article that will give you information on
 how to update drivers: </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If this still does not fix the issue, I suggest that you contact your computer manufacturer to check if there is hardware failure on your computer.</span></span></p>

<p>This is starting to become really annoying im trying to enjoy a race online but pretty much every race im in someone repeatadly spins me out and destroys my chance of getting a decent position just because they can't learn to overtake. Is anyone else experiencing
 this?</p>

<p>I used to play dirt 2 online and stopped for the same reason, but its the same with just about any other racer. &nbsp;People will just punt you off for fun. &nbsp;Only thing you can do is try to hold back for the first couple of corners and hope the leader makes a
 mistake! </p>

<p>As davedx96 says, it's not just Dirt that suffers from rammers, the only solution sadly is either race with people you know or trust or don't race online.</p>
<p>In all honesty, it's not even just racing games that suffer from poor losers - almost every game genre has them and sadly I find it's getting worse.</p>

    <title>Action Centre, Taskbar &#38;&#47;or Start Menu Freezes when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrispydtank  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action Centre, Taskbar &#38;&#47;or Start Menu Freezes when getting&#47;interacting with Notifications Win10AU</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Problem Device is a Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows 10 Anniversary Update has brought a bug with it for Toast Notifications &amp; WiFi (WiFi currently fixed, see below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time A Pop-up comes, whether I interact with it or try going straight into Action Centre, the Action Centre won't open, the Pop-up freezes and either finally leaves after average of 10secs or stays until the refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>During this freeze, sometimes the Taskbar freezes, sometimes adding Cortana, sometimes adding Start Menu or all of it freezes. Then sometimes the Notifications can freeze the entire system, but only everything loaded, so the mouse moves, but whatever is
 on screen cannot be interacted with anymore, like if I have Edge running, I cannot do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To counteract this issue, I can usually repeatedly press the Start Button via Touch or Key, which eventually forces Explorer to restart, or I must Restart Explorer via Task Manager, which I can load and use, even if everything else is frozen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is <strong>ONLY</strong> after the Anniversary Update. I also wanted to get assistance in stopping Microsoft's excuse of "<strong>User Error</strong>" so I asked friends&nbsp;&amp; family&nbsp;if anybody recently purchased the Surface Pro 4 within the last week of
 July, first week of August, I was lucky to have a friend of a friend who did. </p>
<p>
</p><p>They got it as a present on the 5th of August. It was not used or nothing changed, all that was changed was the updates coming through Windows Update, including the AU. He loaded up, began setting up but straight away was interrupted by my exact issue and
 was lucky to revert back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I took the first freeze as a big problem and reverted straight away. On that note, Microsoft should return the Reverting back to 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Including this, every time I booted my Surface, my Wifi would connect to my SSID fine, but it would always be "No Internet". The only way to fix this was to Turn WiFi on and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing I did for freezing issue was that Microsoft have a support page that suggests my issue is related to corruption with Windows Store. This makes sense as the Apps are the ones that are giving out Notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I used the Troubleshooter to do whatever it needs to do to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It said the cache could be damaged but did not fix it. So I ran the "WSReset.exe" as Admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I find out an update was coming: KB3176938</p>
<p>
</p><p>With this, it <strong>FIXED </strong>my WiFi issue and at one point, I thought it fixed the freezing. Sure enough, it was still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- SFC</p>
<p>- CHKDSK</p>
<p>- DISM</p>
<p>- Windows Store Troubleshooter</p>
<p>- WSRESET</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have WSRESET again now with the resent update to see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is 2 Accounts on this Surface, both have issues. If the User Profile is corrupt is the excuse, well the 2nd user hasn't been properly used so nothing "could" have been corrupted, but just to be certain, I created a new user... Still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something is seriously wrong with the AU on my Surface Pro 4 and it is to blame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Sony Vaio Flip 15 Notebook does not have this issue. But I can say that if it was Corruption or something, then the Notebook would of had better chances having this issue than this Surface.</p>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have tried all basic troubleshooting steps, I suggest you to <strong><span>Reset Windows 10 and check if it resolves the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Resetting lets you choose whether to keep your files or remove them, and then reinstalls Windows</strong>. Reset option lets you return windows 10 to its original state without losing photos, music, videos or personal files. You will retain accounts,
 personal files and personal settings. Windows Store apps and Desktop apps must be reinstalled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Make sure you backup important data before making significant changes to Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer section '<strong>Reset you PC' </strong>in below article and follow the steps listed:</p>
</span>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options</span></span></strong></a></p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, I can't believe you still think that solution is valid!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We all know most of the bugs are not related to issues that can be repaired with a reset. Take some responsibility!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I have removed that "solution" as a fix thanks to my friends friend getting a brand new surface pro 4, without Anniversary, went straight to AU, had same issues as me. So if that is the case, how can you possibly tell me to reset and waste my time
 losing everything, when someone has already done it, not to mention others who have issues from this update already saying it's a waste of time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better solutions please or atleast ask for something that might help you guys find the bugs and get a patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enough with the Nuke option!</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the new "Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3189031)" and "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB3176938)" are causing issues with freezing still, making Edge &amp; IE webpages
 freeze, especially Flash or HTML5 related content like video etc. Example, had Facebook, Twitter &amp; YouTube up. as soon as you interact with something on the page, the page goes out and says "not responding" or with YouTube, the video would just hang on buffing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface Pro 4: removing KB3189031 solved web freezing. I did also do the Windows Store corruption troubleshoot and WSRESET again and now I have seen it all working fine thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Vaio Flip 15: Well it just recently got KB3189031 &amp; KB3176938, as soon as it touched this PC, Wifi&nbsp;went out, said no drivers installed, then during restart, BSOD with "DRIVER_POWER_STATE", Action Centre Buttons and any buttons like that anywhere are gone.
 Task Manager won't open. Cortana keeps loading. Windows Update won't show any text. Control Panel Uninstall won't list the recent updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gonna restart again and remove KB3189031 and work my way back until it is stable again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update (Restart 2): Trying to restart like I said on sentence above. Like the first restart, it hangs on "Restarting"... I am gonna assume the BSOD is gonna happen again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yet Microsoft insist that its our fault... RESET! they say... What a joke!</p>

            <p>Update!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think I may of figured out the issue! I HOPE!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that a Support Engineer or specifically @<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f68c6e75-9dd9-41a4-967c-03b6d80cd4c5" title="Vinodh_Kumar V"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Vinodh_Kumar V</span></a>&nbsp;can verify,
 but anybody who has this issue, please go through this and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my Flip 15 Notebook has it going pretty well so far, but my Surface Pro 4, **** NO!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both users still have freezing issues that recently got worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that the Notifications that freeze the Taskbar, Pop-up, Action Centre, Cortana, Start Menu etc are all related to Windows Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As @Vinodh states:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>"<strong>As you have tried all basic troubleshooting steps,</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This includes 2 components I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Windows Store Troubleshooter</p>
<p>2. WSRESET.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I get a verification that something related to Windows Store or Apps that you get from the Windows Store controls Notifications in the Action Centre and Pop-ups?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the thing is, my focus was on my Flip 15 as it had more important things on it that I needed to make sure I can use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that the Windows Updates I mentioned in this thread were the things that screwed my Flip 15, I didn't put any more efforts on the surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did not realize was the <strong>fact WSRESET.exe was actually failing!</strong></p>
<p>Can I get a second verification as to where the Windows Store Cache Folder is suppose to be located?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it "&nbsp;C:\Windows\WinStore\LocalState\Cache "?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, both the Windows Store Troubleshooter and WSRESET.exe had an error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WSRESET said Class not Recognize</p>
<p>Windows Store Troubleshooter said the Cache is damaged and no fix can be made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought "how odd".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I searched online for the Cache Location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well the info I seem to keep finding is it is in the stated location above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a File Search for " WinStore " and it came up empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I searched "WinStore Folder missing Windows 10". This search filled out for me, so it would seem I am not the only one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also seem to see&nbsp;that the freezing questions online&nbsp;is in conjunction with this missing folder. suspect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I found Microsoft Sites and 3rd Party sites that tell you to reinstall or re-register the Windows Store using PowerShell Commands&nbsp;to solve many issues, including the missing WinStore Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did, except the Powershell use to fix WinStore Folder was false, coz the PowerShell never worked because they either tried to do stuff with %SystemRoot% or SystemRoot\Windows\WinStore,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error? It was the "location did not exist" or "AppxManifest.xml missing from from location "C:\Windows\WinStore"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried just making an empty Folder that the&nbsp;PowerShell to&nbsp;use. Nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I was ready to pull my hair out coz the stupid update caused massive failure and Microsoft's ONLY SOLUTION of "Reset Windows" (in a whiny voice) was the only solution left.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I was still interested in the missing WinStore Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the WinStore Folder unique from Computer to Computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So luckily,&nbsp;I have access to a working Custom Desktop&nbsp;PC with Windows 10 running perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the search for the WinStore folder on it,&nbsp;and this is for others who have this issue - if you can, find a working PC and do the search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC HAD WINSTORE! BUT GUESS WHAT!? it was in each users " AppData\Local\Packages " and never in the mentioned locations above or on the web.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT THE **** IS GOING ON HERE!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I double checked the Surface... All users had no WinStore folder in that location. it was only " Microsoft.WindowsStore... " Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my next&nbsp;question was, is the Folder the same or different per user? This is because the Folder has " WinStore_###########" characters on the end. Was it a unique ID?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked all the users on the PC, it was the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the&nbsp;Flip 15 for not only&nbsp;for the missing Folder, but if it was there, was it a different code or the same... The Flip had the Folder, and it was the same as all the other user folders on the Desktop PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I was gonna do a in-place upgrade on the Surface anyways, so I am sure if I did some tests that&nbsp;f*** it all up, I should be fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied the folder to my SD Card, I plugged it in my Surface (yes, SP4 has no Card Reader, my SD&nbsp;can turn into a USB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;removed the Cache data from all places possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forced notifications from various apps and things, especially ones I knew would cause it. Every time, without fail, everything froze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I copied&nbsp;the folder&nbsp;to all Users locations. restarted the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now back on here, typing on it to this thread right now with Notifications that were freezing the stuff, not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other user on here, being my partners, it was so bad, that the attempted fixes broke all the Apps also. Edge would never open like every other app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As soon as I put that folder in, everything is so far working. All the apps load, all notifications dont freeze everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be testing this throughout the day. I had another suspicion that coming from Sleep Mode was causing this, but the fact my partner last night restarted the SP4 and it still went crazy, tells me I was wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue both profiles now have&nbsp;from the WSRESET.exe and PowerShell is that the Windows Store Title is not just "Windows Store" but "@Microsoft.WindowsStore_11607.1001.51.0_x64_...Blah Blah"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, anybody who has this issue, please check what I did above and come on here to verify&nbsp;whether this issue is happening with or without that Folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can a Microsoft Engineer verify my findings?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can&nbsp;Someone also tell me how to fix the Windows Store Name?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers&nbsp;</p>

<p>All this time I've been reading up on this issue, suggestions have been to roll back the graphics driver to an older version. Tried it and of course, it fixed nothing. Just came across this post of yours and I can concur that notifications seem to be the
 culprit here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of my use doesn't involve notifications on Windows since I use mobile apps on either my phone or tablet most of the time. However, I do use VLC on Windows and it seems it shows a next track notification by default every time the track changes. Found
 a way to turn it off and sure enough, no more taskbar or Action Center freeze - so far at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize not all users would have a similarly low Windows notifications usage as me, but a temporary fix could be to try and disable notifications from programs. Of course, the major issue in the end is notifications should not freeze taskbar and Action
 Center but disabling notifications could alleviate it a bit - for now, I'm somewhat content I don't have to sit staring at the screen like an idiot, unable to launch any new program every time it freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do share if you're able to figure out a more permanent solution.</p>
<p>

<p>I think that is one of the issues that the IE Fix connection problems button fixed for me.&nbsp; E.g. I actually got a prompt about it.&nbsp; The strange thing about it is that IE's troubleshooter isn't the one that comes first to mind when we see this symptom.&nbsp; The

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the issue description, I understand that you have issues connecting to Wi-fi.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can understand how frustrating it could be when things don't work as expected.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To understand this issue better, I would like to know the following information:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you get any error code or error message when it fails to connect to Wi-Fi network?</div>
<div>
<p>2. Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Limited connection means the PC has successfully connected to the router, but the PC wasn't assigned a valid IP address, so you can't actually get to the Internet. It can also indicate that a valid IP address was assigned but that the PC doesn't have Internet
 connectivity. If you're connected to a home network, try restarting the router.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>However Internet connection problems are most commonly caused by disconnected cables or by routers and modems that aren't working correctly.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try these steps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Run Ipconfig /all at the command prompt to check if you are able to obtain an IP (internet protocol) address.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Go to Start screen type command prompt select command prompt as an Administrator.</div>
<div>b. Click âOKâ to open a MS-DOS command line window.<br />
c. Type "ipconfig /all" (without the quotation marks), and then hit theâENTERâ key.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>You may also refer to the following links and check:</p>
<p>
</p><div>The following article will help you identify and fix problems with wired (Ethernet) and wireless (Wi-Fi) network connections in Windows. This tutorial doesn't cover network connection problems related to specific programs.</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Wired and wireless network problems</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a>
</p>
<div>&nbsp;
<p>Internet connection problems are most commonly caused by disconnected cables or by routers and modems that aren't working correctly. First, try running the Network troubleshooter to see if it can diagnose and fix the problem.</p>
<div><strong>Why can't I connect to the Internet?</strong></div>

<p>Maybe we have to be in the right state to see its effect?&nbsp; How are you testing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since then I have noticed that&nbsp;there may be some clues about this symptom in&nbsp; netsh.&nbsp; E.g. in a cmd window enter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh wlan sh all | clip</p>
<p>
</p><p>and then Paste the results into a new Notepad window.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then do a Find (F3) for Connection mode:</p>
<p>I suspect you may get a surprise from that.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>A problem I have is I don't know how it gets set...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah.&nbsp; I just found one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh wlan se profilep connectionmode=auto </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know why an update caused that to become manual.&nbsp; And why only the IE troubleshooter knows about it.</p>

            I'm ready to smash all electronics. &nbsp;I have a Toshiba satellite laptop. Since installing windows 8.1 I have had limited access on my wireless connection. &nbsp;I have tried every remedy out there on the internet. &nbsp;I've even been to the Microsoft site. &nbsp;None
 of the online remedies work. &nbsp;When I look at the details of my adapter I noticed a difference in the first item on the list with values. &nbsp;My adapter details a 802.11d but the wireless connection for the adapter is 802.11n. &nbsp;I haveuninstalled and reinstalled
 the adapter. &nbsp;I still have limited connection after restart. &nbsp;I need someone who knows what tthey are doing to go through every step with me. &nbsp;Anyone up for the challenge? &nbsp;I really need the help or I have to take it in for repair. &nbsp;I'm not kidding when I
 say I have tryed everything on the Web.

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>We suggest running an
</span></span><strong><span><span>SFC scan&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span><span><span>and
</span></span><strong><span><span>DISM command&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span><span><span>to check for any corruption on your files that might be causing the issue. To run SFC scan, please click
</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>here&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>and
 follow the provided instructions. If you'll still be having the same problem, the next step is running the DISM command. Please follow the steps below:</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span><span>Press </span></span><strong><span><span>Windows + X</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>&nbsp;</li><li><span><span><span><span>Select </span></span><strong><span><span>Command Prompt (Admin)</span></span></strong></span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Type the following command and press
</span></span><strong><span><span>Enter</span></span></strong></span><span><span>:<br />
<br />
</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></span></span></span>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span><span><span>It may take 5-10 minutes before the command will finish running reports. Do not close the command prompt window. If the DISM command changed anything, restart your computer for the change to take effect.
 After restarting your device, run the SFC scan one more time and check if the issue will now be resolved.&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>Tell us what would be the result.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try creating a new ADMIN account to see if problem can be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Create a new local user account and password.</p>
<p>Restart computer</p>
<p>Logon to new account.&nbsp; This will setup account. .&nbsp; </p>
<p>Restart computer</p>
<p>Logon to old account.&nbsp; In old account go Control Panel, User Accounts, Change your new account from user to administrator.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Restart computer</p>
<p>Logon to the new account.&nbsp; Go to Control Panel, User Accounts. Make sure you are now administrator.</p>
<p>Test Apps now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this works you can delete the Old ADMIN&nbsp; Account.</p>
