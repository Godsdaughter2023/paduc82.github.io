<p>Well, I'm experiencing the same thing, but that is just the beginning. Your disc Drive may be old, but don't worry about it. it only happens to the old Xbox 360 Arcade and Previous models before 2009. Unless you have one of those. I would recommend calling
 customer support.</p>

<p>Actually the answer below is not true. &nbsp;My black Xbox 360 is only about a year old and I just started getting this problem a week ago. &nbsp;The machine has never been dropped or fallen over it just started out of the blue. &nbsp;Some games play, some don't. &nbsp;Don't
 know the fix yet.</p>

            Hi  SANZOGOKU
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Are all the machines the same make and model and configuration? 
<br />
<br />Not all make and model systems will support Wake on LAN. 
<br />
<br />Here are some steps you can follow:

            Hi Sanzo
<br />
<br />Thank you for the additional information. 
<br />
<br />This is likely a driver issue with your network adapters on those affected machines. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network Adapters 
<br />Select the Network card listed,
<br />Select Update Driver
<br />This should give you a choice of drivers - select the oldest one 
<br />Wait a few minutes while it installs the old driver
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter
<br />Click Uninstall
<br />
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager, restart. Windows 10 should detect the network adapter then reinstall it. Check if you can connect and browse.
<br />
<br />If you can, try upgrading those machines to a newer version of Windows 10.

            At first I thought it was how much I have downloaded so I decided to delete a lot because I knew if I was going to restart I would have all the apps out but after I deleted the stuff it still didn't work so now I am clueless of what it could be.

<h2>            How to print multiple photos in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded to Windows 10. The standard photo app seems to be next to useless when it comes to printing. In previous version you could select 3 x different photos and fit them onto a single A4 page, hit print and a minute later you would have them
 in hand. I can only see an option to print 1 photo at time that prints in the middle of the page, or while searching for an answer, found you could print multiple copies of the same photo on one sheet - not the option to fit 3 x different photos on one sheet
 of paper.</p>
<p>Any ideas? Is there a 3rd party app that people use to get round this?</p>

<h2>            Cannot Find Intel 7 Series&#47;C216 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Driver</h2>
                    Hi everyone, I have a question about updating some of my Intel Drivers, like the Intel(R) 7 Series/C216 Chipset Family SATA AHCI Controller driver.<br />
I've been searching the web and Intel site, but I can't find the drivers for it. I know mine is very out of date and needs updating, but Windows Update says it's using the most up to version (Which it always says even when we know it's not true), and Intel
 Hardware Checker app doesn't seem to find it.<br />
So I'm very confused and was wondering if anyone has a link to the drivers for this controller, or could offer me any advice please.<br />
<br />
Thank you

<p>
</p><p>I just added a couple of extra SSD's to my rig, I benched them after any firmware updates were done. The results were very slow, and I know 100% that they are plugged into Intel SATA 3 (6GBs) ports with SATA 3 cables. So I checked my drivers as I recently
 did a fresh install of Win7, and I saw my Intel Chipset drivers are from early 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my Mobo manufactures site, ASUS, but I was always told that Chipset drivers should be updated direct from Intel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit] The latest Chipset drivers on the ASUS site are from early 2012, but while searching the web, I found a few sites like Lenovo, DriversCape, e.t.c.. that have more up to date versions. I'm just not sure if they would be compatible with mine.</p>
<p>I read a post on the MS forum regarding the exact same thing, and one person did say DL them from the Lenovo site even if you're running ASUS or whatever brand.

                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a weird problem with the languages in my computer which led me to be unable to open it.</p>
<p>My computer has 2 languages in it- Hebrew and English (computer's password is in English) and for unknown reason</p>
<p>I powered my compuer on and now im not able to use English in my keyboard, I cant even find it in the languages selection</p>
<p>so no i'm basically stuck trying changing my computer's language to English.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway where I can write in English without being able to use it on the compuer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much.</p>

            Hi Ofek, try the on'screen keyboard - that might let you change the login language
<br />
<br />Click on the Ease of Access icon at the right bottom of the screen and select On-screen keyboard and login
<br />
<br />
<br />When you do get into Windows 10, to stop this happening again:
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel
<br />
<br />Click Add a language
<br />
<br />Click the Advanced settings link in the left pane
<br />
<br />Set your default Language and click the "Apply language settings to the Welcome screen, system accounts, and new user accounts."

<p>Some games may have been completely removed from the servers so you won't be able to download them, but there will still be some you can redownload even though they are not on the marketplace. just redownload them from your download history.</p>

            Hi  Mefyrx, for now there is nothing you can do . . 
<br />
<br />Setting some File Associations in Windows 10 with some executables is now impossible, a lot of users are reporting this at the moment, this seems to be a bug in Windows 10 since the last update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are working hard to patch the bugs in the last couple of updates, this is one of the bugs they are working on and this should be resolved shortly according to Microsoft, the fix is currently on the insiders ring and should be released to us shortly . ..       
        </p>

<h2>            Where can I buy Windows 10 Pro 64 bit on USB Flash Drive or DVD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I recently moved out in the country in a new state and no one locally is selling Windows 10 Pro 64bit on DVD or USB Flash Drive like I use to see being sold at Fry's Electronics 6 months ago.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, I can't find anyone selling it this way
 Online either, including Fry's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has something changed?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't even find it for sale on Microsofts website?&nbsp; Really?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please direct me to where I can go to get a legal copy of it?&nbsp; I need to install it cleanly on a new machine I'm building so I'd appreciate the help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you and I apologize in advance if this has already been covered somewhere else.</p>

            <p>What difference does it make who manufactured the USB flash drive hasn't got a damn thing to do with how to fix it!!! If your PC can't access it the fixes that are stated here won't do anything to help!!!</p>
<p>Every flash drive works basically the same and there is no need for a make or model number,as this has absolutely nothing to do with fixing one!!!</p>
<p>If the flash drive is unreadable in any Computer it usually means it is write protected, or corrupted!</p>
<p>You do not have privilege to view it,and in most cases when you go to Properties it won't even show the option of SECURITY in it!!!Which is what you need to get to into in&nbsp;order to take ownership to be able to change anything about that USB stick. Open Computer
 look for the USB in the partitions.Depending on which slot it's in you may show a different letter,Mine shows Disk 1(E:) as the partition for the USB.</p>
<p>You may or may not be able to format it from here by right clicking on it;when the&nbsp;submenu opens,then click on format. IF it doesn't format try...</p>
<p>Going into properties.</p>
<p>If you are able to get into security in properties,change it to where you have access to the damn thing,then format or do anything else you want with the pen drive. :/</p>
<p>If the Pen drive states Warning...X:/(X being the partition and the files on it)The File or Directory is Corrupted and Unreadble.Then you can't try formatting it or fixing the corruption with .As this won't do a bit of good if you don't have access to the
 file or drive! You need to take ownership first!!If you can,go into Properties,under Security go to Advanced and choose the user you want to take ownership and also check the inherit permissions from&nbsp;Parental&nbsp;properties as well! This will allow you full control
 over any File or folder. Then once you have full control,try formatting the USB again,it should now work properly and formatting should begin.
</p>
<p>IF it doesn't you may need to run a recover tool to recover the&nbsp;files on it. </p>
<p>The USB I'm working on now states this warning and the properties have no Security option to click on and it is write Protected as well!</p>
<p>I have an unlocker,which failed to unlock it and I can not take ownership in order to fix the thing.</p>
<p>So everything on this page is useless information as to how to fix this device. :/ There is not even mention of a file recovery tool on here.Which more than likely would help half of all folks in need of a fix!</p>

    <title>Vista Black Screen after Loading Bar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista Black Screen after Loading Bar</h2>
                    
<p>I have the problem of which I'm assuming that almost all Windows Vista users have probably experiences - the black screen with the lone white cursor after the 'Microsoft Corporation' loading bar. These are the steps I have tried to resolve the problem but
 have not&nbsp;yet&nbsp;worked:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using 'last known good configuration' brings me back to the blank screen and the white cursor</li><li>Going into safe mode brings me back to the blank screen and the cursor </li><li>Enabling low resolution video mode brings me back to the black screen and cursor</li><li>Using Ctrl + Shift + Esc doesn't bring up task manager during the black screen</li><li>Ctrl + Alt + Delete doesn't work on the black screen </li><li>I do not have access to the installation CD as it was pre-installed onto the computer</li></ul>
<p>And yes, as usual, this happened after a windows update - I really should stop expecting anything good out of these updates.</p>
<p>I am running the original version of Vista Home Premium with no service packs - these caused a similar problem but at least I could system restore back.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance, I know how helpful these forums can be.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 PIN problem</h2>
                    <p>I used to login with my PIN until today when this option disappeared and I can't see any button to bring it back on the login screen. So I logged in with my password and went to Settings&gt;Accounts&gt;Sign-in Options. I pressed on create a PIN, it asked for my
 password which I entered correctly and waited. The PIN form did not show. No matter how many times I restart. I even restored my pc to a week ago when all was ok at no avail. Any idea how to solve this issue.</p>

<p><span>Hi there,&nbsp;<br />
I popped in my black ops disc to play for a few minutes but as soon as I started up the game it disconnected me from XBOX live. As soon as I dashboarded it re-connected me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Did this about 5 times, same result each time...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is this an attack on XBOX live or individual users?</span></p>

<h2>            Assassin&#38;&#35;39&#59;s Creed series, can I skip ahead or not&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So I plan on buying an Xbox One very soon, but before I did I really wanted to make a dent in my current Xbox 360 backlog. I bought way too many games last generation and it's made gaming almost a chore because I can never decide what to play and feel overwhelmed
 with all the games sitting in front of me. Long story short, over the past month I've run through almost 20 games so far and right now I'm on the original Assassin's Creed.<br />
<br />
The first time I played Assassin's Creed I came away unimpressed, it just didn't grab or keep my attention. So I put it back on my shelf for years until a few nights ago. Now that I've gotten used to the combat and assassinated a few people it's become a bit
 more fun to play, but the game still doesn't seem all that good to me. I've heard that the series gets progressively better with each new installment but I'm still a bit wary of trying to play all of the Assassin's Creed games.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only Assassins' Creed game that interests me is Black Flag because I love pirates, naval combat, and can grab it for the Xbox One and skip all the rest which would be a huge weight of my shoulders, adding all of the other Assassin's Creed games to my Xbox
 360 backlog seems like a nightmare lol. Will I be able to understand whats going on in Black Flag if I skip the rest? Is it integral to play the others? If so which ones are the most important to play and which can I skip?</p>

<p>I personally hate this series, but I would go with playing Assassin's Creed II and then Brotherhood if you enjoyed the second. They take place right alongside each other and they're quite good.</p>
<p>I wasn't impressed by the first either.</p>
<p>Revelations and III are entirely up to you based on your impression of the others. I found the setting for Revelations quite interesting and it does feature the same protagonist as II and Brotherhood do but was absolutely unimpressed by III. It just wasn't
 as smooth and I found it quite a chore before I put it down.</p>

<p>You can skip to Black Flag. You'd only need to worry about playing something 'in order' if you're an Ezio fan. The rest of the details you can probably find on youtube or a wiki somewhere that explains in a nutshell what has happened so far.

<p>Hi. If you are talking about just black Flag, then no, you cannot skip ahead in the game. You see, I love the Assassin's Creed game series, but like you, i was not impressed by their original game, Assassin's Creed 1. Then, Assassin's Creed II came out.
 Assassin's Creed II was labeled as "Mind blowing" and as "The best selling game" of the year of 2009. So i thought, what the heck, ill try Assassin's Creed II. With Assassin's Creed II, i was very impressed. In Assassin's Creed II, you get to play as Desmond
 Miles, (the main character of the game). Desmond gets to play as his ancestor, which is the Italian assassin Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Ezio's story is pretty interesting and fun to play. You get to see him as a teenager first and then him slowly finding out
 who his father and who his family is and then you get to see him slowly taking on the family "responsibility", per say, of being a Assassin. Now, there is a lot of storyline and action in Ezio's story. There is so much storyline with Ezio, so much that they
 decided to spread it out into 3 games. Those games are: <em>Assassin's Creed II</em>,
<em>Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood</em>, and <em>Assassin's Creed: Revelations</em>. &nbsp;I think that you will really like Ezio's storyline. Now, there are many other Assassin's Creed games. They spread out across, PC, Nintendo, Playstation, Xbox, and WII. The
 main storyline games are on Xbox and Playstation. All the other games that are on PC and Nintendo and WII are just mainly side storylines that they just made as little extras here and there. Now, after the amazing storyline that is Ezio, the makers of Assassin's
 Creed decided to take a turn away from Ezio and start a new storyline with a new character.&nbsp; The next Assassin's Creed game that came after
<em>Assassin's Creed: Revelations&nbsp;</em>is a game called&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed III. Assassin's Creed III</em>&nbsp;is a amazing game as well. I admit that it is not as good as Ezio storyline. But
<i>Assassin's Creed III</i> is the first introduction of naval warfare. In&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed III</em>, Desmond&nbsp;<span>experiences the memories of a half Mohawk</span><span>, half
 British&nbsp;</span><span>man named Ratonhnhake:ton, who is later, (in the storyline), named Connor. In the first few parts of the game, you play as Connor's father, Haytham Kenway.
 &nbsp;Haytham Kenway is a British, Templar agent. If you know anything about the Assassin's Creed series, you should know that the Templars are the bad guys and the Assassins are the good guys. So, as you can imagine, Desmond is&nbsp;astonished&nbsp;that he has a&nbsp;ancestor&nbsp;that
 was a Templar. &nbsp;But, like I said, you only play as Haytham Kenway for only about 1/3 of the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed III&nbsp;</em>game. After that 1/3 part, then the game switches over to Connor and you play as Connor for the rest of the game, SPOILER&nbsp;ALERT!!!!: At
 the end of the game,&nbsp;Desmond unfortunately dies. After&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed III,</em> the next game comes out with ,again, a new storyline and a new character. The next game that came after&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed III,</em> is the game that you are playing which
 is&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.</em> I am not going to go into to much detail in this game because you are already playing it. So i am just going to the next game that is supposed to come out December 31, 2014. The game is called&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed:
 Unity.</em>&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed: Unity&nbsp;</em>will only be released for Xbox One and for PS4.&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed: Unity&nbsp;</em>is supposed to be placed in France. So naturally, the main character is a French assassin. Now, for the people that love the Assassin's
 Creed series and only have PS3 and/or Xbox 360, there are rumors that the makers of the Assassin's Creed are going to make a&nbsp;separate&nbsp;Assassin's Creed game for PS3 and Xbox 360 people, the game is supposed to be called&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed: Comet.&nbsp;</em>But,
 all of that stuff (about the separate game) are just rumors. The makers of Assassin's Creed (Ubisoft) have not confirmed this separate game. And Ubisoft has not ever released any information about this game either. Ubisoft has, however, released information,
 news, and a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed: Unity.</em>&nbsp;Before you play&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed: Unity,</em> i highly recommend that you play all the other Assassin's Creed games from&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed II</em> to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed III&nbsp;</em>because you
 are missing a huge piece of the storylines. All the storylines fit together. You need to know what happened to Desmond, and the information behind the Assassins and the Templars. So play all the Assassin's Creed games that i mentioned before. The games that
 i highly recommend that you play before you play Assassin's Creed: Unity are as follows:&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed II, Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, Assassin's Creed: Revelations,</em>&nbsp;and
<em>Assassin's Creed III.&nbsp;</em>I highly recommend that you play those games that I listed. You cannot miss the Ezio storyline. The Ezio storyline is the best Assassin's Creed storyline ever. Hope you take my advice!</span></p>

<p>The only thing you may not understand in Black Flag is the whole stupid Animus thing, which they thankfully minimalized in the game. Black Flag is worth playing for the naval combat alone. Loved that game, even though I wasn't very keen on the previous installments.</p>

<p>I appreciate the responses, seems pretty mixed. I'm still undecided lol. While part of me wants to try AC2 the rest of me wants me to finally get an Xbox One and be caught up with no backlog so I can start enjoying gaming again.</p>

<p>ac2 is fantastic, the main character is really fun and the setting is great. if you do play the ezio trilogy, i'd advise you to go after the tombs and catacomb challenge maps as soon as you can, as they give you the best armor sets and weapons in the games.
</p>
<p>as for ac3...i hate to tell someone to only play a portion of a game, but maybe just play up to the switch, as connor is ten pounds of boring in a thimble full of dumb, and it'll give the ending of black flag more meaning.</p>

<p>AC3 sucks. Plain and simple. Some may argue that Connor had to contend with Ezio but come on, what a boring emotionally flat dude he was. I LOVE the AC games but that one, I didn't even get half way through.</p>
<p>AC2 is the best. You can of course skip to AC4 as you wont miss and awful lot that isn't already on the net to read or explained in AC4, but I would advise going through AC2, AC Brotherhood and AC Revelations.</p>

                    I have a Skype identity name others can see when they're logged into Skype. When I want to use it myself, the same Skype name is not accepted. A pop-up says "Enter a valid email address, phone number or Skype name". How can I get into my account? Skype
 is even withdrawing money every month from my bank to use it for Skype to phone, and I can't even get in!&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox 360 battery pack not connecting to controller. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smogrunner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 battery pack not connecting to controller.</h2>
                    
<p>I have two Xbox 360 controllers. At first I thought it was the batteries, so I put new batteries in both. I then took out the battery pack of player 1 controller and put it in the back of player 2 controller and it worked fine. However when I put the battery
 pack of the player 1 controller back into itself it wouldn't work. When I push down the power button on the controller all lights blink but barely. When I release it it goes off. I've check the connections etc and they all seem fine, and like I said these
 are new batteries also. Any suggestions?? New battery pack?</p>

<p>Generally those packs go dead after a certain amount of time. Kind of like an electric charging toothbrush with it's docking station. I've been through a few myself. So I hear you. Just replace the pack and you will be fine.</p>
