<h2>            Never Forget- Halo 3 Piano Cover</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone! Here I am again, with another piano cover which I hope will please you more so than all of my others combined. Ever since April when I came out with my Ashes cover, I've been working on this. I finally played it good enough (while recording)
 to post it online. Without further ado, I present you with <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7jdUQpLf34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the LINK to my video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/l7jdUQpLf34?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/l7jdUQpLf34?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>As always, I encourage and appreciate any feedback you have. Leave some comments, give it a like, whatever you can. I hope you all enjoy! I worked very hard on this. It can be much harder to play than it looks :P</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I figured it would be as good a time as any to release this today, the day after 9/11. It may not be nearly significant to you if you live outside of the U.S. like I know so many here do, but it's a way of me personally showing my respects. Thus, I dedicated
 this video to everyone involved in the tragedy 10 years ago.</p>

<p>It's great dude, a lot more passionate and intense than Birth of a Spartan, which I really like as well. Definitely played well and something I liked to listen to a lot, and the strange sense of nostalgia helps bring out the feeling to it.</p>

<p>I think it's a fitting way as anything of showing your respects dude, that's awesome. I also did like the credits a lot, where your dedication was, I found them very cool indeed, and partly thanks to the music before the crerdits, can definitely see the
 feeling there too.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I have plenty I can think about while that plays, and it's nice to be able to think about it in a positive way.</p>

<p>Great piece man.</p>

<p>Haha thank you CSB. Honestly, I was anxiously awaiting your reply. It was definitely much more heartfelt, intense, and passionate than Birth of a Spartan. It's also much more complicated. Birth of a Spartan literally took me a matter of hours to nearly perfect,
 and I only practiced it over the course of maybe 3 days before I recorded. I've literally been working on this one for months, and it still wasn't perfect in the recording. That can be attributed to "stage fright" though lol.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>BS Angel told me to let her know when I posted another cover, so I posted it on the Beta and Gamma forums of Waypoint as well as tweeted her to let her know I posted it. Thus far, no response from her though :(. Don't want to sound selfish, but I'd absolutely
 love to get this one posted on the Waypoint front page again. That's where most of my views come from anyway. There just aren't enough people searching for piano related things on YouTube for it to gain a good amount of popularity by itself.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>Thanks everyone!</p>

<p>All good dude, glad to see it came out sounding great : ) I reckon it was awesome and loaded with emotion, so it was good to be able to listen to it.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I hope Angel shows puts it on the front page too, because that would be great (and if she said she would, it would be BS not to). Plus, it sucks to have something you've worked on and completed not receive the attention it deserves.</p>

<h2>            MISSING KEYSTROKES</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop PC with Windows 7 / IE (latest version)&nbsp;and I am have a problem keying into 'Search Boxes' and' Password Boxes'&nbsp;using a 33 month old Logik Ultra Slim
<span>Keyboard</span> Model LKBWSL11 connected to a USB2&nbsp; socket at the rear of my PC viz:</p>
<span>Keyboard</span> Model LKBWSL11 connected to a USB2&nbsp; socket at the rear of my PC viz:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which ever search box, &nbsp;such as Google, &nbsp;Ebay, &nbsp;Amazon,&nbsp;&nbsp;I use,&nbsp; over half of my key-strokes do not register so &nbsp;'LONDON OLYMPICS' would appear as
<strong>'LNNLMPIC' </strong>etc.&nbsp; When logging in to my on-line bank account I get locked out due to missing characters in my password .......very annoying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have then switched to the Google Chrome browser and the problem disappears. ! Also no problems when&nbsp;using&nbsp;'word processing'.</p>
<p>

            <p>Not sure but, if its only happening in IE, you could try running IE in 'no add-ons' mode to see if it happens then. If it does not happen then its possible one of your IE add-ons causing the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IE (no Add-ons ) - &lt;start&gt; &lt;all programs&gt; &lt;Accessories&gt; &lt;system tools&gt; and click 'Internet Explorer ( No Add-ons ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it <strong>doesn't</strong> happen in 'No-Addons' then check your add-ons and try disabling them one at a&nbsp; time to see if it gets rid of the problem. If it does stop the problem, then either leave the particular add-on disabled or completely remove it.

            <p>What you need to do now though is rather than run as 'no addons' is to go through them all and disable the ones you don't want, or the ones causing the problem, and leave the ones you want running enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, If you watch videos on some sites you'll probably need 'Flash' enabled. Most of the Microsoft own are probably ok as well. But if you don't need Java (for example) or some 3rd party tool bar in IE then disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, they are not all bad, it depends on what you want or need. If you enable one and the problem comes back then just disable or remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ultimate choice is yours though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad it helped.</p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker 2.6 error. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> not2bdnied  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker 2.6 error.</h2>
                    I have finished editing my movie together with all my collections of clips and everything worked great. Now I want to save my project as a movie file to post on youtube. So I go file &gt; save movie file &gt; save to my computer &gt; enter file name (november video)
 and location (desktop) &gt; best quality for playback. From here when clicking next it is supposed to start to save the movie, but i get an error message that says this:
<br />
'Windows Movie Maker cannot save the movie to the specified location. Verify that the original source files used in your movie are still available, that the saving location is still available, and that there is enough free disk space available, and then try
 again.'<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure i have the original source files, that the saving location is available (my desktop), and i have tons of free space left on my computer. I don't want to have to do it on a different version of movie maker because i spent a good amount of time
 on this project. Any ideas on how to fix it?

<blockquote>My project is a compilation of around 100 different clips so it might well be that it is too complex, but i have made two other videos like the one i am making now and they were more complex than this one. My source files are .avi, is that the same
 as dv-avi? If its not what is a good program to convert the source files, and would i have to start over?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have 137 clips in my timeline<br />
40 clips with video effects<br />
9 clips with multiple effects<br />
5 transitions<br />
audio on all clips, plus a song going the whole video<br />
and 9 title overlays and according to the papajohn website, these are all in the limits...and i downloaded the WinFF from the blog and i did everything it told me to do, but i'm not sure it converted because nothing shows up in the output folder i specified.</blockquote>
=====================================<br />
I do not have *the* answer and can only offer some ideas <br />
that might be worth trying. I hope you find a solution...<br />
<br />
The following forum might be worth a look also:<br />
<br />
Windows Movie Maker Forums<br />
<a href="http://www.windowsmoviemakers.net/Forums/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowsmoviemakers.net/Forums/</a><br />
<br />
There are many types of .avi files and&nbsp;dv-avi is just one of <br />
those types.<br />
<br />
And...your project is&nbsp;quite complex and may be the problem.<br />
<br />
The files must be converted before you import them into <br />
Movie Maker so yes....I think that's pretty much like starting <br />
over.<br />
<br />
Here's a free program that can do the conversions to .wmv.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Format Factory<br />
<a href="http://www.pcfreetime.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcfreetime.com/</a><br />
(FWIW...you may want to uncheck<br />
all the boxes on the final screen)<br />
<br />
After downloading and installing Format Factory...<br />
open the program and choose an Output Folder...<br />
(this is where you will find your files after they are<br />
converted)<br />
<br />
Drag/drop your audio/video clips onto the<br />
main screen...<br />
<br />
Select 'All to ???' / OK...<br />
(the ??? represents your choice of format)<br />
<br />
Click...Start...on the toolbar...<br />
<br />
That should do it...<br />

            Yes, I just had to convert all the files to .wmv....The only downside was having to start over because i couldn't figure out if i could change just the clips in my timeline to .wmv

<h2>            Scheduling and running my powershell script crashed Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I created one powershell script, which is working perfectly when I run it using powershell. It just reads through some XML files and emails some of the information from them. But as soon as I schedule this using Windows Task Scheduler, and execute it, it
 crashes the windows. First off, when trying to open Task Scheduler, after scheduling script, it will give error, that Task Scheduler service is not available. Next, i restarted my system, and windows started in Recovery mode. I even tried recovering windows
 to an earlier saved point, but that also didn't help. My company's IT team had to redeploy complete Windows 7 again on my system. I have already tried this on two different systems, both having Windows 7 professional, and it crashes in same way.</p>
<p>Please help me understand what I am doing wrong.</p>
<p>I am not sure how to upload my script to forum, please let me know if any of you wish to have a look, and i will send my code.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Rebooted the laptop, now comes up with a blue screen saying a driver is corrupt or missing and wont boot any further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only did the update because Microsoft might have fixed the issue with disk usage at 100% all the time, and now its broken completely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi Laurence.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore if this is a Windows Update, or Go Back to Old Version if this is a version update.  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times.  
<br />
<br />If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore to a point before the problem began, or choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version if this was a version Update.
<br />
<br />If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>  The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />The media provided for the Clean Install is Version 1803 and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Then once you're back in Windows 10, you can block the problem Windows or Version Update using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />If the hard drive is failing I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best upgrade you can give your PC - lightning fast, better than a new higher end PC without one.

            You just received a HP Diagnostics error that your hard drive may be failing.  I gave you the way to confirm this properly, so you can replace it (ideally with an SSD which is a better upgrade than buying a new expensive PC with higher specs but with a HD).  
<br />
<br />The symelam.sys error is for Symantec/Norton bloatware.  If you run Norton then it might have updated it's driver so that you can roll back via System Restore in repair mode as I gave steps for earlier.  If not You should reinstall and not install Symantec or Norton which no expert in forums recommends because of the many problems it causes.  
<br />I would use built-in Defender for best performance and fewest issues.  It's made by Microsoft who make Windows and know how to protect it best.  
<br />
<br />So once you confirm or not the hard drive diagnosis, if it is clear then proceed with the steps I originally gave which will resolve it one way or the other.

<h2>            Mouse cursor disapears on 3rd monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspirion 7000 series with two external displays. The #2 display is a newer Lenovo and works without issue. &nbsp;The #3 display is an Acer KA270H (just over a year old) and it displays properly. &nbsp;However, the mouse cursor/arrow disappears on the
 #3 monitor, making it extremely difficult to use. I am using a Logitech wireless trackball M570. &nbsp;I just set this configuration up with two external monitors and this issue came up immediately. &nbsp;Any ideas? &nbsp;Running Windows 10.</p>

<p>The solution was short lived...once I unplugged and then replugged the 3rd monitor in the USB the cursor came back...for a while. &nbsp;Once I stop working on the computer for a while it disappears again until I unplug &amp; replug again. &nbsp;How can I make it 'stick'?
 &nbsp;Are there other options?</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, my computer is a Dell Inspirion 24-7459 Signature Edition. &nbsp;It has only one HDMI input (also has an output) and both of my monitors work with the HDMI. &nbsp;Is there any other options other than using VGA and converting it to a USP input?</p>

<h2>            Search key no longer works with windows 10</h2>
                    As a lot of people have done, I have just upgraded my computer to windows 10. The problem with this is that my keyboard has a&nbsp;key&nbsp;labeled search near the media controles that , surprise surprise, brings up search ... well at least&nbsp;it did in windows 8.1.
 For some reason it does not do this any more. Does anyone know how this can be fixed&nbsp;?&nbsp;

<h2>            Microsoft Safety Scanner Found to be Unsafe By Windows 10. Really Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK. Come on now. I am running Windows Defender on a Windows 10 computer. I downloaded msert.exe from Microsoft (the creator of the aforementioned) and while trying to run it I receive the message " WINDOWS PROTECTED YOUR PC, running this will put
 your computer at risk". I'm sure I should run it anyways seeing as how I got it from Microsoft. The thing that is stoppong me is that there is no obvious security signature and it is showing as not having a publisher. Is there a chance I went to a cloned Microsoft
 site? What's the deal here Billy G?

<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the issue persists, </span></span><span><span>Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner&nbsp;to make sure that the computer is virus free.</span></span></p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for answering Mr. Robot. As I read your cut and paste answer, I must ask myself; "Was it
<em>MY </em>question being answered"? I may be jumping to conclusions here, but I am pretty sure the answer given was chosen by an obsolete algorithm designed to place predetermined answers based on certain<em> keywords
</em>used in the questions. This question falls short of being helpful as is it is not relevant, at all, to my actual question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So, thanks anyways, Mr. Robot. If your<em> Human Masters </em>show up for work today, let them know that the other humans need some help with these Microsoft Products. Hope you get a update soon.

<h2>            Admin Log-in Confusion - Win10 - Want to be me, but not admin.</h2>
                    <p>I understand that always being logged in as administrator can leave me open to unsavory intrusions into my computer, etc. But I haven't been able to find an answer to this simple question:&nbsp; When I log in to my computer, choosing MY profile which is listed
 as administrator (mine being the ONLY user profile), am I automatically logged in as an active administrator?&nbsp; I want to be able to access files, and my desktop setup, etc., but not be logged in as administrator until prompted when I need that access to install/delete
 programs, etc., or when I choose to log in as such.&nbsp; (If I create a new user profile, accessing MY files wouldn't be possible, right?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am not automatically logged in as administrator, where can I look to check for said status?</p>

            Hi Hotzy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Create a new Standard Local Account:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into it, move your files over, test all programs work from it or reinstall them.
<br />
<br />Another way is to create a new Admin Local Account, then change yours to a Standard Account so you don't have to move into the new one.  
<br />
<br />More on this here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />I personally don't think this is necessary because while you'll be prompted to do anything  and have to provide the Admin password to proceed, you'll get the same prompts in the Admin Account from UAC that will block out any intruders unless you approve them anyway.  This is why Windows always creates an Admin account when you first install or set it up.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 for not knowing I was logged in as admin and opening the door to them.</p>

            How did you open the door to these invaders?  You would get the same UAC prompt as an Admin that you'll get as a Standard User.  Did you let something by that caused the UAC warning?

<p>UAC? Sadly, I'm way behind the times. My old custom workhorse finally died and I'm trying to meander my way through the Win10 boxstore computer environment. After 10 years away from web design, I'm helping a friend.&nbsp; Frankly, I'm lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed Bitdefender a couple weeks ago because my former protection expired. Never any warnings from the former or from MalwareBytes, which I have had installed for some time. Then I got all these 404 errors after uploading basic html files and
 eventually found the phishing attempts and the hidden source code that replaced mine have the same culprit. Trying to close the door after the horse got away.</p>

            UAC is the prompt when you try to change something that asks you if you are the one doing this.  If your a Standard user it requires Admin approval to proceed.  If you're the Admin it still prompts you which is all most need to know since you will know if you are doing this and not some invader.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best. If you want the best on-demand scanner install and run Malwarebytes free scanner.
<br />
<br />A phishing attempt usually tries to gain your confidence through an email or other contact to trick you into revealing private information.  You can protect yourself by never falling for any of these unless you know the company or person contacting you and have verified they are who they say they are.  Hang up on anyone phoning you about your PC or private business, delete any emails trying this. 
<br />
<br />If Malwarebytes comes up clean now then you should be OK, but if in doubt I'd wipe the drive and do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br /> It is a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will know what works best and have applied it with your own hands.

<p>Thank you soooo much!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have always been very careful not to open anything I didn't ask for.&nbsp; To only install selected programs instead of entire packages.&nbsp; The only virus I've ever had was on my networked work computer because the receptionist was constantly opening garbage
 sent to her by friends. My kids were never allowed to use my computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I have always had installed and used Malwarebytes.&nbsp; I chose Bitdefender because they had such good reviews after the MacAfee&nbsp; that came installed expired -- and I've never liked them.&nbsp; (Bitdefender actually took a lot of extra time to unlock apps so
 I could get something done, but it is working and I hate to waste the money by not using them.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm really surprised to find myself in this scary place -- I don't really know where they got in (Bit. stopping them now), how they seem to hijack my freshly-minted web files as I upload them.&nbsp; My domain registrar is running a scan, and I may have to
 change domain hosts if I can't get answers there, either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really grateful to you for your time and expertise. Looks like I'll be doing some major housecleaning my next day off!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro only Boots if Install DVD in drive.</h2>
                    I have an HP m9402f tower. Phenom 9650 Quad core 2.3GHz. 7 GB DDR2. PSU is upgraded to a Corsair TX650. PCI-E x16 ASUS Radeon HD6450 2GB DDR3 card. Came with Vista x64. I upgraded happily to Windows 8.1 Pro x64. Windows 10 Pro x64 just installed now and
 it works while in Windows, but I can only boot to Windows if the Installation/ISO DVD is in the drive. How does one fix this without having to reinstall entire System all over again???

<h2>            Skype calls go to voicemail quickly iPhone 5s</h2>
                    <p>i have an iPhone 5s with Rogers. When ever I get skype calls, they go to voicemail after only 1 ring. This only happens with Skype. Regular calls wait for 4 rings.&nbsp;</p>

<li>&nbsp;Sign in to the Skype website.
</li><li>Under Manage features, click on Call forwarding and voice mail. </li><li>&nbsp;Edit your voice mail settings so it refreshes. </li></ul>

<p>Hi HunterKiller786,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say you redeemed the code you got from the store, so if that's true then the code has already been used. You can only redeem a prepaid code one time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check your account details for what it says under your subscriptions. You can go to account.microsoft.com and then select Subscriptions. Or you can pull up your Account settings on Xbox and there is a tile for Subscriptions. It will show you your subscription
 history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double check to make sure the code was redeemed to the correct account.</p>

<p>Thanks for the response. I don't see my Xbox Live Gold membership subscription under my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was working fine for a week after I redeemed the code, but after returning the online version of membership, I am not able to connect to my redeemed subscription. And I am not sure what to do.</p>

    <title>No Recoil Hack&#47;Glitch&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ixamxsniperfrog  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Recoil Hack&#47;Glitch&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I think I might have seen a legitimate hack for the first time on BO 2. &nbsp;I played a few games last night with a player and his guest that were firing guns with no recoil. &nbsp;The 2 that a noticed were a customized MK-48 with a variable zoom scope and an FAL.
 &nbsp;The FAL I'm not so sure about as the recoil on those isn't too bad anyway... but the MK-48 was ridiculous. &nbsp;I'm very familiar with the MK and it's recoil (or lack thereof) shouldn't have been possible. &nbsp;Figuring that it was some weird attachment combo I tried
 picking it up, but it acted just like any other MK-48 for me.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Has anyone else seen this or know of anything like this? &nbsp;Obviously hacks on the Xbox are extremely rare, but they're out there. &nbsp;All I could find on YouTube were PC hacks, but after watching those videos it was the same as what I saw last night. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have seen this a lot. You can really cut it down with attachments but I have been seeing them with none at all. At the moment my favorite gun is the Mk-48. That gun kicks so bad you will be sending bullets 10 feet over there heads.</p>

<p>COD weapons dont have recoil. :P. Anyways, killcams dont show whats really happening and alot of weapons can be feathered, meaning that if you fire, then let up a second, then go fully auto (example), the recoil is non-existant, but there isnt too much in
 COD anywho. Hacks possible, sure, but I dunno, JMHO.</p>

<p>Recoil tends to vary. Scarh is very noticeable, its either bucking wildly, or hardly at all.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>the mk48 is no different. All I have on mine is the dual scope and I can take down targets at long ranges.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In that broke down LA level, from the garage, no problem. Look left from the hole in the wall, all the way over to the ambulance. That's a long distance, people are usually specks... &nbsp;as long as they aren't sprinting across I can open fire and adjust to
 the recoil to bring them down pretty quickly. &nbsp; On the opposite side, in the book store, overwatching the same side of the map as the ambulance, that is pretty long distance and I can take out people with relative ease.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>the lsat at those distances is worthless in my hands though... </p>

<p>From all my time using the scarh I also formed a hypothesis ... on some rare occations when my connection was good autoaim was also spot on. It would "latch " on to people easily and follow them, even through walls etc.

<p>this of course hardly ever happens, but when it did I noticed it also worked at preventing recoil. I'd have to violent move the joystick to get off them (if for example I'm aiming at one person, and another runs across my screen) .</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>try a game with the scarh, then go on YouTube and look up a gameplay. Their gun will likely never bounce up at all. Either they are amazing masters of fine control, or, once again, lag/lag comp is giving them a leg up over everybody.

<p>COD weapons dont have recoil. :P. Anyways, killcams dont show whats really happening and alot of weapons can be feathered, meaning that if you fire, then let up a second, then go fully auto (example), the recoil is non-existant, but there isnt too much in
 COD anywho. Hacks possible, sure, but I dunno, JMHO.</p>
<p>[/quote]This is correct. &nbsp;I've found that the MK with a variable zoom doesn't show any recoil in the theater, so it probably doesn't in the Kill Cam either. &nbsp;False alarm people, lol. I wonder how many other guns do it? &nbsp;Maybe all? &nbsp;The VZ just made it super
 noticeable.</p>

<p>[quote user="IxAMxSNIPERFROG"]. &nbsp;Figuring that it was some weird attachment combo I tried picking it up, but it acted just like any other MK-48 for me.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>No weird combo really. &nbsp;I've noticed that when I have the stock attachment and suppressor. &nbsp;It gets reduced quite a bit. &nbsp;I also like the foregrip as well. &nbsp;That is what I use when I play or try for real. &nbsp;I bounce around at times trying to get all attachment
 and so forth till their 1 away from maxed out. &nbsp;Next Double xp weekend I'll drill them all in a game or 2 for a ton of XP.&nbsp;</p>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />
reference (if you have a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Decent Tidy Taskbar</h2>
                    I want my Taskbar to look like it looked before this disgusting Windows 7 was put on again. &nbsp;How do I get the taskbar to look tidy and the good way it used to.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My programs which are pinned to the Taskbar ALWAYS grouped ... never just 1 stupid program on a line. &nbsp;Now it looks disgusting. &nbsp;It is messy, and the way it shows in this revolting version of Windows 7, the open programs mix with the single column/row
 of programs. I have NEVER had this revolting upsetting look. I HATE IT. &nbsp;I want to know how to make my programs group, with a separator bar, and then a part which shows open programs SEPARATELY, not in the distressing untidy and revolting way they are now.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>PLEASE can someone help me. &nbsp;Each minute I look at this revolting layout, I get more stressed, like the way Windows 7 is set up to HIDE important actions is not distressing enough.</div>

<p>Simply create separate folders for each group of icons, and then add them to the taskbar with the
Toolbars -&gt; New Toolbar item on the taskbar context menu. Once you've added the toolbars, simply arrange them in a group below the taskbar buttons for an organized, dock-like experience without running any additional software.</p>

<h2>            How do I reinstall the built-in microphone&#63;</h2>
                    How do I reinstall the built-in microphone on Samsung laptop, Windows 10? &nbsp;I had wanted to try an external mike, so I disabled the built-in. &nbsp;That didn't work. &nbsp;I then uninstalled the built-in mike, since I could not find a way to re-enable it. &nbsp;Now I
 need the built-in back! &nbsp; Thanks.
