<h2>            Microsoft Money</h2>
                    <p>I have Microsoft Money Plus Home &amp; Business (version 17.0.150.3817) installed on a Toshiba Laptop running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every month when I pay my credit card bill, I download the activity and import it into Money. They support the QIF format and it has always worked with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this month when I download the activity and attempt to import it, I'm getting an error message from Money saying that file appears to be invalid or corrupt and to contact the financial institution. When I call them, they say that all is fine on
 their end and to contact Microsoft. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what might be happening and what I can do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            If the two different versions of Window will not complete a format, your hard drive is "defective."<br />
<br />
<br />
You will need to check to see if:<br />
<br />
1) The hard drive can be used for a Windows Boot drive.&nbsp; Usually hard drives of 2TB of less can be used correctly.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; Find the hard drive diagnostics, the the hard drive manufacturer's web site, and&nbsp; follow the directions to test your hard drive.<br />
<br />
3) Check your computer / motherboard manufacturer's web site for a BIOS update.&nbsp; There could be a "fix" that might correct your current problem(s).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You may want to purchase a new hard drive so as to "by-pass" the "steps" to fix the hard drive issues.<br />

    <title>Neat has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jfk&#64;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Neat has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.</h2>
                    <p>I've installed the Neat software/scanner on my Windows 7 SP1 x64 (with all updates) workstation and I receive the following error message;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Neat has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have worked extensively with the Neat Support with no luck. They claim they have done all they can and since Neat uses .NET, it's a Microsoft issue. I have followed all troubleshooting techniques Neat Support has suggested.&nbsp; I have installed the newest
 versions of software and drivers as requested. I've repaired .NET and reinstalled .NET. I've tried .NET 3.0, 3.51 and 4.5.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neat 5.3 will start, then the error <strong>Neat has stopped working. A problem caused the program to stop working correctly</strong> will appear.&nbsp; if I click the red
<strong>X</strong> or the <strong>Close program</strong> button, the Neat program will close (of course).&nbsp; However, if I move the error window to the side, it appears that I can use Neat 5.3 without any problems.&nbsp; I can scan documents and navigate through the
 software just fine.&nbsp; The question is, how do I stop the error message from appearing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm skeptical that it's actually a Microsoft issue because if someone writes software for a specific OS and it doesn't work, it should be an issue with that software, NOT the OS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;But anyway, if anybody has any ideas, your help would greatly be appreciated...</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I had this same problem. I tried endless things to resolve the issue. Two weeks later I had a mountain of receipts that needed to be scanned and my Neat software still was not functioning.&nbsp; Here is what I did step by step and the problem was finally fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) go to your "Control Panel" and uninstall the following programs in this order:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>NeatConnect Scanner Driver</p>
</li><li>
<p>Neat Mobil Scanner Driver</p>
</li><li>
<p>Neat ADF Scanner Driver</p>
</li><li>
<p>Neat</p>
</li><li>
<p>Uninstall any and all remaining Neat programs<em> (if there are more than listed above).</em></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Even though you have just uninstalled your Neat software, oftentimes files and folders are left behind on your computer. You must make sure that the Neat folder is no longer on your computer. If it is not deleted, when you re-install the Neat software, it
 will simply use the existing corrupted file instead of creating a new folder with new files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I copied the Neat folder to my desktop before I deleted it from my C: drive just in case something went wrong and I needed to reinstall my old files. Here is how to copy and delete your old Neat folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) click on your start button and type"C:/Program Files" and hit enter. Scroll down to the folder named "Neat" and right click on it. Select "copy" and then go to your desktop and right click and select "paste." You should see a copy of your Neat folder.
</p>
<p>3) click on your start button again and type "C;/Program Files" and hit enter. Scroll down to the same folder named "Neat" and right click on it. This time select "delete" and make sure that this folder has been deleted.</p>
<p>4) copy and paste the following URL into your browser and hit enter: http://www.neat.com/support/downloads/
<em>(if this URL is no longer available, then type "Neat download" into your Google search box and hit enter).</em> Click on the blue "Download Neat For PC" button.</p>
<p>5) Save the file to your desktop. This is a very large file and will take some time to download. Depending on the speed of your internet, this can take hours. You will know when the download is complete because you will see the Neat icon. If download is
 not complete, you will get a "Windows cannot open the file" message. Don't panic, eventually it will finish downloading.
</p>
<p>6) Once you see the Neat Icon, right click on it and select "Run As Administrator" This will launch the Neat Installation Wizard. Proceed as instructed.</p>
<p>7) You will eventually come to a screen that says</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Please close any programs that fall under the following categories: </strong>
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>-Anti-Virus or security software</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong>-Automated backup software</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You must DEACTIVATE your anti virus software and disconnect any external hard drives from your computer before proceeding with re-installing the Neat software. Leaving these types of programs running can cause the Neat installation to fail. However, after
 the installation is complete you should turn them back on again. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Just a side note: </strong>I was running the free version of AVG Anti-virus software and it did not offer a way for me to temporary disable the software so I completely uninstalled it<em> (from my control panel).</em> Then I visited the AVG website
 and re-installed it after my Neat install was complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Finish installing the Neat software by following the instructions outlined in the Neat installation wizard.</p>
<p>9) Be sure to check the box next to "create a desktop icon" as well as "Launch Neat when installation is complete."</p>
<p>10) If Neat don't automatically open up after installation is complete, double click on the desktop icon. You should have no more problems with your software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, all of my files and receipts were sitting there waiting for me. I did not lose any of my data. I did not have to use the "Neat" folder I had copied and pasted to my desktop as outlined in step 2. I proceeded to scan two weeks worth of receipts
 and made sure I did a fresh backup before I quit the program. As a precaution, I always backup my Neat files to an external hard drive before quitting the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>11) Finally, I deleted the old "Neat" folder <em>(step 2)</em> from my desktop, and reinstalled my AVG Anti-virus software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the exact steps I took to resolve this problem. Hope you have as much success as I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>S. Kelly</p>

4. If it already says: "Automatic", then click on the "Recovery" tab at the top, and change the "First Failure" line to "Restart the Service", then click on "apply", then OK.<br />

<p>I started having the same problem today, nothing worked, so I did what JamesHLiu suggested. Then when I started Neat, I ran it as an Administrator --- IT WORKS, for now &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Thank you for your answer, James.</p>

<p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Burning .ISO files must be manually located in order to add them on your CD burning wizard. This means that If the file is not available in your
<strong>Library</strong> folder, you will need to search its file path. <span>To further assists you with burning CD’s, we’d like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Which version or build of Windows device are you using? To know, press Windows + R to open the Run window. Type
<em><span style="color: rgba(0, 176, 80, 1)">winver</span></em> and press Enter. A new window will open showing the version and build number of your Windows device.</span></li><li><span>What is the program you are using when you burn a CD?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></li><li><span>Are you using a desktop computer? If yes, what is the brand and model of your CD drive?</span></li><li><span>Where is the location of your<strong> .ISO</strong> file saved?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>We’re looking forward to your response.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are unable to change the brightness. <br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you&nbsp;made any changes to the pc prior to this issue? </p>
<div>Have you&nbsp;installed all pending updates on the pc and also updated all device drivers?</div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go through the below methods:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to restart the computer in safe mode and check if it helps:<br />

<p>
</p><p>I've gone through the normal steps (fiddling with language/advanced settings) and I've even gone so far as to uninstall and reinstall the Japanese language pack and that didn't help... &nbsp;The language bar just absolutely refuses to come back.</p>
<p>

<br />
Well that's interesting. &nbsp;I installed a bunch of Windows updates and the language bar magically reappeared- until I restarted my computer to finish the update process, at which point I was right back where I started (no language bar, and if I force it to appear
 it is blank).</p>

<p><span>-What is the exact/complete error message?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due multiple reasons. Let us place the computer in
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>clean boot</strong></a> to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: After troubleshooting, see the section “<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong>” to return the computer to
 a <strong>Normal startup</strong> mode.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Media Creation Tool upgradenow feature bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cjluce  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Media Creation Tool upgradenow feature bug</h2>
                    <p>Quick Backinfo: &nbsp;Win10 reservered, win8.1 activated 64bit. &nbsp;Month ago I download the media creation tool and, like many people, created the ISO image without using the "upgrade this PC now". &nbsp; Win10 installs correctly via ISO after formatting and receive
 the temporary win10 product key (the one that will not activate). After 3 weeks of using win10 my key never activated. &nbsp;After browsing online topics I see that I missed the part where you're supposed to use the "upgrade this PC now" feature.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fast forward to yesterday. &nbsp;Reinstall win8 and updates, win8.1 and updates and make sure win8.1 is activated. &nbsp;Download Media Creation Tool (64bit) and run it, I select "upgrade this PC now". &nbsp;The tool downloads win10 to 100%, verifies download to 100% and
 then creates win10 image to 100%. &nbsp;Here's the issue I'm running into.<br />
<br />
After the "creating win10 image" gets to 100% the window closes. &nbsp;No prompt of success, no background processes running--nothing. &nbsp;I let it sit for a day just to make sure and have restarted multiple times to ensure it wasn't waiting a restart.<br />
<br />
Troubleshooting done thus far:</p>
<p>-Downloaded media creation tool on both IE and chrome</p>
<p>-Ran the tool on different admin/user accouns</p>
<p>-Downloaded/ran the tool on both a wired and wireless connection.</p>
<p><br />
I've also contacted the microsoft phone support and have spoken with 3 different techs, the poor girl I just got off the phone with was reading from her prompt for troubleshooting and just didn't quite understand the issue. &nbsp;She did provide excellent troubleshooting
 on how to download the win10 ISO though.<br />
<br />

            The media creation tool never fully completed, as stated above. &nbsp;There sadly was no .exe to run. &nbsp;Thanks for the though though.

            First off, thank you for the reply and hopefully I don't come across as ungrateful here...but...<br />

<p>- The windows 10 via windows update is a possibility after the customer receives the "you are ready for windows 10 upgrade" notification, which is technically not the issue since after a month *my turn* didn't come up... I could revert back to win8.1
 and just wait it out but I might miss the free upgrade window.<br />

<p>- As stated above I had "sucessfully" installed via the ISO already but after 3 weeks the PC did not activate, this is of course after troubleshooting the big ticket items such as:<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;- Correct region/Date and Time.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Many restarts</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Running the correct slmgr commands via cmd (as admin)<br />
<br />
Again, thanks for the response but perhaps any input on the symptons such as "why the PC hasn't activated after troubleshooting?" &nbsp;or more specifically is there any further troubleshooting I can tryout with the MCTool and why it's closing abruptly?</p>

            <p>sorry, misunderstood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>try running the media creation tool on a different PC and create your media there and see if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are some bugs in the media creation tool.&nbsp; one seems to be if you run out of download space it just stops.&nbsp; I had that happen.&nbsp; Is your hard drive getting full?&nbsp; That's another reason to create the media on a different PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems that it downloads to a temporary file on your windows drive (usually C:) even if you tell it to create the iso file elsewhere.&nbsp; so if you are tight on space, it doesn't notify you can just hangs up from what I have experiences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>try another PC if you can</p>

            Thanks for the continue support!<br />
<br />
I could d/l the MCT on another computer, but I was able to install the image via ISO disc last time "successfully", just didn't get the activation windows update. &nbsp;The only reason that I'm wanting to do the "upgrade this PC now" so that I get my product key.<br />
<br />
That's the first I've heard of that specific bug, I do have an SSD as my C: but it's currently got 50gb free. &nbsp;I would hope that's enough.<br />
<br />
I do have a win7 laptop, I could just try everything on it and see if I get the product key windows update, then just ninja that key for my desktop as their both on win8.1*<br />
<br />
*Not worried about keeping win10 on my lappy, 7 would do.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the idea!

<p>Do not listen people that call you up like that.</p>

<p>It is NOT Microsoft.</p>
<p>If they did not access your Computer, it should be clean; unless you already had prior Malware installed from your own Net travels.</p>

<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.<br />
<br />
6.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.<br />
<br />
7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span></p>

<p>Hi, -EL.</p>
<p>If you are located in the U.K. please report the information to <a href="http://www.actionfraud.org.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.actionfraud.org.uk/</a> . As shown in the article linked below, the Metropolitan Police in the U.K. have been actively investigating this type of fraud.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>A police crackdown has led to the closure of several websites linked to a scam offering unnecessary PC ‘support’.
<p>The Metropolitan police force’s Police Central e-crime Unit (PCeCU) closed 19 websites linked to the scam in April. This action was taken because of the belief that offences were being carried out under the Fraud Act.</p>
<p>Despite this action, the fraudsters continue to plague consumers. Emails from readers show many other sites offering dubious computer support are still active, or being created. The evidence that we have gained clearly shows fraudulent activity.</p>
<p>Victims of the scam receive a cold call from India. The callers say they have been alerted to the fact that the person’s PC has been infected with malicious software. For more details of how the scam works, see the story on page 2 of this article. Our latest
 investigation into this ongoing scam started when a member of our team received such a call at home from a company calling itself Click2support, which claimed to be a department of Microsoft.</p>
<p>On subsequent calls that we recorded, our undercover reporter paid £89 for security software from this company, which Click2support said was worth £300.</p>

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc

<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits

            Hi Youseff, 1703 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Microsoft Store always pushes the updates on its own whenever updates get available. But there may be delays
<br />
<br />However, open Microsoft Store &gt; You can click 3 dots on top right &gt; My Library &gt; See if there is any update pending before paradise island 2 (You can also click Downloads and updates when you click 3 dots on top right)
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

 troubleshooting options to no avail. &nbsp;When the touchscreen works, it may be for maybe 20 minutes at the most.</p>

<br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I've been using my random $5 USB mouse for about 2 years now with no problem.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I don't remember when exactly, but 2 days back, it just stopped working.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">If I replug the mouse into USB port, the LED goes on for a while, mouse doesn't work during that time, however, it goes off after
 ~5 seconds again (after that, the LED usually just flashes from time to time)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I tried different USB ports resulting in the same effect, different mice (2 Geniuses and more..)</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I found out that Lenovo Solution Centre gives me these errors:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://puu.sh/qC0Is/03f7c8715c.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/qC0Is/03f7c8715c.png</a><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Since I couldn't find the drivers anywhere online, I had to restore my system 3 days back. That brought my drivers back.</span><br />
<span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">After booting up my computer today, the drivers are missing... again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">My USB graphics tablet with its own drivers works fine in the same USB ports, so those shouldn't be the problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Besides restoring system, I also tried clean boot with no effect</span><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">Any
 ideas what should I do now?</span><br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you are having issues with your hardware devices, Microsoft Fix it may resolve it. Kindly download and run the Hardware Troubleshooter from this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have mentioned that it worked after performing a System Restore, but the same thing happened when you opened it today, did you notice if there were new updates installed lately? If there are new updates being installed before this happens, kindly
 check the latest installed updates so that we may check which is causing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>clicking your link and "Run Now" redirects me <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/cs-cz/kb/2970908?entrypointid=RNP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, so I can't donwload Microsoft Fix it.</p>
<p>However, if I click "<a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a>", it opens Device Diagnostic, that tells me OM driver is missing but can't find it online, so the problem stays
 unsolved. (<a href="http://puu.sh/qErz4/0c4924c6e3.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/qErz4/0c4924c6e3.png</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back to System Restore - I tried it one more time, mouse worked for a while, but this time, even after bringing my PC to sleep mode and back on, the driver disappeared. I didn't notice any new updates during that time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice one strange thing in the Device Manager though. The HID-Compliant Mouse driver, that should normally control my mouse (right?), is actually asigned to Wacom Tablet (<a href="http://puu.sh/qErN3/d436937a60.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://puu.sh/qErN3/d436937a60.png</a>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible, that my tablet somehow "took" the driver that should've been used by mouse?</p>
<p>Because when I checked the same driver on brother's computer (he doesn't use graphics tablet), the second and third line was something Microsoft related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: sorry for the Czech language on the screens</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Nope, even after third system restore and uninstalling Wacom drivers, the mouse doesn't work any longer.. this time, it stopped working when the computer was on. I was updating Steam client when it broke this time, but I don't really think that's the
 cause.</p>

            <p>Since the <strong>Device</strong><strong> Diagnostic</strong> tells you that <strong>
Optical Mouse </strong><strong>driver</strong> is missing, it seems that there is a program that is uninstalling the driver when you
<strong>Shut</strong><strong> down</strong> your computer and when it is in <strong>
Sleep</strong><strong> mode</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly use your <strong>USB</strong><strong> mouse</strong> in <strong>Safe</strong><strong> Mode
</strong>and see if the problem persists. If you don't encounter the problem while in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>, probably there is a program that is causing your <strong>
Optical Mouse</strong><strong> driver</strong> to be uninstalled. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clean boot</a></strong> to check which program is causing it.
<strong>Clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> helps eliminating software conflicts that occur when you run a program. Also perform a system check, kindly run your antivirus software to determine if there is a malware or virus that is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, check for driver updates for your <strong>USB</strong> <strong>mouse</strong>. To do this, kindly follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Device</strong><strong> Manager</strong></li><li>Click<strong> Mice and other pointing devices</strong></li><li>Click the<strong> Driver </strong>tab</li><li>Click<strong> Update Driver</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software </strong>and then, check if the problem is resolved<strong>.<br />
</strong></li><li>If there is no driver found, Click <strong>Browse my computer for driver software</strong>.</li><li>Then, click <strong>Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer</strong></li><li>Click the driver <strong>HID-Compliant</strong> <strong>Mouse</strong> (if it is more than one, try to update the latest update to the oldest)</li><li>And then, click <strong>Next</strong></li></ol>
<p>After the steps given above are finished, check if the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>I was so looking forward to this game coming out as was my son. &nbsp;I have to say it has been very disappointing because of all the server and matching issues. &nbsp;The black screens &nbsp;and frozen screens and repeated DNS errors are completely ridiculous. &nbsp;This game
 was definitely not ready for release and EA rushed it out the door just to make a quick buck. &nbsp;I will think long and hard before I purchase another EA product.</p>

<p>Indeed it may help to reinstall the game (game only). &nbsp; &nbsp;This may also be another issue with the EA servers not being the best they can be though. &nbsp; &nbsp; Have you contacted EA for trouble shooting tips? &nbsp;Good Luck and keep us updated!!!!</p>

<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled to no avail. &nbsp;It is definitely an EA problem and not an XBOX problem. &nbsp;I have talked with others and they are having similar issues. &nbsp;It seems it is a wait and see game hoping that EA does updates with patches for the many
 many problems.</p>
<p>Again this just solidifies my opinion that EA was in no way ready to release this game when they did. &nbsp;They pushed the release back 7 days and I just do no think that was long enough. &nbsp;They should have worked out more of the bugs first.</p>

<p>I just rented this game for three days. There's A LOT of server problems. My game crashes, my Xbox 360 freezes, and sometimes there's a glitch that makes a bunch of textures obscure the screen. I can't recommend this game in its current state. If these issues
 are fixed, I'll gladly buy the game. Because this game is SO MUCH FUN! I love the character designs and animations. This game will put a smile on your face. It's a shame about the servers though. :(</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Wifi and Bluetooth no longer working following update&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently updated my SP3 to the Creator Update and since then the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are no longer working, I have tried everything I can think of to get these working but no luck so far. I can connect to the internet using an external USB Wi-Fi dongle,
 which I have used to try get updates/ drivers. The Bluetooth settings do not show and says that I no longer have a Bluetooth adapter. The Wi-Fi is showing but does not list any available networks.
</p>
<p>I have searched the internet for solutions and followed advice on resetting the adapters using CMD and checking for corrupt register keys, but to no avail.</p>
<p>The following is what I can remember trying:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Updating drivers</li><li>Running troubleshooter</li><li>Uninstalling drivers and reinstalling </li><li>Network Reset</li><li>Check for updates (using USB Wi-Fi Dongle)&nbsp;</li><li>Roll back update</li><li>System File Checker</li><li>Reset the PC</li><li>Fresh Start&nbsp;</li><li>I have tried a combination of resetting keeping personal files and now even reset losing all previous apps / files.</li></ul>
<p>Any help with this would be extremely appreciated - not ideal being caught out over Christmas with a device that doesn't function properly. Really disappointed that an update from Microsoft has caused this to happen on one of their own devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>James</p>

            <div>you can try a two button reset (probably won't work)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then</div>
<div>release it.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same</div>
<div>time for at least 15 seconds and then release both. </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons</div>
<div>down for at least 15 seconds.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You</div>
<div>should see the Surface logo.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>and you can try reimaging from the downloadable recovery image</div>

<p>Thanks ror the reply Barb,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the suggested steps didn't solve the issue.&nbsp; I am in discussion with Microsoft support now and hopefully they can resolve it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it unlikely to be a hardware failure giving the timing. Seems very strange given that it worked perfectly before the update and following the update both the Bluetooth and WiFi no longer work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update this thread if I find a solution so that if anyone else experiences this issue they can save the time and effort I have expended in trying to resolve this.

            <p>800 x 600 ok, but how you get these proportions on the screen? because they looks like taken on old 4:3 screen (CRT?)</p>
<p>normally on netbook screen it should be stretched or I'm wrong? </p>

                    Hi all i am new to this and im having a problem! I'm hoping I can get some good advice!! I had purchased a Dell Laptop (1525 or something) for my daughter and it had Vista on it and she was very unhappy with it! So, I took to someone who worked on computers
 and requested Xp for her. I just received a validation thing saying it was a bad key. It says its a bad VLC key. I got a new key from tech net and it won't let me install it. Someone told me I have to get rid of the the product Id# to install it. Is this true
 or does anyone know what I have to do! I also went back to where I got the computer worked on and it's closed down. Please, can anyone help me out with this!!!

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Three posts to get all the information in.&nbsp; Take a deep breath, relax. ;-)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"Dell Laptop (1525 or something)" &lt;-- really?&nbsp; You cannot take the time to figure out what model the laptop is?&nbsp; *grin*</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You "... took to someone who worked on computers and requested Xp for her."&nbsp; &lt;-- what does that mean?&nbsp; Did you purchase Windows XP from them?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>"It says its a bad VLC key" &lt;-- You got taken and/or you knew what you did.&nbsp; That is a Volume License Key (VLK, not VLC)&nbsp;- most likely not gotten in any legitimate fashion.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What you need now is to purchase a legitimate license for Windows XP if you plan on keeping Windows XP on the laptop.&nbsp; Personally - I would think you better off (as would your daughter be) to purchase a WIndows 7 license and
 clean-install Windows 7.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should not be concerned about 'keeping all the programs she has on it' as you should have the installation media for all of that and her data should be (or could be) backed up first.&nbsp; Your main concern should be to get
 the illegitimate stuff off this system (all of it) if for no other reason than you don't know what all is there.&nbsp; This "someone who worked on computers" could have installed whatever they needed to spy on everything you/your daughter did on this computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For your direct question - yes you can use the Microsoft Key Update utility to go from a VLK to a valid product key for whatever product you have installed - but you need a valid product key.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I don't believe this solves the actual problem - which is that you still do not know what all is installed on this system and/or you do not have proper backups/media for it.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My suggestion:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Backup everything important - the documents, emails, contact, bookmarks/favorites, music, pictures, etc.&nbsp; If you/your daughter do not backup - that's just unwise.&nbsp; (For now: manually copy the important stuff elsewhere.&nbsp;
 For later: Get a Seagate Replica 500GB drive, plug it in and follow the directions.&nbsp; First backup will take a while, after that things will not take as long.)</div>
<div>2) Collect together all installation media.&nbsp; Microsoft Office if you have it installed, etc.&nbsp; Make sure you have the product keys/serial numbers handy as well.</div>
<div>3) Purchase Windows 7 - Home Premium is probably fine.&nbsp; 32-bit will better ensure compatibility with more things.</div>
<div>4) Clean install Windows 7 onto the machine.</div>
<div>5) Install an AntiVirus software (Avira AntiVir is good for Free if you&nbsp;don't already have&nbsp;one.)</div>
<div>6) Update Windows 7.</div>
<div>7) Install the other applications.</div>
<div>8) Copy back the files you backed up in step 1 (documents, emails, contact, bookmarks/favorites, music, pictures, etc.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Looks simple because it is.&nbsp; You don't have to be a technical wizard to do any of it.&nbsp; Patient, maybe.</div>

<p>I apologize, I have been up quite some time messing with this!! I also will try telling the whole story within this box.</p>
<p>My daughters mother had purchased this Dell Inspiron&nbsp; 1525 Laptop for Christmas for her in 2007/2008. It came with Vista on it and my daughter did not like it. So, from a recommendation from a friend I took to a person who works on computers and he down
 graded it to Win Xp Pro for 100$. (Back then I had never turned on a computer before so, I didn't know u needed keys) Her mother and I for the first year were buying programs for her (Microsoft Office,Avast,Limewire,Bareshare,Nero,O&amp;O,Regcure,Spyhunter,Tune
 UP and so on... I didn't know u have to save that stuff the only thing I could find is office disk.</p>
<p>Like two weeks ago with updates she was hit with a windows validation thing. It said something like the VLC has been banned or bad or something like that.</p>
<p>I tried locating the person who worked on it and they moved or out of business.</p>
<p>I restored the computer before the windows validation hit it. Now im trying to put a new key in it before I hook up to the internet and get hit with the windows validation.</p>
<p>I have purchased a technet license and have a key, I tried %systemroot%\system32\oobe\msoobe.exe/a thing and it won't take the key at all.</p>
<p>I don't know if this is true but I was told that the product Id # with VLC is blocking me from putting a new purchased non VLC&nbsp; key in it. The purchased key is also Win Xp Pro Service Pack 3.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there is a way to put a new key in without having to do clean install? I need to keep alll the programs cause I don't have all the keys anymore.</p>
<p>Is there a way with the computer restored that I can put a purchased non VLC key in before she gets hit with the windows validation?</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and patience!!!</p>

<div>If you get a legitimate copy/license of Windows XP Professional - you can perform a *repair* installation.&nbsp; That will ask you - later in the installation - for your key.&nbsp; This will keep all of your files/programs intact (although
 there will be some things to fix up afterwards.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before you do a repair installation - I receommend rolling back to Internet Explorer 6.0 (uninstall the updates through the Control Panel --&gt; Add or Remove Programs) and making a complete backup of the system (make an image
 of the drive usig something like Symantec/Norton Ghost, Acronic TrueImage, etc.&nbsp; That way you know you can go back to that if you have to (An image would be a bit-for-bit copy of the system.&nbsp; You would need the application to do this and a drive (like an external
 USB) with enough space to put the image on.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once your backups are in order - you would perform the repair installation with your Windows XP Professional (hopefully with SP3 integrated) CD...</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is possible your TECHNET obtained license is not working because that is a license for a copy of Windows XP you plan on using for testing only.&nbsp; Not for your own personal use. ;-)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/ms772427.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/subscriptions/ms772427.aspx</a></div>
<div>"<strong>Can I use evaluation software received in my TechNet Subscription on my devices in my home?<br />
</strong>The TechNet Subscription license terms grant one user the right to install the program software on any devices, including those located at his or her home, but the user must fully comply with all the license terms no matter where the device is located.&nbsp;
 In other words, one user may install and use the evaluation software, only to evaluate it. You may not use it in a live operating environment, a staging or production environment, or with data that has not been sufficiently backed up. You may not use the evaluation
 software for software development or in an application development environment."</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>But yes - it could be the blocked key might be preventing things all around.&nbsp; You might try using the Microsoft Product Key Update Tool...&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/selfhelp/pkuinstructions.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/genuine/selfhelp/pkuinstructions.aspx</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It might all mean - if that fails too - that you will need to locate an OEM licensed copy of Windows XP out there someplace and obtain it.&nbsp; Not your TechNet Licensed copy.&nbsp; ;-)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>BTW - in the list of applications you listed...&nbsp; Microsoft Office is the only one that you really listed of any 'value' and that would have a key.&nbsp; Limewire and&nbsp;Bearshare are file sharing utilities - usually used to obtain
 music/videos that were not purchased.&nbsp; Nero is a CD/DVD burning utility - there are free alternatives that most report as better.&nbsp; RegCure should never be used, Spyhunter... blah, TuneUp - no use and Avast is free.&nbsp; All of the others&nbsp;(except Office)&nbsp;are downloads
 too.&nbsp; If you have Office - you have everything you will likely need.&nbsp; The rest is free/easily downloaded.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So - I would still like to push the whole Windows 7 thing.&nbsp; It'd be a clean install, with all of that stuff on it - the system obviously had its fair share of issues anyway.&nbsp; But - if you can find a valid OEM/retail license
 key and/or the Product Key Update Tool works for you - if that's good for you, who am I to argue? ;-)</div>

<h2>            I love my xbox one....but</h2>
                    
<p>I love&nbsp;my xbox one, I really do.&nbsp;It's great but I can't help but feel OCD&nbsp;with it. I had many bad experiences with the 360 and had hoped that this console wouldn't suffer from the same launch day problems as its predecessor .</p>
<p>I'm finding myself over thinking every little thing that it's not done "correctly".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Not reading a blu ray disc first time in trying (didn't have any scratches) but&nbsp;has worked perfect since</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2. After changing the power settings and manually switching off the console for it then&nbsp;&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep flashing for 5/6 minutes&nbsp;as if it was switching off and having the Kinect go on and off without anything happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. 2 random&nbsp;white pixels along with a faint line when viewing myself in the Kinect set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love to be able to go argos and just exchange the console for piece of mind,&nbsp;but then I've got to worry about all these other hardware problems that some you poor guys&nbsp;have been experiencing (black screen,disc drive, etc).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone else out there also pulling their hair out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want to enjoy my console!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
