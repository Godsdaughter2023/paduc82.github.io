            Sounds like a driver issue with the usb ports. Right click on My Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Hardware tab &gt; Device Mgr button. Scroll down to the usb devices &gt; right click &gt; update driver. Post your results.

<p>Oh thanks Joel but the result was still the same. I cannot use the USB Drivers at all. I plug in diffferent USB Devices that work fine&nbsp; in other computers. I plug one in on this computer and the entire computer freezes. As soon as it is unplugged everything
 starts working again. Dont know what to do at this point as most everything I need to use has a USB Attached to it</p>

            I believe No Compromise has the correct answer here. Have your computer checked by a local computer repair shop. This does not mean the Geek guys at the major retail stores who charge you $200 for an hours of work. Local small shops are always the best
 bet.

<h2>            3.5&#34; Hard Disk Drive USB enclosure files not accessible&#63;</h2>
                    I recently changed my system hardware. Got a new motherboard which doesn't have an IDE socket.&nbsp;
<div>My previous 3.5" IDE internal HDD can't be plugged in on it. So, I bought a USB enclosure (External desktop HDD casing) for my old HDD.</div>
<div>The casing is working perfectly.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The devise is recognized in disk management (Windows 7) as a removable disk. I have also tried changing the name to "I:". But I still can't access the files.</div>
<div>Can somebody please help?</div>

            <p>You need to install your motherboard chipset drivers from <a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://downloadcenter.intel.com/default.aspx</a>&nbsp;if you have not already done so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With an external enclosure I would expect the disk to show in Device Manager with its own model number, not as&nbsp;an enclosure&nbsp;device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect the disk has failed. Try testing it with its manufacturer's diagnostic utility.</p>

            Can you manually set the location ?&nbsp; That's what I do.&nbsp; Actually put my location to the middle of my neighborhood baseball field.&nbsp; I had to quit visiting the baseball because there was too much dang traffic from uber, lyft, yellow &amp; blue taxi's, white
 and black limo's.&nbsp; What's going on, parents too lazy to walk their kids home these days.&nbsp; Or is it the kids that have too many cell phones.

<p>Both of us have open NAT, decent connections, and I've been through everything in
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/26/t/34069.aspxthis%20thread" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this thread</a>, including enabling UPnP and manually opening ports to the Xbox. I'm not sure about the firewall settings, however. I'm working on a Modem+Router wireless setup (I believe he is too); my router is Dlink's DIR-655, the modem is Zyxel P-660R-F1.</p>
<p>We can both join anyone else, just not each other - doesn't matter from which xbox he uses.

<p>Gotcha. &nbsp;OK, from what you've described, there's definitely some kind of NAT weirdness going on. &nbsp;The connection test will uuuuusually catch that, but not 100% of the time. &nbsp;Do either of you ever have trouble with any other friends at all, or with matchmaking?
 &nbsp;That'll help us figure out exactly where the weirdness is coming from.<br />
<br />
For the time being, let's have you both do a really thorough network reset. &nbsp;Please unplug the router and the modem and let them remain off for a full five minutes. &nbsp;Then plug in the modem first and let that boot up before you boot up the router. &nbsp;Give that
 a couple minutes as well before you turn the console back on. &nbsp;Any good?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm sure the setup is fine, but your NAT rating is probably different from his. And the reason you can't connect to either of them is because they are on the same network.</p>

<p>NAT is a rating that tells you about your network status, and consists of Open, Closed and Moderate. The NAT affects which people you can connect to. Gamers with Closed NAT rating can only connect to others with closed rating however you can join a party/
 game with a Open host, since open accepts all connections. Moderate works the same way, but with moderate instead of closed. Moderate is still more open than Closed though. this means that you and your friend can't play together due to different NAT ratings,
 so you need someone that accepts both of your ratings (a friend with Open rating). there is ways to fix your NAT but they hardly ever work</p>

            <p><span>Hi&nbsp; <strong>Max</strong>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community Forums!!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to install few updates on windows 8 computer. I appreciate your efforts on this issue, we will be more than happy to help you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Let us temporarily disable Windows firewall and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Disable Windows firewall.</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press ‘Windows + W’.<br />
b) Type ‘Windows firewall’ and press enter.<br />
c) Select ‘Turn Windows firewall on or off’ and select ‘Turn off the Windows firewall’ for
</span></p>
<p><span>both ‘public network location settings’ and ‘private network location settings’.<br />
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Notice:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other
 software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>Let us run SFC Scan.<br />
a) Type “cmd” on the Start screen.<br />
b) Right-click on it and select “Run as administrator”.<br />
c) Type the following command and press Enter<br />
<b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to check in new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to create a “<b>Microsoft Account</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Press “<b>Windows key +W</b>”.</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Type “<b>users</b>” without quotes in the search box.</span></p>
<p><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then select “<b>Users</b>” from the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Select “<b>Switch to Microsoft account</b>” right below your user account name.</span></p>
<p><span>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enter the required details.</span></p>
<p><span>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restart the computer and then try to login using new Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For your reference:</span></p>

            <p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em>&nbsp;diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em>&nbsp;quoting this post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the Win7&nbsp;computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Is it a 64-bit or 32-bit&nbsp;computer?&nbsp; See...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />

http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3a. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed third-party&nbsp;anti-virus application or security suite&nbsp;(if any) and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3b. What third-party&nbsp;anti-spyware applications (i.e., <em>not</em> Windows Defender) are installed?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on
<em>the computer</em> since you bought it? [Note: This includes Norton or McAfee "freebies" offered by your ISP; e.g., Norton Security Suite; McAfee Security Center.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [pick one] come preinstalled on
<em>the Win7 computer</em> when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Can you&nbsp;successfuly run a manual check for updates?&nbsp; cf. <a href="http://www.pcruneasy.com/tutorials/windows-8/windows-update/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I disabled the Windows Firewall and Windows Defender, restarted the PC, and attempted to install the updates. I received the same results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>. It completed with the following: "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lastly, this was run from a new account, and as previously mentioned had RESET the PC, so everything was replaced and new.

<p>This is a custom-built PC that had Win7 Pro installed about 3 months ago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. When (exact date, preferably) did you upgrade to Win8?</p>
<p>I do not know the exact date. Approx one week after it's official release.</p>

<p>7. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed and if so, was it installed before you upgraded to Win8?</p>
<p>Yes, I use Chrome as well, but IE is the default browser. I've already reset the PC, meaning Windows 8 was reinstalled, which wiped out all installed apps. I tried for updates before any apps were installed and had the same problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. <em>Since you've owned the computer</em>, have you been&nbsp;in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry

<em>Registry Cleaner</em>)?</p>
<p>Yes, I have used CCleaner to clean the registry prior to the upgrade to Win8. All that would have done is cleaned the registry, which would have been reset after the Win8 installation was reset.</p>

<div><br />
<div>Essentially, the solution is as follows:</div>
<div>I finally got it (2770917) &nbsp;installed by stopping the Nalperion Licensing Service, nlsx86cc, update installed fine from manual/stand alone download/installer.</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Type in msconfig.exe and hit enter</li><li>go to the Services tab on the top</li><li>Disable&nbsp;Nalperion Licensing Service, nlsx86cc</li><li>Restart</li><li>Install update, restart</li><li>Turn service back on, restart</li></ol>
A few restarts, but this appears to resolve the issue.</div>

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E<br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver&nbsp;issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it<br />
could be others.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software issues<br />
can also cause the error. When you get to the driver section of the troubleshooter use my generic<br />
methods in the next message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows<br />
Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-<br />
spyware/security programs.<br />
<br />
When you get to the driver and memory sections of the troubleshooter refer to the next message to<br />
update drivers and test memory and then refer back to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 7E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0x0000007E&nbsp; which is also 0x1000007E</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>The SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To<br />
interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>For a complete list of exception codes, see the <em>Ntstatus.h </em>file that is located in the<em>inc</em> directory of<br />
the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have enough disk space. </li><li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the
</li><li>manufacturer for driver updates. </li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p><em>If you plan to debug this problem</em>, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2<br />
(the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000003 occurs, a hard-coded breakpoint or assertion was hit, but the system<br />
was started with the <strong>/NODEBUG</strong> switch. This problem should rarely occur. If it occurs repeatedly,<br />
make sure that a kernel debugger is connected and the system is started with the <strong>
/DEBUG</strong> switch.</p>
<p>If exception code 0x80000002 occurs, the trap frame supplies additional information.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware that is installed is listed in the
</li><li>Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List. </li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be
</li><li>responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts,
</li><li>and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error. </li></ul>
<p>If a driver is listed by name within the bug check message, disable or remove that driver. Disable<br />
or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup<br />
sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file system, you might be able to use Safe<br />
Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process<br />
in Safe Mode, you must start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote<br />
control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the computer<br />
by using the Recovery Console and then deleting the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the<br />
device or driver that is causing bug check 0x7E.</p>
<p>You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS might to try to resolve the error. You should also<br />
run hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies.<br />
For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or<br />
after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system<br />
BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows installation that are associated with lack of disk<br />
space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary<br />
files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files that<br />
contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more<br />
free space for the installation. You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Check for BIOS and driver updates.)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

enabled.</p>

<p>&lt;configuration&gt;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;system.windows.forms jitDebugging="true" /&gt;<br />
&lt;/configuration&gt;</p>
<p>When JIT debugging is enabled, any unhandled exception<br />
will be sent to the JIT debugger registered on the computer<br />
rather than be handled by this dialog box.<br />
<br />
I need some help in addressing this issue....also sometimes IE 8 ends on not responding and I also have trouble playing games with animation.&nbsp; Some helpful advise would be appreciated.&nbsp;<br />

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Hi,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;When exactly you are getting the error?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>For Windows 7, it includes the
<strong><span>.NET Framework 3.5.1</span></strong> as an OS component. This means you will get the
<strong><span>.NET Framework 2.0 SP2, 3.0 SP2 and 3.5 SP1</span></strong> plus a few post 3.5 SP1 bug fixes. The feature of 3.0 SP2 and 3.5 SP1 can be added or removed via the Programs and Features control panel. Thus,
 we don't need to manually download .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 and install it on Windows 7.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>I would suggest you to download newer version of the framework and install if needed. That is, you cannot install .NET framework 2.0</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you need to install a newer version then you will have to uninstall the old version then go to the Microsoft download center and can download the .NET framework
 version whichever is required and install it on your computer. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><span>Refer to the below mentioned download link for downloading the framework.</span></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/default.aspx</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>&nbsp;I also suggest you to reset Internet explorer, here are the steps:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>1.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Close any Internet Explorer or Windows Explorer windows that are currently open.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>2. Open Internet Explorer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Internet Explorer.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>3. Click the Tools button, and then click Internet Options.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>4.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Click the Advanced tab, and then click Reset.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>5.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Select the Delete personal settings check box if you would like to remove browsing history, search providers, Accelerators, home pages, and InPrivate Filtering data.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>6.
<span>&nbsp;</span>In the Reset Internet Explorer Settings dialog box, click Reset.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>7. When Internet Explorer finishes applying default settings, click Close, and then click OK.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>8.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Close Internet Explorer.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
<strong><span><span>Your changes will take effect the next time you open Internet Explorer.</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span><strong><span>Let us know if you have any issues.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The problem could be your antivirus/antispyware/security products - which of those do you use and which<br />
have ever been on the machine even if you uninstalled them? Those can leave trouble causing remnants
<br />
which can create very strange issues.<br />

</span></a><br />
To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click TaskBar -<br />
Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick reference (if you have<br />
a little box on Lower Left - Show for All Users then check that).<br />
<br />
<strong>How to Check and Change the Startup Programs in Vista</strong><br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a><br />
<br />
A quick check to see which are loading is Method 2 there - using MSCONFIG then post a list of those here.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is a little more complex though you might have a few services running you can do without.<br />
Be careful as disabling a service can impact the ability of other services to run and cause issues<br />
down the road.<br />
<br />
Also some programs add services which might not really need to be starting automatically. You can<br />
often put these type services on Manual to reduce their impact on performance.<br />
<br />
To see these compare those in Start - type in Search box -&gt; Services&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top Right Click on it RUN AS ADMIN<br />
to those in the default of Vista as listed here by BlackViper. Ignore and that are on Disabled (which do not run)&nbsp;or
<br />
Manual (which run only on demand)&nbsp;- for any Automatic or Automatic Delated Start you can post those in here if<br />
you need help deciding if you need to run them. A few of those could be set to Stop and Manual so the calling program can run them as needed.
<br />
<br />
BlackViper also makes some tweaks to the default windows services however I would not do those unless you<br />
really understand the total significance of changing a default service. So use it as a tool to compare.<br />

Another thing that help performance is updated drivers - Vista loves updated drivers.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Reinstalled windows 7 on Asus k53e and cannot install a driver for the wireless card</h2>
                    <p>I had to reinstall Windows 7 on an Asus K53e. It has a wireless network interface, but since I reinstalled, I cannot get it to load the driver. The device no longer shows up under Network Adapters in the Device Manager.&nbsp; The general tab for the device says
 that Code 28.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there someway I can discover what kind of wireless card is being used? I know it is an Intel Centrino, but I didn't write the exact type down before I reinstalled the system. I have restalled the OS on literally dozens of Windows 7 computers, but this
 is the first time I could not find the driver in a search or get adequate support from the manufacturer's site to reinstall the correct driver. I have even tried looking for the driver in the windows.old directory, but it won't automatically install from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>You encounter error code 28 in device manager for any device if the driver for that device is not installed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these methods and check.</span></p>
<b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>You might visit ASUS’s website to download the updated drivers for the Wireless card.</span>
<p><span>Asus support link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;m=K53E&amp;hashedid=fCGFt3hiSAQYMnvO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;m=K53E&amp;hashedid=fCGFt3hiSAQYMnvO</a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2: Download drivers using the Vendor ID or Device ID</strong></span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on “Start button”.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Right click on “Computer” menu and choose “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on “Device manager” option in the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Unknown devices would be listed as such and marked out with a yellow question mark.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Select the unknown device and right click to access Properties.</span></p>
<p><span>f. In the Properties window click on Details tab and select Device Instance Id from the drop down.</span></p>
<p><span>g. An alphanumeric string like this PCI\VEN_1217&amp;DEV_7130&amp;SUBSYS_012F1025&amp;REV_01\4&amp;6B16D5B&amp;0&amp;33F0 is the identification marker for the device. We only need to isolate the
 Vendor ID number (prefixed with VEN) and the Device ID number (prefixed with DEV). In this case, Vendor ID is 1217 and Device ID is 7130.
</span></p>
<p><span>With the numbers identified, a few resources can be tapped to get the vendors behind these numbers.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Viewer showing images as negatives and then printing negatives</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click on a JPEG to print it from Windows Photo Viewer, the preview of the image is shown as a negative, and that is how it prints.&nbsp; It makes no difference which printer I try to print it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked everywhere for a solution - has anyone come across this, and do you know how to fix it?</p>
<p>

            <p>Not certain this is the same problem, but I can reproduce a similar effect as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the 'print pictures' window with the little preview appears, click [options] ( lower right ). Click 'Color Management'. Click [Advanced] tab. Make sure the various settings are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, by changing 'Device Profile' to 'Agfa Swop Standard', I can get a similar effect to the one you describe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, it may be worth checking the settings on this page. Mine are all listed as "System Default (xxxxx)" where xxxxx varies depending upon the category.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not certain, but hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>If not, post back and someone may have a better suggestion.</p>

    <title>Is My Windows 10 Upgrade Crippled With Multiple Issues&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boatboy63  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is My Windows 10 Upgrade Crippled With Multiple Issues&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Attempted to update my Toshiba L755 series laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 Saturday morning. After an hour, there was a problem and it went back to Windows&nbsp;7. I started troubleshooting and it found a problem somewhere and repaired it. Attempted install
 again and was successful after 2 hours. Set up as a local account and changed all defaults to preserve my privacy.&nbsp;Laptop is used by adult&nbsp;family all on a single admin acct&nbsp;and I don't want a MS account associated with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Played around for a couple hours online and closed lid on laptop to make it "sleep" just like I did prior to the install. When I&nbsp;opened lid on it later on, you could see what appeared to be a backlight come on in screen, but nothing ever happened. After
 waiting&nbsp;several minutes, I had to press and hold power button to shut down. I then pressed power button again to reboot. A few minutes later, it was back up and running as before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Started looking around in "Settings" from start icon. Went to System&gt; "Storage" button, it would freeze up and never open. Had to literally click the X in the corner to close out of settings and come back. Tried storage again with same results.&nbsp;Closed and
 came back to&nbsp;settings. Some of the buttons there would open and allow me to browse, and others would also freeze as before, having to click "x" to close. Moved to "Update &amp; Security" and it was scanning for Updates. Sat there for a long time and it never said
 up to date, stopped scanning, or anything. Got on net for a little while, then closed lid to "Sleep" again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Came&nbsp;back later, opened lid, and again, backlight with screen that never resumed. Appears that when lid is closed, LED indicator on front of laptop never shows it as sleeping. Had to press and hold power button to shut down and restart again. Went to Control
 Panel&gt;Troubleshooting and clicked on Troubleshoot Windows Update, and ran as admin. A couple minutes later, it showed a problem of 0x80070490. When I tried to search, I was finding results from Win 8. Went ahead and tried doing a scan of something like DISM
 that I had seen posted, but it came back good. Also had another problem showing it could not locate C:\software something or C:\winupdate. Sorry, but can't remember specifically. I know it may sound crazy, but sometimes when I run a troubleshooter, it will
 give me results after a few minutes and other times, it will appear to run for 20+ minutes and I finally click cancel because it never quits. I searched online for a good while trying to find applicable results for the code it gave, but they were all older
 results. I even ran another scan from something I found online that was like sfscn that checked disc files for errors and they all came back good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to go to the Recovery&gt;Reset PC and give it a try. It gave the option to keep all files which is what I did, as I have many files/programs from the last few years. When I clicked it, it then gave a list of 20+ programs that would be lost and I would
 have to reinstall. I declined that as I didn't want to have to go back thru it again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to find a resolution online for the sleep/resume issue and found many people have been having the same issue. Also saw a recommendation of turning off fast boot to help but it didn't help either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all these issues, I thought maybe Windows 10 wasn't ready for me and chose to go to Recovery and Go back to Windows 7.&nbsp;When I clicked it, a screen popped up saying something like Preparing to Recover, this won't take long. I noticed at first, my hdd
 LED was showing it was being accessed and was working. After waiting 30 minutes,&nbsp;the light basically quit other than a flicker every 15 seconds or so. I cancelled the Recovery and decided to reboot to see if that would help. After rebooting, I&nbsp;went thru the
 process again of attempting to Recover to Windows&nbsp;7&nbsp;and allowed it to sit for over an hour but it never got past the same screen.&nbsp;Other people whom I have seen post about doing this said it only took a few minutes and there was a pop-up asking about why you
 wanted to downgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just like a resolution on what to do to either repair sleep/resume and&nbsp;Windows Update, or a solution of what I can do to get it to go back to Windows 7. Also, I ran in Safe Mode to try some things. One thing I did notice on safe mode was that sleep/resume
 worked perfectly while it was going.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply. If you re-read my post above, I mentioned in the next to the last paragraph, I have tried to restore it back to Windows 7&nbsp;but it did not work. Since posting, I have even tried it for 2 hours at first and never got anywhere. I even
 turned off the anti-virus today and let it try for over 4 hours. I have tried this by going to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery&gt;Go Back to Windows 7. I do not get any option to do this from startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further suggestions would be appreciated. I still have 3 weeks remaining to get this back to a dependable OS.</p>

            <p>Well, it's been a week since my last post and no more help from anyone at MS. For anyone who may be reading this, I did find out something of importance. Since I have been unable to recover back to Win 7, I did finally manage to restore back to the same
 day that I "downgraded" to Win 10. I went to Win 10 on Aug. 1 and was able to restore to the&nbsp;a couple hours after 10 was installed.&nbsp;I was hoping just maybe, it would then allow me to go back to Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I attempted to&nbsp;restore back to the first completion of the Win 10, it would fail and mentioned my antivirus causing the issue. I use the free version of Avast. Don't know if anyone else could be experiencing this, but just wanted to pass it on.
 Before attempting the restore, I went into Avast and&nbsp;disabled it until I physically turned it back on. At first, it appeared to work until it rebooted.&nbsp;When it did, once again it had failed and I&nbsp;realized Avast was back on and running. I had to physically
 uninstall Avast and then reboot. Once I did that, It did restore back to 1 hour after I completed the Win 10 upgrade.&nbsp;Avast was also back up and running, probably due to the fact that it was active at the time Win 10 completed it's install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I once again uninstalled Avast,&nbsp;rebooted, and made sure it was gone. I attempted to recover back to Win 7. It appeared as though it was working as my hdd light was flashing for a good couple hours. I left it alone overnight and the next morning,
 it still had not recovered back to Win 7. I don't know why, but after 10 hours, you would think it would have completed. It appears that it will not recover back no matter what I do. I guess my only option is to copy pictures and all files I want to keep to
 a flash drive and use my original Win 7 backup dvd's to reformat hdd and do a clean install. Still experiencing problems with sleep/resume and laptop&nbsp;just seems to run sluggish and slow at times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to share my findings with an antivirus running while trying to recover or restore. Will probably do a fresh install of Win 7 sometime in the next week unless someone can offer a way to get this back without doing so.</p>

    <title>Doing a Fresh Re-Installation of Windows 10 Questions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_115  say:</h3>
<h2>            Doing a Fresh Re-Installation of Windows 10 Questions</h2>
                    <p>I use Microsoft Windows 10 Home as my operating system.&nbsp; I am finishing up graduate school.&nbsp; After I am done with school, I plan to wipe my computer clean and start fresh with the operating system. &nbsp;&nbsp; I have used the Reset PC options in the Settings section
 in the past, but I want to start completely fresh.&nbsp; I understand that I can also reset my computer by doing a clean installation of Windows 10 which unlike the Reset PC, removes everything.&nbsp; If the clean installation of Windows 10 is the best option to start
 fresh on my computer, how do I carry out this process and what links would I go to to download the necessary software and instructions to carry out the process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a secondary note, I have two internal HDD hard drives that I wish to wipe as well.&nbsp; Windows 10 is located on my SSD.&nbsp; Is there an alternative way that Windows 10 can wipe those HDDs without having to use the Windows Reset PC option? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi John
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, you can make bootable media then perform a direct clean install and format both local drives during setup.
<br />
<br />Here are the steps:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi John_115 , you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Please Note, clean installing Windows will not wipe you second drive, when the installation is complete, you can right click your second drive and choose Format to wipe that drive . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Not the easiest question to answer, because there isn't one way and one way only to do a clean install. Differently people have different customs and procedures that they like to follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's certainly a lot of information about how to perform a clean install on the internet. You should read through some of that information and build your own plan - a plan that works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are two things I can tell you that aren't matters of opinion:</p>
<p>1- You should understand each step you're about to do, and why you're doing it.</p>
<p>2- The better prepared you are, the more successful you will be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only do clean installs when installing a new version of Windows, and I put together a complete, multi-step checklist. Maybe you're not as OCD as I am, but you'll feel more confident if you prepare in advance. Your goal is: No surprises.</p>

Alright this is really getting me mad. &nbsp;I bought Medal of Honor limited edition on release day. &nbsp;Now i hear that everyone is getting a beta clairification email and i am confused. &nbsp;I do not remember anything about my EA profile and I decided to make a new
 one. &nbsp;Will i still get an email of clairification or is there something else i still have to do.

<p>All that email basically said was just that they haven't forgotten about the people who bought the medal of honor limited edition and that when the battlefield 3 public beta goes live, they will let use know. I don't know if you really need to do anything
 or even create a ea profile. But there is no harm in creating a profile. You will probably still get the beta because you did buy the limited edition of medal of honor. As far as getting the email, i really don't know. I am sorry i am not being much help to
 you. If you really want to, you can try emailing ea about your situation and find out what to do.</p>

            Hi Roy,
<br />
<br />You can create Windows 10 installation media using the MCT on any USB flash drive that is 8GB or greater, any time you need it
<br />
<br />The creation process will wipe any previously stored data from that drive, so backup any data on that drive first
<br />
<br />Then, when you are finished with that you can format that flash drive and put your data back onto that drive . ..

            Hi Roy,
<br />
<br />When you read "dedicated USB drive must be used for this" it means that on the USB drive you must have only the Windows 10 Installation Data and nothing more. 
<br />You could rewrite the USB you have used the first time with a newer version of Windows 10, provided by Windows Media Creation Tool. That only means that the previous OS's image will be deleted and a new one will be created.
<br />There's no need to buy another USB drive only to have an USB Bootale OS. But if you want to use for other things the USB actually in use as Bootable OS, you can buy another smaller USB, using that one for the OS Bootable Image and format the older one as local drive for your data.

            Obviously, if you want to create a Recovery Partition on you actual PC, you could buy a small drive and set it as Recovery Partition, but that's only in the case you want to be sure to recover your personal data just in case of OS death.

This isn't meant to be rude, but your very short and cryptic answer has nothing to do with my question. Thanks anyway

<p>Hello, thank you for your detailed reply and understood. You've now made me aware of the good sense to wipe the USB drive and recreate bootable media when a new version of Windows is released. Obvious to me now, so thank you for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My original question was around creating a recovery drive (created dead easy right from Settings), which I understand to be a different animal than bootable media created by WMCT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I meant to ask is "should a buy another (blank of course) usb stick just for recovery purposes (as opposed to OS reinstall) purposes? My intuition says yes. But I do have lots of room on other sticks that have files, program installers etc on them -
 that is&nbsp; why I asked my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's late, I'm tired, but I think you said the same thing I was thinking: yes, use WMCT to have one dedicated USB to be able to reinstall the OS from scratch. And have another USB for recovery purposes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I didn't get that right, please correct me. Thanks! ☺&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks Dave. I intend to keep my existing WMCT-created stick solely for bootable media purposes. Meaning I'll shortly wipe that stick and then run WMCT again to get the most current version of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question was for another stick for another purpose - recovery, not an OS creation tool. Like I said below to Stefano, my common sense says yes, spend the measly $10 or so and buy another stick to configure and use solely for recover purposes, using Settings
 &gt; Recovery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I'm being clear and not coming across as a luddite. And same request as to Stefano, please correct me if I'm not making sense. Cheers!&nbsp;</p>

            H Roy, you are making perfect sense.
<br />
<br />So, to use a USB flash drive as a recovery drive, rather than as installation media, you must dedicate that to the Recovery Process and not use it for anything else, Windows will manage that Flash drive itself . . .

            Yes, that's what I was tring to say.
<br />And better than an usb, for recovery purpose, I suggest an Hard Disk, because of the size an hard disk can provide.

    <title>SCREEN MIRRORING PROBLEM WITH WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stilianoschatzakis  say:</h3>
<h2>            SCREEN MIRRORING PROBLEM WITH WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before, when I had Windows 8.1, my screen mirroring worked almost perfectly - my devices&nbsp;showed up in my TV. &nbsp;I have Sony Bravia&nbsp; KDL-48W585B Model and my devices are ASUS T100 32G Transformer and Samsung Galaxy Note 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with Windows 10, my T100&nbsp; fails to connect to my TV.&nbsp;its trying to connect but finally I get a message fail to connect.&nbsp; My Samsung&nbsp;Note 4 connects perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing that's changed is my Windows update from 8.1 to 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed some instructions from community &nbsp;and I found my screen adapter&nbsp; Intel(R)&nbsp;(HD) Graphics and I tried to update it. But the edition is brand new from 10/7/2015 edition 10.18.10.4252.&nbsp;There is no other update. is it possible to reenter the previous
 edition from windows 8.1? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the screen mirroring a lot and so this is really irritating. Any suggestions gratefully accepted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your time </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>stelios</p>

<h2>            Trackpad on Lenovo Legion Y520&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, everyone!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant figure out how I can scroll using two fingers on my trackpad. I have gone to settings, and it says something like: "Use two or Three fingers on Your trackpad to scroll or change desktop." This leaves me with the impression that I am supposed to be
 able to to it, however I cant. And I cant find any Place where you can turn it on/off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for helping!</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I had already gone to the right place, but my page looked different. Then I realised that it was because I didnt have the Synaptics driver installed. I went to Lenovo-support, and found the "Synaptics/Elan-driver", I installed it and now I can use multi
 touch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>

<h2>            Specific user unable to communicate with external users at a specific domain</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just completed our on prem to o365 migration and I have a specific user that is the only one having problems with Skype for Business in regards to contact external users. More specifically a single domain they are having issues with; however, other users
 within my org aren't having the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When an IM is started from either party, once there is a reply to the message they stop going back and forth unless the window is closed. The following messages appear on either recipients IM windows.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">"This message wasn't sent to First Last"</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)"><br />
Also, the users at this external domain are added to the users contact list, and they respectively show as available, &nbsp;busy etc. but once the user starts a conversation with them, they instantly become presence unknown.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">External communication is allowed with all domains within the **** admin, I've also cycled the ability for the specific user to have external contact communication and the issue
 is still occurring.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 68, 68, 1)">I'm at a complete loss at what the problem could be and any guidance would be helpful.</span><br />

            <p>Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>External Communication is enabled and there aren't any domains that are blocked within the SfB Admin Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Just performed an update to office on the users computer, they are running<br />
Skype for Business 2016 MSO (16.0.6701.1034) 32-bit</p>
<p>2) The user is using the same domain as all users, the migration happened the same for all users within the org.</p>
<p>3) Went into SfB Admin and edited the specific user to no longer have external communication, and then enabled them again to have external communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jesse</p>

</p><p><span><span><span><span>Please disable the external communication and then wait for some time to test again. It may need some time to take effect.
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>To confirm if it is related to the client, I suggest you set up the user’s account on another PC’ client and set up another user’s account on this PC’s client. Can they work normally?</span></span></span></span></p>

            <p>Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies, it's been busy over the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did the external communication disable and waited about 5 hours for the effects, then re-enabled and it took about 30 minutes for external communication to be turned back on, but the issue was still occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried via the outlook web portal with SFB and the same issue was occurring, so it isn't a local computer problem, it has to be isolated to something within the O365 Servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We created a support ticket and about 24 hours after that was created, everything started to work again as normal. It must have just been an intermittent issue that was really bizarre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help!</p>
