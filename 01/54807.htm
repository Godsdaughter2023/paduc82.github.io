<h2>            USB 2.0 devices do not work in Surface Pro 3 USB 3.0 hub</h2>
                    <p>Greetings! I have had a continuous issue for a few months wherein USB 2.0 devices (including flash drives, Bluetooth mice, Xbox controllers) do not work in the USB 3.0 hub of the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The most recent update for Windows 10 has been installed</li><li>I have uninstalled all USB devices and restarted</li><li>Plugging in a USB 2.0 device powers the device, but the device manager doesn't notice anything (even after scanning for hardware changes)</li><li>Plugging in a USB 3.0 USB multihub device will also allow USB 3.0 devices to be recognized, but not USB 2.0 devices; attaching this multihub to another computer allows for USB 2.0 devices to be recognized</li><li>The USB 2.0 devices work on other machines with Windows 10</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that this is a driver issue. I have not attempted to reset my Surface since I have a few dozen applications that I'd have to reinstall, and I would love if there was a fix that wouldn't require me to spend a day reinstalling a number of applications
 just because of a silly maligned update (especially since I have very little faith that this step would actually fix the problem). Thanks!</p>

<p>Thanx chris for all your help. I have opened file explorer and clicked on all folders but when I open FSX the is no file fsx.exe I have absolutely no idea of what is going on. I got a reply from dovetail games. They said to right click on the steam icon
 and select shortcut, advanced and then run as administrator. After doing this I sign into steam and then I am able to run FSX but it wont start directly from the shortcut, cant figure. Anyway at least now I can play it. Thanx again for your help</p>

    <title>Confounded With the Lack of Bumper Button on Wireless Speed Wheel - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erickemmler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Confounded With the Lack of Bumper Button on Wireless Speed Wheel</h2>
                    
<p>Seems the wireless speed wheel was not completely thought out. Unless success to microsoft is once again *** the&nbsp;consumer for some profit.</p>
<p>I love the wireless idea and the wheel works better for driving than the controller. Why no bumper button ability??? For a $60+ controller it is such a small addition and then provides compatibility with games like Need For Speed: Shift. In&nbsp;Shift&nbsp; the bumpers
 are needed to properly&nbsp;navigate through the career selection menus.&nbsp;Need for speed shift advertises that it supports "wheel", guess that does not include the new "wireless speed wheel", something lost on those gift shoppers not sauvy with this stuff.</p>

<p>I have a theory that the circuit board within the wheel has the solder points for the bumpers. I'm currently looking for a security torx that will allow me to open one up to verify. If it does, it's a simple task of soldering in 2 good momentary switches.
 &nbsp;Had they included the bumpers, this wheel would be perfect for many people. </p>

<p>I can not, for the life of me, fathom why anyone - especially Microsoft - would develop and sell a controller, knowing full well that it does not have the full range of buttons found on EVERY OTHER CONTROLLER OF ITS KIND. &nbsp;Did they think no one would notice?
 &nbsp;Or that it wouldn't be a big deal and no one would mind? &nbsp;Ridiculous does not even begin to describe it...</p>

    <title>How do I disable F1 key in Windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> noah marks  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I disable F1 key in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>To answer the question that everyone asks first:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one in the history of Windows has ever purposely hit the F1 key to launch Help. It is however sandwiched between the ESC and F2 keys which are primary keys in Excel. On my external keyboard I have removed the F1 key entirely. And the Insert key. Worthless
 and annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second. There are a dozen responses to this question in the blogs and most have people refuting their success - so what is the Microsoft solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the details of my request:<br />
</p>
<p>I want to disable the F1 key only. </p>
<p>I do not want to disable any other shortcuts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never have any reason to use F1 key - I'll remove it if I have to.</p>
<p>I don't want to mess with the registry.</p>
<p>I am not a programmer.</p>
<p>My company for some reason uses Windows 8, and hopefully the GM of this version has already been fired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can't a user configure shortcuts easily?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<h2>            Cannot log into laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been on the phone to virgin tonight to try and fix internet issues. Cut a long story short she has asked me to go into settings boot safe mode with network and restart laptop. When the laptop has come back on it has asked me to log into my account
 with password. Normally it asks me to log in with PIN which is fine but the problem is I don't know the password. I've tried many including my windows account password. I am able to get into my windows account on the website on my phone and have changed the
 password but that doesn't work either. Is the laptop password a local one not linked to the account? Also on the internet icon in the bottom right it displays a yellow exclamation mark symbol even though it says connected. Anyone have any ideas? Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<h3> j. raymond  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Device not showing for &#34;output&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've been a cochlear implantee for about 2 years now. Advanced Bionics have just released a new device called the Naida CI Connect which (basically) allows the implant processor to connect directly to ANY Bluetooth device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to stream audio from my laptop directly to my implant. I set up the device, and can see it in Bluetooth Devices but when I go to an Output Source all I have available is the built-in speakers for my HP laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7393b18d-4b08-4b17-99ee-b4a4d353d00d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7393b18d-4b08-4b17-99ee-b4a4d353d00d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So...I've tried a few different things and it hasn't worked. I tried looking for a new driver. I've tried deleting and reinstalling the driver. I've searched the web looking for answers and am coming up a fat goose egg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            Hi Jane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I would contact Advanced Bionics via their website here as they would know how this it to connect exactly if it's not working once paired.  There are likely some other settings possibly in the device that need to be made.

<p>Why do you think I'm here? AB doesn't know. There are no "settings" for it...it's a SWORD chip allowing direct connection to any Bluetooth device.</p>

            But how would I know that?  You did not say that you've contact the supplier in your post.  
<br />
<br />  I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br />
<br />Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>
<br />
<br /> See Fixes here which are all working:  
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/windows-10-fix-bluetooth-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14169/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/1017867/make-windows-10-recognize-bluetooth-dongle-as-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/1017867/make-wi...</a>
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/bluetooth-not-working-cant-find-in-device-manager/ccfa2f34-ac5e-4718-b499-e6050e511a41">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />If this is a mic or headset right click Volume icon in System Tray to Open Sound Settings,  make sure the correct device is selected for input or output in the dropdown menu.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version update in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span>I think I see the problem here…now the question is how to fix it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I've gone through your list without any difference to the output.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also have a BOSE SoundLink Mini Bluetooth speaker that I decided to try and connect. As you can see in the picture, it shows up in TWO areas in Device Manager: Bluetooth AND Audio Inputs and Outputs where the NAIDA CI Connect does not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is a driver/device ID issue and I’m not sure how to address it. It might be something as easy as a small driver AB needs to develop so when the OS identifies the NAIDA CI Connect it looks for a driver from AB and that “driver” simply has the information
 in it to set it up as an Audio Input/Output device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The NAIDA shows as a Bluetooth LE Device for "Description" with a Class &amp; Class Name of "Bluetooth" with a Device Category of "Unknown".</span></p>
<p><span>The BOSE shows in Bluetooth devices with a Class of 00240428 and Device Category as “Multimedia” and when I open the properties in Audio Inputs and outputs its Device Description is “Audio Endpoint” with a Class property &amp;
 Class Description of “AudioEndPoint”. The Device Category is “Audio”, Driver description is “Audio Endpoint”, Class name and Display name is “Audio inputs and outputs”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a163a16a-0b45-47e4-a9c5-8a473d8970ca?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a163a16a-0b45-47e4-a9c5-8a473d8970ca?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The BOSE speakers show in the selection of output devices, but not the NAIDA CI Connect.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36a212f2-899c-4f86-8fe2-ac6ee926bcb4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/36a212f2-899c-4f86-8fe2-ac6ee926bcb4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve updated the Bluetooth controller firmware from Intel, checked for other updates and basically did everything you told me to do above with no changes. The OS doesn’t know what to classify it as…and so it just leaves it in the Bluetooth but doesn’t
 “associate” it with anything else because there is no indentifier for it. Is that something that Microsoft needs to put into their database? Possibly…it certainly sees it as a NAIDA CI Connect, so maybe Microsoft needs to have it defined in their internal
<p>
</p><p><span>I've sent this information off to Advanced Bionics as well. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do Help Desk Support for my job...helping users fix their Win10 systems in the automotive arena specifically in their diagnostics &amp; programming for vehicles. I'm certainly no noobe...so if you have any other things you want to try I'm in for a penny,
 in for a pound. Between Microsoft and AB I'm sure we can get this worked out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My needs are a bit more "unique" than most. With cochlear implantees they are typically deaf in both ears. I have perfect hearing in my non-implant ear, and this new technology allows me to stream lessons directly to the implant so I force the brain
 to relearn. Unfortunately...they only have their web site to use and I can't download the lessons to my iPhone.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One other "interesting" observation is that the OS "forgets" my implant and I have to re-sync it every time I want to try working on this problem by disconnecting the battery and reconnecting it so it will pair again. Not sure if it's significant,
 but it is something odd considering everything else I've ever paired to this HP laptop is still in my list of Bluetooth devices.</span></p>

<h2>            Help With GeForce GT 240 Graphics Card</h2>
                    Reaching the point where I want to cuss!&nbsp; I recently had to build a new system with some components from my old Dell which had a bad mother board. When I transfered the remaining components to the new motherboard/case, I was unable to boot my Vista.&nbsp; I
 finally broke down and bought Windows 7. It loaded fine and now the system seems to be running fine with one exception. When I load the drivers for my PNY GeForce GT 240 graphics card, I lose video when Windows starts. As soon as the green scrolling bar disappears
 is when this happens. I hear the Windows sound so I know Windows is loading properly, but NO VIDEO!!&nbsp; I ensure the onboard graphics card is disabled on the mother board.&nbsp; I have tried several installations of Nvidia drivers but to no avail. This error occurs
 everytime I load the Nvidia Drivers. I roll them back in Safe Mode after the video doesn't work each time. I keep checking to make sure the onboard video remains disabled.&nbsp; Any suggestions??<br />
<br />

Biostar TA 790 GXB A2+ mother board<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Enable the onboard graphics from BIOS and check if it works. Also, read the documentation that came along with your motherboard first. Because the actual
 switch for disabling the onboard video could be a physical jumper OR a software BIOS setting, be sure you know the correct jumper.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious
 problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that does not help then, uninstall the drivers for the graphics card completely. Download the drivers from the link given below save it on the desktop,
 after uninstalling the drivers from device manager install the downloaded driver.
</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To uninstall drivers</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1. Click on Start menu, type in devmgmt.msc to open the Device Manager. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2. The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Expand the category of the device you wish to uninstall. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4. Right-click the device and select Properties. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>5. Select the Driver tab on the device's Properties dialog box. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>6. Click the Uninstall Driver button. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Once you have uninstalled the drivers install the latest drivers and check if that works fine.</span></span></span></p>

Epson has Windows 7 drivers for the 2480 scanner, you should use drivers from the manufacturer since they are available.<br />

    <title>Skype cannot locate my sound card - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victor sosa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype cannot locate my sound card</h2>
                    Bought a new mixer (Behringer Xenyx x1204USB) and installed what I believe are all the necessary device drivers. &nbsp;When I turn my mic on and try to record my audio with Adobe Audition 3.0, everything is fine. &nbsp;But when I tried the call testing service,
 immediately a message popped up that said Skype cannot locate my sound card. &nbsp;I don't know that it's just a Skype issue either. &nbsp;When I went into the Control Panel on my computer and checked the sound/audio devices, there's no actual mic showing in the "playback"
 section. &nbsp;The Behringer is listed as a line in and not a microphone. &nbsp;Is is Skype? &nbsp;Is it me? &nbsp;I think I must've inadvertently messed something up but I'm not sure what I did. &nbsp;Any ideas?

            Yes sir, I did check everything through the Device Manager and I am up to date. &nbsp;I have also uninstalled and reinstalled Skype several times with no change. &nbsp;I have been and continue to be able to record my voice into my DAW with no issues whatsoever.
 &nbsp;But to your question about other applications; I did try to see if I could utilize a site that records podcasts for you and then sends the file to your Dropbox account, and the same thing happened there. &nbsp;I got a message saying their system couldn't access
 my microphone.

<div>Problem is the old one is over seas (i gave it to my bro as a b-day gift)</div>
<div>Yesterday I sat on webcam guiding him on how to set up the USB with the Xbox and copy all of my saves to it</div>
<div>He followed step by step, took the Xbox360 (hiden folder) with the DATA0000, 0001, 0002 files and he compresed them</div>
<div>He send them to me via email and I extracted the DATA files, replaced my USB's DATA files</div>
<div>Put it in the xbox, and did not work, i had to redo the setup process for the USB to be used with the xbox</div>
<div>Deleting all my files on my usb</div>
<div>Anyone know why this is not working? Am I doing anything wrong?</div>

            <p>Because all save files are now dead. &nbsp;The usb must be formatted to work with the xbox. &nbsp;Once the usb is put into the pc, the pc reformats the files into something it can read. &nbsp;This makes the files unreadable to the xbox.</p>
<p>If your brother did not delete your original files, have him put them back onto a usb stick and mail it to you. &nbsp;It may take a little longer but that is the only way you're going to get them. &nbsp;Another option is to wait until the fall update. &nbsp;I believe Xbox is setting up the Cloud for gamers where all your saves and info will be saved for easy access with just a login and password.</p>

            Hi Par.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Start Menu troubleshooter:   <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F22D5FDB-59CD-4275-8C95-1BE17BF70B21/startmenu.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/2/F2...</a>
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Settings app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />

<h2>            Computer shuts down instead of restarting</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having this issue for a while now. I have reinstalled the pc, complete clean installation, changed disk, added memory... all to no avail. Wheneveer I want to restart, the laptop just shuts down. I am keeping up with all sorts of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a ASUS S551LN, with 480GB SSD and 12GB RAM, Nvidia 840M 2GB, i5 4200</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a while, I managed to fix the problem by changing the Minimum/Maximum Processor Rate in the Power options to 100%. Worked for a bit and then it started again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me insane as nobody can figure it out. I have been in chat with microsoft support more than once, they have remotely logged into my laptop and performed some test to see what the issue was and never found it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes (not all the times), if I do a Selective&nbsp; Startup by disabling all services but Microsoft's, it will restart normally and then start again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            There can be several causes but to start with, you can try following. Please try these options one by one and check after each option.
<br />
<br />1. Troubleshoot Power
<br />Type troubleshoot in Cortana Search &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &gt; Click Power &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow on-screen direction.
<br />
<br />2. Restore Default for Power Settings
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; sleep &gt; Click Additional power settings to open Power options &gt; Click Change Plan Settings &gt; Click Restore default settings for this plan
<br />
<br />3. Disable Fast Startup
<br />Reach to Power options as in previous step &gt; Click Choose what the power buttons do &gt; Click Change settings that are currently unavailable &gt; Scroll down to Shutdown settings and uncheck Turn on fast startup &gt; Click Save changes
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall / Install Battery Driver (Only for laptops)
<br />Shut down your computer &gt; Detach power chord &gt; Remove battery (if fixed no need to remove) &gt; Attach power chord &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; Expand Batteries &gt; Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System &gt; Uninstall &gt; Shutdown the computer &gt; Remove the power chord &gt; Attach your battery &gt; Attach your power chord &gt; Reboot the computer to automatically install the driver
<br />
<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

 not accept the CD key. &nbsp;I tried the 32 bit CD and the key <strong>worked!</strong>. &nbsp;Why won't the key work with the 64 bit version like it did the first time when I upgraded from Windows XP.</p>

How to Do a Clean Install with an Upgrade Windows 7 Version<br />

</p>
<p><br />
Please read the following:<br />
The upgrade will check that (Windows XP or Vista) is installed. <br />
However the Windows 7 End User License Agreement does specifically state that, therefore as long as you have a valid COA<br />
and product key for the computer you wish to upgrade you can.</p>
<p><br />
So if your computer came with a previous qualifying license (Vista or Windows XP). Note: The Certificate of Authenticity (COA) must be attached to the computer and readable, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license agreement.
 No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p><br />

            On my VAIO laptop I have three battery loading options: &nbsp;
<div>
<ol>
<li>Full capacity, allegedly it's no good idea to use this always.</li><li>Up to 80%, allegedly that's a good compromise for folks actually using the battery.</li><li>Up to 50%, that might be what's happening on your box (<i>RTFM</i>), that's a plan for folks who don't intend to really use the battery, where the overall battery live time is more important.</li></ol>
Wild guess, in my opinion 116 hours makes no sense, it's far too much, my laptop would barely reach four hours with a fully loaded battery. &nbsp;New batteries are
<b>very</b>&nbsp;expensive, you should <i>Read The Fine Manual</i> to figure out what's going on. &nbsp;I vaguely recall that I was supposed to load the battery at least once to its full capacity, run on battery as long as possible, and load it again to full capacity.
 &nbsp;After that they recommended the 80% or 50% plans.<br />

<h2>            Latency</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have been experiencing a lot of lag these last two weeks. I have now found out it is due to high latency. The latency varies from 200-250&nbsp;ms. I have tried a factory reset but that didn't work. On my laptop the latency is 20 ms so it is clear it is a Xbox
 issue. Has anybody got any suggestions as to what I could do or does it need to go in for repair. I have also tried it on wireless and wired so it is a xbox issue.</p>

<p>It sounds as if it is a port issue rather than a console issue. &nbsp;I'd suggest ensuring you have the correct ports open. &nbsp;The next step would be to check or change the settings within your modem/router, so here is the link to reach our Networking Hardware
 Forums:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/networking-hardware/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Once you reach this site please locate the device which you are using and follow the steps for DHCP Reservation and then DMZ, as well as following the basic power cycling technique after changing any port settings.</p>

            <div>Hi Lennox Cedeno,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Have you made any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Runtime errors can occur if you are running two software programs that are not compatible, if your computer has memory problems, or if the computer has been infected with
 malicious software. </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span>Mostly, this error can be caused by two factors:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries are missing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Conflict with other software installed on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Try these methods to fix the error message.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method&nbsp;1:
</span></strong><span>Reinstall the Runtime components of Visual C++ Libraries to resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Download the latest runtime components from the link below. Please check the system requirements before installation.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable Package (x86)</span></strong></p>
<div><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84&amp;displaylang=en</span></a></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Let’s put the computer in clean boot state and check if any third-party program is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications
 or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Here’s&nbsp;an article you may refer to, for steps with reference to the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>How to configure Windows XP to start
 in a "clean boot" state</strong></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
 After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned here:</span></p>
<p><b><span>To configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</span></b></p>
<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure
 Windows XP to start normally.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>a.&nbsp;</span><span>Click
<span>Start</span>, and then click <span>Run</span>.</span></p>
<p>
<span>b.&nbsp;</span><span>Type msconfig, and then click
<span>OK</span>. The <span>System Configuration Utility</span> dialog box is displayed.</span></p>
<p>
<span>c.&nbsp;</span><span>Click the
<span>General</span> tab, click <span>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I created a USB drive (as recommended by MS); I did indeed click setup.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It still requires key code. Will not let me proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This page notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one as long as you upgraded from an activated Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 license or Windows 10 Preview build."</p>

</p><p>I had all the files for the upgrade on my hard drive, but nothing has happened over the past few days.</p>
<p>Ran the setup.exe on my hard drive, but no joy.</p>
<p>I got an error : "Unable to locate required install file [boot.wim] Error code 0x80070002"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a DVD from the downloaded .iso</p>
<p>Booted from the DVD.</p>
<p>It asked for the Product ID.</p>
<p>I carefully typed it in, but I was told is was invalid.</p>
<p>Typed it in, again, no joy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you suggested, I ran the setup.exe on the DVD.</p>
<p>It did not ask for the Product ID, and began the installation.<br />

            <p>Possibly the problem is resulting from your USB drive installation. People have been reporting that you cannot use the USB drive to&nbsp;grade to&nbsp;Windows 10 this way. This method is only for people who have no DVD drive—and have their full retail product keys
 in-hand. If your system has a DVD drive, then you should be&nbsp;using the DVD method to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very likely that systems with the DVD are programmed to treat the USB slot as a DVD drive—and that's why it works for them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back and try again following the instructions as they're stated using an installation disc instead.</p>

            <p>I've been searching this issue for several days and it appears that those answering don't seem to fully understand the problem.&nbsp; Attempting to 'clean install' (booting from the DVD) requires a product key however this step can be temporarily skipped.&nbsp; While
 doing so allows Windows10 to be installed, a product key is still required to activate.&nbsp; It claims the installation requires activation and the current key is invalid (and shows the last 5 characters of my current key)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attempting to upgrade from within Windows7 results in a window demanding a product key be entered and this<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> cannot</span> be skipped.&nbsp; It doesn't matter if I allow the upgrade to autorun after inserting the DVD or if
 I go directly to the 'setup.exe' file on the DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clearly the Win7 key is useless as has been well documented.&nbsp; I understand the process as it SHOULD run but I am stumped with my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this problem on&nbsp;two of three&nbsp;computers, all running 'genuine' Win7 operating systems - only one of the three has the upgrade app in the bottom right corner (the only one I haven't attempted the upgrade to for fear of having the same issue)&nbsp;because
 the other two required me to reinstall Win7 after the failed Win10 upgrade attempt.&nbsp; I was unable to 'repair' or to 'restore' or to return to my original system - very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My product key for the Win7 systems came from my MSDN account and is the same on all three computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, why does my upgrade require a product key - no ifs, ands, or buts...&nbsp; no skipping... no logging into my Microsoft account after upgrading - because I can't get past the product key page unless I do a clean install and if I do that, I STILL have to enter
 a product key to activate - even logging into my Microsoft account doesn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I invite any al all responses.</p>

            <p>I ultimately ended up contacting Microsoft’s Tech-Support by phone and was informed that creating an installation disk — whether by USB drive or DVD — was not ultimately recommended. Rather, I was informed that it is best to simply go to the Download section
 of Microsoft’s website and begin the download process directly from the site, following the instructions thereafter. This worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still have no idea why Microsoft originally recommended (and probably still recommends) creating an ISO file and utilizing a USB drive or DVD. If it was never intended to be the primary methodology, why did Microsoft originally steer so many people in the
 wrong direction?!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Very frustrating.</span>

            <p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; This was the most logical I've received.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I did attempt to do as you (and Microsoft) directed above and go directly to the download site with the same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On two of my three computers (I've not attempted on the third because of the problems on the first two), a product key is required to 'upgrade' to Windows 10 or to clean install.&nbsp; The clean install allows me to skip the key and continue installing but eventually
 requires a key to activate.&nbsp; The upgrade process will not allow me to bypass or 'skip' the key request and therefore, the upgrade ends at that point.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it also provides no way of returning to my previous condition and therefore required me to
 do a clean reinstall of Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yup, VERY frustrating.&nbsp; Microsoft has been of no help.</p>

<p>Actually, this still does not work. I have had the same problem, both from USB keys and SD cards.&nbsp; I create the installation media on the flash drive, then run Setup.&nbsp; It starts, downloads updates, then asks for the key every time.&nbsp; Of course, there is no
 key to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if I download the tool, then run the tool and select "upgrade this PC" then it uses the existing key and the installation is properly activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, don't create full installation media on the USB drive.&nbsp; Just download the tool and put that on the drive, then tell it to upgrade, not create media.</p>

<h2>            left mouse button not working</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows 8.1 and the left mouse button does not work, sometimes when I boot it works for about 2 minutes, very rarely. I have a xornet gaming mouse and have tried other mouses but the problem is the same. Only the left button on the touch pad on my
 laptop works. I have changed the delay to no delay always on but this makes no difference. The right mouse button always works and have changed that to my primary mouse button atm.&nbsp; But I want to play some games that require both buttons to work.</p>

                    I have looked at multiple posts on here and tried multiple suggestions on how to fix this but non of them have worked. Every time i try and download Windows 8.1 from the Windows store it tells me this exact message " You need to use an account with Administrator
 privileges to install Windows 8.1, try logging in with the user account of an administrator of this PC and trying the update again" But this confuses me as i am the only user on this computer and i have checked and I have administrator privileges. PLEASE HELP&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi Ethan,<br />
<br />
1. What troubleshooting steps did you try to fix the issue?<br />
2. Which antivirus program is installed on your computer?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: <span>&nbsp;</span></strong>I would suggest you to reset Windows store and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press <strong>Windows key + Q</strong>.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. In the Search box type <strong>
WSReset.exe</strong> and hit enter.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This will reset your cache for the store. Now try the download and check.
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to enable built-in administrator account and see if that helps.<br />
<br />
</span><span>a. Enabled the "administrator" account.<br />
b. Logged in as administrator and went into User Accounts and managed the original account I want to use to download Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I changed account type from Administrator to Standard. &nbsp;Then changed account type back to Administrator.<br />
c. Logged back in as original account and now you will be able to download 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span>To enable the administrator account you have to get an "elevated command" prompt, then type:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>$ net user&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">administrator</span>&nbsp;/active:yes</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To get the elevated command prompt, you can bring up task manager, click File, then hold the control key and select "Run new task".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span></p>
