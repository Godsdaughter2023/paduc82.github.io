<h3> robert lechl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch pad having problem detecting two finger click after 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>Since the 1803 update the touch pad of my Surface Book 2 is acting more randomly whenever I click on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So if I click often it doesn't react at all.</p>
<p>Or if I click and have a second finger on the touch pad (just lying there) it doesn't do anything, or do a right click, or a pinch zoom.</p>
<p>When click with two finger it mostly fails, of course I have enabled that in the settings.</p>
<p>The only work around is the lower right corner click to simulate the RMB click. Thats work excellent, but it also automatically disables the two finger click.</p>
<p>Also I notice some delays, like I drag something and at first the cursor goes slow, then move on very fast and far to far. All when trying to drag things while clicking.</p>
<p>I didn't got an tab click to work. I mean a slight tab instead a force click.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before 1803 update it worked lot better, all I had to do is disable the 3 finger click and got reliable results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry, but since the update i can't work anymore with the touch pad. I rely on Software where I need a to drag a lot both with normal click on right mouse button click.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I switch to my MacBook I feel a huge different. I never had such a problem and really never care if I have one or three finger on my touch pad, it always works correct and like I want. Thats so sad for the MS Surface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a few advices like running diagnostic, reinstall the surface drivers etc. But nothing worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all advices.</p>

<h2>            How do I combine desktop icons on two screens&#63;</h2>
                    I am running windows 7 on a computer with a video board that feeds two monitors. I also have three additional screens connected via Diamond USV to VGA converters.<br />
<br />
Occasionally, for no obvious reason, the desktop icons will be split between two screens.<br />
<br />
How to I consolidate all of the icons onto my main screen without having to move them manually one at a time?<br />

<p>I am running Windows 10.</p>
<p>I have the updated drivers and the dongle shows up in the device manager as Generic Bluetooth Radio.
</p>
<p>Along with Microsoft Bluetooth Enumerator.</p>
<p>I can go into W10 Settings &gt; Bluetooth &amp; other devices &gt; Add Bluetooth or other device and...</p>
<p>It prompts me for a device PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, understand that I attempted this a couple of times prior.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time, Windows actually gave me a PIN to enter into the device. </p>
<p>However, the device's BT search feature timed out before I could complete the function. I tried again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, it generated a different random 6-8 digit pin for the new device.</p>
<p>I entered the suggested PIN into the Rii Mini (I think). Not sure how that worked without being paired but still...</p>
<p>I wasn't prompted to make a note of the PIN and have no idea what it was.</p>
<p>Now, it's asking for a PIN and I don't have one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to disable, reenable,... but I cannot get it to reset or prompt another PIN.</p>
<p>The manufacturer is of no help whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need windows to reset the the passcode sequence for the device.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>While I very much appreciate your reply, I'm afraid we might be getting lost in translation.</p>
<p>So, that I understand properly... Windows did not generate the PIN for the generic dongle?</p>
<p>I assumed that Windows created a random custom pin for the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a side note. The device support page has been shut down. It's here or nowhere.</p>
<p>I guess, I'm just out $30.</p>

<p>Yes, the PIN that is being provided is auto-generated by the device.</p>

            Hi CorGardy 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You should use File Explorer to copy the photos from iPhone and pasting into Windows.
<br />
<br />When you attach iPhone to Windows computer, iPhone will appear under This PC. Open its internal storage and open DCIM folder. Now navigate to folder where the required pictures are. Select them &gt; CTRL+C and go to the destination folder in File Explorer and CTRL+V to paste them.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’ve set up a family account on Windows 10 and it is sort of working fine but i have noticed one thing that is a little odd:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The times being recorded on the child account are wrong. &nbsp;On some occasions they are showing websites have been accessed at very early hours of the morning (3 and 4 am) yet the sleep time is active from 9:30 pm until 7:30am. &nbsp;On one occasion the activity
 was occurring when I know my child was definitely asleep. &nbsp;We’ve checked all the clocks and it is making no sense!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Am i doing something wrong in the set up...I am a novice at this and trying to come to a happy medium with my child but the inconsistencies in the data are making it very hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<h2>            Removing windows 10 and replacing with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new laptop with Windows 8.1 pre-installed, and then did the upgrade to 10, in the hope that it would be better, but I absolutely hate it.
</p>
<p>Is there a way to remove it and install Windows 7?</p>

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>You will first need to go to the manufacturers website for your model computer and first find out if there are Windows 7 native drivers available. A lot of computers that come preloaded with Windows&nbsp;10 do not have native driver support for Windows 7 by the
 manufacturer. If there are no native drivers, you will have to consider returning the machine and purchasing a machine preloaded with Windows&nbsp;10 Pro with downgrade rights to Windows 7 Professional. Or look through the manufacturers catalogue for systems already
 preloaded with Windows 7, usually the business line will have these options. </p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Return the laptop if it came preloaded with Windows 8 and purchase one already preloaded with Windows 7, they are still available:</p>

                    i keep trying to connect to the wireless internet in my house but I keep getting "the connection between your access point, router or cable modem and the internet is broken" along with the "default gateway is not available" when I run a diagnostic on why
 I can't connect to the internet. The first one usually comes up with detected and the second one usually comes up with fixed next to them in the&nbsp;dialogue box. I have an HP 2000 laptop computer that I got over Christmas. I runs on Windows 8, no one else in
 my family is having this problem with their computers. Right now I am on my father's computer using the wireless internet to try and figure out what the problem is.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />Did you download those fonts form the Internet?
<br />
<br />If so, are they coming down as zip files and if so, have you unzipped those files to get the contained font files?
<br />
<br />Right click a font file, is the file type ttf or otf

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issues description, you are being prompted to perform check disk on every startup. To help you suggest steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if
 you could answer the following question: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any software or hardware changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try following the step and check if that works:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many errors in Windows are caused by corrupt files. Those files could have become corrupt because of errors on your hard drive. The Check Disk tool checks for errors
 and attempts to fix any it finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> Use Check Disk at your own risk. On rare occasions I’ve experienced problems when using check disk in Windows Vista. Here are
 a few things to watch out for:</p>
<p>
<span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you run check disk and your computer has to be restarted to scan your computer and your computer hangs at a black screen when it boots up, do the following:</p>
<p>Turn the computer off and back on and immediately start pressing F8 on your keyboard repeatedly. A black screen with different boot options
 will appear. Select to use the Last known good configuration (advanced) boot option.</p>
<p>
<span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Never stop check disk once it has started. It could take hours to days to scan your hard drive depending on its size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How-to Use Check Disk?</b></p>

<p>Click
<b>Schedule disk check</b>. Disk check can’t check a hard drive that has open files. Your computer will reboot and check the disk before Windows Vista boots up. If you want to cancel the scheduled disk check for any reason, check out this guide.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Using the Command Line Interface</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check Disk can also be run using the command line (DOS) prompt.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Open the command prompt with administrative privileges by typing
<b>cmd</b> in the <b>search box</b> in the <b>Start Menu</b> and right-click

<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type <b>chkdsk</b> followed by one or a combination of switches listed below in the command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you run the check disk (chkdsk) command from the command prompt by typing just chkdsk check disk will run in read only mode. All it does is check for errors.
 It will not fix any errors it finds unless told to do so. This is done by adding switches when typing chkdsk in the command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A switch looks something like
<b>chkdsk /F</b>. Notice the switch<b> /F</b> after the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Below is a list of most of the switches used with the check disk command. You can use one or a combination of switches with the check disk command.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>D:</b> If you want check disk to scan a drive other than the C: drive, add the drive letter after chkdsk to tell it to scan that drive.
 If the drive is called X: on your computer it would look like chkdsk X:.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>/F:</b> The /F switch is the most common of the chkdsk switches. It tells chkdsk to fix any errors it finds. Chkdsk can’t fix errors on
 a disk that has open files. If chkdsk asks you if you want to check the drive next time Windows Vista boots or dismount the drive choose to check the drive next time Windows Vista boots. Never choose to dismount the drive. That option should only be used by
 a professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>/R:</b> The /R switch tells chkdsk to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector is a spot on the
 hard drive that can’t hold saved data anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>/I:</b> The /I switch tells chkdsk to perform a less detailed but faster disk check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>/C:</b> The /C switch tells chkdsk to skip the checking of cycles within a folder structure which reduces the scan time. Don’t ask me what
 this means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of an exhaustive disk check using the command line interface is:</p>
<p>chkdsk D: /F /R</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The check disk command shown above will fix any errors it finds and also attempt to recover bad sectors of the D: drive if any are found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot sign into Windows account in Windows related apps. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hydrafiend52  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot sign into Windows account in Windows related apps.</h2>
                    I've been having this issue since I got back from a vacation on May 28th. From what I've been told, no one had used my PC during that absence.<br />
<br />
Basically, the title explains it all. On any Windows related app, be it the Store app or Xbox app, whenever I try to login to my account, the pop-up window for "Signing In" will briefly appear, but it quickly closes itself without any input from myself. It
 isn't an issue of forgetting my password or username, as I'm clearly logged into this account right now. I should also make a note here that I'm using a local account , rather than having that whole linked-MS account thing.<br />
<br />
Before this, for about a week or so the Store and Windows-related apps would refuse to even work on my computer (even Edge). I suspect this may have been a side-effect of installing a Windows update, as everything works normally now. During that time period,
 I did that whole "wsreset.exe" thing, and even messed with the registry at one point (which, when combined with wsreset, seemed to bring back the Store with limited functionality).<br />
<br />
However, I don't know if my tampering resulted in what's happening now, or if this login difficulty is also a result of a recent Windows update. Any help would be appreciated, thank you.

            Xylee,<br />
<br />
Hi! Thank you for leaving a message. To answer your questions;<br />
<br />
1. The OS Build is as follows, "15063.96". The version of Windows 10 is "1703".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. The last time I updated Windows 10 was during that whole "Creators Content" update thing...I think it was a few weeks ago now? I forgot to mention I had already (manually) checked up on my updates, and everything appears up to date.<br />
<br />
3. Now, that's also an issue I forgot to mention. I had attempted a "clean boot", but whenever I hit the "Apply" button to change the startup method (from Selective Startup to Normal Startup, as per the instructions) , the method wouldn't save. So in other
 words, I was being locked to a Selective Startup, even though I was hitting "Apply" and then "Ok" to change it to a Normal Startup for a successful "clean boot". Not sure of any workarounds for this, but I'm pretty sure if a solution could be offered on how
 to get around this issue, this might just be the fix I'm looking for.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the instructions I read up on almost made it seem as if changing the Startup mode would immediately restart the computer; if this is indeed the case, it did not happen for me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you for taking the time to respond to my issue. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Totally spaced on the link you left for me. Those instructions are a little different than the ones I followed when I first tried the clean boot, but I will try them soon and tell you how it goes. Thank you for sharing that link.<br />
<br />
<strong>EDIT: </strong>Clean booting, unfortunately, did not work. I followed the instructions to the letter, but unfortunately, the pop-up box for "Signing In" still closes immediately. I was pretty certain clean booting would be the solution but now, I don't
 know what I can do. Still holding out that it's just an issue with a recent update, or something.<br />
<br />

            Hello again.<br />
<br />
When I attempted to perform a Startup Repair, it stopped shortly into the process, informing me that it was "unable to continue". It then left me a .txt file named "SrtTrail.txt". I'll post the contents. I'm feeling a little iffy on the strings of "0x0", but
 is that even something I should worry about?<br />

Clean booting did not work again. I also discovered that I cannot "Add" my Windows account via the&nbsp;<strong>Activation</strong> tab, which is under
<strong>Update and Security </strong>in the <strong>Settings</strong>. The similar "Log In" screen pops-up momentarily before closing itself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for taking the time to respond to my message and assisting me through this issue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>EDIT: </strong>Not sure if this helps any, I also cannot create any new "Users" for my PC (same issue with the pop-up screen). I'm not sure if this is related at all, either, but the PC also cannot detect "Family Members". I hadn't thought much of that
 warning before (it's been present since the this started, if I can recall correctly), but I'm beginning to think it may be connected to this larger issue.&nbsp;</div>

This..."partially" worked. Somewhat. In the end, I used a recovery drive to just totally reset my PC, after saving all my personal files to numerous flash drives and such...<br />
<br />
In any case, my Windows account's work and everything now. Thank you for having the patience to deal with my issue, and I hope you have a great day!

            If you have the most recent mouse driver update, and it is a recent update, try downloading and installing the older version.
<br />
<br />Here are some tips about video drivers, but you can apply the general principle to mouse drivers
<br />
<br />POSSIBLE FIX – UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/find-missing-drivers-hidden-components-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/find-missing-dr...</a> 
<br /><a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-device-manager-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/ways-open-devic...</a> 
<br />•	uninstall your display driver:
<br />•	In start menu search for Control Panel’ (icon view)
<br />•	Right click on Device Manager
<br />•	Select Run as Admin 
<br />•	double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall (ie Display Adapters).
<br />•	You have buttons for 3 options:
<br />•	if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the “Roll Back Driver button”
<br />•	or you can try the Uninstall button
<br />•	or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update “manually” is better)
<br />  - restart Windows 
<br />
<br />GENERAL- UPDATE DRIVERS IN WINDOWS 10

<br />
<br />UNINSTALL VIDEO DRIVER

<br />•	This is a recent, VERY common problem being asked on the site. The current unverified best guess is to try resetting the Video driver: either roll it back, or uninstall it and let win re-install, or windows upgrade it or manually download upgrade from video system builder site
<br />- In start menu search for Control Panel’ (icon view) 
<br />- Right click on Device Manager 
<br />- Select Run as Admin 
<br />- Expand Display Adapters
<br />- double click on the device whose driver you need to uninstall to display the Driver Properties dialog
<br />- You have buttons for 3 options: 
<br />- if it is active and you think the problem is a recent update, you can try the “Roll Back Driver button” 
<br />- or you can try the Uninstall button 
<br />- or you can try the Update Driver to let Windows do the update (often doing a driver update “manually” is better) 
<br />- restart Windows 
<br />
<br />
<br />If it is not an Intel:registered: HD Graphics driver, make note of the name (in case the fix above did not work). Go to the web site for the video card maker and see if they have a newer driver for the specific video card.  Also ask the same question there to see if they can come up with a better answer.
<br />
<br />Reduced display functionality with older ATI (AMD) Radeon video cards after update (not FCU specific)
<br />An update package (not RS3 specific) incorrectly targeted ~1.9M devices and resulted in reduced display functionality with older ATI (AMD) Radeon HD 2000 - 4000 series video cards. The update package is expired, so no new exposure is expected, however we have received ~3,000 support cases and observed significant forum and social activity. We are actively working on an Answers Q&amp;A post which will include mitigation instructions.

Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

    <title>HACKING - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> greatorexjohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            HACKING</h2>
                    <p><span><span>Having discovered a connection to a remote computer in Windows 7 Credential Manager ("virtual app/didlogical") I enquired and was informed that this link is a credential that
 is stored on the computer and is used by Windows Live applications, such as Messenger or Live Mail, among others.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you remove the virtualapp/didlogical file it will be retrieved from the net and re-installed by these programs.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Because I don't use any of these programs, I installed a shortcut to Credential Manager on my desktop so that I could easily remove the virtualapp/didlogical link each time it re-appeared.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Shortly afterwards, my Credential Manager shortcut disappeared from my desktop - it had been removed to the recycle bin!<span>&nbsp;
</span>(No other person had access to my computer.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I suspected someone somewhere was gaining access to my computer via the link.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The same thing happened again after I'd replaced the shortcut onto desktop, except it had been transferred to a Control Panel file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I again returned it to Desktop, but soon afterwards, this shortcut had disappeared completely from my computer,<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Also, the 'Credential Manager' program had somehow been altered and now refused to allow me to set a new shortcut to be set up. As I was expecting something like this, I had kept a copy of the shortcut in a Word file.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I decided I would now insert TEN shortcuts to Credential Manager on my Desktop - just to see what would happen. By 1.30 pm on the same day, these had all been completely removed!<span>&nbsp;
</span>Next, I inserted a shortcut to Credential Manager but renamed it "Find this if you can!" - to check if<span>&nbsp;
</span>the person removing the shortcuts could still identify it.<span>&nbsp; </span>Sure enough, by the next day, even that shortcut had been removed!<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the link to virtualapp/didlogical allows someone to amend programs, and identify and delete shortcuts from desktop, it would seem they could more or less do what they liked with the computer. After this, I disabled Credit Manager itself and have had
 no further problems.<span>&nbsp; </span>My question is this:&nbsp;surely this action has not been&nbsp;authorised by Microsoft?<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

            Thanks, canadiantech, but I do not need help sorting a problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I do&nbsp;not have Windows Live Essentials on my computer -&nbsp;and there is no problem with my Windows installation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;think I deserve&nbsp;an explanation as to&nbsp;how and why the remote computer operator
 linked through "virtualappdidlogical" was able to amend programmes and delete shortcuts from my desktop,&nbsp; and&nbsp;whether&nbsp;such action&nbsp;has been&nbsp;authorised by Microsoft.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since disabling Credential Manager&nbsp;(as I do not use programs such as Live Messenger) - thus&nbsp;removing
 the link to virtualappdidlogical quite some time ago, there have been no further instances of unauthorised&nbsp; interference&nbsp;with programmes and shortcuts on my computer,&nbsp; indicating&nbsp;that the remote computer operator had full access.&nbsp;

            <p>Canadiantech:&nbsp; Thanks again, but Microsoft state "virtualapp/didlogical "should not be a threat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Why haven't they stated "IS NOT A THREAT?"&nbsp; I'm looking for denial (or proof) that this programme does not allow indiscriminate access to computers on which
 this credential is installed.&nbsp; Only then might I accept that my computer could be hacked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The events I've described happened in July - having disabled Credential Manager I've had no further problems with hacking since.&nbsp; Re-installing Windows cannot&nbsp;provide
 the evidence I'm looking for.&nbsp; If someone with Windows 7 and virtualapp/didlogical installed inserts a shortcut to Credential Manager on Desktop and reports nothing untoward happening in the following 24 hours it might prove things one way or the other!

</p><p>Hi GREATOREXJOHN, I recon you really are having worrys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you shouldn't do- You shouldn't install anything like RegCleanPro, or any remote desktop apps from INTERNET websites.</p>
<p>What you could do- Disable remote desktop under "<strong>Control Panel</strong>" --&gt; System And Security --&gt; Allow remote access and their pour is dirt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reply:&nbsp;&nbsp; Sorry, Trojanwin - there are&nbsp;no "worrys!"&nbsp; The&nbsp;problem of interference with my desktop shortcuts disappeared completely in July,&nbsp;after I had disabled "credential manager" which stopped "virtualapp/didlogical"&nbsp;allowing
 access to my computer.&nbsp; Despite my detailed explanations above, no one has yet&nbsp;realised that I'm trying to find out if, and why, or a denial, that the programme&nbsp;allows remote access to the computers on which it is installed.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade very slow out of sleep&#58; 7 minutes</h2>
                    <p>I have a 2013 HP h8-1520t originally with Windows 8 Pro. Upgraded to Windows 10 about a year ago. It ran without problems. Recently it has been very slow coming out of sleep: about 7 minutes. I tried Enable Ulps 1 =&gt; 0 and this did not help. I switched from
 AMD Radeon to NVidia graphics card and this did not help either.</p>
<p>Any ideas will be much appreciated.</p>

<p><span>I bought Call of Duty Ghosts for my 360 on Amazon and it came with the Free Fall DLC. &nbsp;When I typed in the code on the DLC card the screen said the code had already been used, even though it was the first time I typed in the code, I tried multiple
 times to redownload it, on my console, in the in game store, and on the website. &nbsp;It always says the code has already been used. &nbsp;I should also say the game was brand new and shrink-wrapped &nbsp;when I got it, so there's no way someone had used the code before
 I got it. &nbsp;How can I fix this? &nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Eject a CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wroughtpigeon69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eject a CD</h2>
                    
<p>I have a problem which I know must have a very easy and obvious answer. We have an Xbox 1 (obviously) and there has only been one CD in it since we got it. Now we want to put in another one but I have been unable to locate an eject button anywhere on the
 console or the controller and I have been searching online using Google and have found two ways to do it.</p>
<p>One is to turn it off and use a paper clip on the left side next to a small yellow dot. That has not worked yet, I can push it in about 1" and it stops, nothing else happens. Don't want to press too hard because I don't want to break anything. It does not
 seem to me that is the preferred way to eject a CD anyway, there has to be a way to do that with everything powered up.</p>
<p>The other option is to press the eject button but no one says where this eject button is, there is no button labeled "eject". Please assume I am the village idiot and tell me where this eject button is in one syllable words.</p>

<p>Thanks, I was about to take a pic of the front of my Xbox to copy here and prove there was no button. My Xbox is white and the button is totally invisible, it blends in perfectly with the slot. I did not see it until I got close with a flashlight and even
 then I only saw it because I knew exactly where to look and the triangle glinted in the flashlight beam.</p>
<p>The existence of this button is not mentioned in the tiny pamphlet that comes with the Xbox.</p>
<p>Thanks again, problem solved.</p>

<p>The eject button is directly to the right of the Blu-Ray opening. It has a triangle on it and should be touch sensitive.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Install .Net framework 3.5 on Windows 7 Ulitimate 64 bit</h2>
                    When I download and run&nbsp;the bootstrap file for .Net framework 3.5 is says 0 bytes downloaded and quits with a "setup error". If I download and save the file, it won't start, won't open just acts like a dead link.&nbsp; Someone from another software company
 ran a .net cleanup utility on my computer last night and now many of my programs are not working correctly and I am told that they all need the .net framework to function.&nbsp; I tried running windows update and it says my computer is up to date.&nbsp; Can someone
 tell me how to install .Net framework in windows 7?

            Hello jcampbell46,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your reply back!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;When you open your Windows Media Player try to change or verify the setttings.<br />
<br />
Select 'Alt' key to view options.&nbsp; Then select 'Tools'-&gt; 'Options'-&gt;&nbsp; <br />
From the Options tab, you will be on the "Player" tab.<br />
Verify you have a check in the box for the option "Allow Screen Saver during Playback"<br />
<br />
Please let us know status.&nbsp; Thanks!<br />
