<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane

<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-verify-if-you-downloaded-or-installed-the/06f98274-741a-45df-9e0d-6cc48816824b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Which version and edition Windows did you originally upgrade from or was installed prior to your current version:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - 1703, 1607, 1511, 1507 (build 10240)
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.‚Äù 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If you recently upgraded to Windows 10 1803:
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Make sure all the latest cumulative updates have been installed. 
<br />
<br /> It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters.
<br />
<br />
<br />Chipset:

<br />
<br />If these updates don't help....
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

<h3> its og faithful  say:</h3>
<h2>            cant download xbox 360 account</h2>
                    I recently wanted to sign into my xbox live account on my xbox 360 to play some games with my friends and I had an error code where i couldnt sign into my account. I read that you have to delete and re-download your account to fix this. So I deleted my
 account, cleared the cache, updated my payment options, and updated my privacy settings. So I go to download my account and its stuck at abt 1/4 of the way and wont move. Keep in mind I've had this issue for forever but I've always had my profile on a USB,
 until now. I cant do much of anything abt it either because I have to wait a month because I updated my privacy settings. I also do not have an error code.

<p>Hello Its OG Faithful,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here on the Xbox forums. Is your console having issues with any other profile? How long has this been going on for?</p>
<p>If you do not have any other profile, then you can try letting a friend or family member attempt to sign into your console with their profile.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from that, I would recommend connecting your console to a different home network if possible. You can also try using a hotspot if that is the only other network available. Please note that hotspots don't always provide solid connection, so a friend
 or family members home network would be ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If other profiles download fine on your console, then we would need to troubleshoot your account specifically. If switching networks fixes the issue, then you may need to upgrade your network hardware or contact your service provider for support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            This problem has occurred on all of the xbox 360s I have tried to sign into and Ive done everything I can to fix it (changing privacy settings, changing payment settings, changing wifi connection) I still can download other accounts to my xbox 360 so its

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing you can try, that I don't see listed, is changing your password. There is a password limitation on the Xbox 360 in terms of how long it can be. You may need to shorten it if it exceeds 16 characters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I don't think you are able to since you have that 30 day lock on your account in terms of updating your settings. you may want to consider
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contacting a live agent</a> so that they can go overt your account details.</p>

            i have reset the password and thats likely what caused the initial error for signing into my xbox 360 account. I have contacted a live agent and filled out a submission form<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Activation Error After Latest Upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation Error After Latest Upgrade</h2>
                    I have an HP Prodesk 600 G1 SFF with 32gb of ram running an intel i5 4570 CPU and a Western Digital 650gb SATA drive.&nbsp; I got the free upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7 earlier this year.&nbsp; The download and&nbsp;upgrade went smooth and Windows 10 was activated.&nbsp;
 Yesterday (12/4/2015), I got the latest update to Windows 10.&nbsp; The&nbsp;download and install went fine.&nbsp; After the last reboot, I launched Windows and while checking out what is new I noticed that now Windows is not activated.&nbsp; Prior to yesterdays update, my copy
 of Windows 10 was activated and now it's not.&nbsp; I get an error message stating that Windows is not activated as the previous version of Windows on this devices was not activated. The error code it gave me was 0x803F700.&nbsp; My original version of Windows 7 was
 an OEM version that came with the PC.

I have had the same problem I accidently logged on to the new speech thing on win 10 with outlook but I did not want to because it has changed the password on my family computer and I no longer have the email or phone number that I need to change password and
 I also don't know how to change them

    <title>Windows 10 only boots to Advanced Startup Options after update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amberd1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 only boots to Advanced Startup Options after update</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Envy M6-ae151dx laptop running 64-bit version of Windows 10 (it came new with Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a Windows update on 5/20/18 after postponing it a few weeks earlier. It was going really slowly, but other than that nothing out of the ordinary for an update. I was doing other things while the update was going on, but periodically glancing at the
 computer screen. I remember seeing it was around 70-80% done, then a short while later the screen went black and it looked like it was restarting. At that time I walked away from my laptop for a bit, thinking the update was done, and came back to a blue screen
 asking me to choose my keyboard layout. I picked "US" and was directed to this screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e460e624-5f98-4cf8-ae4b-d6945269b897?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e460e624-5f98-4cf8-ae4b-d6945269b897?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I first chose "Continue - exit and continue to Windows Rollback" thinking that would undo the most recent update that seems to be causing problems. However, when I chose that option, my laptop restarted and booted right back to the "Choose your keyboard"
 screen.&nbsp; After that I clicked "Troubleshoot" and was taken directly to "Advanced Options":</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946e18a6-69be-4d8e-9fdd-86820e2e6774?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/946e18a6-69be-4d8e-9fdd-86820e2e6774?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First I tried System Restore.</strong> It offered me 3 options to pick a restore point from ("Windows Rollback", "Windows 10 on volume 3", &amp; "Windows 10 on volume 3"). None of them worked. Regardless of which I chose, I got an error stating no restore
 points exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Next I tried Startup Repair. </strong>I was given the same 3 options ("Windows Rollback", "Windows 10 on volume 3", &amp; "Windows 10 on volume 3"), and tried all 3, but again, none of them worked. Each time it would say "Diagnosing your PC" then eventually
 went to a screen that said "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC" with the option to either cancel or go to Advanced options. I clicked "Advanced options" and was taken back to the "Choose an option" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since 5/20 I have been frantically Googling for solutions and tried many different things to no avail. It seems many, many people are having catastrophic issues with this latest update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I tried starting in Safe Mode</strong>, but all the examples I was able to find of how to do so showed "Startup Settings" in the Advanced Troubleshoot screen. Since "Startup Settings" isn't an option I'm offered on that screen, I found
<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-force-windows-to-restart-in-safe-mode-2625163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a>&nbsp;and used the command prompt in the Troubleshoot screen to set my laptop so that it was forced to boot into safe mode. After restarting, for about 10 seconds I saw a black screen that said safe mode around the border, then it immediately went
 back to the blue keyboard selection screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I tried the USB recovery drive</strong> I made when I first got the laptop and attempted the Startup Repair from that with the no result. With the recovery drive plugged in, I was given the option to "Reset this PC" and chose the option to keep my
 files. I got a message saying it was preparing then after a few minutes a message saying my PC couldn't keep my files and be reset.&nbsp;</p>
&nbsp;
<p>After more searching, I found <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6?auth=1">
this post</a>&nbsp;and have at least been able to transfer most of my personal files to an external hard drive, however, the only file remaining that I want to save I can't figure out how to access. I can't figure out how to get to my Chrome profile info in the
 hidden AppData folder. I always had my laptop set to show hidden folders, but I can't see any hidden folders using the Notepad method at the above link.
<strong>Is there any way to access the hidden AppData folder through command prompt so I can rescue my Chrome profile info??
</strong>If this turns into a worst case scenario and I have to do a re-installation, I would
<em>really, really, really</em> like to save my my Chrome bookmarks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried any of the other Advanced troubleshooting options yet out of worry I might end up accidentally messing something up. Even though I've managed to transfer most of my files, I would still like to avoid having to do a re-installation if at all
 possible. I did click on "Go back to previous version" but once again I was given 3 options ("Windows Rollback", "Windows 10 on volume 3", &amp; "Windows 10 on volume 3") and I'm really not sure which is the correct one to choose... This has been
<em>incredibly frustrating</em> to know that my files are all still there on the C: drive, but I just can't boot to the C: drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Unfortunately, you will have to perform a new install. This appears to be a serious bug many are encountering with the new version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<br />

<br />

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply. The havoc Microsoft has caused with this update is absolutely infuriating. I've finally been able to extract my Chrome AppData info using xcopy in the command prompt (I assume it will also be in the Windows.old folder after new
 installation, but I didn't want to risk it). So now that I have a backup of all my files, I'm ready for an installation.<br />
<br />
A few questions in regards to your instructions...<br />
<br />
<strong>Create a bootable copy:&nbsp;</strong>The only free storage I have right now is a 32GB micro SD card in a USB adapter (so it can plug into a USB port). I know the SD/USB is formatted as FAT32, like the instructions at the link,
<em>however</em>, the instructions also say if your computer is UEFI based there are extra preparations to be done for the ISO, but then the only things specifically mentioned are formatting for FAT32 or GPT. Is that the only preparations needed?? I think my
 computer is UEFI. On the Advanced Startup Options there is an option for "UEFI Firmware Settings", so that's why I'm thinking it's UEFI. Should I use the Rufus program suggested instead of the Microsoft .iso to USB/DVD tool because of that?? In my searches
 I've also seen many people refer to Microsoft's Media Creation Tool. I assume I could use that as well?<br />
<br />
<strong>Perform a custom install:</strong> So to boot from the SD/USB I'll need to go into either BIOS or UEFI settings to change what it boots to first? On the Advanced Startup Options &gt; Troubleshooting screen I chose "UEFI Firmware Settings" and my computer
 restarted to this screen:&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebef0ff2-b730-401b-bea9-daee7e6e3050?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebef0ff2-b730-401b-bea9-daee7e6e3050?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>Choosing "Boot Device Options" gives me this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87fd3128-261f-4dca-885c-118031992849?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/87fd3128-261f-4dca-885c-118031992849?upload=true" /></a><br />
Which doesn't seem useful?<br />
<br />
I tried choosing "BIOS Setup" and was able to find "UEFI Boot Order" with an option for "USB Diskette on Key/USB Hard Disk", so I assume that's the route I need to go.<br />
<br />
When doing the installation, based on the example pics at the instructions you linked, at some point I'll have to choose which partition to install Windows on. If there's more than one, how will I know which to pick? In the example pics in the instructions
 it's obvious because of the two partitions, one is labeled "Primary" as the Type, but if I get to this point and there are more than 2 options and it's not so obvious which to choose, will it be an issue if I pick the "wrong" partition??<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>Ok, and what about creating a bootable copy? I went ahead and downloaded Rufus. For the "Partition scheme and target system type" should I choose "MBR partition scheme for BIOS or UEFI" or the option that's just for UEFI ("MBR partition scheme for UEFI")?
 My laptop seems to have both UEFI and BIOS capabilities (see pictures in previous reply), so would it be best to use the&nbsp;"MBR partition scheme for BIOS or UEFI"?</p>

            UEFI is important if you have a drive thats larger than 2 TBs and you need to use the GPT partitioning scheme. Go with MBR.

    <title>Media Player MKV - No Fast Forward - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media Player MKV - No Fast Forward</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone.</p>

<p>I got MKV to work after I installed all the codecs necessary on my DLNA server. (My laptop)</p>

<p>However, with MKV support being added, how come you can't fast forward/rewind? And how come the video is 0 seconds long even though it's not? It shows up as 2:00:01 on VLC, Winamp, and Media Player Classic, but on the Xbox One it's always 0 seconds with
 the inability to pause, fast forward, or rewind.</p>

<p>Anyone have any insight as to why this is? This is the most bizarre thing ever, especially when you're watching something with family and a network error occurs. We'd rather not watch the whole thing from the beginning. I've also tried Serviio and no luck
 with that either. Any help is appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>Probably a content issue. &nbsp;I suspect that your MKV does not have a CUE section (the table-of-contents-like section of the MKV which allows a file-reader to know where to jump to in the file). &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can re-write your MKV file with a few different programs that will author the CUE section for you.</p>
<p>With FFmpeg, the command line is:</p>
<p>ffmpeg -i inputfile.mkv -c copy -map 0 outputfile.mkv</p>
<p>Where -c copy just copies the media in the tracks without re-encoding (which takes forever), and -map 0 (zero) ensures that all tracks are copied.</p>
<p>There is also MKV Tool Nix which has MKV Merge GUI, which is easy to use: drag, drop, click 'start muxing'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> System Restore will not revert any of your non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with this tool was to
 recover a deleted non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Run Online Scan.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A fast way to check for viruses is to use an online scanner, such as the Microsoft Safety Scanner. The scanner is a free online service that helps you identify and remove viruses, clean up your hard disk, and generally improve your computer's performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner webpage to download the scanner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b. Click <strong>Download Now</strong>, and then follow the instructions on the screen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><b>Important:</b> While performing scan on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>

<h2>            Connecting with DVI cable puts monitor in power saving mode</h2>
                    I recently got a new PC with an ATI Radeon HD 4350 graphics card running Windows 7.&nbsp; When I tried to use my existing monitor with the DVI input, it puts the monitor in sleep mode (or power saving mode).<br />
<br />
When I connect with a VGA cable it works fine.<br />
<br />
All drivers are current.&nbsp; I am at a loss as to what to do.&nbsp; The only discrepency I have found is that the monitor is expecting a 60 Hertz refresh rate and the video card is stuck on 59 Hertz.

Are you trying to burn to "dvd", so the burner/software is confused as you have inserted a cd?<br />

            Odd that you say 3 different pc's all suffer the same problem, which means what's changed has changed on all 3. Maybe this is something you can work out by a process of elimination?
<br />
Check http://myvideoproblems.com/Tutorials/EnableCdRecording.htm<br />
<br />
One thing might be an update to WMP, and this has got copy protection enabled, you may need to delve into the settings to allow the copying of protected work.<br />
<br />
Which version of WMP are you using?<br />
Can you burn other files using other software to cd's?<br />
<br />
I assume you have checked that the cd burners are indeed connected?<br />

            No guarantees, because I haven't tested it myself, but the following solution seems to have helped several people with the same error message (usually after upgrading to WMP 11):<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Open the Services applet (Start &gt; Run &gt; services.msc &gt; OK)</li><li>Scroll down to IMAPI CD-Burning COM Service</li><li>START the service</li><li>The "Startup type" (which you can set by double-clicking on the entry to open its "Properties") should be "Manual" -- although if this doesn't work, you can try setting it to "Automatic."</li></ul>
<br />
If the above doesn't help, there are some other suggestions here: <a href="http://club.myce.com/f3/wmp-11-connect-burner-restart-player-200198/#.UJu8uobn-iV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
For more assistance here, if necessary, please provide the following information<br />
What version of Windows are you using, including service pack (right click My Computer and select Properties for info)?<br />
What version of WMP are you using?<br />
Do you have another CD-burning application installed on your computers? If so, which one, including version?<br />
What happened to your computer(s) just before this issue started (e.g., did you just upgrade to WMP 11)?<br />

</p><p>All I'm doing is inserting a CD or 2 into my PC. Then, my intentions are to move the tunes I like best into a new playlist - then use that playlist to burn a blank CD so I'll have a new CD with just my favorites on it. But - the darn thing keeps saying "connect
 a burner". </p>

<p>
</p><p>A "burner" in this context means a CD drive that is capable of recording CDs as well as reading (playing) them.&nbsp; Were you able to record CDs previously?&nbsp; If so, are you using the same blank CDs as you used in the past (there are different types and not all

            <p>Hi Yogesh,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this link, that solved&nbsp;almost all of&nbsp;my problem mentioned on: </p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-desktop/cant-run-exe-or-exe-files-in-windows-81-single/82a7abc8-5d5d-4697-8dab-2f658d7ec530</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am mentioning this solution and link on the said&nbsp;post with your name, to help others with similar problem, please check it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the only problem that remains is my&nbsp;PC settings and Windows Store Apps are not working, because of which I am not able to activate Windows although its a genuine copy&nbsp;pre-installed&nbsp;in the laptop. Please let me know if you can help with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone else can help, it would be welcomed.</p>
<p>

</p><p>The details of my laptop's problem are mentioned on: </p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-performance/windows-81-pc-settings-not-working-or-popping-up/a5b2579d-ccda-4cce-8486-745294509f77</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Store Apps simply pop-up and then get minimised. I have run Windows Store Apps troubleshooter multiple times but the problem is still unresolved.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I am not able to activate my pre-installed genuine copy of Windows 8.1 Single Language with Bing, start bluetooth from my laptop, etc, and other problems.</p>

<h2>            Sign in approval from remote location</h2>
                    <p>Hello all...</p>
<p>
</p><p>We just got a second Xbox One because it seems like most popular games are one player and I have four kids who need to play! One player games drive a dad insane....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I had downloaded "Fortnite" for the new Xbox One and expected two kids could play at the same time. Well, the new Xbox needs my passkey to before it will load the game. I suspect this is because my gamertag is the only account with Xbox Live and
 my account resides on both Xboxs. I may have to purchase an Xbox live account for another of our family accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at work and can't enter my passkey into the new box. And, under no circumstances I can have my son get my passkey - Microsoft would be happy, but dad would be sad (and poor).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way I can remotely log into my new Xbox to approve my son to play his game? Or do I need to be on the same network (I am at work)?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, if this remote feature hasn't been implemented, please do it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for you input.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi JT,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Unfortunately, you would need to be at the console to sign in. Only reason you are needing to sign in is due to you have two Xbox consoles that the kids play on. One will need your account signed in for the kids to play on
 their account as the gold wont transfer for both consoles. Being you have 4 kids, you could purchase another Xbox live subscription for the kid account that is on the most and set the console that isn't your home console to that one. So the set up would be
 for example.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Xbox is your home console--all can play on this due to you have Xbox live and you don't need to be signed in.</p>
<p>The old console doesn't have home set to it so they need your account signed in to play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You purchase gold for oldest child and set old console as the oldest childs home. Now all can play on either console due to they both have gold. You would not need to sign in any longer on the old console.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>

    <title>Prevent Lock Screen Background from Automatically Changing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Prevent Lock Screen Background from Automatically Changing</h2>
                    <p>I have been experiencing a problem lately where my lock screen will automatically change the background to what I am assuming is the Bing image of the day. At least it did a while ago, now something keeps changing my lockscreen to a kind of broken-looking
 image of a stairwell. It no longer updates the image with something from the web. I have tried setting my own lock screen wallpaper and it holds for just a moment 5-10 minutes, then all of a sudden gets replaced by that broken-looking stairwell image again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I prevent it from automatically changing and just set a single image as the lockscreen wallpaper? Below are some pictures of what I am talking about. Thanks for any help you guys can provide. It's more annoying and not necessarily impacting anything
 else. Just not sure why it wont hold the wallpaper I am setting on it.</p>

            <p>I've had the same issue myself and solved it by changing the compatibility mode of the viewer program on the CD. Open File Explorer and click on the CD Drive. In the right pane, right click on viewer program and select properties. Click on the compatibility
 tab and set your version. As most hospitals and such are using Win 7 SP1, that would be my first choice.&nbsp; Good Luck</p>

</p><p>Regarding your concern, has your computer successfully boooted to Windows 10 before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the first time you're running Windows 10 on your machine, it will take time and will require multiple restarts for the upgrade to complete. Don't touch the computer when it's in the process of upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon.</p>
        </p>

            Do you have any USB devices especially hard drives or Bluetooth mice or keyboards connected? If so try removing them to see if boot continues.

<p>Unfortunately it is still the same problem after every&nbsp; bigger update (not if defender only).</p>
<p>Because Win10 is creating here so many problems I still work on Win7 on almost all PCs and started with Linux Mint also because of that trouble. Start and update my 2 Win10 PCs only all couple month. For business they are not usable this way.</p>
<p>From Win10 release on, I had problems with rebooting systems. I run Win10 on 2 PC for testing. Both show problems after rebooting. Have another look please:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One hangs always after updates in the reboot loop after a restart, like I describes it above. This one works with a Logitech wireless dongle for mouse and keyboard. It always hangs after reboot. removing the dongle makes win10 to run to the start screen
 but if I stick the dongle back, it does not work. So I always stuck here. Only connecting an wire mouse and keyboard makes it run again. This is the same problem with the new October update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second Win10&nbsp;PC also stucks after reboot sometimes (this has no wireless mouse/keyboard). Breaking up and reboot again and again&nbsp;makes it work finally (with error recovery).&nbsp;The whole procedure needs hours&nbsp;with a big update. :-( &nbsp;</p>
<p>But here I have another strange incident:</p>
<p>I use 2 HHD here. Both have 2 partitions. Please see</p>
<p>
</p><p>HDD1:</p>
<p>C:&nbsp; Win10 System</p>
<p>D: empty</p>
<p>
</p><p>HDD2:</p>
<p>E: empty</p>
<p>F: Win10 System Image (Backup)</p>
<p>
</p><p>All partition have a size of 116GB. On the empty D-drive Win10 is showing 6 GB in use and 110GB free. But there is nothing on the drive. Also test tools like WinDirStat show, there is nothing on the drive. But Win10 shows a usage of 6 GB.</p>
<p>If I format D-drive, it is empty afterwards.&nbsp;If I make another system backup with Win10 it is there again. Backups are stored on the F-drive (!).</p>
<p>This is a clean PC only with a new Win10 installation and all the Win10&nbsp;updates which came afterwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even using Win 3.0 or Win95 I did not have so many problems like with Win10 !!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-(((</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me here?</p>

<p>I did not try this. Uninstalling and reinstalling of all updates will probably need me several days.&nbsp; :-(&nbsp;The last update has needed over 3 hours to make the PC work again. I can't really see the advantage of trying this. If the update&nbsp;went throught all
 update problems and get controlled by a wire mouse/keyboard, it works with the cordless dongle like it should. It's only an update Problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Win10 is blocking Disk space on the second PC&nbsp;on drive E is absolutely not understandable.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t share printer in my office network on Windows 10 Enterprise &#40;1803&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I can't share printer in my office network. On printer properties shared option is enabled and network connection is private so printer sharing on this network is turned on but I can't find any printer in my list on other clients to add!

            Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Status
<br />Scroll to the bottom
<br />Click Network and Sharing Center
<br />
<br />Click Change advanced sharing settings
<br />Expand All Networks
<br />Under Password protected sharing
<br />
<br />Switch between 'Turn on password protected sharing and Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then choose 'Turn off password protected sharing' 
<br />
<br />Then click 'Save changes'
<br />
<br />Also:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: optionalfeatures.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to SMB 1.0/CIFS File Sharing Support
<br />Tick the SMB 1.0/CIFS Client
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Automatic Removal and
<br />Untick SMB 1.0/CIFS Server
<br />
<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />Restart if prompted. 
<br />
<br />Microsoft apparently has a workaround which does not require enabling SMBv1, for those who rely on the ability to 'browse' the network.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4034314/smbv1-is-not-installed-by-default-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403431...</a>
<br />
<br />Explorer Network Browsing
<br />
<br />The Computer Browser service relies on the SMBv1 protocol to populate the Windows Explorer Network node (also known as "Network Neighborhood"). This legacy protocol is long deprecated, doesn't route, and has limited security. Because the service cannot function without SMBv1, it is removed at the same time.
<br />
<br />However, if you still have to use the Explorer Network in home and small business workgroup environments to locate Windows-based computers, you can follow these steps on your Windows-based computers that no longer use SMBv1:
<br />Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start). When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />All Windows devices within that subnet that have these settings will now appear in Network for browsing. This uses the WS-DISCOVERY protocol. Contact your other vendors and manufacturers if their devices still don't appear in this browse list after the Windows devices appear. It is possible they have this protocol disabled or that they support only SMBv1.
<br />
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them toAutomatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X &gt; computer management--&gt;shared folders--&gt; choose the shared folder, right click it then click Properties &gt; Share Permissions --&gt;protection that everyone can read and execute, see folder contents and read permissions.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please read this if you found that program on your computer and don't know what you should do. I've been having troubles with my computer lately and I just found out this was using 25% of my **** CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some tech websites will tell you this program isn't malicious. Apparently they've never heard of POTENTIALLY UNWANTED PROGRAMS. Things that run in the background by itself that you didn't know installed itself?&nbsp; Some things that you must click "I accept
 to install this program" can also be considered PUGs in some shadier installation applications. To make a fitting folklore analogy, just because vampires can't enter your house without your permission, doesn't mean you knew they were vampires, nor does it
 make it your fault for them sucking your blood after you let them in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstalling this thing was a ****, I can't remove the folder (which is hidden 2 directories deep in appdata), if I select it in task manager, it starts moving up and down the task list every second like it's trying to avoid my mouse, and as soon as I forcefully
 shut it down, a new process opens immediately. Uninstalling it from the control panel took like 3-5 minutes from clicking "uninstall program" to the uninstall actually starting, the entire time nothing seemingly happening.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;As soon as I uninstalled it, my CPU usage went from 100% can't load a webpage to 15% running a big max graphics video game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the search results on google have unclear answers and tell you this program isn't malicious and I noticed that microsoft answers was top result with unclear answers. Hopefully,&nbsp; this is the topic people will see when they google Akami netsession_win.exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't need clowns to reply to this topic defending this program, this is for people who need a clear solution to their problems.</p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>Since yesterday, each time I tried to save my work done on Microsoft words on my university drive (novell filr), my windows immediately ends up with the blue screen with the message:</p>
<p>'system thread exception not handled (ntfs.sys)'</p>
<p>It then automatically reboots and sometimes ends up with the same blue screen recurringly or sometimes went to recovery option and once exit, continue to windows, it will function normally again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked my hardware, extended memory and they are all working normally.</p>
<p>All my drivers are updated including graphic cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have performed the system restore to 5 days ago and it is still the same.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the application filr&nbsp;(university apps which allows work to be done remotely) and it is still the same.</p>

Bug check description: This indicates that an exception happened while executing a routine that transitions from non-privileged code to privileged code.

The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect. Possibly this problem is caused by another driver on your system that cannot be identified at this time.</span></p>
