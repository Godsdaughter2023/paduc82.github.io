    <title>Back up time and date still not correct. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Back up time and date still not correct.</h2>
                    <p>Some time ago I asked a question relating to the date and time on Back up and Security and I am aware that I am not the only one experiencing this&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to the community I had some very interesting suggestions and tried every one of them but&nbsp; unfortunately none of them have resolved the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a live chat with a Microsoft operative who was also unable to sort out the problem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>So here I am today still trying to correct an issue that Microsoft should have no problem correcting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today is 07/06/2017 @ 10.07am and is displayed as such on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last back up is still showing as 08/05/2017 @ 7.23am even though I tried to back up again this morning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>I fail to understand why Microsoft is unable to provide a solution to this problem.&nbsp; I really wish I had never upgraded to Windows 10 which to me has been nothing but trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Hello <em>keepplugging</em>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are multiple factors to consider should encounter a freezing issue on Windows 7. I'll need more information to properly address your concern. Kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The hotfix link you provided shows that it is intended for <em><strong>Windows 7 Build 7600</strong></em>. Installing
<em>Service Pack 1 (SP1)</em> will upgrade your Windows 7 system to <strong>Build 7601</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to the freezing issue, I suggest performing a <strong>clean</strong>
<strong>boot</strong> in order to eliminate the possibility of a software conflict. A
<strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you use your Windows 7 PC. For the steps on how to perform a
<strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong>, please refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support
 article</a></strong>. Follow the steps under the section: <em>Windows 7 and Windows Vista</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no error messages, i.e. no popups.&nbsp; And I see no obvious error reports in Event Viewer., though there are numerous entries in Event Viewer that seem unrelated, e.g.<br />
<br />
Faulting application name: AUDIODG.EXE, version: 6.1.7601.23471, time stamp: 0x57601f74<br />
Faulting module name: VIASysFx.dll, version: 1.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x4eb38d17<br />
Exception code: 0xc0000005<br />
Fault offset: 0x0000000000060e62<br />
Faulting process id: 0x1d90<br />
Faulting application start time: 0x01d3d8d4642aa26d<br />
Faulting application path: C:\Windows\system32\AUDIODG.EXE<br />
Faulting module path: C:\Windows\system32\VIASysFx.dll<br />
Report Id: e6eec912-44c7-11e8-867c-14dda97b7653<br />
Event ID 1000<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Name resolution for the name cas.us.criteo.com timed out after none of the configured DNS servers responded<br />
Event ID 1014<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't found any useful troubleshooting steps.&nbsp; I've run deep virus scans with TotalAV, chkdsk on the system disk and on an external disk I use for data, and "sfc /scannow."&nbsp; No errors reported.<br />
<br />
The system doesn't actually freeze; rather, applications stall.&nbsp; The system responds to the mouse OK, but applications' response to a mouse click can take up to three minutes.<br />
<br />
I haven't yet tried a clean boot.&nbsp; (I've been gathering info, and the system stalls only once every day or two.)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, this question:<br />
When the system stalls, timeout errors show up in Event Viewer, e.g.<br />
TIMEOUT&lt;mcsacore.exe&gt; C:\ProgramData\McAfee\SiteAdvisor\saupkeep.dll\log.txt<br />
TIMEOUT&lt;explorer.exe&gt; C:\Windows\System32\DDORes.dll<br />
TIMEOUT&lt;ThunderbirdPor&gt; C:\Users\RJD\AppData\Local\Temp\nsrAF19.tmp\FindProcDLL.dll<br />
TIMEOUT&lt;saUpd.exe&gt; C:\Windows\System32\secur32.dll<br />
etc., etc.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to figure out what any of the timed-out processes are waiting for?<br />

    <title>Only account on the computer is not administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ragutom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Only account on the computer is not administrator</h2>
                    <p>I have seen some posts on this problem, but none touch on all of the issues or offer a viable solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here goes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer has a linked microsoft account (set up with an email address and password), which we will call "Tom" from this point on. This account AT ONE TIME WAS administrator with full control. It is now showing up as a guest. As of right now there is
 no available administrator account to be able to make changes, do elevated command prompts, etc. When a User Account Control box comes up, it says to log into an admin account, but doesn't list one, and the OK box is greyed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sounds easy??? WRONG... here comes the crazy parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am UNABLE to activate the built in admin account through this Tom account for the obvious reasons of not having admin rights for any UAC prompts or elevated command prompt. Registry states that this built in account is already on ("10" in the hex code)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooting into safe mode to get the admin account CAUSES THE TOM ACCOUNT TO DISAPPEAR PERMANENTLY!!!!</p>
<p>I can make changes during this time, but suddenly the Tom account no longer shows up as an account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon rebooting the computer into normal mode, the Tom account has now permanently disappeared and the "safemode" admin account is in its place as a brand new "Hi" account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I can create as many accounts as I want with ANY type, but I can never get windows to recognize the Tom account anymore. creating a new linked account with the same email address causes windows to state that an account on the computer already
 exists with this email address....but it is not listed ANYWHERE. &nbsp;The user files are still on the computer in the Users folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recover from this state, I can Restore the computer to a point 2 weeks ago, and my Tom account RETURNS, but unfortunately it is still guest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the account repair tool using the Tom account, but obviously it prompts a UAC and doesn't allow me to continue. &nbsp;I have not tried running that tool in safe mode or upon reboot with the admin account but the Tom account missing. But I feel that
 won't accomplish anything since Tom is no longer seen as an account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not my computer. The only way I noticed this issue was attempting to repair a webcam that is "stuck on"..... yes, this could be an indicator of a deeper problem, or suspected foul play. The webcam turns on as soon as windows loads....?!? Scary!!
 The owner had a friend "IT professional" work on this computer before these issues arose and I dont want to jump to conclusions about crippling the computer and spying through the webcam (which is now covered with tape)....although it is really coincidental.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of right now, re-installing windows is a last ditch solution. I will not take the easy way out without first bouncing around some ideas. &nbsp;I am EXTREMELY computer proficient and have tried most of the normal solutions (net user /add, administrator enable
 through command prompt, safe mode, Users control panel is unusable due to UAC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me nuts....I can't wait to see some great ideas!</p>
<p>

            <p>I can't imagine how it would disappear.&nbsp; Hopefully all your files are still safe under
<em>C:\Users\Tom</em> (or whatever).</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few different things can happen depending on if the account existed locally before getting joined (which in my own opinion is a more reliable way to go).&nbsp; For example my username home folder is shawn_000 because it uses digits if you first make an MS account.&nbsp;
 But that doesn't happen if the account was local first and then just got "connected" to MS account later.&nbsp; But then you also have some weird things where you have both a local and an online account if you were to go explore under the MMC console of actual
 users on the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly what would probably be the best is to get into the built-in <em>administrator</em> account and create a new local account, with admin rights, that you can use without being in safe mode. Basically just one to yourself.&nbsp; On my system, that's my only
 account. I just rely on UAC instead of actually using a limited account because honestly, does anyone truly run under a limited account every day and not go insane?</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I digress.&nbsp; Just got your new account setup as a local account.&nbsp; Boot up and login, get it all configured and drag your files over.&nbsp; Then later if you want to you can connect it to MS.</p>

<h2>            Mic not working - Can hear people but they can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t hear me</h2>
                    
<p>For many months now I have not been able to use a mic with my Xbox One. I can hear people in game/party chat but they cannot hear me. I have tried multiple controllers and headsets including a brand new Lunar White controller as well as brand new Xbox One
 headsets and regular Apple headphones with mic (to no avail). I have tried all troubleshooting options, including: factory reset on my Xbox, unplugging / reconnecting the headsets, checking parental settings, made sure I have an open NAT type, updated the
 controllers (with and without the headset plugged in), signing in and out of my account, assigning the controller/headset to my profile, power cycling my Xbox, resetting the controllers themselves, and more. When I try a test call on Skype I am still not able
 to hear myself. This is extremely frustrating as nothing I have found on online seems to help, and I should not be expected to buy ANOTHER headset or ANOTHER controller. I currently have 2 Xbox One headsets and 3 Xbox One controllers. If this is not fixed
 soon (this week) I will promptly be switching to PS4. Microsoft needs to get it together.</p>

<p>Update 1: After spending a couple hours talking to MS support and running through all the usual troubleshooting options my problem still persists. Additionally I have cleared my alternate MAC address and that did not work either.
</p>
<p>Update 2: I have tried using my Xbox at a friend's house using a different internet connection and this did not work either.</p>

<p>Did you try using your headset on your friend's xbox (I guess I am assuming they have an xbox)? If you can go to someone's house who already has an xbox and especially if they use a headset that works, if it does not work there, problem is limited to something
 with the headset or how it is connecting to the console.</p>

<p>this was happening to me but after buying a different controller it stopped at least for about a month or two this is the third controller that broke for no reason and all of the headsets that I tried work including my brand new turtle beach so it is definitely
 not the headsets and I've been through all the steps to fix it but nothing works. the problem is either the controllers or my xbox itself

<h2>            XBOX - Black Ops 1 on Xbox One S Rendering issues&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking for some help and cant seem to find anyone else having the same issue, I am playing BO1 on an Xbox one with it being backwards compatible however all of the DLC maps on Zombies are not rendering correctly with large parts of the map in some cases
 just being black making it pretty difficult to play. All of the 'on disc' maps are fine and I have already tried to uninstall the maps and re-install but had no luck with them. On some maps like shi-no numa it is minimal in terms of how much of the map is
 not rending correctly however Moon is virtually unplayable due to the majority of the map just being black. I have added a pic to better explain the issue I am having, any help would be fantastic!&nbsp;<br />

            Thanks for the reply, thats right only the zombies DLC maps, all online multiplayer maps are as they should be however the zombies ones are like this in parts, I dont have another xbox one to try these on however? I can see someone below has suggested
 to uninstall the whole game and re-install then clear cache so may give that a try however Im not sure if it will make a difference only being the DLC packs I am having an issue with having already done that,&nbsp;

<h2>            computer saying printer paper out and wont print from computer only from printer HP300 series,</h2>
                    Printing photos 2 days ago and stopped a job by hitting the cancel button on printer. When tried to print again it wouldn't print. Cancelled all in que but it says there is no paper in printer. Have removed and replaced paper, have removed and replace
 more paper, then less paper. Have turned off both computer and printer and restarted. Nothing is working, I am not a computer savvy person but I have some knowledge.<br />
The printer will work printing directly from itself but not thru computer.<br />

<h3> vaibhavmadan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating bootable DVD of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I want to create a bootable DVD of Windows 10,so that I can directly install Windows 10 from that DVD, whenever I want to. So, which type of DVD should I use? What I mean by this is that should I use DVD-R or DVD+R. Or should I use DVD+RW or DVD-RW. Also,
 how can I make that DVD bootable? Also, should I directly put the ISO or extract its files and put them there?</p>

            Hi VaibhavMadam
<br />
<br />Yes, that Installation Media will fit onto a Dual-Layer DVD, you need to burn the ISO image onto that DVD, in order to create the boot sector
<br />
<br />If you have DVD burning software, that will burn a bootable DVD form the ISO file, otherwise click this link to download a tool from Microsoft which you can use to create the bootable installation media from that ISO - tool works for Windows 7, 8 and 10

            Let see...&nbsp; what do we know about your system environment:<br />
<br />
It is windows xp.<br />
<br />
If we knew more, you would probably be done by now!<br />
<br />
What is the issue you are having that you thing System Restore will remedy?&nbsp; System Restore is not a time machine.<br />
<br />
Has System Restore ever worked successfully in the past?<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers, for making the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible by not prompting for any system information when a new question is asked.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />
<br />
<div>Some Anti Virus tools will "protect" your system so much that they will not allow a System Restore to work properly. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>For example, if you are running any Norton/Symantec products, you may see a message like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Restoration Incomplete. Your computer cannot be restored...</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is such a popular Symantec problem (well, I'll be polite and call it an "undocumented feature"...), they wrote an article about it:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service1.symantec.com/support/sharedtech.nsf/pfdocs/2005113009323013</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Depending on what you are using for malware protection, you may have to disable the product(s) temporarily, do the System Restore and then&nbsp;turn the products back on again when the System Restore is complete.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes you will need to boot your system in Safe Mode and while your protection programs are not running, then do the System Restore. &nbsp;Microsoft hints in some of their articles that if System Restore fails to restore your computer, boot into Safe Mode
 and then execute the&nbsp;System Restore. &nbsp;That works for some configurations.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes System Restore is so afflicted or the Restore Points are suspicious, the best option is to just reinstall your System Restore. &nbsp;Doing so will delete any old Restore Points, but sometimes this is the only way to fix a broken System Restore. &nbsp;You
 don't have to reinstall XP, just the&nbsp;System&nbsp;Restore part.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That may leave you with your original unspecified problem that you hope System Restore will correct (using a System Restore is usually not equivalent to fixing the problem though).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Give those ideas some consideration if they apply to you. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes malicious software will afflict your System Restore to prevent you from finding and removing the malicious software. &nbsp;It would much rather fool you into thinking that you have to repair or reinstall your XP when that is not necessary.</div>
<div><br />
<div>No matter what you are using for malware protection, I would do this and only then begin to troubleshoot any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs then resolve any remaining issues:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></div>
<div>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>These can be uninstalled later if desired.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the scans run clean, reboot, test and we can fix any other issues.</div>
<div><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Since you have reported that KB2586448, KB2567053, KB2570947, KB2616676, KB2567680, &amp; KB971029 are NOT installed and since this seems to have happened out of the blue, I'd say there's a 99% chance your PC has become compromised by malware. Running Webroot
 is all well and good, but it is not a 100% guarantee you won't get malware. Even if you never visit "shady" websites, you're always at risk if you're online, especially if any of the following are true:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Windows does not have every single high-priority and/or critical security update installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- you are not running the latest version of plugins, such as Adobe Reader, Adobe Flash, and Java</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- the XP account you use online is an admin account instead of a regular user account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- you use a browser that is not secure</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the last point, you might want to look into using Chrome:</p>

<p>Hi. I want to connect my Xbox to my Direct TV box but the Direct TV box does not have an HDMI port all it has is AV plugs. Does anyone know of a cable or converter that will allow me to connect my Direct TV service to my Xbox one. Thank you&nbsp;</p>

<p>No you have to hook through with an HDMI cable. &nbsp;My suggestion to you would be to definitely call DirecTV and tell them to update your equipment, as it sounds like it has not been updated in quite a long time. &nbsp;I have had directv for 5 years and have never
 had a box that had AV plugs.</p>

<p>I'm surprised I missed this piece of news.&nbsp; Black Isle Studios, the developers of the original
<em>Fallout </em>titles and several D&amp;D video game classics, is <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-08-22-interplay-appears-to-be-resurrecting-black-isle-studios" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
apparently being resurrected</a>.&nbsp; And just when I thought Interplay was finally done for after losing that lawsuit over the
<em>Fallout </em>MMO to Bethesda.&nbsp; Granted, it'll have almost none of the same employees, but still, wow.&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>

    <title>Xbox has lost it&#38;&#35;39&#59;s way. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox has lost it&#38;&#35;39&#59;s way.</h2>
                    
<p>Reference # <strong>[Mod Removed - please no personal info]</strong></p>
<p>As a PlayStation 1 and 2 owner I was apprehensive when I first purchased an Xbox 360 way back in 2005. However since that date I have never looked back I remain impressed and captivated by Microsoft’s take on the gaming console and I’m very happy I made
 the switch to this day. Perhaps the biggest reason that I and many others are able to say this is because of the amazing and sincere customer care Microsoft provided when many of us experienced the dreaded red rings of death. If Microsoft hadn’t acted swiftly,
 given bonuses like free months of live, gift cards even free controllers and games, how many of us would be currently playing a PS4? I am writing this today because, despite knowing that at launch consoles may suffer from bugs and issues, I was confident that
 I was putting my money in to a company that cared about it’s customers and had a great customer support team to show for it, when I preordered the $500 Xbox One when it was first announced. All but a couple of the launch games available to play on my new console.
 Unfortunately the console I received was defective and ruined all of my games. Far more unfortunately then that, a month after contacting Xbox support my problem remains unresolved. When I first called about the issue I was given what they term as an advance
 exchange where they send you a replacement console before even received the defective one. A brilliant move that the three red rings issue probably influenced. They also gave me a free game download to play while I waited for my new console, justified I felt
 in putting my money into Xbox once again. However upon receiving the new Xbox I discovered that the launch games I purchased no longer worked in any Xbox One console. Undeterred I called Xbox and told them the issue. A month later I still have not been given
 a resolution, but instead a run around of poorly thought out and insufficient solutions including “Contact the game retailer or publisher and ask that they replace the disc which will cost you a $20 fee.” Despite the fact that their defective console caused
 the issue, how is this considered customer service? Sending me off to another company to solve my problem? I did not know this to be the Microsoft way. I even humored the idea by calling them, to which 2K, EA, Best Buy and Amazon all replied in one way or
 another “You should contact Xbox given the fact that it was their defective console to blame.” Obviously this answer was a given and a poorly thought out resolution, but most importantly highlights the main issue that no one I’ve spoken to at Xbox is stepping
 up to take responsibility of the problem and reach a hand out to me, the customer, for resolution. I requested to get a call back from the Advance care team. I received a generic e-mail not even describing my issue. I called and again requested a phone call
 to get on the same page, and again was given a generic e-mail that not only wouldn’t solve my issue but told me that there was nothing they could do to solve my issue, that the only way my discs could’ve scratched would be if I moved the console while playing
 them. So I moved the console while playing EACH of my games…? And that’s it. That was the solution they provided and closed my case. Apparently Microsoft has forgotten how they got here and who got them here. I am sending this letter to them, as well as posting
 on my blog and channel, in a last attempt at a resolution before I request a full refund on my console and games and wash my hands of Microsoft as they have done to me, a loyal customer who has spent thousands of dollars on their product since 2005. Hopefully
 I can get a resolution and/or change to a policy that involves customer service supervisors telling customers “I’m sorry there’s nothing I can do.”, and replaces it with the way it used to be “What can I do for you?”</p>

<p>Like I have posted elsewhere, I would swear that all the people who use to work for Microsoft and were a pleasure to deal with were all fired and replaced by temps that don't know squat. My recent chat with support left me staring at the monitor, wondering
 if I accidently opened a chat with a completely different company. I am having a problem with surround sound through the hdmi connection, while playing games, blurays, and streaming video on Netflix. The support person pointed me to a link about using the
 surround sound beta option while watching tv. I was then told to power cycle my system 3 times and unplug everything. I did this, turned around to continue the chat on my computer, and the chat had been ended. Nice huh? The person I spoke to didn't have much
 knowledge at all, and then disappeared.</p>

<p>I've tried. Not to be a jerk, but have you ever talked with some of these people? Half the time they don't even know what you are talking about. Example: I was trying to explain to a support specialist that when using hdmi surround sound, the sound was not
 coming through the proper speakers (the sound was not being steered to the correct speaker). Instead of the sound being divided properly in the 5.1 speaker setup, it was all over the place, and playing through the wrong speakers. I thought it was obvious what
 I was saying, until the support person said 'I am confused. Is the sound coming through speakers on a different surround sound system?' I wish someone took a picture of the look that was on my face, because it had to have been classic. My 10 year old grandson
 would have understood what I was talking about! I was then told "let's do the unplugging. Please power cycle your system 3 times". So I said "which am I suppose to do first, unplug or power cycle?" I got "yes sir, let's do the unplugging". I asked "okay, and
 then you want me to power cycle 3 times?" The person then said "how about this. Let's shut down and unplug everything, and wait a minute". I said okay, and proceeded to do so. I turned back to my computer to tell them I did, and ask what was next, and they
 had ended the chat. I would like to say this is an isolated incident, but trust me, this is right on par with some of the other conversations I have had with Microsoft xbox support people.</p>
<p>If I thought it would do any good, I would be writing to support and calling them everyday. But aside from thanking me for giving them the opportunity to help me, nothing ever happens. They will not give any info, do not know any info, and have no idea how
 to fix anything, have terrible grammar, etc. I mean my grammar skills aren't perfect, or even that good, but I feel like an English major when compared to some of these support people. At least this has been my experience with them.</p>

<p>I have spoken with them and they've solved my issues without a hiccup. Keep trying thats really all i can say, as for future reference do troubleshooting over the phone. Support agents are human they do mess up but that doesn't mean they get crucified.</p>

<p>Nj, I will do troubleshooting whichever way I find convenient at the time. But thanks for your suggestion. ;) If they are competent support, they should be able to handle the situation either way. And I HAVE used phone support in the past for a different
 issue, and trust me, it was no better. I could write you a long book about some of those calls, but it's pointless.
</p>
<p>If they don't want to get "crucified", they should maybe acquire a level of expertise that is a bit beyond what I just listed. Just because NJDevils from the forum (who happens to be an ambassador, there's a surprise) says they did him right doesn't change
 my experience with them. I am not going to keep spinning the wheel, hoping I get the same person you got.

<p>Reference # <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>
<p>My latest unreplied to response.</p>
<p>Below are the discs damaged by the original defective Xbox One I purchased that are being refused to be replaced.</p>
<p>NBA 2K14: $60</p>
<p>MADDEN NFL 25: $60</p>
<p>BATTLEFIELD 4: $60</p>
<p>FIFA 14: $60</p>
<p>CALL OF DUTY GHOSTS: $60</p>
<p>FORZA 5: $60</p>
<p>ASSASSINS CREED 4 BLACK FLAG: $60</p>
<p>TOTAL: $420</p>
<p>Xbox One: $500 Two plug and play kits: $50 Additional controller: $60</p>
<p>That's over a thousand dollar investment in your product. Not to mention my paid Xbox Live membership since November of 2005 (not all on my current gamertag) and it's active through 2015!</p>
<p>And just tonight one of the two plug and play kits I purchased at launch has failed the battery and charger are not taking a charge and die instantly when I unplug and every 10 minutes or so while still plugged ( I know that both are defective by mixing
 it with the other working plug and play kit and using process of elimination).</p>
<p>I need to have this issue escalated above so that I may challenge this policy in place. I am out $420 for the past month and can't even get a phone call to say this is unacceptable is under statement. I will continue to write the corporate office and update
 my followers on social media in an effort to bring about a change to this policy and shed light on what's happening so that hopefully no one else will have to go through not only broken discs but being treated as disposable quite frankly. I will continue to
 fill out surveys voicing my dissatisfaction and filing complaints until I am given a response from someone higher than you and if I am not to be allotted such attention as this I request an immediate refund of all hardware mentioned herein. I will ship everything
 in one box to the return address I used before. Please let me know the next course of action.</p>
<p>Hoping for better,</p>
<p>A disappointed long time customer</p>

<p>For MS to offer ONE game as compensation is still something to be pleased about. Yes, your situation is very unfortunate but they have no legal obligation to even offer you ONE game. Never mind seven.</p>
<p>Also, you must have known the console was defective when it ruined one of your games, yet it seems you must have been continuously trying your other games afterwards? That is probably how Microsoft will see it. I'm by no means sticking up for MS customer
 support though. Apart from a select few people they are generally below par. Sometimes one or two of them go the extra mile to try and help you, but otherwise they follow a script and are told to deal with all issues by the book.</p>
<p>Hope you have better luck in the future.</p>

<p>They were asking me over the phone to try different games and blu rays and scratches aren't very easy to see so we just thought the console wasn't working it wasn't until I tried them in the new console that we realized the discs were now defective</p>

<p>I've also had many problems with my console and numerous controllers. Not to mention that I've had to pay to send back faulty accessories to a different country! Their service on 360 was amazing. It's non existent on Xbone. &nbsp;I've decided that I'm only keeping
 my Xbone for Titanfall and exclusives. PS4 has already won the console war IMO.</p>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Jumps Up &#47; Down Issue</h2>
                    
<p>I use Windows Explorer (Windows 7 Ultimate 64 Bit)&nbsp;a LOT&nbsp;(To find specific Folders, Files, Etc.) !!! However there appears to be several issues.</p>
<p>1st- It jumps back up to the top of the listing &amp; I have to scroll back down ever single time. Major Pain!</p>
<p>2nd- Even if I pick the Folder first, then the Expand Arrow, It scroll down, now I have to scroll it up to get to the sub Folder / Files - More Pain !!</p>
<p>3rd- Previous versions of Windows allowed me to set where I wanted Windows Explorer to allways open up at (i.e. - C:/ or some other location). I cannot find a way to do this now with Window 7. I can not even "PIN" to C:/ to use that method.</p>
<p>Any help, suggestions or fixes (best option) will be very, very , very welcomed.</p>

This shows one way to reproduce it, clicking the triangle to expand a folder you're currently viewing also reproduces it.

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</blockquote>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Number 1 and 2 are known issues that have no definitive fix, yet.</p>
<p>Number 3 is the same as it's always been in Windows. You can simply right click the Windows Explorer shortcut that you use and select Properties.</p>
<p>In the Target Box, enter the path where you want WE to open.</p>
<p>For example:&nbsp;</p>
<p>%windir%\explorer.exe /e,</p>
<p>Will open to Computer, showing all drives.</p>
<p>%windir%\explorer.exe C:</p>
<p>Will open with the C: Drive expanded.</p>
<p>%windir%\explorer.exe C:\Users\your name\Documents</p>
<p>Will open WE with your My Documents folder selected.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

<p>Hi Matthias,</p>
<p>I understand that you want to restrict the contact quantity in the contact list of SFB(Skype for Business), it’s not feasible to do that in SFB. There is only an upper limit in SFB contact list, which is 250 contacts.</p>
<p>Given the situation, we’d like to invite you to share your idea with our relevant team via:</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
</span><span>Alexisbonneau</span><span>,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Where have you saved the media files that you have downloaded?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check the file attributes for the files that you have downloaded if they are set to ‘Read only’. To check that</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Right click on the file</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>In the Attribute section check if it is check marked against ‘Read Only’. If yes uncheck it and see if you are able to make changes to the files.</span></span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try saving those files in the Music\video Libraries after you have made the changes to them. Now check if the changes that you have made have stayed
 or not.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Once you have changed the file information you might need to apply the changes while you are in Windows Media Player, to do that follow the steps
 given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Windows Media Player.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Make changes as per your choice</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Select Organize and click on ‘Apply media information changes’
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now check if that retains the changes that you have made after reopening Windows Media Player 12.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            How do you activate a 2nd Disc Drive in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have installed a second SATA3 2TB disc in my HP Envy 700-060ea desktop PC.</p>
<p>Device manager recognises its presence but doesn't seem to offer a format option so the drive doesn't appear in File Explorer, so effectively unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I need to do to get the drive recognised?</p>

<p>Managed to work it out myself. Just wasn't trying hard enough.</p>
<p>Right clicked on new disc and it gives you the format option.</p>
<p>So all working now. thanks for the reply.</p>
