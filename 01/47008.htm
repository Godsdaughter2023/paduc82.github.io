<h2>            Skype for Mac&#58; how to change &#47; add a phone number for a contact</h2>
                    I tried control-command on the contact's name &gt; view profile, then clicked on the pencil to edit, but it won't allow me to change the number, nor to add the number.

<p>Sorry, my post got buried, and I didn't see your reply. I have since reposted my question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version: Skype for Mac 8.12.0.14</p>
<p>
</p><p>Want to add a number to an existing contact. Would also like to be able to edit a number to an existing contact. I'm able to do it in Outlook, but the change is not reflected in Skype. There's no option in the contact's profile to add or change a number.
 In the Windows version there is an option to add a number, but not in the Mac version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried editing the contact's profile in Outlook, and was able to save it. This was for a Skype contact in Outlook. However, even after I signed out from Skype and signed back in, the change did not appear in my Skype contact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears to be an oversight. Please fix. Or else explain how to do it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>To add a phone number and save as a contact on the New Skype application, you need to dial and call the number first. Then, press CTRL/CMD&nbsp;on your keyboard, click on the number &gt; View Profile &gt; Add contact.</p>

<p>That's not the question being asked. The question being asked, which is also my question, is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to add/edit a phone number associated with an existing skype contact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example:<br />
<br />
I have Bob as a contact in skype, using his skype ID. I also want to be able to call Bob on his cell phone. In the past, you could add his cell phone number to his profile, and make outbound calls using skype-out credit/subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can no longer find ANY way to add these numbers to contacts in skype.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The options at the time differ in the New Skype from the classic Skype. You can call the contact phone if they added it in their profile themselves, but you can't edit or add phone numbers to the contacts at the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
You can quickly search for recent calls or contacts in the Call menu as well. <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34773/common-questions-with-skype-on-desktop-mac-and-linux?q=contact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Please have a look at this FAQ</a> about the new interface.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This seems to be a problem only in the latest version of Skype for Mac, not in the Windows version.</p>

<p>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/6a775e1e-faba-4875-8572-8b526a35c027" title="chankirtan">
chankirtan</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the expectation that contacts would synchronize across all Microsoft products and services, however there are potential benefits as well as considerations to the concept.&nbsp; I've read a handful of other posts with the same or similar requests!</p>
<p>
</p><p>While we were able to add phone numbers to a Skype contact's profile on our own contact list in Skype Classic and previous versions, the contact never saw those additions on their side. Likewise, only the contact themselves could
 edit the phone numbers they added to their own profile; we were never able to do this as the Skype contacts list did not - and still do not - work like a local address book. (Personal note, here: If you Mac users were able to edit Skype contact phone numbers
 in older versions, I certainly can understand why this feature is missed. We on the Windows side were never able to edit our Skype contacts' phone numbers, update email addresses, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The New Skype applications are yet a work in progress. As of now, we cannot add phone numbers to a contact's profile on our own contact list - as Jannine and Carola noted, above, we need to call that number first, and then that contact will appear in the
 Calls list, where we can edit the phone number and type a name for that phone number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although we can synchronize our address book in the New Skype on Mobile application, this is not available for the New Skype desktop version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do send feedback to Skype either within the app (Application Settings -&gt; Help and Feedback) or from the
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">skype.com Help page</a> -&gt; Send Feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>

Dear Concern,</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
I am using EasyNote TJ65.. Due to some project work i had to install Linux in my laptop (Fedora 12). I use Computer Management &gt; Shrink Volume from windows 7 to partition the drive. I created one more partition for installing linux. But after finishing fedora
 installation it reboot my laptop and come up with choice menu. When i choose "Other" it directly goes to the Packard Bell Recovery Management. I have burnt the recovery CD earlier. Than i use those CDs to recover windows. But after finishing windows installation
 it reboot and choice menu come in front. But again when i choose other it again goes to recovery management. Notice that fedora is working fine. But i don't want fedora any more and i want my genuine windows 7 back.</div>
<div>
<br />

<div>
It will be great if you help me in this regards.</div>

            Not <em>quite</em> sure why you would have chosen Fedora 12 over something like Ubuntu, but anyway.<br />
The FIRST thing to do is to save ALL your data from the Windows partition (if there is any) to external media. (Don't forget your Favorites - many people do!)<br />
<br />
Having done that, just restore your computer to it's factory settings as per the instructions that came with the computer...

    <title>Skype for business meeting recording not enabled - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> conrad braam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype for business meeting recording not enabled</h2>
                    <p>I want to record a meeting (actually want to record my screen , and SFB is probably the simplest way to do that,) so I contact my IT organization yesterday, and have them enable me to make recordings. So today I expect the group policy will apply to my machine
 when I switch it on, its not letting me record, so I reboot again at lunchtime, same thing, no new menu options.</p>
<p>1. Is it possible to make it easier for users to figure out the cause of the menus looking different to how they should ?&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/record-and-play-back-a-skype-for-business-meeting-6d1dd3c5-ded7-4935-8db0-d6d7173c482f&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Why can I see meeting recording manager, and have the manager app installed when I'm not enabled to record, and the manager app not make this clear to me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll wait a day for the GPO policy application process , I now hope GPO is not the cause though.</p>

<p><span>Hi Conrad,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am glad to help you for your questions here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For your first question, the start recording option in the list should be as the picture mentioned in the article you shared above. If you cannot see the option in the setting list, please share a full screenshot about your
 current option list to me here, and I will help you to do some more research, thanks.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>And for your second question, as you can see the recording manager, and you cannot view the option “ start recording”. In this scenario, I’d like to share with you that, the option “manage recording” is used to check the
 records you have in your computer( they are stored before, may be it is empty). And the start recording option is not available when you just send IM to others, you can try to use the skype call or video call with other contacts to check if you could see it
 in the option list just as the picture in the article you shared, thank.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you still cannot see the option when you use audio call or video calls, please take a full screenshot about your current option list in the skype for business, and provide the version of your skype for business client
 to me for further investigation, thanks. By the way, if convenient, pleas share with us how your IT to help you enable the GPO policy to enable the recording feature for you, thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>
<p><span>Oliver</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Calculator no longer working</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently I reinstalled windows to clean up my PC. After reinstalling my windows calculator will not work no matter what I do. The calculator looks like it tries to open, but it just disappears. I've&nbsp;tried almost everything I know or can find on the internet.
 Also, I'd like to refrain from reinstalling windows considering I just did that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stuff I've&nbsp;tried:</p>
<p>sfc&nbsp;scannow</p>
<p>resetting the calculator</p>
<p>downloading other apps (most won't&nbsp;open just like the windows calculator)</p>
<p>I also tried some PowerShell stuff that I found online, without success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Misc information:</p>
<p>Windows 10 Professional 64 bit</p>
<p>Dell Inspiron 5767</p>
<p>I am on a domain, but I'm&nbsp;pretty sure that's&nbsp;not the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also contacted Dell because I still had an active warranty, they told me to contact Microsoft, who wanted 500$ to solve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate any support.</p>

<br />
<br />Sure you do not have to pay 500 $ to solve it.
<br />
<br />What is your antivirus ?
<br />What is your exact version of Windows 10 (winver command) ?
<br />
<br />Reset Calculator
<br />Clic on Start button &gt; Settings
<br />&gt; Applications &gt; Apps and features
<br />&gt; Calculator &gt; Advanced options &gt; Reset.
<br />
<br />Keep me informed.

<br />You antivirus could be responsable.
<br />You should unistall it completely for a while and execute the repairs once again.

            Hello Paul,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Calculator app. Perform these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.WindowsCalculator | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check Calculator app, it should work fine now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!       
        </p>

<h2>            Wheel stands</h2>
                    
<p>I'm planning to buy a wheel stand and was wondering if anyone on here owns one or has tried some of them and has anything good or bad to say about them.&nbsp; I've narrowed down my choices to these ones:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.xwstands.com/page6.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XL20 Xlerator wheel stand</a>.&nbsp; This seems to have the advantage of being especially suited to playing from a couch or easy chair, because it allows you to sit all the way back
 and still have the wheel within easy reach.&nbsp; Also since the steering wheel column isn't between your legs, it might be easier to reach all the pedals with either foot, allowing heel-toe shifting and left foot braking more easily.&nbsp; The main disadvantage I see
 is it won't work well with a normal dining room type chair. </li><li><a href="http://www.wheelstandpro.com/products/stand-for-porsche-gt3rs-csp-and-logitech-g25g27-racing-wheels---deluxe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Wheel Stand Pro</a>.&nbsp; Seems sturdy, the steering wheel column can adjust to different angles other than 90 degrees,
 works with any chair or couch.&nbsp; The main disadvantage I can see is that on a couch or easy chair, you may not be able to lean back and still have the wheel close enough to be comfortable, so you're forced to either sit forward, or have your arms extended whay
 out to reach the wheel.&nbsp; Another potential disadantage is having the column between your legs, which might interfere with some ways of using the pedals.
</li><li><a href="http://www.fanatec.de/html/index.php?id=220&amp;lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Rennsport Wheel Stand</a>.&nbsp; Seems mostly similar to the Wheel Stand Pro, except as far as I can tell the steering column can't be adjusted to angles other than 90
 degrees. </li></ol>
<p>If you've used one of these, can you please&nbsp;comment&nbsp;whether the advantages and disadvantages I mentioned for them are true?&nbsp; Since I haven't seen any of these in person I'm just guessing based on the photos and product descriptions.&nbsp; Thanks for any help
 you can give me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have the Rennesport and I think its a good quality build stand. &nbsp;All of them are good quality... If you are looking for an advantage between the 3. Keep looking!!! B/c there not. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my rig...it's a GT2 with the Rennsport Wheel Stand and Clubsport pedals:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi150.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fs81%2fTrippulG3%2fmy_racing_rig1.jpg" /></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The upright column doesn't <strong>have</strong> to be 90 degrees vertical, but the way it's built, I think it probably shouldn't stray too far from that due to weight distribution.&nbsp; Honestly, I've never had a problem with being able to reach the wheel,
 and as you can see I don't have a special racing chair or anything.&nbsp; I just put a pillow behind me on the couch, and I'm perfectly comfortable.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I've never had a problem with the bar between my legs either...the pedals are out far enough away from it so that you have a pretty full range of motion to do whatever you would do in an actual car.&nbsp; I can left-foot brake or heel/toe no problem.&nbsp; Ok, actually
 I can't really heel/toe very well, but that's just because I suck at it...it has nothing to do with limitations of the stand...lol.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Really, the only slight issue I have with the stand is that the upright doesn't lock into position once you get it situated how you want.&nbsp; It's held in place by tightening a large black knob (which you can kind of see in the above picture, just to the right
 of the upright bar)...this creates tension, which is generally enough to hold things in place, but there are no pre-drilled holes or notches for it to sit in, so with some spirited driving, it IS possible for the upright to work its way loose (I've had a friend
 over, and the upright actually collapsed and fell forward toward his feet.)&nbsp; As long as you're reasonably gentle with it though and aren't yanking on it like a lumberjack (my friend's a pretty big guy who doesn't realize his own strength sometimes), it should
 work fine for you.</p>

<p>I built one years ago out of a couple dollars of scrap wood and a couple of simpson A34(L-shaped metal braces). I have thought about upgrading to a stand like one of these but can't see spending over a hundred bucks to replace something that works good and
 cost me about $2 to make.... </p>

<p>Thanks for your replies, and special thanks to Trippul G for the detailed response and photo!&nbsp; I can see from your photo that I think I'd be fine with the Rennsport or Wheel Stand Pro as long as I had a cushion behind me, and I like the fact that unlike
 the Xlerator stand, these stands can be used with a regular dining or desk chair also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Al jonesen, I thought of making a stand also.&nbsp; I'm sure I could throw something together quickly and cheaply out of wood.&nbsp; The thing I like about the stands I listed though is that they're pretty adjustable, and they fold up compactly enough to fit in a
 closet or corner.&nbsp; If I were to make one that was adjustable and foldable while still being stable enough, it seems like it would be enough extra work that the ready-made ones no longer seem so expensive.</p>

<p>Sure, no problem. &nbsp;I was thinking about the Xlerator one, but I think the biggest drawback with that is the fact that the upper portion where the wheel attaches, rests on whatever surface you're sitting on. &nbsp;So for me it'd be sitting on a soft sofa...I can't
 imagine that would be very stable.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Between the Wheel Stand Pro and the RennSport, I've heard good things about the former, but have no personal experience with it. &nbsp;For me, it came down to the simple fact that the RennSport was a little bit cheaper, and seemed to offer similar quality.</p>

<p>I have the wheel stand pro and I cannot say enough good things about it. &nbsp;Extremely stable, well-built, and very adjustable. &nbsp;Regardless of you body type and the type of chair you use, you can make it work. &nbsp;One small exception: &nbsp;I use it with a deep and
 cushy couch, and it is true that you can't sit all the way back. &nbsp;I imagine this would be true for any of those rigs, however. &nbsp;However, I bought one of those floor cushions with the arm rests to put behind me and the set up is very comfortable. &nbsp;I can play
 all day and not feel back or arm fatigue. &nbsp;The stand does not wobble, tilt or slip no matter how aggressive you drive. &nbsp;When I am done, it folds up nice and compact.</p>

<p>The main thing is to have your wheel mounted on something that is sturdy.</p>
<p>Laying the wheel on your lap is not good for serious driving in Forza.</p>

<p>[quote user="Rhosh"]I use it with a deep and cushy couch, and it is true that you can't sit all the way back. &nbsp;I imagine this would be true for any of those rigs[/quote]</p>
<p>This is true for the Wheel Stand Pro and RennSport stands, and any other stand with a similar design where the wheel is mounted on a straight column in front of the pedals.&nbsp; However the Xlerator stand that I linked to in my initial post has a different design
 which does in fact allow sitting all the way back on a couch or easy chair.&nbsp; Click on the link in my initial post and when you see photos of it you'll immediately see why.&nbsp; There are also some more expensive wheel stands that are designed in such a way that
 the wheel can extend back farther from the pedals, which may allow sitting farther back on a couch.&nbsp; For example see:</p>
<p><a href="http://steadiplay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://steadiplay.com/</a></p>
<p>I ended up buying a RennSport stand.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a tossup between&nbsp;the RennSport and Wheel Stand Pro.&nbsp; I chose that design over the Xlerator because even though I currently play on the couch, I want to also be able to play from a desk chair if I change my sim
 setup, and the Xlerator stand pretty much needs some sort of wide seat like a couch or big&nbsp;easy chair in order to work correctly.&nbsp; Also it looked like it might not hold the wheel as steady, since it would allow it to twist around when the force feedback kicks
 in.&nbsp; A stand like the SteadiPlay would probably be more ideal as far as being sturdy and very adjustable, but the price was too high, and it's not as compact either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the RennSport so far.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just putting a large pillow behind me on the couch solves the reach problem.&nbsp; I do find the vertical steering column between my legs to be slightly annoying at times, which is a problem the Xlerator and SteadiPlay stands don't
 have.&nbsp; But I really like how compactly&nbsp;the RennSport&nbsp;folds up.&nbsp;My wife likes that I can now easily put the driving rig away in the corner when I'm not using it.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 won&#39;t start after hibernation</h2>
                    <p>ok, , i have a hp elitebook, the other day i hibernated it and now it won't start at all, it loops in the start screen, turns itself off and then turns on again just to loop again, i researched a little and i know it has to do with the hibernation file that
 is created when you hibernate however there is no way for me to acces windows or my files (tried it from an ubuntu disc i use for recovery) what can i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>more info:</p>
<p>i tried hp built in diagnosis and startup and HDD tests have been passed and the hdd works just fine, i don't have system recovery discs or a windows 10 instalation disc</p>

<h2>            100&#37; Disk</h2>
                    <p>Hello! At the start of the new year, my computer became very slow. I went into task manager and found that the disk is 100%. I have searched online for a solution and have attempted to fix it however it has proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This 100% disk is slowing my computer down significantly. I have an ASUS i7-7700 laptop that is about 3 years old. I ran my anti-virus, restarted the laptop, yet is has persisted for 3 days. How can I fix my disk?<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af43da6d-aaa0-4d1b-b44c-015191c5af3d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af43da6d-aaa0-4d1b-b44c-015191c5af3d?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Luke.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) See fixes here for 100% disk usage:
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-percent-disk-usage-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-100-pe...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usage-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/fix-100-disk-usag...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />My name is Angel. I am an Independent Advisor. Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.
<br />
<br />FIX : Windows 10 100 Percent Disk Usage Problem
<br />
<br />1. Press  W8K + R and type devmgmt.msc in the Run, hit Enter key to open Device Manager snap-in.
<br />
<br />2. In the Device Manager window, expand IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers and right click on Standard SATA AHCI Controller, select Properties.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />3. In the property sheet, switch to Driver tab and click Driver Details.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />4. If the Driver File Details window shows storahci.sys driver listed there, it means you’re running inbox driver and hence it is possible to disable MSI mode. Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />5. Back on the property sheet, switch to Details tab. Against Property, select Device instance path from drop-down and note down the Value mentioned there.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Registry Disclaimer: The further steps will involve registry manipulation. Making mistakes while manipulating registry could affect your system adversely. So be careful while editing registry entries and create a System Restore point first.
<br />
<br />6. Press W8K + R and put regedit in Run dialog box to open Registry Editor (if you’re not familiar with Registry Editor, then click here). Click OK.
<br />
<br />7. In the Registry Editor window, navigate to following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\PCI\&lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt;\Device Parameters\Interrupt Management\MessageSignaledInterruptProperties
<br />
<br />*Substitute &lt;AHCI Controller Value&gt; we got in step 5.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />8. In the right pane of MessageSignaledInterruptProperties key, look for the registry DWORD (REG_DWORD) named MSISupported which should be corresponding to Value 1 as its Data. Double click on the DWORD to modify its value:
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />9. Finally, set the Value data as 0 and click OK. Close Registry Editor and reboot. After restarting your machine, the 100% disk usage problem should disappear.
<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the printer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try uninstalling the printer completely from the computer including the driver software. To uninstall device</p>
<p><b><span>Method <span>&nbsp;</span>1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Click on Start menu, type in "devmgmt.msc" to open the Device Manager.
</span></p>
<p><span>b) The Device Manager will then display a list of installed devices in the right pane of the console.
</span></p>
<p><span>c) Expand the category for Printer. </span></p>
<p><span>d) Right-click the device and select Uninstall</span></p>
<p><span>e) A dialog box will pop up asking you to confirm ‘Uninstall’. Click OK to proceed.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> While you are uninstalling the printer make sure that you select the option to delete the driver software as well.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Also delete the drivers by going to the below given location.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Open Devices and Printers by going to start menu</span></p>
<p><span>b) Select the Printer installed</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click on ‘Print server properties’</span></p>
<p><span>d) Go to Driver tab, delete all the drivers listed other than ‘Microsoft XPS Document Write’ and ‘Send to Microsoft OneNote Driver’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now download and install the latest driver software from the manufacturer's website.</span></p>

            Hi <strong>Scott</strong>, <br />
<br />
Every Windows operating system requires the specific drivers compatible with it. It will also depend on the manufacturer of the hardware or device on where will you be able to download them. Most of the time, these drivers will be available on their website
 itself. For an instance is your network driver. You may check your network adapter's support site to get the latest drivers available drivers for it.
<br />

<p>That is a bunch of bulls....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the manufacturer does have them, they will be there</p>
<p>If not then you use Microsoft developed and created generic drivers that are signed by&nbsp;Microsoft as the manufacturer of those drivers.</p>
<p>go to device manager and look in the properties for the network drivers, if they say Microsoft, then most likely the manufacturer does not have them for windows 10</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you go to HP and look at models that came with 7 or 8 and look for drivers for 10, if they do not have them, then they are Microsoft drivers. you can verify this in device manager properties for devices.</p>

<p>Doesn't matter if it was OEM, retail, stolen or fell out of the sky, if you have a older pc that came with or you installed 7 or 8 on and the manufacturer doesn't have 10 drivers, then do you think a genie popped out of a bottle and created them for internal
 system hardware, LOL, NO, Microsoft modified, engineered, developed&nbsp; them and signed them and you can verify this, ONCE AGAIN in device manager.</p>
<p>Better go educate yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And this PC you have now, wait about 3 years or so and when windows 11 or 12 come out, you will be going where are the 11 or 12 drivers,&nbsp;then you will be installing 11 or 12 with all Microsoft created generic drivers for your board and most all other internal

            Now if it is an older device&nbsp;of connected hardware like a printer and programs, that is why Microsoft created the COMPATIBILITY MODE from Vista to 10, so you can install and run them in that compatibility mode the drivers or programs were designed for
 or they would be useless too if OEM's do not create NEW drivers and they do not.

<p>Vista is irrelevant, no that proves my point more, that all PC;s and laptops that were sold by all of them HP, DELL, ASUS and on and on and on that came with Vista from them with their drivers, do not have ONE SINGLE DRIVER AVAILABLE TO USE TO BE ABLE TO
 INSTALL AT LEAST WINDOWS 8 AND WINDOWS 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>HMMM so lets see, how did the OS succeed installing and the PC's and laptops ran, well because &gt;&gt;&gt;MICROSOFT CREATED ALL THE INTERNAL HARDWARE DRIVERS TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE, or their PC's and Laptops would have become art on their coffee table for display
 only or they would still be running Vista and that goes for all.. HILARIOUS.</p>

<p>
</p><p>first, i have not queried about video editor. i asked for the installation of corel Ulead dvd movie maker 7 pro. i didn't expect the reply to install a alternative. My question is, why the compatibility mode does not support like windows 7. even&nbsp; i have
 tried to install with windows xp mode, windows 7 mode, it was not responded. why this option was given in windows 10 and what is the use of it. The developer given the compatibility upto windows vista and not for even windows 8.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Holy1233,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this up. There are several reasons as to why you can't play Sea of Thieves on your Windows 10 computer. Regarding your concern, the code name "<em><strong>AvocadoBeard</strong></em>" is given by the game developer to easily identify
 what's causing you unable to play the game. It wants to inform you that your privacy and online safety settings are restricting you to play the game, or if you don't have an Xbox Live Gold membership and you're playing the game on Xbox One. Since you confirmed
 that your privacy and online safety settings are all good, there's a possibility that there's something wrong with your game profile on Sea of Thieves. I suggest that you contact
<strong>Sea of Thieves Support</strong> team so that they could also help us to investigate and fix this issue and allow you to play the game. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/games_windows_10/i-cant-play-sea-of-thieves-pc/62d77ba9-4908-4e21-984a-bd81919de5a8">link</a></strong></em> that discusses the same issue and how you can
 contact Sea of Thieves Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to double check your privacy and online safety settings, you may login on this
<em><strong><a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Settings?tab=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> and follow the steps below:</p>

<strong>Join multiplayer games</strong> to <strong>Allow</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You can also change other settings before clicking the
<strong>Save</strong> button.</span></li><li>Play the game again.</li></ol>

<h3> timstone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update 1803 kills network &#47; client server operations</h2>
                    <p>PLEASE read this ALL before responding. &nbsp;I took the time to research the problem and provide details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the Advantage Database Server on a network. &nbsp;It worked perfectly until the 1803 update. &nbsp;Any computers with 1803 installed will not be able to access the ADS Client server. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize Microsoft made a lot of changes to networking, which, of course, are not documented, and thus we cannot trouble shoot the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the problem on 3 computers: &nbsp;1 uses Parallels with Win 10 Pro, another is a Dell Desktop from the Microsoft Store with Win 10 Pro, and the 3rd is a Surface Pro 4 ( with Win 10 Pro of course ). &nbsp;The problem exists on all computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reverted them all back to 1709 and they work perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE DO NOT tell me to install software from scratch. &nbsp;Frankly, that's a huge investment of time, and none of my clients will be willing to do that on their business computers. &nbsp;The problem exists in the 1803 update, and Microsoft OWNS IT ! &nbsp;So please,
 lets get some engineers on this problem who actually understand what changed, and how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please do not say we should go to the publisher of the other software. &nbsp;The fact is you also messed up Remote Desktop so again, lets take responsibility and get some skilled people involved with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you notice attitude, yeah, it's present. &nbsp;I've spent a full day tracking this down, losing that productivity, and having some clients who also experienced this and are VERY frustrated with Microsoft. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least provide instruction on how to freeze updates at 1709 for more than 30 days so we are not facing the prospect of having to waste more time rolling back until you get this fixed.</p>

<p>My apology for not responding sooner. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly we probably won't get any answers from MSFT. &nbsp;There are many posts where people may find something to temporarily provide a fix, but then it fails again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the ADS issue, the problem is when using "discovery" for the client to find the server. &nbsp;We found that 1803 took away firewall port access and we had to reset those ( 6262 UDP ). &nbsp;The problem still persisted to do the initial connection but at
 least the software did work properly once we established communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We did find a reliable solution. &nbsp;Set the server computer to a STATIC IP. &nbsp;Then create an ADS.INI file on each workstation ( check the manual ) to specify that IP and PORT ( 6262 ). &nbsp;Without the need for "discovery", the client will immediately connect and
 work as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other note. &nbsp;ADS uses UDP port 2989 for it's discovery of the server. &nbsp;It's a good idea to open that on all firewalls, but that may not solve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to check all of your networking settings. &nbsp;1803 set them all back to default ( mostly OFF ) for network discovery processes including the Services that should run automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all of that said, the issue may also be related to Defender. &nbsp;Even without the Firewall running, people still had problems. &nbsp;Some people found that using AVG instead of Defender allowed everything to work properly, but of course that is not really a
 solution. &nbsp;It may provide a temporary band aid but it does not actually get to the root of the problem and allow a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, from posts I have seen, this affects a lot of networking software including some very large systems. &nbsp;</p>

            Hello CescoKid,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting.&nbsp; I've included both the links and some steps on how to activate your Remote Assistance session on Vista.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if this helps you.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/398b5eda-aa7f-4078-94c5-1519b697bfa01033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/398b5eda-aa7f-4078-94c5-1519b697bfa01033.mspx</a><br />

<p>This check box appears on the message that you see when your helper asks to share control of your desktop. If you select this check box, your helper can respond to requests from the computer for administrator consent or administrator credentials,
 such as a user name or password. Then your helper can run administrator-level programs without needing your participation.</p>
</span><span>
<p>You can allow your helper to run administrator-level programs only if you can run them yourself. You will be asked for consent or credentials before giving your helper these abilities.</p>
</span><span>

<span>&nbsp;
&nbsp;Can someone using Windows Remote Assistance share control of my computer without my permission?
</span><span>
<div>
<p>No. You must give someone permission to share control. If you have an
administrator account, you can prevent non-administrators from giving permission. To do so, on the computer that you want someone to connect to, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Click start/Orb then select Control Panel.&nbsp; Choose Classic View and click on System to open System.</p>
</li><li>

 administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the <span>Allow Remote Assistance connections to this computer</span> check box.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <span>Advanced</span>, and then clear the <span>

<h2>            Red Dead 2 Installation Cancels on its OWN</h2>
                    <p>I bought Red Dead 2 for my xbox one from the microsoft store. When downloading the game, the installation stops at the same place everytime 15.15gb or 17.7% complete. I have taken many steps to correct this such as....</p>
<p>-hard resetting my xbox</p>
<p>-hard reset and leave off power for hours</p>
<p>-factory reset my settings</p>
<p>-factory rest my xbox (deleted EVERYTHING)</p>
<p>-plugged my xbox into the router with a ethernet cable</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do or how to fix it. I dont know how to get in touch with xbox support. Included is pictures of the errors.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fffb77f8-c4d5-4383-9169-a038bced1524?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fffb77f8-c4d5-4383-9169-a038bced1524?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d94b8ee-91b2-4c9c-8158-8fe802e3dbfe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8d94b8ee-91b2-4c9c-8158-8fe802e3dbfe?upload=true" /></a><br />
