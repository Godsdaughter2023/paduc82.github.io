<h2>            Windows 10 Mail duplicate settings for loading external images&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>please allow me to ask two questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> what is the difference between the two settings in Windows 10 Mail to load external images (externe Internetbilder). If there is no difference, I think one of the two should be removed by your developers as it is just confusing</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> why are external images (or other content) downloaded by default? I always thought loading external images when opening a mail is a security risk as it is used by spammers/hackers to load malicious content or just as confirmation that
 the mail was received (note: in the images the settings are turned off but they were enabled by default)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>For all people searching this, the German translation of the two settings is:</p>
<p>- Externe Bilder und Formate automatisch herunterladen</p>
<p>- Immer vollständige Nachricht und Internetbilder herunterladen</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for trying to clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Regarding Q1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is actually not really the case. I give you a few examples why these duplicate settings cannot really work this way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. One can&nbsp;enable "automatic download" in both settings <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
for only one</span> of the mail accounts (because also in the "Reading" pane one can uncheck the checkbox&nbsp;"apply&nbsp;to all accounts"). The problem with that is, the two settings are not in sync. I can enable it in the "Reading" pane while it stays disabled in
 the "Mailbox sync settings". So if one is disabled and the other is enabled, what is the result? Is it now disabled, or enabled? Do you get my point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Let's assume in the "Reading" pane I have set the checkbox to apply the setting&nbsp;to all accounts. So all accounts should download external images. Now&nbsp;in the "Mailbox sync settings" I have set for one specific account to&nbsp;NOT download external images. Which
 setting wins? Do you get my point?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really confusing! And looking at what I wrote in 1. it seems to be even technically wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Regarding Q2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here I don't really understand why you explain me the purpose of the setting while I was asking something different. I was not asking what the setting is doing (because I know), I was asking why it is enabled by default because it is a known security risk
 (for example in Outlook 2013/356 loading external images is disabled by default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you very much!</p>

<h2>            I wanted to report an error with Jonah in Shadow of the Tomb Raider Croft Edition Disc version,its a small error, hope it can be fixed.</h2>
                    during my second playthrough of shadow of the Tomb Raider Croft Edition from GameStop, I am playing on New Game+ mode, anyway I am not sure whats best to report this error to the games maker if you can, so it can be fixed, I went ahead and used Report
 a problem on my xbox One X console, but not sure if that's the best way to report errors in game or not,&nbsp; I picked the Jaguar Path,&nbsp; during new game plus mode , right in the jungle before you get to the first town, my Jonah character became two AI of the same
 person. I am guessing that once the towns video starts the second Jonah should go away, but I think that's maybe a error I should report I took a few Capture a screenshot on my xbox one and upload them to my onedrive to share here in any case. anyway I don't
 no what needs to be done to fix this error, also running in Insider Preview Beta firmware on my Xbox One X, but that should not effect a character in game I would think its a bug related to the game and not the console system itself, Os Version is 10.0.17763.2002
 (rs5_release_xbox_dev_1810.180918-1920) again the firmware on my xbox one x seems very stable, so I don't no if that could make 2 Jonah's in shadow of the tomb raider, if so maybe I should downgrade the OS version back to non-insider firmware version.<br />

<p><span>Hello Firas7,</span></p>
<p><span>To begin with, I suggest that you check if the notifications are enabled in the notification area.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right-click
 an empty area on the taskbar, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Notification area, click Customize.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>For
 each icon(Action Center and Windows Update), select following option in the list:</span></p>
<p><span>‘Show icon and notifications’. The icon always remains visible on the taskbar in the notification area and any notifications are displayed.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Ok.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer the below article for more information on this.</span></p>

<h2>            Cumulative Update for Windows 10 KB3097617 - Error 0x80092004  3 failures not a charm</h2>

<p>
</p><p>How does MS expect me to allow a person in India to "fix" my computer when the coding of Windows 10 has caused nothing but problems with incorrect error messages ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And to fully enhance my experience - the party feigned sarcasm but only got as far as 50%- ill mannered- another failed MS effort. After 3 attempts including one by direct d/l 50% is as far as update installed before failing.</p>

            <p>If you are only being tortured by that one update, try not to revert so quickly. MS will have a major update in November. Hopefully this upcoming build will improve a few things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My major gripe is the quality of HELP and the reverting to cheap labor with accents so heavy as to defy comprehension. I found both "chat" and made in India to be a detriment to Microsoft and&nbsp;of no use to the end user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;upgrade in-place repair I had to do, was the FIRST time since Windows 2 I had to do a reinstall to fix a problem. I wish more resources were devoted to coding an O/S instead of artfully becoming a PUP with advert revenue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on the edge of chucking all things MS if this is not fixed with November major fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a bit over the top for anyone to demand access to my computer and not tell me what the fix is.</p>
<p>THat is demand and not ask.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The upgrade of Windows 10, left my hosts file in place. I have a rather large hosts file to tame advertising and tracking cookies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I renamed the hosts file, so it was no longer read.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I was able to install the problematic update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fault MS for not allowing a clean upgrade install at the start, and worse the lack of information, even on Tech Net for what the file system does and how and to whom or lack of documentation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Edge and IE 11 to compare who provided the MOST INTRUSIVE advert injection-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge was the winner for most adverts over IE 11- </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would think other ad-blocking software may have a similar adverse effect. However lacking any documentation it is only a guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing 10 did:&nbsp; turn off restore points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this is of help to you.</p>

            <p>It is the contents of the hosts file&nbsp; that was sending possibly a site to loopback. The documentation on W 10 is lacking. I made this change after another failure. Then the next operation was a repeat of installing the same update- this time with success.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was a guess on my part, predicated upon the extent of advertising incorporated into this new revenue stream. After I had all updates installed. I had to deal with Money / news/ Groove loading and then closing.</p>
<p>I had to use PowerShell to remove these un-installable apps, then reinstall them from the store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To change permissions is another matter, that is addressed with adequate instructions easily&nbsp;found. Let us keep this thread to cumulative&nbsp;update failure.&nbsp; If you have not made entries to hosts, or have blocking software, there may be another issue on you
 computer. Remember the O/S is used on may different computer brands, all are different and most have differences in architecture,&nbsp;especially device drivers.</p>
<p>My computer in question is a Toshiba laptop.</p>

            <p>When 10 is working, it is working well. I had to reinstall the MS apps</p>
<p>Weather/Groove/Mail/I-heart/Groove/Flipboard. Instead of trying fixes- I decided removal/replace was quicker. W7 is my favorite, before that W2000.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do keep a USB pen drive with the&nbsp; O/S loaded and immediately backed up the HDD to a portable USB HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>One minor pain was after I had things running I used the MS account for u/n and p/w</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon removing old files, the Windows7 directory was owned by old logon, and to remove this required
</p>
<p>editing permissions- the old user name was that file owner.</p>

            <p>My problem with&nbsp;certain updates not installing, ceased immediately after I removed hosts from being read.</p>
<p>After I took care of hosts, the next thing I did was to try again to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know if hosts entry&nbsp;was the cause of my update failure, I have had no problems with anything installing since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last *UBAR was at the hands of WD and Acronis- their updated back-up for W 10was stated as being compliant- but it was OK for 8.1 and nothing higher.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That app locked the computer after back-up of C drive. Then the fun began- restore failed computer went into endless BSOD loop, one more in-place repair.&nbsp; This was a WD/Acronis *UBAR</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have suffered blocked texts thanks to MS advert injection, the worse was their video running over Rachel Maddow. I choose to ignore the MS adverts, and give negative input on advert popups that make it past block most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said, my problem with the OS performing is fixed. Microsoft needs to give equal efforts to coding software with inserting adverts, sideways. I have not installed 10, on my 6 home computer network, I am still considering my options: sanity / win
 7/Linux.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Thanks for your input. Audio drivers are up to date. Uninstalled and reinstalled Skype 8.17.&nbsp; Did a test on Skype audio; sometimes my message was complete but at other times message was incomplete. Spoke with one of my contacts on Skype who told
 me that sound and picture were fine but that my sound broke up now and then for about 2-3 seconds and then resumed ok.&nbsp; So there is still a problem. Below are 2 screenshots of microhone settings.</strong></p>

<h2>            &#39;Find Album Info&#39; script error in Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    Hi, having problem with WMP 12. The 'Find Album Info' function is not working. All goes well until you click Finish to confirm you have found the right album information when window pops up saying there is a Script Error. I can then only get out by pressing
 cancel without updating the music files. This has only started happening recently. I have tried Restore Music Library to no avail. Can anyone help?

            <p>Thanks both for replies and info. I have found a solution by luck more than anything else. Had tried rebuilding library but did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the "Find Album Info" window is open there is script in top left hand corner:
<br />
fai.music.metaservices.microsoft.com</p>
<p>If you hover curser over this it 'refresh' pops up, click on the script and it refreshes the Window just like clicking refresh on I.E. This cures the problem, if it doesn't work first time just refresh a couple of times and it does work. Also, so far, has
 stopped problem recurring.</p>
<p>Hope this works for you Widgeon3.</p>

    <title>Wireless Mouse does not work at all on my Dell Inspiron 1720 after - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Wireless Mouse does not work at all on my Dell Inspiron 1720 after Windows Vista Service Pack 2</h2>
                    A couple weeks ago my computer prompted me to download Windows SP2. Everything went fine until I grabbed my Logitech mouse and nothing happened. I tried changing the battery, a system restore and some other things but nothing happens. The USB ports and
 my computer don't even acknowledge the mouse is plugged in, although it does acknowledge everything else that is plugged in like my Ipod and external hard-drive. I bought a Microsoft wireless mouse just to see if it was indeed the Logitech mouse but my computer
 does not pick up on that one either. The mice work on my friends laptops and computers so I don't know what is going on. Please help, thanks. &nbsp;

    <title>touchpad problem in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> radudascalescu  say:</h3>
<h2>            touchpad problem in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My computer is an older Toshiba Satellite A200 series with a genuine Windows Vista Home Edition installed on it and which I upgraded first at Windows 7 then Windows 8.1. Along the time, I found all the necessary divers so that it worked fine. Now I upgraded
 to Windows 10 and all features are ok,&nbsp; except 2 of them:</p>
<p>1. first, I cant use my Synaptics touchpad only as mouse, because the light behind the pad are not going on, and I cant use the volume control or other utilities in it. I mention that in Win 8.1 I found a driver who worked. I tried also the trick with the
 compatibility, but it didnt worked too. What could I do, except selling yhe notebook ?</p>
<p>2. second, Windows 10 didnt find a driver for the Mass Storage Controller. Does someone know a solution ?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>If it's a backwards compatible game then yes. If it's a game that's available on both platforms, but not backwards compatible, then they are seen as separate versions so you both would need to be playing the same version.</p>

            <p>As an owner of an xbox one s I do play xbox 360 games with backwards compatibility. The simplest way to explain how it does this is this: the xbox one essentially opens up the xbox 360 software to be able to play the games that are backwards compatible. This means that you can play with people that are playing on xbox 360 using an xbox one or one s. For a list of backwards compatible games click&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-one/backward-compatibility/available-games</a></p>

<h2>            How add child to xbox account and change security settings</h2>
                    
<p>I have been working on this for 6 hours and on the phone for over an hour. &nbsp;It has gotten so confusing and ridiculous. &nbsp;My son and I both have to have a microsoft account which I have made and I have set his settings in Family Safety to age 8. &nbsp;However,
 logging into xbox on Windows 10 his settings are teen. &nbsp;To change them one must log into xbox.com. &nbsp;If I log into under his microsoft account they can not be changed because he is the child. &nbsp;If I log in under my microsoft account at xbox.com there are no
 children listed and no where to add him. &nbsp;How do I protect him?!!??? This is a nightmare and someone should be held responsible!!!!!!!!!!</p>

            <p>Hi Alberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To read Kindle E Books&nbsp;on Windows 8.1, you need a Kindle E Book reader.</p>
<p><strong>Kindle for pc </strong>is not an App. It is a reader for the Desktop. Use your desktop browser to download it and use it on the desktop.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>
<p>The kindle app is a link to the Cloud to store your books and is primarily used to buy more books using the Start Page. Go to the Start page, search apps for
<strong>Kindle. </strong>Install it if it is not already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this post helps. Get back to us for further queries. We are happy to help.

<h3> joshuaguilbert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo screen saver problem&#58; shows photos from the web</h2>
                    Running win 7. My screen saver has been set to a folder in my photos directory. It cycles through these plus it shows the profile pics of my friends on facebook. Thing is I have not downloaded or saved these photos ANYWHERE on my computer. After it started
 doing this I even went and checked the settings and if the folder had the pics in it. Directory was still set to photos/screensaverphotos and that folder had not gained any photos. How is this happening? Can it be fixed or has facebook invaded my laptop in

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the suggestion but I did all that. Something more is going on. I set up and followed the steps you have listed when I started and several times afterwards. The fact that it is showing profile pics from facebook that I have not even downloaded
 suggests that either there is a microsoft bug OR facebook is playing silly buggers, could be both.</div>

<h2>            Set Bluetooth accesspoint connection ast mettered</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>When I connect my android with bluetooth, and establish a tethering connection (via bluetooth&gt;joint a personal network&gt;myphone&gt;connect using&gt;accesspoint), it works well but the connection is not metered.</p>
<p>There is in fact no icon in the windows 10 network menu, as there is usually the Wifi networks or the ethernet connection (even the USB android tethering is visible as ethernet).</p>
<p>It is usually there that I can control the properties of the wifi/ethernet/usb connection, metered, private/public... but now, no way.</p>
<p>I've searched&nbsp; in the windows 10 parameter for network , and there is nowhere to edit the connection.</p>
<p>even on the network status page, the "modify property connection" don't open any dialog.</p>
<p>however I see well bluetooth network connection</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the windows 7 style of network properties(network &amp; sharing center) , I can see the bluetooth connection, but no way to set metered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a known procedure to set a bluetooth accesspoint connection metered?</p>
<p>is it a known problem?</p>

<p>Thanks for the proposal, but it does not work, as a bluetooth accesspoint connections is not listed in the wifi connections, even in the known wi-fi connections</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even in the list of network usage, there is no section for bluetooth, only wifi and ethernet.</p>
<p>Bluetooth is not listed in ethernet either (my ethernet connection is shown as disconnected with no usage)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot either create a connection from the windows control panel...</p>
<p>only way seems to be by the bluetooth icon which send me to peripheral and printer and shows my bluetooth telephone allowing&nbsp; a PAN connection...</p>
<p>
</p><p>bluetooth accesspoint connection seems not managed by windows 10 modern components...</p>

    <title>Why can&#39;t WMP rip a CD cleanly without putting hiccups between - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bummedburner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t WMP rip a CD cleanly without putting hiccups between tracks that should flow seamlessly as they do on original&#63;</h2>
                    In ripping an original CD where there are multiple tracks but when the music should sound seamlessly without interruption (Chopin's Preludes in which the piano sustain carries to the first chord in the next track, or the Sgt. Pepper's or Abbey Road albums)
 instead there is a digital, coarse blip and drop in sound lasting a milisecond breaking the seam. It's ugly and artificial, and I don't want this on the burned CD, which is what will happen. I have chosen "no gaps" --still the problem. I have gone to enhancements
 and selected crossfading on and crossfading off, and crossfading anywhere from 0 to 10--none of this works. The original cd plays in the lap top sweetly flowly in its live performance, with tracks keyed to alert me to new movements but not breaks like your
 average pop song ending pause, another starting. My savvy is limited to WMP and my tools are window 7. What am I suppose to do to Abby Road's B side medley with hiccups and pauses between the tracks on a CD I rip for myself

            <p>Hi - your music <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">should</span> play seamlessly and it sounds like you may have a driver problem. Check with your pc manufacturer for audio related driver updates.</p>
<p>You certainly don't want to apply crossfading or any other enhancements (IMO)&nbsp;and these would not affect a CD burn anyway. In fact I expect a burned CD would be fine, but it would be worth buying a 5 or 10 pack of CD-RWs so you can do test burns... I always
 used to do this before committing to a CD-R.</p>
<p>If you like your audio in high quality, there is a good (and free) work-around for this which I used on my W7 laptop.</p>
<p>It means learning how to use some audio editing software at the end of which you will join up and save (e.g.) the last section of Abbey Road as a wav. file...&nbsp;below is how I have created it for streaming purposes (to avoid gaps of several seconds! - created
 on my W7 laptop - wma version) Does this sound of interest? - Cheers, Ric.</p>

            Thanks for your help. First off, I'll say it is of interest to me to know how to do this. Although time-constraint prevents me at this moment &nbsp;from exploring it, or posting my many additional questions right now, I will say as regards the driver, I've
 had the same issue on two different laptops of different make. I see that I don't want to use any enhancements.OK. But that small drop between tracks happens on both--does not happen when I play the original CD in the computer, but in playing back the ripped
 tracks, it occurs. And it happens on the CDs I've burned. I initially thought it was due to not ripping the files as WAV, but as MP3. But ripping them as WAV the result remains the same. Forgive me if I'm a little slow at getting this or un derstanding all
 your suggestions immediately. My guess is I'm not very savvy, but I appreciate your help and look forward to an opportunity to pursue this. I do want to produce high quality burned CD, &nbsp;I see you understand my question by posting t

            <p>BB - thanks for the quick response. I have heard the 'blip' between tracks on both a Dell and an HP laptop - but this was corrected by getting the audio drivers right in both cases. It's a pity you cannot hear your music the way it is meant to be, and worse
 still if you cannot burn a decent disc without the problem... <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<em>I have to say I have never encountered that problem burning CDs with conjoined tracks in Windows 7.**</em></span></p>
<p>The editing program I used for joining up the tracks is called 'Audacity' and is a free and reliable download, but I have been involved in audio editing for years (going back to the days when you had to splice tape!) so it was relatively easy for me to adapt
 to doing this digitally - in fact it's a lot easier, once you find your way around the software. If you want to have a look&nbsp;with a view to&nbsp;giving it a try you'll find more about it at the link below. It will probably seem a bit daunting but loading and&nbsp;joining
 up tracks is a relatively straightforward process and I'll be happy to help get you started. Let me know what you think, and no rush - I'll keep my notification link open.</p>
<p>Cheers, R.</p>

            I will look into audacity. As a matter of fact, I actually have a Lenovo/HP, and evidently therefore the blip. Before I try audacity, however, do you know how to set the driver rigfht on my laptop, as you say? Thanks for keeping the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">notification

            <p>Hi - It's a new day and I have a confession to make! My assertion that I never had that blip issue when burning a disc on W7 was completely
 pre-laptop days - and using a special music program - not WMP. So this morning I have test-run off a few conjoined tracks discs on both laptops using WMP - sure enough those tiny blips are there. So it probably isn't a sound card issue after all. I also tried
 a burn using <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">iTunes</span> on this W10 pc... still that millisecond pause unfortunately. So apologies once again for what was one of my worst senior moments to date!</p>
<p>What does still stand is my suggestion to put the tracks back together using 'Audacity' - I have done that for quite a few albums, notably 'Abbey Road', Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side' and 'Wish You Were Here' along with some classical works as well (Beethoven's
 Fifth is one) - it does mean you can't pick out individual songs or movements but at least you can burn a disc that will play seamlessly (or in my case - stream it thus) from the reconstructed files.</p>
<p>Apologies once again for the confusion - I have edited my post yesterday to avoid misleading anyone else looking at the thread. Best - Ric.</p>

            Thanks so much for all the detective work. I wonder if this blip showed up in XP or jst starting with W7. It's a annoying fault, no? I'll follow up on audacity, perhaps, but I'd still like to know how I can burn a CD without those blips AND burn on one
 CD from various sources. IIn the end, thanks very much for your time. By the way, in what situation were you splicing tape? Sounds very interesting. A lost art, huh?

            <p>When I first had XP there was no option at all in WMP for burning gapless CDs - a two second gap between tracks was mandatory! I don't know whether this eventually changed - if it did I was already using the alternative software that came from the PC manufacturer
 and didn't need it anyway. In view of that a fractional blip in W7 was a vast improvement - and most of my conjoined tracks do play back OK when streaming or listening on cans...Odd that 'burn' thing though... live and learn!</p>
<p>Sound has always fascinated me. It started when I was about 6 or 7 with curiosity as to how they got the echo on rock and roll records. I used to do stuff for school and college back in the sixties - back then I only had one (fairly primitive) machine to
 work with, and cutting and joining sections of tape was the only option - although usually I could get hold of a second machine to copy the finished result, thereby avoiding a joint breaking at the worst possible&nbsp;time... By the 70's I had two machines and
 could bounce stuff from one to the other, which made life easier. Now I can multi-track stuff&nbsp;with Audacity all in the one window... and edit clean as a whistle - fantastic really.

            <p>Hi again - something that may be of interest has come to light from another thread I have been involved with.</p>
<p>I know you are still using Windows 7 at present, but I had noticed that the Cyberlink Media Suite,&nbsp;which is being distributed on some Windows 10 pcs, has a CD and DVD copying facility. An enquiry about a problem using this&nbsp;prompted me to do some test runs,
 and lo and behold -&nbsp;one perfect CD copy with no blips between tracks! </p>
<p>So it may be worth investigating whether you have any Cyberlink software already installed - or if there is a free download that applies to disc copying in Windows 7.</p>

</p>
<p>This seems to be the relevant link and a quick check produced the info in the snip below (my highlights)&nbsp;- you just need to make sure it is OK for your OS, but general compatibility with Windows should be fine as it comes preloaded on loads of pcs...&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 All the Best - Ric.</p>
