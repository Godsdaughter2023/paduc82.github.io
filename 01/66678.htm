<h2>            Windows 10 Fall Creators, Auto Reopen of Programs after Restart</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have 2 users in my pc, and when I use my user and then shutdown my pc, some programs still open, and then when i turn on and logon on the other user it gives me a bluescreen.</p>
<p>I think its because the same program is open in the 2 users.</p>
<p>Is there any way to disable reopen programs after restart?</p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Try this workaround, see if it helps you.
<br />
<br />Shutdown PC by pressing alt+F4, and select shutdown.
<br />
<br />Then on restart, apps do not restart.
<br />
<br />You can also create a desktop shortcut with
<br />
<br />c:\windows\system32\shutdown.exe /s /hybrid /t 0
<br />
<br />The /hybrid is optional, but without it, you do not fast boot.
<br />
<br />Keep us posted, Good luck!

            Sure, I believe Microsoft will provide future updates with a fix for this. You can mark the query resolved for the sake of others having same issue.

            <p>That adapter is an HDMI adapter. It plugs into th HD Video Out port. Then, you need and HDMI cord to plug into that pigtail adapter and your HD device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The small end of that HD adapter has a cap on it. Be sure to pull it off before trying to plugging it into your Surface.</p>

<h2>            Clean Installation of Windows 10 1709 x64</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I need to upgrade my W10 1607 to the latest version as support will discontinue in a few weeks.&nbsp; I also understand that the "Upgrade" I'm being offered through "Windows 10 Update Assistant" is not my best option, however doing a clean installation
 using MCT for me is going to be mind bending for me (so I do wonder if the simple upgrade offered by W10 windows assistant might be the less stress option ?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, if I do this in the next few weeks there's not another upgrade due shortly is there and therefore wait ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for someone like me what preparation do I need to do for a "Clean Installation of W10 1709" ...I will use the opportunity to clear out all my unwanted Files/photo's and debris from the previous upgrade from 8.1 to W 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a "Custom Install", if I do this will this save me creating all my Folders again, loading up my Files and putting on the Apps I loose by other methods and of course any drivers !</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I take a copy of my current windows setup (which has taken me months to get how I want it ...&amp; getting things like "Defender off line" working incase I do need to "revert" back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I keep Edge Favourites &amp; Favourites Bar&nbsp;?&nbsp; Do I need to get all my Edge Favourites into IE &amp; then import or can I take a copy of Edge_8wekyb3d8bbwe ie C:\Users\xxxx\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe &amp; then copy that back
 into W10 1709 ? (unless they don't use that folder).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What version of Edge does 1709 have, I've currently got Edge14 and I use IBM Trusteer Rapport to protect my financial / online banking sites but I think they only support up to Edge 15 currently.....................&amp; this is the reason I've held off until
 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally I want to change my Hotmail account / password from one I use no longer to my one I constantly&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy *** to *** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Windows 10 version 1803 (2018, 3rd month) historically, should be out about April 10th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You asked too many questions for me to tackle - I would suggest you visit your email account you want to use and maybe combine the one you dont want to use http://account.microsoft.com &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; and also might look into your settings / account / Sync's&nbsp; and start
 doing some syncing of your settings if not already doing so - they'll be saved in your Hotmail and OneDrive accounts sync's.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Maybe think about putting all your documents, pictures, etc folders into onedrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can backup your drivers simply enough from CommandPrompt(admin) or PowerShell(admin) , use this command as an example;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Edge 41.16299.334.0 is my edge on v1709 with all current updates.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; There seems to be no 1803 so I think that MS will stop supporting 1607 soon, so I am going to have to upgrade to 1709 ASAP.</p>
<p>I've been deterred from using the Update&nbsp; assistant so to get a better installation (&amp; it needs to be simple for me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I use MCT from USB but keep all my Files, Drivers, Apps, favorites and, settings. (I'll clear out any Apps I don't need before, I'll remove any Anti-Virus other than Defender and I'll probably load Malwarebytes on afterwards).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can do such an installation how do I do it ?....</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a good idea to update to the latest <strong><em>Windows</em></strong> version since the
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4076503/windows-10-version-1607-semi-annual-channel-end-of-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Semi-Annual Channel end of support for Windows 10</a></strong></em>
 version <em><strong>1607</strong></em> has occurred on the<em><strong>10th of April 2018</strong></em>. This means that this version will no longer receive security updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In-line with your concern, you can perform the upgrade via the Media Creation tool and will be given the option to choose on what will be kept through the upgrade. For a detailed guide on how to use the tool, you can check the steps under the
<em><strong>Using the tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10</strong></em> topic found on this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. Alternatively, you can check this

 MVP <em><strong>Andre Da Costa </strong></em>to determine if your device is compatible with the recent version.</p>

<p>Darwin, Thank you &amp; good evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Andre Da Costa's article thank you,&nbsp; I have a Toshiba Satellite C50D-A-13G...............&amp; it doesn't appear on 1709 or indeed 1703 as being compatible.&nbsp; Which I found strange as I did upgrade to 1703 last year but rolled back to 1609 because&nbsp;Edge
 was very slow or would not load................however after the rollback I found the problem was caused by IBM Trusteer Rapport !</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I wonder if the compatibility list is correct ?.............................I further ask the question because&nbsp; my C50D-A isn't included in the compatibility listing for 1607 !!! which I am running &amp; have been since introduced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So bearing in mind I only use the Laptop for Emails, Spreadsheets and Internet Banking (Which is why I use Trusteer Rapport) I wonder what options have I got ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I rollback to 8.1 (but I loose Windows Defender Offline &amp; Cloud Sampling by WD) &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a&nbsp;Home version of &nbsp;1709 (so that I can get security updates) that maybe compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any 3rd party software available that would protect my Laptop to the same level of future security updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought when I bought this Laptop with 8GB of RAM it would do me for many years to come especially as I don't use it for Games, design &nbsp;etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the delayed response. Although your device may not be compatible for the version
<em><strong>1709</strong></em>, this should not restrict you from attempting to perform a clean install. In-line with your concern, you can get the latest
<em><strong>.ISO Windows</strong></em> version on this <em><strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support link</a></strong></em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">.</a>
 Once you got the latest version, refer to the steps under the <em><strong>Using the tool to upgrade this PC to Windows 10
</strong></em>topic to complete the upgrade or check this detailed <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">guide</a></strong>
 by <em><strong>Andre Da Costa</strong></em> on how to perform a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the upgrade or clean install reports any error, then that's the best time to consider deferring the upgrade or rolling back to a previous version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result of the upgrade.</p>

<p>On a technical level perspective, downgrading to the original version you were running prior the upgrade is at intermediate level. The steps on how to downgrade can be found on the
<em><strong>Forum Article</strong></em> in the previous post. Click the <em><strong>Windows 7 or Windows 8.1</strong></em> link under the
<strong><em>Detail</em></strong> section to view the steps. Just a reminder, if you're not familiar or comfortable with the steps, seeking technical assistance would be recommended.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, creating a system backup is the ideal preparation prior to any system changes. You can also check the

When you click to clear the check box on the General tab of the folder's Properties and Apply the change, the Read-only attribute is changed for all the files in the folder. However, the Read-only attribute is not changed for the folder, its subfolders, or
 any files in its subfolders. If you click Apply changes to this folder, subfolders, and files, the Read-only attribute is changed for all files in the folder and all files in the subfolders. However, the Read-only attribute is not changed for the folder or
 its subfolders.</p>

<h2>            Device Properties not Opening</h2>
                    I'm trying to update the drivers on my mouse. When I open Devices and Printers, every device shows up with no error, I can not open any device properties. When i right click a device and select properties I get the mouse loading sign for about five seconds
 and then it stops loading and nothing opens. Every device is doing this and I can't find anything related to this for Windows 10.

    <title>Can only Access Vista Home Public Files over a Wireless Home Network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gene albert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can only Access Vista Home Public Files over a Wireless Home Network System.</h2>
                    I have added a wireless Vista Home Desktop computer to my existing Home ATT Uverse Router system. My hardwired Windows 7 Ultimate and my hardwired Windows XP Professional can access each others files just fine. My wireless connected Vista&nbsp; Home system
 can access the other computer files just fine, but will only allow the other two systems to access its Public folder.
<p>I have followed all the steps I could find on various forums (use the same Workgroup names, set the systems to Private, use a login password for the Windows 7 and Vista Home, etc, allow folder and file sharing, etc.).</p>
<p>All systems can access the Internet through the U-verse router and all can see each other's shared folders. Still, the Vista Home system will only allow access to files in its Public folder.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks, Gene Albert</p>

<p>It can see any folder I set in Vista to be shared and set permissions for modification. The problem is, Vista will not let me access the shared folders from either the Windows 7 Ultimate or the XP Professional system, only the Public folder can be accessed.
 I do get an error message saying that I do not have permission to access the folder(s), etc.</p>
<p>When I try to the steps you outline above, only the user names that are on the Vista system are available. If I name one from the Windows 7 system, I get an error message that it cannot find any such name. All systems are members of WORKGROUP and not part
 of a domain.</p>

<p>Hello Diana,</p>
<p>This works for individual folders, if done separately. How do I make it work for a collection of folders at one time. For example, how do I allow access to all the folders of a specific User's account, without having to do so separately for each folder,
 on the Vista Home Basic system? Or how do I make the whole C:\ drive available as a whole, on the Vista Home Basic system?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for the favor of another reply,</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>To do so, you can try taking the ownership of the parent folder.</span></p>
<p><span>For example, if the folders you need to take the ownership are under âMy documentsâ folder, then you need to take the ownership of my documents
 folder (Parent folder).</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
Step 1 worked for me, thanks. But i was wondering if by adding everyone, anyone could access my computer, or would they still need a password.<br />
<br />
Question 2: I just realized that both accounts in one computer can be accessed from my main computer, does it have to be this way?<br />

<p>If you aren't very far in the game, you can try deleting the save file that you currently have and deleting the worms game from your console. &nbsp;You can do this in console settings, memory, and then select where you saved the worms game.
</p>
<p>After you do this, try re-downloading the game to your HDD and then create a new save. &nbsp;Hopefully, this time it will not corrupt and you will be able to play. &nbsp;If it continues to corrupt, there could be an underlying issue with your hard drive and it's ability
 to save games. &nbsp;Do you have issues saving in any other games?</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>can any one give me the relevant email address for complaints and refunds? I purchased the game Worms Revolutions and am suffering the same date bug as every one else. I know there's a sort of way around it but at the end of the day the game is not fit for
 purpose and breaches the Sale's of Goods Act. Shame on Xbox and Team 17 for the very poor way they have dealt with this problem.</p>

<p>The game is broken. &nbsp;The date on the Xbox is what seems to be causing the issue (December date). &nbsp;There is a temporary and, IMO, unacceptable workaround located in my thread about this issue.</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/8/t/401095.aspx</p>
<p>I received a stock answer from Team 17 that they know about it and are working on it, but that doesn't mean squat.&nbsp; I contacted Xbox support through chat and requested a refund of my MS Points, which I received yesterday.</p>

<p>All you have to do is get offline and set the dates back a few months or years I just do jan 1 2005. You can play no problem. Cannot play online or file corrupts. Hopefully they fix it. Have fun!</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t click on a folder in the taskbar but I can open softwares from the taskbar</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have a shortcut to "my PC/my computer" (all the drives and USB Flash drives) on my Windows 10 taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do a left click on the shortcut icon, something loads but everything closes immediately and there is a kind of "flash" and I can't open "my PC/my computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I used to have issues with softwares shortcuts in the taskbar but I did a reset of the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows Key + R on your keyboard.</li><li>Key in&nbsp;<em>PowerShell</em>&nbsp;and hit Enter.</li><li>Right click on the PowerShell icon on the taskbar and select&nbsp;<em>Run as Administrator</em>.</li><li>Now paste the following command in the&nbsp;<em>Administrator: Windows PowerShell</em>&nbsp;window and press Enter key:
<pre>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</pre>
</li><li>
<pre>NOW for the important part ! Locate to : &nbsp;C:/Users/name/AppData/Local/ and delete the TileDataLayer folder. Should fix everything immediately, no reboot necessary. Let me know how it works for you, it did for me! And remember to clean the recycle bin after you deleted the folder and give it 1min then everything is back to normal !</pre>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>but I still can't click on the "my computer" folder on the taskbar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Should I<span>&nbsp;run the SFC?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Or Should I run the DISM Tool?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Or the fix is something else?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Many thanks!</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi Guillaume,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the troubleshooting steps you have performed to resolve your issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Have you installed all pending updates?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you able to access File Explorer&nbsp;from start menu?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the Methods below.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>If you are&nbsp;able to access File explorer/ This Pc from Start, suggest op to Unpin File Explorer from taskbar and re pin and check if that helps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> Place your computer in <strong>clean boot
</strong>state and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3.</strong><br />
This issue could be due to the system file is corrupt. I recommend you to perform SFC scan, System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow the below link on how to run SFC scan.</strong><br />

<h2>            Computer freezing with Blue Screen Error STOP&#58; 0x0000007E</h2>
                    <p>Original Title- STOP: 0x0000007E etc etc</p>
<p>Dell StudioXPS9100 running Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 64bit.<br />
<br />
We've had issues with the computer freezing or spontaneously rebooting more or less since we got it, but it would also have long periods (like, months) of stability with no problems. Lately it was getting bad again (as in, it would freeze or blue screen after
 hours or even minutes rather than months), and after googling around I began to suspect the video card. So I replaced it. The problem only recurred twice in the first 24 hours the new card was in, but lately it's back to freezing or blue screening after about
 10 - 15 minutes of use. The last time, on a BSOD, I got and copied down the following:
<br />
<br />
STOP: 0x0000007E (0xFFFFFFFFC0000005, 0xFFFFF8000C894B7C, 0xFFFFF880029A6EE8, 0xFFFFF880029A6740)<br />
<br />
It seems to run OK in Safe Mode, which suggests it's NOT a hardware issue after all. (Or am I wrong about that?) Any help would be much appreciated.

<strong>1.</strong> Obviously a very up to date driver. Check with Nvidia Support, their on-line documentation<br />
and drivers, and ask in their forums. If there are no newer versions it make be necessary to<br />
revert back to an old stable version.<br />

<br />
<strong>4.</strong> If needed run the Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a new CAUSE (see next message<br />

<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050<br />
<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before
<br />
these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers <br />
were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video <br />
driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products <br />
could be at fault as well as drive issues.<br />
<br />
Use the troubleshooter below and refer to the next message for drivers and<br />
memory when you get to those sections and then return back to the trouble-<br />
shooter as needed.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 50&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000050</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0x50: PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA<br />
<br />
</strong>The PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bug check has a value of 0x00000050. This indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.</p>
<p><br />
Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code </p>
<p><br />
If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call the
 manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased <br />
Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p><br />
If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p><br />
These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses.</li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
<p>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA Parameters </p>
<p><br />
The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>

<p>If the driver responsible for the error can be identified, its name is printed on the blue screen and stored in memory at the location (PUNICODE_STRING)
<strong>KiBugCheckDriver</strong>.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Cause <br />
<br />
</strong>Bug check 0x50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective RAM, be it main memory, L2 RAM cache, or video RAM).
</p>
<p><br />
Another common cause is the installation of a faulty system service.</p>
<p><br />
Antivirus software can also trigger this error, as can a corrupted NTFS volume.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Resolution</strong> </p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a faulty hardware problem:</strong> If hardware has been added to the system recently, remove it to see if the error recurs. If existing hardware has failed, remove or replace the faulty component. You should run hardware diagnostics supplied by the
 system manufacturer. For details on these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a faulty system service problem:</strong> Disable the service and confirm that this resolves the error. If so, contact the manufacturer of the system service about a possible update. If the error occurs during system startup, restart your computer,
 and press F8 at the character-mode menu that displays the operating system choices. At the resulting Windows
<strong>Advanced Options</strong> menu, choose the <strong>Last Known Good Configuration</strong> option. This option is most effective when only one driver or service is added at a time.</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving an antivirus software problem:</strong> Disable the program and confirm that this resolves the error. If it does, contact the manufacturer of the program about a possible update.
</p>
<p><strong><br />
Resolving a corrupted NTFS volume problem:</strong> Run <strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> to detect and repair disk errors. You must restart the system before the disk scan begins on a system partition. If the hard disk is SCSI, check for problems between the SCSI
 controller and the disk.</p>
<p><br />
Finally, check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help pinpoint the device or driver that is causing the error. Disabling memory caching of the BIOS might also resolve it.</p>
<p>Remarks </p>
<p><br />
Typically, this address is in freed memory or is simply invalid.</p>
<p><br />
This cannot be protected by a <strong>try - except</strong> handler -- it can only be protected by a probe.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />

<br />
------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

            I promised to report back, so here's the report: I took your suggestion to post on Dell's forums and on NVidia's. Dell wins. The suggestion there was to remove the flea power and remove and reinstall the video drivers. The system has now been up and running
 for two weeks without issue, so I guess that solved it. I'm definitely bookmarking this thread though for all of the suggestions made here. Thanks again.<br />

            EasyPal will fail with the error if nothing is connected to the soundcard, so make sure your interface is connected before starting EasyPal.

<p>Your message is confusing. Do you mean that your whole task bar is not<br />
at the bottom of the screen, but is at the top, or left or right side<br />
of the screen?</p>
<p>If so, read on:</p>
<p>Although by default the task bar appears on the bottom of the screen,<br />
it can be on any of the sides you prefer it on. To move it from any<br />
side to another, simply click on an unused part of it and drag it<br />
where you want it. Be sure to click <strong>within</strong> it, not on the edge;<br />
clicking on the edge and dragging will resize it, not move it.</p>
<p>If it won't move, it may be locked. In that case, right click on it<br />
and uncheck "Lock the taskbar," then try again.</p>
<p>By the way, with today's wide-screen monitors, I prefer the task bar<br />
on the left or right side of the screen. I think that makes a better<br />
use of screen real estate than having it at the bottom.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I posted this is xbox support and have gotten no replies or anything, figures right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Anyways ill copy and paste it here for you maybe someone here can help me out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Alright hopefully someone here can help me with whats going on. Im pretty sure that the issue has something to do with my router but anyways here the last week or so I keep just randomly loosing
 my internet connection. But the strange thing is that it only goes out for a few seconds.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">This is a problem because when your playing a game online or online in general i will get signed out of xbox live or disconnected. If i wait about 15 seconds and try again i can sign right
 back in again. Though here lately i seem to be getting discnonnected every 5, 10, or 15 min so as you can imagine its very annoying basically I cannot do anything on xbox live.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The reason I say I believe its my router is because It also happens on my laptop when using the web ill be browsing or something and random ill lose internet connection but when i click view
 connections and connect to my router again it connects back up.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I dont know what is causing this to happen, i've tried resetting both my modem and my router many times now and it still continues to happen, any ideas on what the problem may be or how to
 fix it?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">I dont think that anyone is having the problem with the desktop computer which hooked directly now wirelessly so i dont think its an internet issue.</span></p>

<p>Do you have an access code for your service provider(this is separate from your router security)? If so, you will have to erase the connection on your X-box and reset everything(undo the modem on x-box) then restart your xbox with it plugged back in. Set
 up a new connection and you will get to the option for the service provider code. It's not as easy to check all codes without resetting. You can get intermittent connection when the IP access code is wrong, in fact, that is what you will get.</p>

<p>A simple solution is to just unplug your modem and&nbsp;router, wait a minute, and plug them back in. Once it boots up again, you should be fine. I had similar problems with our old modem and&nbsp;router at home, resetting it was something we did a fair bit, thanks
 to our bad router.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">No, unplugging my router and modem was the first thing I tried though it hasnt seemed to make a difference. I also switched the channels as well but still seem to be having this problem.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The strange thing about it is that like I said it happens on my laptop as well as my Xbox, and once it goes out about 4 or 5 times and after about 15 min of reconnecting eventually the connection will stay for a few hours at least
 then it will start going out. Im sure its just a router issue. If it presists i'll likely be looking into a new router.<br />

 is being monitored. The files on the C drive are abot 90&nbsp;MB in size of which PC Doctor is about 60 MB so there is 30 MB of files that seem to be hidden. There was a problem that occurred with the computer which interrupted it from working. I am using Windows
 XP home with SP3 wwhich was installed with updates. Do not have a disc with XP home and SP3 on it which can be used to reinstall the System Restore so what can be done to reslove this problem?

            It sounds as if you re-installed Windows in a non-standard way.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
What happened "awhile back"?<br />
<br />
What happened to interrupt the computer from working?<br />
<br />
What did you do in response to the two problems above?<br />
<br />
If you don't have a CD with XP Home, how did you re-install Windows?<br />
<br />
Have you ever installed a different version of Windows (e.g., Vista, Windows 7) on this computer?&nbsp; If so, is it still installed?<br />
<br />
If you open My Computer, how many drives show?&nbsp; Right click on each one, select Properties, and report what is shown for Used Space, Free Space, and Capacity.<br />
<br />
Open Disk Management (Start &gt; Run &gt; diskmgmt.msc &gt; OK).&nbsp; You should see something like this --&gt;

<br />
<ul>
<li>How many "volumes" are shown?</li><li>In the upper pane, do the sizes (capacity and free space) correspond to the information from "My Computer"?</li><li>In the lower pane, how many disks are shown?</li><li>In the lower pane, what is written in each box (using the image linked above, what I am looking for would correspond to:</li></ul>

            <p>Well after the unknown problem which I think was with windows the computer was still booting but was acting weird. So I thought if I did a restore the problem would be corrected, which to me was unknown. Actually I just remembered that it was a windows was
 not responding I think. The Windows did something to correct itself I think and no there was not any other Version installed by me. What I think happened was some files were uninstalled and may have updated this I really am not sure about. Except
</p>
<p>I do have a disc with XP home version 1.0 and 2 other discs with Applications and Drivers. The computer was purchased used with the operating system which was probably re-installed. Being that there was alot of Updates that came shortly after connecting
 to the internet. Question if you do not have Java installed and you use the computer or get updates will there be any problems because of no Java? I did install Java after it became evident it was not installed already.</p>
<p>The Harddisk information is the following:</p>
<p>Local Disk C: Used Space: 90.4 MB</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free Space: 9.51 MB</p>

            It sounds as if the CDs you have are those provided by a computer manufacturer to restore the system to its "fresh from the factory state" although its also possible that they can be used to do a "clean install" of XP.<br />
<br />
Please provide all of the following information:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>the make and model of the computer.</li><li>assuming that there is a "Genuine Microsoft" label somewhere on the computer, identify the version of Windows (e.g., Windows XP Home) on the label.&nbsp; Do
<u><b>NOT</b></u> post the 25-character license key</li><li>provide the identifying text on EACH of the CDs you have.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
For example, if you have a disk like <a href="http://www.pandgcomputers.com/product_images/q/405/mcenc5__20135_zoom.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
THIS</a>, you should say that it says<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reinstallation DVD<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows XP Media Center Version 2005 with Update Rollup 2<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only use this DVD to reinstall the operating system on a Dell PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For distribution only with a new Dell PC.<br />
<br />
If you have a disk like <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ygz7RLtS4do/TcPbkpTaJUI/AAAAAAAAAG4/UW6Sxkak100/s1600/Windows_XP_FULL_CD.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
THIS</a>, you should say that it says<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows XP Professional<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Version 2002<br />
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>From your description, it seems as if Windows was improperly installed on this computer.&nbsp; Unless you have made a typographical error, a 100 megabyte (100 MB) C partition seems very odd.&nbsp; And Windows normally is installed on C, not on H.&nbsp; It's almost as if
 Windows 7 was installed (which would account for the small 100 MB partition) and then someone reinstalled Windows XP, mistakenly not reformatting the entire drive.<br />
</p>
<p>Given that it is a used computer, my advice would be for you to copy all of your data (documents, images, pictures, etc) to external media and do a clean install of Windows.&nbsp; If you properly identify the disks you have, I can give you instructions how to
 do that.</p>
<p>If doing a reinstallation of Windows sounds like it's not your cup of tea (and there's no shame in admitting that), you should take your computer -- and the disks you have -- to a local independent computer professional (not a BigBoxStoreUSA or GeekSquad
 type of place) and ask to have Windows installed (and your data saved and reloaded).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
You didn't run JDiskReport to identify what was taking up the space on C and you didn't provide the Disk Management information I requested.&nbsp; That information is not so important if you are going to do a clean install, but it would be helpful.<br />

<p>This information in disk management shows Healthy</p>
<p>The disks are for a Gateway Profile 4 and the disk says it is for a Gateway Operating System&gt;Windows XP Home Edition. Near the center of the disk it says SWR OPC WIN XP PERS HE SRCD RO 5/02 which is to be used for reinstallation. The 2nd disk is for Gateway
 Applications which say SWR APP SYS VER5.9 DISK 1 R49 8/02 used to reinstall. The 3rd disk is for Gateway Drivers and it says SWR APC BT SYS VER 20.1 R151 8/02. I guess the dates of 5/02 8/02&nbsp; refer to a 2002 version.</p>
<p>I think the person I purchased to computer from said they only used it for doing&nbsp;personal finances so maybe they did a setup for that reason? I was suprised to see the system installed when I got the computer.</p>
<p>I really am not sure about that tool you suggested I can use to see what is on the C drive that is hidden. Well I installed the tool and it looks like there are Boot files that are not being shown. There are 4 files that refer to Boot/Fonts and 2 others
 1 that refers to memtest.exe and 1 that refers to bootmgr the rest refer to the PC Doctor program I installed from 1 of the disks. There is another part named Recycler and I guess maybe that is the recycling bin.</p>
<p>There is a&nbsp;sticker on the back&nbsp;which has the key and a sticker with the Designed for and Microsoft Logo Windows XP on the front. Should I have needed to register the computer as mine when I first got it?</p>

<h2>            Minecraft- Will not start game</h2>
                    
<p>I bought Minecraft for my son's xbox 360 and it worked for several weeks/months. Now when it starts it gets to the "preparing to save level" screen and just stays there. The game never loads. I tried deleting the game and saved files as well as clearing
 the cache. I then reloaded the game and the same thing happens. Not sure what is going on.</p>

            <p>Hey there Grningbear!<br /><br />I'm sorry to hear this is still giving you issues. Let's see what we can do to get things sorted for you.<br /><br /><strong>These steps look like they've already been done, but I wanted to make sure they were done in this order:</strong><br /><br /></p>
<ul>
<li>Move your minecraft saves to either a USB drive or Cloud Storage. That is just to protect it from being deleted accidentally.</li>
<li>Go to Settings, System, Storage, find Minecraft and delete it. While you're there, make sure you don't see any corrupt files (usually marked with a yellow exclamation mark) and delete them as well.</li>
<li>Next, delete your profile ONLY (do NOT delete profile and items, here's a guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete</a>).</li>
<li>Clear your system cache 3 times in a row (really, 3 times; here's a guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a>).</li>
<li>Restart your console.</li>
<li>Redownload your profile (use this guide again: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../profile-move-delete</a>).</li>
<li>Redownload Minecraft from your download history (here's the guide for that too: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/view-download-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../view-download-history</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Again, you might have already done many (or all) of those steps, but I just wanted to make sure they were done in that order. Sometimes finicky issues want things to be done just so. Also, you may need to perform all of those steps with your son's gamertag, if he's the one having issues with Minecraft.<br /><br /><strong>Which brings me to some follow up questions:</strong><br /><br /></p>
<ol>
<li>Are other profiles on his console able to access Minecraft without issues?</li>
<li>It sounded from your original post like there are multiple consoles available, but I could be misreading it. If there are multiple consoles available, however: If your son downloads Minecraft to a different console (using his profile's download history), is he able to access Minecraft without issues?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll work from there! ^_^</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer to the below article on how to perform a clean boot to know

    <title>How to set static IP address in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to set static IP address in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased several Win 10 machines recently and need them to keep the same IP addresses. I used to know how to set static IP addresses in Win 7, but cannot find the functionality in Win 10. What are the steps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>No, that absolutely is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it...it's in the IP4 properties of the network adapter.</p>
