<p>actually you did</p>
<p>when you PURCHASE any membership on the dashboard</p>
<p>there is a notice the same size as the purchase now button</p>
<p>"this membership will renew"</p>
<p>even if the autorenewal was off previously</p>
<p>it will turn on whenever you purchase a new dashboard membership (prepaid cards are not dashboard purchases as they are already purchased)</p>

    <title>Windows 10 update screwed my computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amir yihyie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update screwed my computer</h2>
                    <p>So a few days ago I was having these update messages and I decided to update, then at around the end of the update it crashed and now I can’t seem to get it to work. It shows a big blue screen that says Recovery your computer/device need recovery or something
 like that, with 3 options- Enter, F8 and F9&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both enter and F8 dont work, and F9, when clicked, makes the computer say “Please wait” for about 10 minutes, then sends me to my opening screen that I need to put in my computer password. Then it waits another 10 minutes, and shows me my desktop with a
 warning of something about my system files, and only has a recycle bin, with no icons on the desktop nor the taskbar, and i cant do anything at all. It shows there is no internet connection, although there clearly is, and then when i shut down the pc and reopen
 it it does the same thing again.</p>
<p>I have a windows 10 pc and I already had windows 10 perfectly fine before the update</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. Otherwise, you can resort to below

<h2>            Windows 10 100&#37; disk usage in Task Manager</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,<br />
i have dell laptop -&nbsp; inspiron 15 , 5000 series , OS is windows 10 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Recently i had a problem at the laptop:<br />
Disk utilization is quite constant at 100% even though no program runs parallel and there is no traffic between the hard disk and the external device.<br />
I searched in Google for solutions and found this issue quite common in Windows 10. I tried all the options from the solutions offered such as stop and disable : Windows Search,Superfetch and Background Intelligent Transfer Service<span>&nbsp;</span>without
 any success .<br />
<br />
I also tried to run a disk repair on Windows 10 and even "Reset to default" of the windows which means getting clean operating system - deleting all the files that I had and that did not help either.<br />
Still after booting the computer and during work the disk utilization is 100% and the computer is very very slow.<br />
Do you have a solution?<br />
Is the hard disk malformed and is this what causes windows to show 100% disk utilization ?</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

<p>
</p><p><span>Please provide</span><span> us with the below details for better clarity on the issue.</span></p>

<p><span><span>2.<span>
</span></span></span><span>Is the printer connected to the system using a wire or wirelessly?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To find out the reason, which might be causing the issue, run the Print troubleshooter on the system. The troubleshooter finds and fixes basic issues related to printing or scanning.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, try installing the latest drivers from the manufacturer website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go to the Printer manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers available for the device and then install it by following the instructions given in the website.

<h2>            Motorola VIP1225 Uverse Issues</h2>
                    
<p>Everything works except for changing channels. A four digit channel will sometimes only receive 2 or 3 of the 4 digits (for example 1501 may be 501, 151, 150 etc.) I have tried putting the Kinect sensor directly in front of the cable box with only slight
 improvement. Thus, I don't think and IR extender would help my scenario. Any ideas would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey Mello,</p>
<p>Putting the Kinect directly in front of the STB can sometimes cause the Kinect to overwhelm the STB's IR receiver.</p>
<p>Could you try to do the same thing with the STB held about 5 feet away from the STB, pointing at it?</p>
<p>Also, could try going to TV &amp; OneGuide settings -&gt; Troubleshooting and changing the IR speed?</p>
<p>In another thread, users said they fixed the issue by getting a newer VIP box from their provider.</p>

<p>I had a similar issue. &nbsp;One HUGE problem is that you cannot use the DVR features though the Xbox One, which is kind of stupid IMO.
</p>
<p>I have a Logitech Harmony 900, and found that I have to set it up, even with the pass through, to use the DVR. &nbsp;Even after doing it I had the same problems, either going through the Xbox guide or switching to use the PVR device it wouldn't read all numbers.</p>
<p>Turns out it was the Kinect. &nbsp;Turned it off in settings, now everything works great. &nbsp;I will only be turning it on when needed now.

            I had this issue as well. sfc /scannow is no good if you can't open command prompt as admin. I was able to resolve by starting in Safe Mode. Once there I completely uninstalled my AV (Symantec). Upon restart, I was able to use admin credentials normally.

<h2>            Mature 17 Year Old Looking For A Clan</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking to join a clan that preferably plays most days on a variety games, these games mostly being Black Ops, Modern Warfare, &amp; Fifa. I have played Xbox for around three years, and played Call of Duty &amp; Fifa throughout those years, so I have experience
 on the games. I also have a positive k/d on Call of Duty &amp; a good win ratio on Fifa.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am looking for a group of lads preferably, who are on throughout the week who I can have a laugh with but also take things seriously. It'd be nice to speak to new people and have a laugh with a different bunch of people.<br />
<br />
It'd probably be easier if you added me or messaged me on Xbox, as I do not always check the forums.<br />
<br />
PS. If your in the same position as me and are looking for new people to play with, add me and we can potentially start our own thing up.</p>

<p>You could always get another company to install the battery... Microsoft doesn't replace batteries, they replace the entire unit.&nbsp; This is why you always get 3 years Microsoft complete extended warranty and I personally purchase the high end Surfaces (i7-16gb-512gb)
 so if I have an issue out of warranty the trade in replacement cost is reasonable for a 3000$Canadian device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not Microsofts fault that you didn't do the research, I knew about the fact that they only replace the entire unit for any issue out of warranty at a reduced price.&nbsp; I also knew about Microsoft Complete 3 year Accidental Damage Warranty...&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also Batteries don't last forever, they have a limited amount of recharge cycles, you could of easily used all the cycles especially if it needs to be recharged more than once a day, even once a day for 3 years can deplete a battery because they have a life
 of 1000-3000 recharges. User Error could also be the issue, depleting a battery to 0% many times will also do damage to the battery and cause premature failure, I don't deplete below 30% unless I really need to use my Surface. Leaving a battery charged at
 100% for weeks at a time can also damage a battery, batteries should be stored at 50% for long periods of time, you should also fully charge/deplete to 5-10% once every few months if you constantly have the surface plugged in at 100% or during long term storage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just do some more research on who replaces batteries for Surface devices, small mom and pop shops do these type of repair, shouldn't cost more than 300$.</p>
<p>

            <div>Gloria,</div>
<div>Microsoft replaces with refurbs, they don't replace batteries and return the</div>
<div>original unit. They'd been charging $450 US and recently have been replacing</div>
<div>SP3's with refurb SP4's. Is this 600 dollars US? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you read iFixit.com, you will see that trying to open the Surface usually</div>
<div>bricks it - they aren't designed to be opened. It is unlikely any shop will be</div>
<div>able to replace the battery. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You also might want to look around yourself for a certified refurb SP3. Or SP4.</div>
<div>Be very careful who you purchase from and make sure they have a no questions</div>

    <title>&#34;Default gateway is not available.&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruby1110  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Default gateway is not available.&#34;</h2>
                    For the last few months my computer has randomly lost its connection to the wifi network it was currently using. &nbsp;Often enough, it will work for anywhere between 20 minutes and 4 hours, and then suddenly break down. &nbsp;When I run a network diagnostic, I
 am told that "the default gateway is not available."
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This problem carries across various Wifi networks in different living situations, and other people using the connection never experience these problems, so I know that this is a problem with my computer and not the network itself.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have followed the advice given on other questions regarding updating drivers (I updated them this afternoon with no luck--I've had gateway errors 3 times since then). &nbsp;What else can I do to fix this problem?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it helps narrow down the cause, I am using Norton Antivirus and I double-checked my Windows updates today.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you very much for your help!</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I have followed the advice both in the link provided and am still experiencing issues.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also changed my IP settings based on the advice that page linked to (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-networking/windows-8-ethernet-connection-randomly-dies-error/41699057-a735-42fb-a01f-1976d68468fa). &nbsp;I immediately lost all
 internet access. &nbsp;When running diagnostics, I get a "DHCP not set for Wifi" error. &nbsp;I only got it back when I reset all of my Internet settings.</div>
<div><br />
<div>What else can I do to fix this problem?</div>

<div><br />
<div>When I right-click my network, I cannot find a Wireless Networks Tab. &nbsp;While rooting around for similar input, I also couldn't find a preferred networks or authetification area. &nbsp;Is there a different way to access this information in Windows 8.1?</div>

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>I am sorry for all of these (probably extremely basic) questions. &nbsp;I am not very computer literate and the instructions you're giving me aren't always lining up with what I'm seeing. &nbsp;I really have no idea what I'm doing, so please be patient and specific
 with me.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My network was already set as a WPA2, so I didn't do anything about that. &nbsp;Under the Advanced Settings in the Security Tab, I got a 802.11 settings tab. &nbsp;I checked "Enable Federal Processing Standards (FIPS) compliance for this network," which was previously
 blank. &nbsp;Is this what you meant by disabling the IEEE 802.1X authentification?</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is indeed what you've suggested (please confirm that this is the case. &nbsp;Again, I'm not sure about what I'm doing), then the number of times I've gotten a default gateway error has decreased. &nbsp;However, the problem still remains. &nbsp;What else might
 be the cause?</div>

<p>
</p><p>I have followed the Rene Driessen's instructions in the provided link, but there has been no change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My two drivers are not from Broadcom, but are listed as "Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2200 (Intel)" and "Intel(R) Centrino(R) Wireless-N 2200 (Microsoft)". &nbsp;I'm not sure if this would change the result in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried downloading the Broadcom adapter found in the MB2277's link, but I couldn't install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer came with Windows 8 pre-installed, so I don't have any other drivers to fall back on. &nbsp;What should I do?</p>

    <title>What are the real advantages on being a Windows 10 early adopter&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sauloottoni  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the real advantages on being a Windows 10 early adopter&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Throughout the years, I've always had this problem: a huge fraction of my programs and applications would stop working after upgrading my Windows to the next version, even at incremental upgrade scenarios, due to the incompatibility between the new version
 of the Windows Kernel and the software I used. Some software, like antenna simulators and circuit design suites have been rendered useless when migrating from 98 to XP, forcing me to get a new version. And then, once again on XP to 7, and once more from 7
 to 8.x, which has given me lots of headaches over the time, because usually the newer version of the softwares, when there's one, is absurdly expensive or hard to find, and are usually Windows exclusive, meaning that I have no version of these for my Linux
 machines (not even Ubuntu, that gets working packages from most other Linux distributions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, from all that, is there any advantage for me, an engineering student, to upgrade my 8.1 machine to 10 as soon as it is released? How different is the system's kernel? Will I be at risk of losing my graduation specific applications once more? And what
 about my games?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>P.S.: the word 'reserve' on telling Microsoft I am going to update my computar ASAP is completely misleading, and most of the users seem to get it as 'there will be a queue, you are a special snowflake that can reserve its place in the sun to melt before
 the others'. Since it's a digital upgrade and the only meaning I see for this 'reservation' is to tell Microsoft the size of the resources you are going to have to allocate for the first batch of upgrades, I'd largely recommend rephrasing the pre-updater,
 to avoid such misleading.</p>

<p>Agreed. Considering the Game is now owned by Microsoft, they should take some interest in making it work on their new platforms. I just installed Win 10 and like playing Mechwarrior 4 big time. This is the only game I have in my games list (22) that I can't
 coerce into working on WIN 10. And this is a great classic game that has superior gaming attributes. Come on people. SIGN up and comment to make a difference.<br />

            Before MechWarrior Online was released an attempt was to reboot the game, but instead Microsoft just wanted the game for there own systems, and the reboot went on to became MechWarrior online PVP

            Two of my favorite games were MechWarrior Vengeance and MechWarrior Mercenaries. I would very much like to play those again in Windows 10. I was actually surprised to no end that there seemed to be no way to make it work. I want these games back.

            <p>Such rewarding gameplay without the extreme hardware demands of more modern games suggest that an emulator of some kind might work..... especially if an older DOS kernel is included.</p>
<p>I had it working on WIN7, and messed around a bit with some add-ons. But you are right, I'd pay $$$ for an out of the box or downloadable solution or fix .... or an entirely new rework on WIN 10.&nbsp; U.S. Military has real Mechwarrior stuff now and is improving
 the tech. This game was deja' vu and years ahead of its time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stomping around the Battleground in a custom built Mechwarrior is going to be 'actual' very soon. Just sayin'.</p>

            <p>I am on board with this 100%.&nbsp; I have been watching and waiting for mechwarrior 5 for many years.&nbsp; They could at least revive mech 4 by putting it on steam with a stats recording server like they used to have.&nbsp; With steam they could make and sell DLC for
 the game.&nbsp; That would be nice, but really we want mech 5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even SSI has re-released all of its gold box games on GOG.com that have been abandonware for decades!!&nbsp; And they are selling like hotcakes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How long microsoft are you going to let this opportunity go?&nbsp;&nbsp; The gaming community is ripe for a mechwarrior 5 standalone game with multiplayer just like mech 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; I know it would be a huge hit if you do it right.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its time.&nbsp; Please make the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are counting on PGI to make MW5... dont.&nbsp;&nbsp; They are a horrible developer who care nothing for the franchise or its fans.&nbsp; Their game, "Mechwarrior Online" has ruined the franchise.&nbsp; Dont let them do any more damage please.</p>

<p>MechWarrior 3 and 4 will run on win 10 but you got to mess about a bit. Its been a while since i did this and can't remember all i did but the compatability settings alone wont do it.</p>
<p>For Mech 3 do a full install.Get and install relevant patches. Now here is what i did. Install a cd emulator (like "WinCDEmu". its free) . Make an ISO image of MW3 cd and mount it. No need to use the cd after making the iso.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MW4 was a pain to get working but you can download a modified version for free here and follow their instructions</p>
<p>https://www.catalystgamelabs.com/2009/07/09/mekteknet-honored-to-distribute-mechwarrior-4/</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW you can get Assassin Creed for free. There is a link on this page. </p>
<p>http://blog.ubi.com/get-two-ubisoft-pc-classics-free-december/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But be warned its a 25gb download and you got until the 18th to get it free.</p>

    <title>HDD got wet, what materials can I use to clean disc&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennywally  say:</h3>
<h2>            HDD got wet, what materials can I use to clean disc&#63;</h2>
                    This is really bad.<br />
<br />
A sewage backup ruined my PC, I'm trying to rescue data on the disc.<br />
<br />
I already lost a backup hdd that was attached to same puter.<br />
<br />
HDD was on it's left side submerged in sewage for about an hour<br />
<br />
it was allowed to dry completely.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking some water must have gotten inside because the external that I expected to survive
<br />
<br />
eventually died out. I figured it was due to a coating on the disc. I also figue the main HDD also has a dried coating on the surface, and if I can wash it off<br />
<br />
the read/write arm won't get clogged up like the other external did, at least long enuf for me to extract a g or 2 of info b4 it craps out for good.<br />
<br />
So I have to try but I need to know what to use.<br />
<br />
I've worked in a clean room environment b4, so I'm familiar with steps to keep things dust free, I even seen a clean box made from a clear rubbermade tub<br />
<br />
with gloves taped to it etc. I'm familiar with all kinds of chemicals from acetone to MEK to methylene chloride.<br />
<br />
So I need accurate info here.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure I'll need to wet the disc, but with what and what method/materials to wipe or brush with etc<br />
<br />
I think it's a seagate 320 sata [ it's not here ]

            kennywally, thank you for posting to the Microsoft forums.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately reverse engineering of hard drives&nbsp;is outside the scope of support that this forum can offer you. I would recommend contacting the drive manufacturer for further details.<br />
<br />
The only knowledge I can give you is that most data recovery centers actually keep identical drives/parts on-hand to attempt recovery. Basically they keep all the extra parts so that when this type of thing happens they simply clean off the platter and replace
 it into an identical drive and attempt recovery. As a home technician the main obstacle you may encounter during this process will be the cleansing of the actual platter/s. I am unsure of what chemicals they use but I do know it does not affect the magnetism
 stored on the platter, they also clean it to the point where it has a mirror-like finish again as water spots can also affect data recovery. So in short data recovery on a recently submerged hard drive will be very difficult especially for environments that
 do not possess the ability to reduce static and dust.<br />
<br />
With that being said if you choose to attempt to find an identical drive and swap parts out you certainly void all warranties of both units, and 10 times out of 10 the manufacturer will not cover this under their warranty, nor will Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if we can be of further assistance with any Windows Vista related issues.<br />
regards,<br />

            I would suggest Mineral Oil as many 'fish tank' computer cases use it as a cooling/case design method. Basically, the computer parts (motherboard, harddrives, psu) are all submerged in Mineral Oil to give the computer a nice appearance.<br />
<br />
You could then use a soft cloth (like the kind designed for brittle LCD screens) and try to gently break apart the muck. It may or may not work but its a shot.<br />
<br />
Rubbing Alcohol works for cleaning motherboards so I would assume harddrives as well but I suggest trying the above first.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens. I tried searching the internet for possible methods and came up with nothing.

            I never thought of mineral oil.[ mineral oil is also used to remove scuffs or grease pencil on photographs ]
<br />
<br />
And yeah, a search came up with nothing.<br />
<br />
I was giving it more thought, and the optics place I worked for had sensitive multcoated lenses that would get dust n dirt from the field, so they'd
<br />
<br />
first blow any loose dirt off, then hydrate the lens with an optical cleaning solution to float the dirt so it won't scratch the surface,
<br />
<br />
then slowly remove the dirt with alcohol n q tips, and reapply as necessary, then up it to acetone. I'd say the mirror surfaces were fairly close<br />
<br />
to how clean a platter must be like in order to do it's job. It just took me a while to resurrect the 20 yr old memories....<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try it on the external first, since it is already toasted I have nothing to lose and everything to gain!<br />
<br />
If I luck out and get it to spin and cough up a cpl G of data, all the better. But truthfully I suspect grime got ground into the platter
<br />
<br />
and there should be a scratched up surface from that so I don't expect much,<br />
<br />
but if I can get it to light up and spin, I'm halfway home!!!!<br />
<br />
At least it is worth a shot. <br />
<br />
This will take me a while to gather materials, I'll post the results<br />

            Definitely let us know! This would probably be the first open-to-the-public physical data recovery. I myself would like to know if those materials work.

            Kennywally, thank you for posting back to the Microsoft forums.<br />
<br />
I would advise against using mineral oil as you are simply trying to make sure there are no water spots on the platter, you are not trying to shine it or lubricate it. Scratches should not be an issue unless you overheard a clicking or banging noise coming
 from within the drive when you attempted using it. I have seen many a drive that has been flooded with water and usually they did not show signs of physical damage as the drive returns to what is called the "Landing Zone" (edge of platter) when the drive encounters
 issues.<br />
<br />
Mineral oil if used would then need to be cleaned off as it is oil based, my suggestion is to first start with the most unabrasive solvents. Alcohol, and maybe Methyl-Ethyl-Ketone, but start with alcohol first as it is the most unabrasive and will not leave
 residue behind on the platter. Keep in mind the lens spray you mention will usually be a mix of isopropyl alcohol (not to be confused with isoproponol) which is two parts, alcohol and oil used to both clean and fill tiny scratches in glass lenses. Which in
 turn still leaves residue behind, as do all other solvents except rubbing alcohol and MEK, MEK is pretty strong however we used to use it to remove the protective film from computer motherboards prior to repair. Hence my recommendation to first start with
 alcohol.<br />
<br />
Use a lense cloth, or microfiber keeping them slightly damp to avoid static, but not too damp to where they will cause streaking. (alcohol &amp; MEK will not streak)<br />
<br />
Now assuming you do clean the platter correctly you will still have the issue of other parts being damaged from water. Those of note would be the actuator arm, the electric motor, and the actuator solenoid. The electric motor that spins the platter and the
 solenoid are both comprised of electric coils wound around a set of magnets held in place by floating bearings secured by tiny circlips. You would have to clean both the electric motor and the solenoid out completely, as water can wash away the lithium based
 grease on the insides causing the "floating" characteristics of the bearings to disappear, once this happens tolerances change and drive characteristics do as well. And while it is true that the hard drive can compensate for small tolerances it cannot compensate
 for large differences due to a platter spinning differently. As for the actuator arm if it touched the platter then it may have damaged itself and the platter. In a perfect situation the actuator arm never actually touches the platter, it merely floats above
 it.<br />
<br />
This is why I recommend just cleaning the platter and finding an identical drive to place the platter in as overhauling this drive will be a serious undertaking.<br />
<br />
Good luck with this process<br />

Aaron Barth

<br />
I wasn't sure how to go about using the mineral oil other than to try to shine up the surface if it had gotten<br />
<br />
dulled from the cleaning. I knew it would have to be removed, but hadn't really gotten that far yet with
<br />
<br />
figuring out the process.<br />
<br />
I have most materials to take it apart and to have a look to inspect the surface for evidence that the seal was in fact compromised<br />
<br />
and the read write device did in fact get clogged up. I'll post a verification of that asap...24-48 hrs I hope.<br />
<br />
kw<br />
<br />
p.s.<br />
<br />
I do have a spare 40g drive that I took out of my sony, so that could be the ticket as far as avoiding all the drama with the electrical end of it.<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping they are compatible. But I can always troll best buy computer repair and do some begging.<br />
<br />
Am I dreaming to think a 40g small external is a single platter? [ I may find out today ]

10 times out of 10, the outer seal that lines the top cover of the hard drive is never the entry point for water to enter the drive. It is always the breather hole.<br />
<br />
If you have a 40GB that has the same physical likeness as the drive in question then you could probably use that and replace both the platter and the circuit board on the underside. I myself have saved a couple drives which have had faulty circuit boards on
 the bottoms. I learned that no harm came from using the incorrect board with a different sized platter, though the drive did not operate correctly. (and Windows did not even try to mount it)<br />
<br />
Do not worry about alcohol dulling the surface, that will not happen, besides most consumer rubbing alcohol is actually 70% alcohol and 30% water. The reason why I advise against mineral oil is because you want to NOT handle the platter as much as possible,
 shining it then cleaning it then buffing it might compromise things. Start with the simplest most non-volatile approach first.<br />
1.Disassemble<br />
2.Clean platter with alcohol, make sure it looks pretty<br />
3.Replace in drive and reassemble<br />
4.Test<br />
<br />
Then proceed with further steps if previous steps failed.<br />
<br />
Hard drive manufacturers usually make their products in such a universal way that housings, circuit board pin-outs, and rotation speed usually remain the same across different drives. (same manufacturer of course) Of course platter densities change and so do
 the circuit boards. Once you get it open I am sure you will be disappointed with how much water actually got in there, as it wont be much at all, (mostly condensation and tiny droplets) just heed my advise and start with the most unabrasive solvents first
 and remove those water spots. If this becomes an ongoing project for you and you need to store the platter store it back in the drive itself. (Some data recovery places store customer platters in a lead-composite based case.)<br />
<br />
And no your not dreaming, a lot of the Maxtor 40GB slim hard drives had single platters.<br />
<br />
Good luck sir.<br />

            Seagate, in their infinite wisdom, designed rounded corner five point screw heads!!!! wtf?<br />
<br />
Used an easy out to remove them, but upon opening the case, which is molded metal<br />
<br />
that holds a soft rubber cage for the hdd to float in, that was a nice job, hated the screws tho.<br />
<br />
Now the weird part, there's absolutely NO MUCK RESIDUE whatsoever inside the case!!!<br />
<br />
It doesn't appear to have gotten soaked as I suspected, but no matter, the HDD for my desktop<br />
<br />
was definitely under sewage water for about an hour. <br />
<br />
But anyways, this drive just wont spin! The was some muck on the connector that was plugged into the<br />
<br />
desktop so I kinda assumed it got soaked. The thing did work for a few minutes when I first plugged it<br />
<br />
in but then it made some noises, then the blue light went out and the system it was plugged into no longer seen the drive.<br />
<br />
So either way, something happened to it...I'm considering other options here since muck does not appear to be the culprit<br />
<br />
there's no sense going in to test my methods on this one. For those who are curious, I think I'll pull it from it's current adapter,
<br />
<br />
and connect it to a different adapter, maybe that'll do it.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
So I'm gonna focus on the one I KNOW for sure was under water and in muck, cuz I pulled it out and the casing was covered in muck<br />
<br />
and it is cleaned off now.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
New TARGET HDD is a sata SEAGATE 320g<br />
<br />
Ok, just 2 min ago I got the top off the HDD and guess what?! NO MUCK !!!!<br />
<br />
But there was dust!!! I think the dust came from the case screws that had lots of white dusty corrosion on them all<br />
<br />
except the one under the label, it was pristine.<br />
<br />
So I'm not sure if I should pull the disc cuz there are two, or just get the dust off the best I can<br />
<br />
reassemble and plug it into another working PC and see if I can extract the data.<br />
<br />
If it's a go, data extraction is first, then curiosity about how long this mother will continue to spin,
<br />
<br />
provided it spins at all, if not, then a case change, and for this big one I have no spare case,
<br />
<br />
so I'll have to go begging. But first things first. Remove dust, reassemble, test unit, then go from there...<br />
<br />
I don't know where to look for the breather hole so I didn't see it and apparently it was not breached!!!!<br />
<br />
I won't get to this next step tonight.<br />
<br />
I'm gonna use 91% alcohol with q-tips to remove the dust, but I need to configure a clean box out of
<br />
<br />
rubbermaid storage container , with holes cut for hands and gloves taped to container. It'll take a little time to do all that.<br />
<br />
I'll use those purple surgery gloves, and tape them to kitchen gloves with the hand part cut out and replaced with the surgical gloves<br />
<br />
cuz I want to be able to feel how much pressure I'm applying to the platter.<br />
<br />
later<br />
<br />
kw<br />
<br />
update on 40g, swapped adapters and no go. The unit was heating up , it starting to get pretty warm I just pulled the cord,
<br />
<br />
it must need another case, probably electronics got cooked, the desktop and external were both plugged in and on, when the back up hit...<br />

I told you, you would be disappointed by what you would see in the actual hard drive. If there is no visible damage from water/water spots on the platter then the platter is okay, and should be handled as least as possible.
<br />
<br />
As for the dust, just attempt to blow it off the platter, if the dust seems stuck to the platter then you may attempt cleaning with alcohol. The same rules apply to cleaning a platter as they do when cleaning a CD, straight lines from center to edge of disc.<br />
<br />
It looks like its time to start swapping parts around, the main parts to tbe concerned about are: platter, circuit board, rest of unit. You can mix and match parts based on work needed and ease of interchangeability. Meaning if the inside looked okay and you
 have an identical drive then leave the platter in-place and start by swapping the circuit board, if it still fails then remove the platter and then transfer platter and known-good circuit board back to known-good case/unit. I cannot stress how important it
 is to start with the easiest most non-invasive&nbsp;of things first and then work your way to the more involved processes.<br />
<br />
I should also tell you I have run a hard drive before without its top cover just so I could extract data from a customers PC. Her hard drive showed signs of the "click-of-death" and would get worse as the unit heated up. An old trick is to place the drive in
 the freezer then attempt data recovery. I froze her hard drive then quickly removed the top cover as I loosened the screws the day prior. I then recovered all of her data, though it wasnt much just ~20GB.<br />
<br />
For the 40GB what do you mean by adapters? Are you refering to the circuit board? The external enclosure?<br />
<br />
Good luck.<br />

</p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>

<p>Hey Lauser,</p>

<p>Hey there Lauser!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing this issue. </p>
<p>I would suggest since the removal and redownload of your profile didn't work , maybe roll back the updates for your console as outlined in
<strong>Solution 7</strong> of our page entitled <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console/system-update-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Troubleshoot problems with an update to your Xbox 360 console</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If and when you can, review that page, try those steps and let us know if that helped resolve the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
