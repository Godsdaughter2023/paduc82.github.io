<h2>            How to restore large icons, medium icons, and classic icons options within the view menu in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I was wondering if anyone could help solve this issue of mine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Problem:</div>
<div>Every time I right click the desktop, and select "view", the options for the predefined icon sizes (Large Icons / Medium Icons / Classic Icons) are missing from the list; however, other options such as "Auto Arrange Icons", "Align Icons to Grid", "Show
 Desktop Icons", and "Show Desktop Gadgets" are accessible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i><u>I'm wondering how can I restore the predefined icon sizes options in the "view" menu without a "fresh" installation of Windows 7?</u></i></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please note that the&nbsp;re sizing&nbsp;of my desktop icons is still functioning. I can use the "CRTL + Scrolling" to change the size and I could go to "Personalize" -&gt; "Window Colour" -&gt; "Advance Appearance Settings..." to adjust the size of icon&nbsp;numerically&nbsp;as
 well. I just find this process to be&nbsp;tedious.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background:</div>
<div>I just recently downgraded my pre-installed Windows 8 Home (x64) laptop to Windows 7 Pro (x64). It's been a few weeks and I just noticed the options were missing from the view menu. I contacted Dell for technical support; however, I was informed that they
 do not provide technical support for downgrades unless the laptop was pre-installed with Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp;Furthermore, I was directed to this forum as a potential way of solving my issue. I tried googling with several terms but with no success.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only programs that are installed are as follow:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Software --- Chrome | Internet Explorer | Microsoft Office 2013 | Adobe Master Collection Collection CS6 | Autodesk 3DS Max 2012 | Autodesk AutoCAD 2012 | Dropbox | iTunes | VLC | Windows Media Player | Windows Security Essential</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Utility Software --- Intel HD, Graphics | Intel WiDi, Intel Rapid Storage Technology | KillerNetManager (Wifi/Blue Management Program) | Dell Audio | Dell Touchpad (Synatics Touch Pad) | Dell Quickset (Extension options for Windows Mobility by Dell)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Hardware Specification --- Dell XPS 15 | i7-3632QM @ 2.20 Ghz, 12 gig RAM | NVIDIA GeForce GT 640m (2 gig RAM) | Intel HD Graphics 4000</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you for reading. Any information, insights, and possible solutions, would be greatly appreciated.</div>
</div>
<div><br />

            <p>Hi Vijin,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried&nbsp;individually&nbsp;uninstalling the software off my computer to see if it brings back the options but no success. I am 100% sure a "Fresh" installation of Windows 7 would do the trick but I don't want to resort to that method for every time the problem
 occurs.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried both recommended methods you have proposed. According to the System File Checker, it did not find any "integrity violations". Please refer to image link:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://postimg.org/image/7kduxbf9n/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://postimg.org/image/7kduxbf9n/</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With regards to method 2, I was able to select the predefined icon size options within the new user account's view menu. Unfortunately, replacing the corrupted user profile by copying the new user profile's "protected files" in the "My Documents" did not
 fix the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, I decided to do something else and it kind of solved my problem...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><font><span>I decided to create a brand new administrative account. I removed the corrupted user profile account and presto, all view's options were available within the new administrative account.&nbsp;</span></font><span>Unfortunately other&nbsp;problems&nbsp;surfaced
 where the old one did not have.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><font><span>For example, adjusting the visual effects in Aero, didn't work properly. Checking off the options&nbsp;</span></font><span>"show drop shadows under windows" and "use drop shadows for icons labels on desktop" had no effect. Even after logging off,&nbsp;logging
 in, rebooting, and shutting down, didn't do the trick. &nbsp;I accessed the options via&nbsp;</span><span>right clicked "My Computer" -&gt; select "Properties" -&gt; "Advanced System Settings" -&gt; under "Advanced" tab -&gt; under "Performance" category -&gt; "Settings" -&gt; "Performance
 Options" -&gt; "Visual Effects", from here I checked off the two options.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>In addition, another problem surfaced when right clicking the taskbar. The option to check off "small icons" is no longer&nbsp;available.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I created a guest user account, and a standard account, and these options work accordingly. Problems seem to occur within the administrative accounts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Any suggestion?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>

    <title>Adding XBox Live to a Child Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattsainsbury  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adding XBox Live to a Child Account</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a bit of a newbie to XBox.&nbsp; We recently got an XBox One for my kids and I'm having difficulty adding XBox Live to their accounts.&nbsp; I went into settings and have it set to ask a parent, but when I try to purchase on their child account it says "You need
 a Parent to Buy this"&nbsp; "we can't send a request".&nbsp; Isn't it supposed to send a request for me to approve the purchase.&nbsp; I can't seem to figure out how to purchase and apply to my child's account.</p>
<p>Please let me know if I'm possibly missing a step or having something incorrectly set up in my settings.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi, if you have given a gift card to put money into the child account, this can not be used to purchase Xbox Live.

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like the child might not be in your family on Xbox. You can check by signing into your account in xbox.com clicking your profile pic and clicking account &gt; Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your child is added there is a hang up and cant request for some reason. It doesnt happen all the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should be able to raise the privacy on his account a little just enough so you can buy it on his account and not need permission. And change it back to where he does. I have the same issue with my daughter account from time to time doing the same issue.
 That's my only work around.&nbsp;</p>

            You can add funds to there account too and have them buy Xbox Live that way. They won't be eligible for any promotional things happening though since a credit card is required

<p>An easier solution would be to add Xbox Live Gold to your parent account and then set your Xbox One as your "Home" Xbox in the console settings.&nbsp; This will allow anyone to use it all the benefits of Gold.&nbsp; So all kids would have the ability to play online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you have more than one Xbox in your house then it just depends on who is using them.&nbsp; For example, I have an Xbox in my office and use to have one upstairs for my kids.&nbsp; I had Xbox Live Gold and would set the upstairs system is my "Home Xbox" so my
 kids could use it all they want.&nbsp; Then since Gold attaches to your gamertag and the home system, I could still play on my office xbox and even play games with them.&nbsp; No one else could use my office xbox though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have two kids and two xbox systems.&nbsp; Then buy gold for one kid and have them log into the second system and set it as their "Home Xbox" and now both kids enjoy Gold off one purchase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same works for Game Pass and Digital Games, they all come with a license for one gamertag and then a second license for that gamertag's Home Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Elsie,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p><br />
Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p><br />
1) Are you using Skype app for Windows 8 on the computer?<br />
2) If yes, have you added your Skype or Microsoft account on Skype app?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time you start Skype for Windows 8, you can simply sign in with the same Microsoft account you used to download the Skype app from Windows Store.</p>
<p><br />
You’ll also have the chance to merge your Skype and Microsoft accounts. This will allow you to chat with your Messenger buddies from Skype and enjoy the benefit of having a single sign-in for a variety of Microsoft services and products.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are using Skype app, here’s how you can sign in to the Skype app on Windows 8:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“How do I sign in to Skype for Windows 8 with my Microsoft account?”</strong></p>
<strong>

</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also refer to the link to add the contacts on Skype app:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>“Adding contacts (Windows 8)”</strong></p>

            If you don't have Skype for Windows 8 (new interface) but Skype for desktop (regular desktop program on Windows 8), just open the main skype window, under the "skype" menu click "sign out" and then sign in again using you credentials. Don't forget to merge
 Skype and Microsoft accounts if you want all of your contacts together, as <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1001660b-b2be-411b-8b73-64417032a1ee">

<h2>            Error 0x80048051</h2>
                    
<p><span>I have gotten this error code before (0x80048051), and last time i did a hard reset and reset my router and it seemed to fix the problem.. However today, this did not fix the problem. I can not sign into any profiles on my Xbox One right now. In fact
 I just turned my console back on and I only see the HOME screen (the one with the big window, with the 5 recent windows underneath it), but to the right it is completely black. It doesn't even have the option to connect to Xbox Live or the internet... It is
 just black. As of right now the only thing I can do (since none of the apps open either) is watch tv through my xbox one).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Also, I am able to sign into my hotmail/outlook account and view my emails, but can't sign in on my Xbox One.... I just get the spinning circle, then it goes back to the sign in screen for a quick second, then it goes back to the circle, then displays the
 error message. Haven't been able to sign in all day. I have internet connection.
</p>
<p>UPDATE: I did another hard reset and the black screen has disappeared, and i know see the store, and games and apps and that stuff.. HOWEVER, I still cannot sign into my profile.

<p>Hey there.</p>
<p>The suggested solution for that error code is to hard reset your router/modem (unplug, wait 5 minutes, plug back in) and restart your console. &nbsp;If that doesn't work, it's suggested you contact support for further assistance -

<h2>            VBA.Shell runing reg.exe will always redirect to SysWOW64 version</h2>
                    I'm running Access 2010 x32 on Win7 x64 and I'm unable to run desired version of reg.exe&nbsp;
<div>When I run it from Windows (command prompt) it does expected (I use it to copy keys from HKLM\Software\MySoft section to HKCU). However, when I try to run it from VBA by using Shell function it will always redirect to reg.exe in SysWOW64, which will in
 turn copy wrong keys from registry (from redirected WOW6432Node). Tried running it with or without cmd.exe shell, all same. Even when explicitly referencing C:\Windows\System32\reg.exe makes no difference.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Would anyone know how to trick VBA and Shell function to run reg.exe as if it was run from command prompt?</div>

            <p>Hey!</p>
<p>xThe Yeti 36x&nbsp;here looking for devoted gamers to join Shadow Company.&nbsp;&nbsp;Shadow Company is a mature community that has been around since 2008.&nbsp;&nbsp;We enjoy having fun playing&nbsp;games with like-minded people, while staying competitive in game.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this sounds like something you have been looking for we would invite you to join our ranks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Minimum Requirements:</p>
<ul><li>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must be Mature</li><li>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have a Microphone</li><li>·&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Must be 18yo or older</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Must be able to attend at least 1 practice a week</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shadow Company supports both Playstation 4 and Xbox One with the following titles:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Battlefield 1</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call of Duty Series</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Destiny 2</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a small idea of how Shadow Company operates:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Military Based System: We conduct practices with a squad that is led by a (SL) Squad Leader and a (SA) Squad Assistant.&nbsp;&nbsp;During practice, you get to work close with your squad members to learn Map Callouts and tactics that will help with alerting your squad to the location of enemies and/or objective targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, we don’t focus on KDR (Kill/Death Ratio) and SPM (Score Per Minute) as our goal is to work together as a community to help everyone become better in game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Earn Medals/Ribbons/Awards: No matter what game you play from the list above, you are able to earn special awards, medals, and ribbons! These awards are achievements that are completed by progressing as a team and/or completing skilled achievements in game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Family Oriented: All of us here at Shadow Company are family.&nbsp;&nbsp;We realize that real life issues do happen and that is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;You will not be penalized for not showing up to practice as long as you let the Squad Leader know that you will need to step away.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a family, we will always support out members that need to address issues outside of the gaming world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is xThe Yeti 36x, and feel free to PM me stating that you are interested and I will walk through getting started. &nbsp;If you are interested in playing&nbsp;just message me and I will set up a date where you can join in a practice with my squad and give you a chance to see what Shadow Company has to offer!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If interested in signing up please visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.theschq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.theschq.com</a>, and be sure to let them know that xThe Yeti 36x sent you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you and see you in game!</p><p><br /></p><p>P.S. We have a lot of older guys that run with us!</p>

I'm sure that many people would love to be friends with you. </p><p><br /></p><p>Why not set up your own clan? You could perhaps set up an active group that could play on games together, I'm sure that there are many users on the forum that would absolutely love to join an active, friendly clan. </p><p><br /></p><p>Why not give the ambassador program a try? We need more friendly users like you. In this program, you can help people out a bit and test your knowledge on XBOX.

<p><em>If interested in joining you get a couple weeks "recruitment" period where we all can get to know you and see how you fit in with everyone and such then you are initiated. Which is basically a knife fight with the rest of our members. We make it personal to show that you are a valued member in our clan and we wont ever be a huge clan, and we have no desire to be.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want a friendly clan full of people that have a great personalities and always have you laughing when you log off, then look no further. Give us a shot and if we aren't for you, no hard feelings but I know friends will be made and with most clans its not about friendship, its about numbers.&nbsp;We are after quality not quantity. Please feel free to post here or msg me. If you're interested just post here or send me a message for faster response! We also have a PS4 side&nbsp; Thanks and see you all out there!</em></p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE:</p>
<p>We do NOT recruit based on k/d&nbsp;- We care more about how you act and socialize more than how well you play.</p>
<p>We do NOT have "Try Outs"&nbsp;- Again its not about how well you play, its more of how well you act towards people.</p>
<p>Not looking for "loners" - Please dont request to joing if you rather play alone than with members</p>
<p>We play a variety of games&nbsp;- Therefore may not be on the same game every single night. So if you are looking for a clan that plays specific game, we might not be the clan for you.</p>
<p>We arent a "Recruit All" Clan&nbsp;- We are recruiting yes, but we are only looking for certain types of members that aren't too competitive and doesnt stick to only one game....as described above. We dont need or want the numbers. We will stay a small clan. People will apply but not necessarily join. We are more of a gaming community looking for friendships and fun online.</p>

<h3> joe masaro  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 mail app</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Below describes the difficulty I've had adding my email account to the Windows 10 mail app.</p>
<p>I would like to know if anyone has an explanation for the problem I've had?&nbsp; Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I open the mail app to add my email account I click add account and enter my email address</p>
<p>and password as asked. The account is then immediately added as POP3 (I have no IMAP option at this point).</p>
<p>I then have to go Manage Accounts and change to IMAP.&nbsp; The problem is that the download option</p>
<p>"as items arrive" is missing (even after a restart).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I solved this problem by deleting the account, opening the People App and adding&nbsp;my email account there.</p>
<p>In this case the procedure is more complicated and I am offered the choice of POP3 or IMAP right from the start.</p>
<p>The account is automatically added to the Mail app and the "as items arrive " option is present.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows 10 mail app works though with various problems popping up now and then which I guess is true</p>
<p>for most users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

    <title>What on earth is &#34; This advertised application will not be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xprt007  say:</h3>
<h2>            What on earth is &#34;  This advertised application will not be installed because it might be unsafe. ...&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my Samsung notebook from Windows 8.1 to 10 around the time Samsung stopped making notebooks/PCs, meaning for most types made around that time or before, there are no Windows 10 software updates of their software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The gamble however worked and Windows 10 supplied all the drivers I needed for the notebook to function 99.9% normally. The only Samsung-specific program I installed and really needed was the battery life extender. It worked well for a long time, until some
 Win 10 update I could not identify suddenly seems to have changed its behavior. It would cease working at times and only completely load the GUI if I re-installed it. I did not get the pattern, but in the last year or so, it seems whenever I install new software,
 it ceases working. It seems it has to be the latest installed program for it to work. It otherwise the GUI not simply get loaded, or it is just visible as running in task manager processes or just will not start at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Samsung no longer provides updates, I had settled for this, since I quite frequently install software and have literally done so hundreds of times with no further problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, however I cannot suddenly install it in spite of several trials and restarts as it interrupts the process with that error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">This advertised application will not be installed because it might be unsafe. Contact your administrator to change the installation user interface option of the package to basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what that is and so how can this silly &amp; patronizing intervention be stopped and if not, how can I do what it claims so I can install it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting compatibility is of no use and up to today has in any case never been necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's nothing wrong with my notebook as because of an unrelated issue with a specific Windows 10 cumulative update getting repeatedly "successfully" installed, I&nbsp; have carried out DISM &amp; Scannow scans and none have yielded negative results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will appreciate your help.</p>

            Hi xprt007 
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />I would do a clean install and just let Windows configure your devices with plug n play. So don't install Samsung software.
<br />See link by Greg to do a clean install of Windows.

<p>It could be windows security so type windows security into Cortana Search and see if any of the App and browser controls are set to Block.</p>
<p>You can try changing the settings and test installing the software, then turn them back on again.</p>

            Honestly, I'm not too familiar with this specific software, but from what you've said it sounds like you might be on the downward slope given that there is no manufacturer (Samsung) support for the software that you're now having problems with.&nbsp; If Samsung
 don't support it and state it's compatible with Windows 10 then it was probably only a matter of time before it stopped working.&nbsp; Added to that as you mentioned you've had some issues to workaround already.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for the responses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have very many programs installed, a good number Giveaways that one can only activate once and so a fresh installation just because of this would not only be cumbersome but time consuming and there's no guarantee that if the cause was inside the changing
 Windows 10 build or whatever had been changed, that it would help.<br />
<br />
As said, before these troubles started, there was no problem this program had with Windows 10. It came after about 1.5 -2 years after the upgrade and since there was no need to keep re-installing it, it took time before I realized there was a change in behavior
 and so could not determine which Windows or other update could be behind this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also it seems there's no other program, at least that I have been able to find anywhere that can act as a battery life extender for my Samsung which I bought 6 years ago [still working well, at least 10 hours of almost everyday].<br />
<br />
The battery life extender can set it to charge to 80% to extend its life, but since I often work-off the grid, I need the notebook to run longer than the 80% charge allows, and in that case I am not aware of any simple means to easily switch between 80% and
 to 100% in case I need it.<br />
So not installing "Samsung software" ... and as said in my introduction it's the ONLY Samsung program I kept after upgrading from the original&nbsp; Win 8.1 to Win 10 ... would simply mean taking away the needed option of occasionally charging to more than 80%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made at least one fresh installation for unconnected reasons in the meantime since this specific program started acting strangely, but it did not help with the specific issue of restoring its normal behavior, so I think the problem was in some changes
 in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now and then, during the many times I have re-installed the program, I have sometimes used the compatibility test, sometimes not and it has never made a difference.</p>
<p>When the issue suddenly came up, I had used it and when the unexpected error came up, I tried without, restarted, .. tried everything I had done before to no avail. That's when I wrote the post, after trying to understand that error message.</p>
<p>I first gave up, but then tried installing again a day or so later without a compatibility test. It suddenly worked. As said, since for some reason I have to quite often install new software for some reason, this has come up again and I was able to re-install
 with no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably some form of change made a compatibility test problematic at that time, although I had never experienced this before. Anyway, I hope it does not misbehave again. ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you &amp; best regards</p>

<h2>            Players online freezing consoles to kick players offline</h2>
                    
<p>My internet connection is fine, my modem is lit up like a Christmas tree. I play other consoles, PC, and Onlive online with no problems, and I use XBL Silver for downloads. So with that out of that way, the problem I have once in awhile is when i'm playing
 on Xbox Live Gold and it is usually when i'm getting the better of someone and then i'm either kicked or the game freezes like what happened today.</p>
<p>I went back in and happened to select the same server playing against what seemed to be the same people, and out I went again when they were cornered. What is that?</p>
<p><br />
That's one of the reasons I barely use XBL Gold, i'm not going to pay money only to have it wasted because sore losers can't take a loss. It didn't happen yesterday while playing the same game or last weekend either. I don't know how it would be done, but if
 Microsoft can find a way to strip cheaters of their ability to cheat, it would prevent business from walking away.</p>
<p><strong>Support sent me to Xbox Forums to get help from the staff, I don't know if I will actually be contacted, but here is my post about what happened and one of the reasons I don't invest in Xbox Live Gold.</strong></p>

<p>G'day uechiblu3000!</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear that you're having troubles on Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>Let's start from the top of your post. You said <em><strong>"i'm either kicked or the game freezes like what happened today."</strong></em>. Is it just you getting 'kicked' from the game or are there more people you know of getting 'kicked'? When your game
 freezes, does your Xbox 360 Console freeze as well?</p>
<p>Next, you said <em><strong>"if Microsoft can find a way to strip cheaters of their ability to cheat, it would prevent business from walking away."</strong></em>. I suggest that you report these users both through the in-game cheater report system (if there
 is one) and also through the Xbox LIVE <strong>file complaint</strong> system. If you don't know how to file a complaint on Xbox LIVE, please go
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/HowTo/360/Submit-Player-Review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any more questions feel free to post them here.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Dementia issue with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I have been diagnosed with dementia and I find Windows 10 hard to use, I had Windows 10 and had to change back to Windows 7. Dementia is a condition where a person can get confused with systems that most people find easy and with Windows 7 ending
 support January 2020 I have no option but to go back to W10. Is there any way that this could be made an easy changeover for me and less confusing. By the way, I am also an older person so any help would be very grateful.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a lot to all the really good people who have replied to my post. I have lots of brilliant advice and lots of work to do but I will be staying with Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know I can save them all using the "Save All" dialog, but it's not what I want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Side note: in the same way Microsoft seems to enjoy frustraiting users with new funky interfaces as the one of&nbsp;Windows 8, it seems to enjoy frustrating old happy and loyal Outlook Express users by ignoring all the trouble of Windows Live Mail.</em></p>
<p><em>Does&nbsp;Microsoft aim to push all of us to&nbsp;use Gmail?! This is&nbsp;bizarre!</em></p>

            Hi&nbsp;<font color="#68217a"><span>OneMonister</span></font>,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for posting your query here in Microsoft Community. Let us help you on it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I understand that you're wondering if it's possible to select multiple attachments from an email you received in Windows Live Mail 2012 and drag and drop them to your PC. Apparently, the only option to select attachments and save them to your PC is by
 using the <i>Save all... </i>option. It is possible to choose multiple specific files through this option. The feature you're looking for to drag and drop multiple files from the actual email window would be a great addition to Windows Live Mail. I suggest
 that you submit your feedback on the product by clicking&nbsp;<a href="https://feedback.live.com/default.aspx?productkey=wlmaildesktop&amp;f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396&amp;scrx=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hopefully, that feature would be considered on the next release of Windows Live Mail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let us know if you have any questions.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Rhyan O.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to not delete Windows.old folder, it contains all data from the previous operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case something goes wrong with your computer, Windows.old folder will help you to roll back to the previous Operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t open Network &#38; Sharing Center from right-clicking the network icon on the system tray.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there. I am currently using Windows 10 1709, and recently (maybe after some update) I am troubled that I cannot open Network &amp; Sharing Center from right-clicking the network icon on the system tray as before. When I right-click the icon, instead it will
 show the option to open the Network &amp; Internet app menu. </p>
<p>I would prefer the traditional control panel Network &amp;Sharing Center where I can adjust adapter settings and check wifi status. In the new app-like menu it is hard for me to get the information I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to toggle the option back? I really use this shortcut a lot, and now it is useless, which is somewhat annoying. I hope there is a way to help the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>If you at Microsoft value our ideas, then please actually listen to them.&nbsp; On an non-touchscreen laptop or desktop I have no use for your windows apps.&nbsp; I want access to control panel items not apps.&nbsp; Please either make these right click context menus configurable,
 or have both options available for those of us who need them.<br />
<br />
My job requires me to change my network configuration (set static IP addresses) several times a day.&nbsp; Having to go to the control panel or type "Network and sharing... " in the start menu search is not efficient.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Weekly Defrag Scheduling attempts to defrag my drives on the same day - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Weekly Defrag Scheduling  attempts to defrag my drives on the same day of each week.</h2>
                    <p>I have Windows set to "Defrag and Optimise" my drives on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that it always attempts to defrag my drives on the same day of each week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried disabling the weekly scheduling, re-enabling it and then performing a manual defrag on my preferred day, hoping that Windows will continue to perform an automatic defrag on the same day each week.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it doesn't and continues to defrag when I don't want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had problems with previous versions of Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I missing something here? How can I permanently change the scheduled defrag day?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What actually determines the day of the week that defrag runs?</p>
<p>

            <p>So I did this and it seemed to work well.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Task Scheduler to the Defrag folder, then right-click and disable the defrag task.<br />
<br />
</li><li>You can still open the Defrag UI to see status (or even use it manually).<br />
<br />
</li><li>You can create your own task in Task Scheduler (I created my own folder for it on the left) to run the defrag command on any schedule you choose.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I think this will get you exactly what you're looking for.&nbsp; <em><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2158e97-e806-4062-b932-b27621531131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here to enlarge image...</a></em></p>

            <p>I'm sorry, that was for an older version of the defrag UI.&nbsp; Windows 8 has the new "maintenance window" timeframe where it does all maintenance tasks (updates, cleanup, defrag, problem reports, and about 8 other things).&nbsp; That schedule can be set in the action
 center, but it only lets you set the time of day (default is 3:00 AM local time). If the computer is off or in-use, it will do it the next time the system is on but idle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can open Task Scheduler to find and see the defrag and maintenance tasks, but you'll note that the trigger (where time/day would be) is blank.&nbsp; This is because the tasks were scheduled with new abilities in the AT scheduling engine that aren't in the
 Scheduled Task UI interface yet, so it cannot show the actual schedule being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think perhaps the easiest workaround, instead of trying to get those AT commands at a command prompt, would be to just disable the schedule in the defrag UI, then schedule your own defrag using task scheduler directly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just set up a scheduled task that
 executes this command:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>defrag.exe /c</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Assign it the schedule days/times you want in the Task Scheduler.</p>

                    <p>I have been in touch with Apple and they have asked me to contact you as i am unable to restore my Iphone 6s plus 64Gb. We have deleted over 60gb of the 250GB ssd on the Sony Laptop. The problem is as soon as it is deleted the free space starts filling up.
 As iTunes does it stuff to restore it comes up with a message to say that there is not enough space on the hard drive to do a backup/restore?!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried numerous times and now it has 30 GB free and reducing. Apple said that there is enough space now to restore the Iphone, however,&nbsp; it is still the same message that the HD is full. Apple has asked me to contact Microsoft (you) to resolve this
 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise urgently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: As we speak the Hard Drive is now at 317MB after deleting 60GB??? How?&nbsp;
