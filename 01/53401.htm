<h2>            Meaning and use of Task Manager memory columns.</h2>
                    What are the meanings of the different memory-related columns in Windows Task Manager? I need to assess fairly total impact on physical and virtual memory, and need to know what I should add up. .Is it possible to separate out program and data segments?&nbsp;

            What I need, I suppose, is a soft tour through what these different categories of memory really mean, and what happens when you run out of them. This would have to be given by someone with an excellent technical understanding themselves, and the ability
 to explain things simply for me. Understanding is worth so much more than trotting out jargon words one does not fully understand oneself,<br />

            What is a shared memory pool? Is it a memory pool where processes can take out their own, little, unique bit of it? Or does it mean that processes have memory in common, which is one (not very reliable) way that they can communicate?<br />

            I would like to know the formula for calculating the total memory of all types that a process is using.<br />
This is far from clear, because it is not clear if some of the memoty types are subsets of other memory types, and therefore must not be counted twice. Also what should be done regarding the shared memory. The memory (virtual and physical) that ends up being
 used by a process is one crucial parameter, because it is a resource that is often in short supply. It also gives some indication of the likelihood that the process will often be held up paging in memory, in a system running low on memory..<br />

            Hi J, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

            Hey Jim,
<br />
<br />This is a recovery partition brought into view in 1803. You cannot remove, but only you must remove its mapping of its respective drive letter, which is K. Once you do this, it brings it back to its intended visibility, being hidden and out of sight. Once you do this, you won't be pestered with low disk space notifications anymore. You will need to remove the drive letter and mount point in DiskPart in order to do this.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + R together to go into Run. Type in the following: diskpart
<br />
<br />Enter the following in the new DiskPart window:
<br />
<br />select volume K
<br />remove letter=K
<br />
<br />Does not work after a reboot? Try entering this instead in an administrator session of Command Prompt: mountvol K: /D
<br />

<h2>            Fraud</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not sure where the right place to post this is but if there is a correct place to post this someone will tell me.</p>

<p>Two people have been scamming and one of them is committing fruad by going on other peoples' accounts, changing passwords to their account and/or email adress used to sign into it to gain access to credit/debit card infomation. Their names are eG x NiNJaZz
 and eG x Sponge. the first one is committing fraud and the second one is thinking about it. They are and have been scamming Microsoft points and other money trading codes (I.E itunes, paypal, etc) without actually providing the product in return. In this case
 Call of Duty modded lobbies.</p>

<p>Their ultimate goal is to get fifa points on FIFA 14 using credit/debit cards on their victims' accounts and then transferring any good players or the money they gain from the points to their own accounts.<br />
&nbsp;I have a set of numbers I got from when I talked to a support agent over the live chat here 1234562197 and would like something done about these rule breakers.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Again, if this is the wrong place to post this please tell me and direct me to the correct place. I could not find it.<br />
Thanks for helping and have a good day.</p>

<p>Well I was told to put it here (forums, not this particular thread) if I wanted a fast-ish response by a member of the enforcement team.</p>
<p>NiNJaZz is committing fraud now but was doing simple scamming of microsoft points and other types of codes for money. Sponge has not yet committed fraud but has been scamming players before. I have reported both on console at least a month or two ago now
 and nothing has happened. </p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn't of named and shamed but I've never done this type of thing before so I have no idea what the right and the wrong thing is to do.</p>

<p>Fine, this is my real account. (shakennebula89) and I know he's committing fraud for a fact. He is going on others' accounts (he joins the party with them) and then starts spending on their card linked to the account. He then gives some money that he gains
 to eG x Sponge. I highly doubt they are both lying to me.</p>
<p>I guess they were wrong. I'll report them both now on the console and I bet you they'll do nothing as they always do. I don't mean to be rude but I don't want these acts to be gotten away with. It's illegal and he/they should be punished.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Enforcement Team</h2>
                    <p>Hi Xbox you have suspended me for following your advice&nbsp;i 
purchased a game from the marketplace that for some reason charged my 
bank three times so i contacted Microsoft on the live chat and i was 
told to contact my bank as they can only see one charge so i did i 
contacted my bank they reversed the payments and i carried on but 
recently the bank must have concluded the investigation and&nbsp;i received 
the refund from Microsoft themselves, so i received my suspension due to
 marketplace theft... well ok i guess it was a charge back but when i 
open a case and prove to them that i was only acting on the instructions
 of the support staff the suspension will be lifted and i can carry on 
as normal, well that didn't happen they upheld the decision to suspend 
me i have the log number for the chat i had with Microsoft telling me to contact
 my bank i have tried for hours to talk to someone who can help but they
 all tell me to contact the enforcement team however the enforcement 
team don't have a phone number or an email address so how can i discuss 
my case further with anybody?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Original message sent to the enforcement team.
</p>

<p>Hello, I have been suspended for marketplace theft. I believe this was 
caused by doing a chargeback on my account with my bank. I spoke with 
your support team on 11/1/17 (case number 1402954902). They told me to 
do the chargeback. I spoke with another agent on 2/1/18 (case number 
1413955103) who confirmed this and helped me submit this review. I feel 
this action was caused by being mislead by your support team and hope 
that this can be overturned please.</p>





<p>Case Review Status after them reading this and investigating: Decision Upheld</p>

    <title>How to Reset Adminstrator File Permissions Special Permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> &#8226;&#173;&#186;&#8224;&#174;&#183;&#124;&#183;&#223;&#197;l&#8226;&#173;&#186;&#8226;&#173;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Reset Adminstrator File Permissions Special Permissions</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am running Windows 7.&nbsp; I created a new user account for my mom and thought I would change permissions for folders I didn't want her to accidently delete or modify.&nbsp; She is computer illiterate so I just wanted to keep my important files safe until she&nbsp;learned
 how to properly use the computer.&nbsp; As I was changing the permissions I confused one of my administrator accounts with regular accounts and I changed the permissions.&nbsp; Now I have full control on administrators accounts except they don't have special permissions.&nbsp;
 So now I am unable to change any permissions with any accounts.&nbsp; I've looked around for hours and every solution people have posted, apparently don't work according to the people who try them.&nbsp; So I am&nbsp;reluctant to try any of them.&nbsp; Please post if you have
 tried a solution and have been successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only things I have tried which didn't work are:</p>
<p>1. changing ownership- Problem is none of my user, admin accounts have the right permissions.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; system restore - Didn't change anything to do with permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below are&nbsp;some&nbsp;things&nbsp;I haven't tried because they haven't worked for anyone that I have seen so far.&nbsp; Let me know if you've had this problem and one of these actually worked for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; A program that is supposed to fix this problem</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tweaking.com/content/page/windows_repair_all_in_one.html</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. Another program </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>use Permissions Time Machine v1.2 to restore permissions to folder or files or registry keys download it from amyd projects blog</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3.&nbsp; This is one that people were having a lot of problems with the locations of the files?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You will need to run ‘Subinacl Tool’ to reset the permission to normal. To reset system permissions, follow the steps:
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download subinacl.msi from the following link, and save it on the desktop.
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads</span></a><span><span>(http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads)
</span><br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the desktop, double-click subinacl.msi to install the tool. <br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select C:\Windows\System32 as the destination folder. <br />
<strong>Note</strong> This step assumes that Windows is installed in C:\Windows. If Windows is installed elsewhere, select the appropriate path to .\System32.

            <p>"Special Permissions" simply means that the permission panel shows more options than are normally visible. To fix the permissions for a particular folder, do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Seize ownership of the folder.</li><li>Remove your mother from the accounts list for this folder.</li><li>Set the permissions you require: Full access to the System and your own account, read-access to your mother's account.
<br />
</li><li>Do not use the "Deny" option. It often has unintended side-effects.</li></ol>

            Hi Matthew
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />After pinning, before restarting, try disabling Fast Startup first then restart to see if it sticks. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Power options
<br />Click Additional power settings under Related settings
<br />Click Choose what the power button does
<br />Click Change settings that are currently unavailable
<br />Uncheck 'Turn on fast startup (recommended)
<br />
<br />Click Save changes.
<br />
<br />Click Restart now and see if it works.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, click Start, type: folder options
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under General &gt; Privacy
<br />Click Clear
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart then try pining again.
<br />
<br />Still not working?
<br />
<br />Try deleting *.automaticDestinations-ms from the following directory,
<br />
<br />%AppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Recent\AutomaticDestinations
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: %AppData%
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Then navigate to that folder. 
<br />
<br />Delete the contents. 
<br />
<br />Other steps you can try...
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />	Press Windows key + X
<br />	Click Windows PowerShell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />	At the command prompt, type the following, hit Enter the restart. 
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
<br />
<br />Option 2: 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Option 3
<br />
<br />1. Open Notepad.
<br />
<br />2. Copy the following text into Notepad:
<br />
<br />@echo off
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im explorer.exe
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /im shellexperiencehost.exe
<br />
<br />timeout /t 3 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />del %localappdata%\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState\* /q
<br />
<br />timeout /t 2 /NOBREAK &gt; nul
<br />
<br />start explorer
<br />
<br />@echo on
<br />
<br />3. Click File and Save.
<br />
<br />4. Choose a location to save the file.  Enter a File name of ClearTileCache.bat and select Save as type of All files (*.*).  Click Save.
<br />
<br />5. Open File Explorer and navigate to the location that you chose to save the file to.  Double-click ClearTileCache.bat to run the file.

            <p>Go to the order summary page, there you will find your product key:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Windows 8 came preininstalled on your computer:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>

<p>Hi Missy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you're pertaining to the image below, <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/091262b7-b375-437f-b01c-06233d5508af" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/091262b7-b375-437f-b01c-06233d5508af" /></a></p>
<p>then it could be that you press FN key and press the Volume UP or Down key that's why it's there and wouldn't go away. You may need a quick restart or
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force a shut down and restart you device</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try the two button shut down. Here's how: Press and hold the Volume-up button and the Power button on the your PC at the same time for 15 seconds and then release both of them. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but remember to continue
 holding down the buttons for 15 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you need further assistance, feel free to get back to us. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
please download this reg file from my SkyDrive:<br />
<br />
http://cid-128fc518635be2dc.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/MS%20Foren/Registry/WER%5E_Explorer.reg<br />
<br />
and make a double click on the file to import it. If you can't do this, run regedit.exe and import the registry file there!<br />
<br />
When the Windows Explorer crashes, Windows Error Reporting Service [1] creates a dmp file under C:\Localdumps. Please upload the file to your public Skydrive [2] folder and post the link here. I take a look at the dump with the Debugger, maybe I can see which
 Shell extension is the cause.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Many of the files sfc can't fix are not important.<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt;&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
put the command from below (copy and paste it) into that box and then hit enter.<br />
<br />
<span>findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt <br />
<br />
that creates the sfcdetails.txt file in the folder you are in when you run it.<br />
<br />
So if you are in C:\Windows\System32&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then you will need to look in that folder for the file.<br />

<br />
That creates sfcdetails.txt&nbsp; in C:\Windows\System32&nbsp;&nbsp; find it and you can post the errors into a message<br />
here. NOTE :&nbsp;there probably are duplicates so please only post each section of errors once.<br />
<br />
You can read the log/txt files easier if you&nbsp;right click on Notepad or Wordpad then RUN AS ADMIN - then<br />
you can navigate to sfcdetails.txt ( in C:\Windows\System32 ) or cbs.log ( in C:\Windows\Logs ) as needed.<br />
(You may need to search for sfcdetails.txt if it was not created in the default folders.)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Seems those sites which promote these poor products are all part of the scam. They include a couple<br />
or legitmate products (if any) and then rate all of their products higher and they are often virtually the<br />
same.</p>
<p>Unless you know how to recover from an errant deletion and that can be extremely difficult its best not to<br />
use a registry cleaner. And they "fix" very little and "BREAK" a lot</p>
<p>Run RegCure uninstaller C:\Program Files\RegCure\uninst.exe</p>
<p>Check info here :<br />

<p>Or Use Revo to Uninstall it :</p>
<p>If RegCure is running use TaskManager to close (end Process) - Right Click on Taskbar - Task Manager</p>

<p>========================================================<br />
========================================================</p>
<p>McAfee is probably also part of the problem as it is known for causing system slow downs and other<br />
problems. Uninstall it and then run the McAfee Removal Tool to prevent remnants which can cause<br />
strange issues. Also run the Removal Tools and check for special instructions for removing any other<br />
antivirus program, used or not, that has ever been on the machine including trials. Those all leave<br />
trouble causing remnants. Malwarebytes is ok to keep. (Note you can't just disable McAfee to test<br />
as it will still load pieces of itself into memory.)</p>
<p>Below are recommendations to use while testing, however permanently is even better.</p>

<br />
=================================</p>
<p>Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave File System, Web,
<br />
and Network running (Script and Behavior are also recommended in Ver 6+).<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free<br />
<br />
Windows Firewall<br />
<br />
Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)<br />
<br />
IE - Protected Mode<br />
<br />
IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)<br />
<br />
I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 6.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 6.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.prevx.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.prevx.com/</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;-- information<br />
<a href="http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://info.prevx.com/downloadcsi.asp?prevx=Y</a>&nbsp; &lt;-- download
<br />
<br />
PCmag - Prevx - Editor's Choice<br />
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2346862,00.asp</span></a>
<br />
<br />
Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.<br />

<h2>            recovering Skype account- security issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this issue raised by many people. Unable to recover a Skype account, created with a Skype login many years ago. As it is always open I had forgotten my password and when I went to change it within Skype, the only option (on both phone and laptop) was
 to create a new microsoft account. I saw previous responses giving a link to reset, but this only allows a reset of a microsoft account. So I only had a choice to create a microsoft account, and it has now created a new account, without any contacts or previous
 information from my old Skype account. I want my old Skype account back. I created it, and this is a serious security breach if I am not able to access an account I created, which contains personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>

<h3> dvongrad  say:</h3>
<h2>            File sharing between users at different locations</h2>
                    <p>I would like to share files across different computers with different users. For example, the admin user on Desktop&nbsp;would like to have full control over Laptop and vice versa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have network discovery and file sharing turned on, the proper services are started, and the drives shared as Desktop-C and Laptop-C. When I go into Advanced Sharing&nbsp;and then Permissions, I can set the Everyone user to have Full Control over everything
 and I&nbsp;can create, edit, and delete on both computers from the other to my heart's content. What I would like to have is \\DESKTOP\Admin to have Full Control over Laptop-C and&nbsp;\\LAPTOP\Admin to have Full Control over Desktop-C. and everyone else to have read
 access on both I thought I&nbsp;could go into Locations... to see the other computer and then specify the user with the syntax \\COMPUTER\User. But all I see in the Locations dialog&nbsp;box is the name of that computer, so I have no opportunity&nbsp;to select another computer's
 user. When I right click on the shared drive and select "Give access to", all I see is Advanced sharing" so I can't even select a specific user. It seems each PC can see the other by name, but can't access the users on the other to give access to each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to extend this scenario&nbsp;to have full control over my daughter's computer but for her to have write access over select portions of mine. I don't want to have to resort to OneDrive just to share a few files back and forth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like it should be easy to do, but I can't seem to find a link that describes&nbsp;a solution for what I would like to do. Any input on this is much appreciated.</p>

<p>

<li>I would like to confirm if both the laptop and desktop computers are running in

            My "laptop" is actually a Surface Pro 4 (SP4). I don't know if that makes a difference or not.<br />
<br />
Both were recently reset with disk clean with Windows 10 Pro within last 2 weeks. The version and build of both is 1803 and 17134.228, respectively. Both have all updates.<br />
<br />
Using the DateMedia folder installed on both desktop and SP4 (DateMedia is a small application I wrote using MFC and C++ to rename a photo using the date found in the EXIF data):<br />
<br />
Desktop Group or user names:<br />
<br />
Authenticated Users<br />
SYSTEM<br />
Administrators (MY-DESKTOP\Administrators)<br />
Users (MY-DESKTOP\Users)<br />
<br />
SP4 Group or user names:<br />
<br />
ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES<br />
ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES<br />
CREATOR OWNER<br />
SYSTEM<br />
Administrators (MY-SP4\Administrators)<br />
Users (MY-SP4\Users)<br />
Trustedinstaller<br />
<br />
I log onto both the desktop and the SP4 with the user "Dave". It is the only user account on each.<br />
<br />
My daughter does not use either because she has her own laptop. She is the only user account on it. The OS is Windows Home and the version is 1803 and 17134.228, respectively. It has all updates.<br />
<br />
DateMedia folder:<br />
<br />
ALL APPLICATION PACKAGES<br />
ALL RESTRICTED APPLICATION PACKAGES<br />
CREATOR OWNER<br />
SYSTEM<br />
Administrators (MY-LAPTOP\Administrators)<br />
Users (MY-LAPTOP\Users)<br />
Trustedinstaller<br />
<br />
Again, to clarify, I would like to have full control over the desktop and SP4 from each other, full control over my daughter's laptop from either the desktop or SP4, and for my daughter to have read/write access to a folder that I'll specify on the desktop.<br />
<br />
I hope this answers all your questions. Let me know if you need any more information.

            I get as far as step 12, but Locations lists only the "location" of that particular&nbsp;computer (ie: DESKTOP for the desktop and LAPTOP for the laptop) and not the other one so I can't proceed any further. Network in File Explorer can see both computers and
 all its shared resources, but I can change permissions&nbsp;only for the Everyone user. If I type "\\LAPTOP\User" into
<strong>Enter</strong><strong> the object name to select</strong>, the next dialog box says it's not valid, so I select the
<strong>Remove</strong> option. Perhaps the problem lies in that I need to add the laptop user to the desktop and vice versa. If that's the case and I&nbsp;want to add the desktop user to the laptop without a Microsoft account, I'm not sure how to add that user.
 Trying to use "\\DESKTOP\User" on the laptop says usernames can't contain '\'. It would seem to me that adding another computer's user as a user to another would defeat the purpose because there could be several users with varying control over others. In my
 case, there are only two, but I want to have full control over one from the other in both cases.

<p><span>Hi Bhottinger,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft has dropped support for this product. As such there are no drivers available for this product.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, as per Windows 7 Compatibility Center, Microsoft Sidewinder Joystick is compatible with Windows 7. You can see the report here.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=sidewinder joystick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Hardware&amp;s=sidewinder%20joystick</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As such, using Windows inbuilt driver check if you can manage to get the device to work. If you have the old driver CD, you can try changing the
 compatibility settings of the driver to get it to work.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Usually, Windows will find and automatically install the necessary drivers when you plug your game controller into your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Connect
 the Joystick to the USB port through the adapter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>See
 if it gets detected.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Windows
 should recognize the new hardware and set it up to work properly.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:<br />
<br />
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Install the old driver that comes along with the product by changing its compatibility settings.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer:</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After running the installation, check if the device works.</span></p>

<h2>            Region Lock</h2>
                    
<p>I live in Spain, my region is Spain, my IP address is Spanish. However my disc is English. On the First Strike map pack there was an option to down load the DLC as Spanish (ES) or English (EN), so I downloaded the English version...does anybody know if that
 option is available on Escalation? The option only presented itself after you'd paid for it so clearly I want to make sure.</p>
