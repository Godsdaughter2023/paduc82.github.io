    <title>Solid State Drive 100&#37; Active Time - No Transfer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jcrystaln  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solid State Drive 100&#37; Active Time - No Transfer</h2>
                    <p>Recently, I took a PNY 240GB solid state drive out of my laptop and put it into my desktop. I wiped it and reinstalled a fresh copy of Windows 10 from a thumb drive onto it. Ever since I frequently get these strange hiccups where the drive active
 time is stuck at 100% in task manager for about 5 to 10 seconds but no data is being successfully transferred (Disk transfer rate is a flat line at 0). The cursor still works and I can click on windows (essentially whatever is already open in RAM is responsive
 it seems like) but the program that was trying to access the hard disk hangs and no other programs that need to access the disk will respond for the 5 to 10 seconds. It happens pretty regularly I would say on average once per hour.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried updating the firmware for the drive with a tool from PNY but the tool indicated that my drive firmware is the latest. I ran windows update and I am up to date. I tried searching for a new driver from within windows but it says I'm on the
 latest. I installed the AMD SATA firmware from their website. I disabled the Message Signaled Interrupt following this guide from Microsoft:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/3083595/task-manager-might-show-100-disk-utilization-on-windows-10-devices-wit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/3083595/task-manager-might-show-100-disk-utilization-on-windows-10-devices-wit</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, I installed windows again, this time using my manufacturer's built in reinstall from the OEM HDD that is still in my PC. I updated all my drivers using my manufacturer's driver packages. I am still having the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<p>HP pavilion power 580-023w</p>
<p>Ryzen 7 1700</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>1TB HDD</p>
<p>240GB PNY SSD CS1111 (installed myself)</p>
<p>MSI Radeon RX 580 8GB GDDR5 (installed myself)</p>
<p>SuperNOVA 550 G2 550W 80 Plus Gold Modular Power Supply (installed myself)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!<br />

            Hi Josh
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up
<br />
<br />See if that makes a difference, if not...
<br />
<br />SEE:<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-100-percent-disk-usage-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-100-percen...</a> 
<br />
<br />Look for blank icons on the desktop and delete them.
<br />
<br />Since you have SSD, you might need to update the firmware. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps
<br />Disable all Background apps.
<br />
<br />Disabling Windows Update:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to Disabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Also, check whats starting up with Windows.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Click Startup tab
<br />Disable all except Windows Defender.
<br />------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: msconfig
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Go to the services tab
<br />Check the box, 
<br />hide all Microsoft services
<br />
<br />Disable the remaining services
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Restart if prompted
<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: problem reports
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Delete any failed or pending reports.
<br />
<br />Go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications and actions &gt; Turn off "Show me tips about Windows."
<br />
<br />If you have Chrome installed, uninstall then reinstall it. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type: powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Exit 
<br />
<br />Create an entirely new account and delete the current one.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google has ended security updates for Chrome in XP and Vista.</p>
<p>A lot of people then switched to Firefox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if this assists you, BUT&nbsp;it is a repeat of most of what you have already done:</p>
<p>There&nbsp;is only so much maintenance work to do.</p>
<p>You have an unsupported Browser, Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scan for Malware, if necessary&nbsp;in Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/how-to-start-windows-in-safe-mode/#vista</span></a></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows Vista</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Using the F8 Method:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Restart your computer. </li><li>When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently tap the
<strong>F8</strong> key repeatedly until you are presented with the <strong>Windows Vista Advanced Boot Options</strong>.
</li><li>Select the <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>&nbsp;option using the arrow keys.
</li><li>Then press the <strong>enter</strong> key on your keyboard to boot into Vista Safe Mode.
</li><li>When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Vista will enter Safe mode.
</li><li>Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once in Safe Mode with Networking, download and run RKill.</p>
<p>RKill does NOT remove Malware; it stops the Malware Process giving you a chance to remove it with your Security Programs.</p>

<p>Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click<strong> Start</strong>, click
<strong>All Programs</strong>, click <strong>Accessories</strong>, right-click <strong>
Command Prompt</strong>, and then click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>. </li><li>Type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<div><span>sfc /scannow</span></div>
The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.

<h2>            God Modders on Call of Duty&#58; World at War</h2>
                    
<p>I have encountered God Modders on Call of Duty: World at War. It's ridiculous.&nbsp;A box appears in the upper left hand corner when&nbsp;I go into a live match showing someone's gamertag repeatedly. These God Modders, they fly across the maps and never get killed.
 It's impossible to win, and makes the game no fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've stopped playing my World at War game, because every match I got to on Xbox Live has these God Modders. It's extremely aggrivating. I don't even play my Call of Duty: Black Ops anymore in fear of the same thing happening. I'm stuck with my other games,
 which are enjoyable, but my favorite game is World at War. Now that the God Modders have taken over, it's no fun anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could someone please get these God Modders banned from Xbox Live? I want to be able to play a fair game on Call of Duty: World at War again. Not this cheap-quantum singularity God Modder's game.</p>

<p>Tell me about it!.. I couldn't believe it after months of neglecting Worl At War I've been playing it recently and couldn't believe my eyes to see players flying everywhere and invulnerable as well.</p>
<p>Slake is right with the 'avoid player' thing, eventially if you keep doing that whenever you see one you'll have normal games again. I've been setting them to avoid under the guise of player communication 'disruptive voice' because of all the youtube links
 that they are somehow getting onto the screen.</p>
<p>But something to do before avoiding is 'File Complaint' reason being 'System Tampering' to try and make xbox aware of them.</p>
<p>I've been making it my quest to do that each time I see some flying douchebag.</p>

<p>Avoiding doesn't last very long sometimes. I've ran into many people I've previously avoided before (which I also go another extra step and mute so that if I do run into them again, they're marked and I can leave before I'm forced to play with them again),
 and once they're in a game with you again, the system seems to wipe the fact that there was an avoidance there, because I'll have to submit a whole new review. Complaint filing should be improved, too, perhaps with a reply message at the very least explaining
 what happened as a result. When people go as far as putting their modded online games on YouTube, showing their own gamertag and all, yet nothing happens to them when complaints are filed, it gets really annoying.</p>

<p>Go look in accounts suspensions for a whole load of nothing being done. While I'm here I'll also point out avoiding players does not guarantee you'll never play that person again. As stated in the player review section it only lessens your chances.</p>

    <title>Why does Skype ring out in Edge but not in Skype&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wbradney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Skype ring out in Edge but not in Skype&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have the Skype UWP app open. I also have Edge open with my Outlook.com email inbox showing. I tried to call someone (in Skype) but the call dropped. He immediately calls me back. I hear the ringing, but nothing shows up in Skype or in notification toast
 to answer the call. I suspect that the only place I can hit "Answer" is in Edge (because if close Edge while a call is incoming the ringing stops), but I can't find the app and the tab in time to accept.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After closing Edge, the next time he calls I get the option to answer in Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Skype is up, shouldn't that application be the default place to answer incoming calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened to me a few times and it's quite annoying to say the least.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Since you are signed in using one Skype account on two different Skype platforms, there is a possibility that an interference will happen during a call. In line with that, it is not advisable to sign in using one credential to more than one Skype platform
 most especially on the same device and internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid this to happen again, make sure to sign in on one Skype platform only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Feel free to post back if you have questions and clarifications.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Question: </strong><em>Are you saying that I can have email/calendar/OneDrive/office365 etc, or Skype, but not both?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>No, you can use any of these at the same time. The thing is, for Skype account being signed in to two Skype platforms on one device, the calls can be interfered as what you have encountered. That is why we are advising you to use
 one Skype platform for the call be redirected to that specific platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for you to utilize your Outlook account while signed in to Skype application, please try to change the status of the account on Edge from
<em>Available</em> to <em>Invisible</em>. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>While signed in on Edge using Outlook, go to Skype <em>(the message icon at the upper right side of the screen).</em></li><li>On that page, click your <em>Profile picture or Avatar.</em></li><li>Change the status from <em>Available to Invisible.</em></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>To check, advise one of your contacts to do test call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after.</p>

<p>I was wrong, I have been experimenting, and finally succeeded. It has got nothing to do with nividia.</p>
<p>Delete the <strong>Microsoft .NET Framework 4</strong>. There is also a client, delete that one too.</p>
<p>Anyway, I tried to put it back just recently, and for me it was ok.</p>
<p>I suggest you first try&nbsp;windows&nbsp;update. If that wont work, uninstall the above.</p>
<p>Problem was over for me after that, I really believe it will for you too.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday early AM Win10 updated on it's own and went into the blue screen restart loop. &nbsp;After numerous failed attempts at fixing it, refreshed Win10 via the repair screen. &nbsp;Got the HP PC working again yesterday evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This AM Win10 apparently tried to install the same update and I'm in the same blue screen, " &nbsp;:( something is wrong and we're working on it" screen. &nbsp;The loop continues without the PC going to the repair screen and unlike yesterday I can't get to the repair
 screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get to the repair screen again or how can I fix this loop problem?</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused, I will certainly help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please mention the complete error message with error code if any.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to boot from the Windows 10 media and boot into the safe mode from Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To boot into safe mode on Windows 10 computer follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Insert the media such as (USB or DVD) and restart your computer</span></p>
<p><span>b) Press F12 key (typically this is F12, but it can differ between computer manufacturers) and choose the drive that you inserted the installation
 media into.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once the Windows Setup window appears, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click next and select Repair your computer.
</span></p>
<p><span>d) You will then see a blue screen and an option to choose. Choose the option Troubleshoot and select advanced options.</span></p>
<p><span>e) You may choose Safe boot from advanced boot option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When you boot into safe mode from advanced boot option you need to restore the PC to a previous date when it was working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>:</span><span>
</span><span>Restoring your PC to an earlier point will remove updates and drivers installed after the restore point was made. It won’t affect your personal files.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t have windows 10 media, you may refer to the below link to download the ISO and create the installation media:</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#39; update stuffed my computer.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, did an update on my laptop today and when it rebooted up it came up saying to 'choose an operating system' it asked me to pick a keyboard layout ,so I chose United Kingdom as there was no Australian, as there was no Australia English to choose. From
 there i clicked on &nbsp;it and took me to another screen that has 4 boxes 3 saying windows10 volume 2. The other box says windows rollback and in all this I haven't a clue what it all means! Now by clicking on any of these takes me back to keyboard layout, then
 it gives me a choose an option, 1 continue &nbsp;exit and continue to Windows 10 ( on volume 2. 2 turn of your pic. 3 use another operating system- continue with another installed version of windows. And lastly 4 troubleshoot- Reset your &nbsp;pic or see advanced options.
 I go too troubleshoot and gives me 5 more options. It won't let me system restore, I don't know a command prompt and start up repair isn't working either and it says go back to previous version nothing happens there either.i can't get any start menu or anything
 other than these advanced options. I don't know why th S happened ,it asked me if I want to update and I did and this is what happened. Please help,I'm going out of my mind,trying to figure all this out. Thanks in advance</p>

<p>To isolate your concern, we recommend that you follow these steps to find out if you can launch the Run dialog box. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> <strong>key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Type<strong> rstrui.exe</strong> in the Run dialog box to launch system restore.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If it allows you to manage and launch system restore application then we suggest that you perform the procedure. T<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">his option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restoring won’t affect
 your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Charged for Xboxlive... But never signed up for it</h2>
                    <p>I've been getting charged for xbox live for the last several months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Last month I received a large $60 charge out of nowhere... I'm unemployed currently so that's kind of a big deal. I was previously being charged on my credit card... Every single month. And there were some $20 charges I believe.</p>
<p>I don't know how you got access to my card info but I like a refund of at least 6 moths, and that $60 charge. I have no idea why this is happening but it needs to stop. I already paid to get a new credit card, and then it started showing up on my debit card
 which is now empty thanks to this. If you won't listen to me or you don't cancel it I'm going to have to really struggle to replace this debit card.</p>
<p>Please give me my money back.</p>
<p>Also, trying to reach support from Microsoft, I was lead in a multiple page loop when attempting to contact them. No phone numbers, no emails. Nothing at all except sketchy link loops. Incredible customer service, I'll be sure to recommend.</p>
I don't even know where to post this honestly. You've done really well obscuring how to even ask for help.

    <title>Worst Customer Service Experience Of My Life&#58; Requesting Elite - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Worst Customer Service Experience Of My Life&#58; Requesting Elite Controller Replacement Under Warranty</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I hope I am posting this in the right spot. I have to share what has been the worst customer service experience I have ever had. I spent over a month of my life, as well as my own money, trying to get an elite controller replacement for a controller with defective thumbsticks. If you are thinking about requesting a replacement, DON'T! Return it to the store instead, if you can.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>To summarize my entire experience with the repair process:</p>



<p><u>March 4:</u> Contacted Microsoft via chat to request a replacement controller. Sent in my purchase&nbsp;receipt via email, was told I would be contacted by a support rep. <b>No response. </b>

  </p>

<p><u>March 14:</u> Contacted Microsoft via phone to request a replacement. After wading through confusing menus and spending time on hold, I received my rep, Rebbecca, who said&nbsp;she would&nbsp;assist me in setting up a repair. After describing my issue and spending some time on hold, she told me there would be an option to ship a replacement <b>controller </b>to me, but I would have to pay $25 to ship it, and would not have to send in my faulty controller. I reluctantly agreed, and later that day received the shipment notification from the service center.

  </p>

<p><u>March 21:</u> I received in the mail not a replacement <b>controller</b>, but replacement <b>thumbsticks</b>. I emailed my rep to let her know about the mixup.

  </p>

<p><u>March 23:</u>&nbsp;The rep&nbsp;called and emailed me to apologize for the mistake, and let me know&nbsp;she was looking into the issue and I could expect an email from the service center soon. <b>No response.</b>

  </p>

<p><u>March 27:</u> I emailed my rep to ask why I had not yet been contacted by the service center.

  </p>

<p><u>March 28:</u> She replied to let me know she was still looking into the issue.

  </p>

<p><u>March 31:</u> I email <b>again</b> to ask why&nbsp;I had still not been contacted by the service center. <b>No response.</b>

  </p>

<p><u>April 3</u>: I email <b><i>for a third time</i> </b>to ask why I had still not been contacted by the service center.

  </p>

<p><u>April 4:</u> My rep called me in the morning to apologize for the wait and to let me know she had been away sick for the past week. She got my personal info from me again and let me know that I would&nbsp;be contacted shortly.

  </p>

<p><u>April 5:</u> I email my rep&nbsp;to let her know I still have not received an email from the service center.

  </p>

<p><u>April 6:</u> She replied&nbsp;and let me know it can be up to 3 days to receive a response.</p><p><u>April 7:</u>&nbsp;I receive an email from the Xbox Service Center, now asking me to ship my defective controller back with&nbsp;<b><i><u>my own funds.</u></i></b></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Below is the last email I sent to my customer service rep.&nbsp;To be clear - I&nbsp;am NOT&nbsp;complaining about the way I&nbsp;was treated by&nbsp;customer service rep I received: she was very courteous throughout the process. The&nbsp;lengthy,&nbsp;confusing repair process&nbsp;and the fact that Microsoft wants customers to pay to&nbsp;ship repairs for products under warranty is what I&nbsp;take&nbsp;issue with.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>Hello Rebecca,</p>

<p>After a long wait I finally received an email from the service center with instructions on how to return my controller. I was angered to find that, after all this time, Microsoft:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is now asking me to spend&nbsp;<i>more</i><b>&nbsp;</b>of<b>&nbsp;my own money</b>&nbsp;to&nbsp;ship&nbsp;<b>their defective controller</b>, which is&nbsp;<b>still</b>&nbsp;<b>within warranty</b>, to them;</p>

<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would like me to continue to wait for them to receive my shipment before they ship a new controller,</p>

<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They expect me to wait up to 10 additional days for the replacement once they receive and process my repair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is unacceptable. This email arrived on&nbsp;<u>April 7th</u>; I first contacted Microsoft on&nbsp;<u>March 4th</u>&nbsp;to request a repair. It has been&nbsp;<b>over a month –&nbsp;</b>not for my controller to be fixed, but<b>&nbsp;</b>just for me to get this email, which I should have received on day one. I have already spent&nbsp;<b>$25 of my own money</b>&nbsp;to receive&nbsp;<b>the wrong repair&nbsp;</b>with&nbsp;<b>no refund,</b>&nbsp;and Microsoft is now asking me to spend&nbsp;<b>more of my own money</b>&nbsp;to ship this controller back to them – something I was originally told wouldn’t be necessary.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>At this point,&nbsp;<b>I no longer want the controller</b>. I have no desire to spend more of my own time and money to receive support for something that is still&nbsp;under warranty. I have requested a return with the store I bought it from, and will be shipping it back this week. I wish I had simply done this in the first place to avoid this stress, time, and hassle.
</p><p><br /></p><p>Rebecca,&nbsp;I do not wish any ill will towards you,&nbsp;as I understand you are simply a front for the repair process and much of this is out of your control.&nbsp;You have been nothing but friendly and polite every time we have talked, and I have no complaints about your conduct in our exchanges. However, in every other aspect this has been the most terrible customer service experience I have ever had. I will be posting this on the Xbox forums to warn others about what they can expect if they attempt the repair process.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p><b>If Microsoft wants to win back any respect I once had for them as a customer, they will:</b></p>

<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Refund me for the thumbsticks I paid for under the impression I would be sent a replacement controller;</p>

<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compensate me for the time and stress this entire process has caused.</p>

                    I am running Windows 8.1 on an HP envy 700. &nbsp;I'm stuck in safe mode and cannot start any of the Office applications or most things that do not run on the XP style desktop. &nbsp;I can't find any instructions for getting out of safe mode in 8.1. they all seem
 to refer to XP or Vista Start button. &nbsp;without access to my phone list or task list i WORD, my Email in OUTLOOK etc, I'm going nuts.

<h2>            Windows was unable to create a required installation folder error 0x80070005</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased an 2.5GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 iMac running Snow Leopard, the most recent OS.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It has the most recent version of bootcamp and I then proceeded to install Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium, which I just purchased from the Microsoft store on Tuesday.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I was then proceeding to install the version of Windows 7 Professional Upgrade (educational version) that I also just purchased from the Microsoft store.<span>&nbsp;
</span><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While it recognizes the media, upon trying to copy files to the machines from the CD, it gives me an error message “windows was unable to create a required installation folder error 0x80070005”.&nbsp;
</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have since run all the updates on Windows 7 Home version and don’t know what to do next to get Professional Upgrade to install on the machine.<span>&nbsp;

            Try these following suggestions:<br />
<br />
The error 0x80070005 occurs if the upgrade has no permission to writecertain folder. Try the following steps:<br />
<br />
Reset permission<br />
============<br />
<br />
1. Please download the subinacl.msi file from the following link and save the installation patch onto the Desktop:<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e8ba3e56-d8fe-4a91-93cf-ed6985e3927b&amp;displaylang=en#AffinityDownloads<br />
<br />
2. Please go to the Desktop and double click the downloaded file.<br />
3. Please select the C:\Windows\System32 folder as the Destination Folder during the installation. Later we will use this tool to reset the permission settings on the current machine.<br />
<br />
4. Click the "Start" Button, in the "Start Search" bar, type: "notepad" (without quotes) and press Enter.<br />
5. Copy the following commands and then paste them into the opened Notepad window:<br />
<br />
@echo off<br />
<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=administrators=f<br />
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=administrators=f<br />
<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CURRENT_USER /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subkeyreg HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT /grant=system=f<br />
subinacl /subdirectories %SystemDrive% /grant=system=f<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@Echo Finished.<br />
@Echo =========================<br />
@pause<br />
<br />
6. After pasting the above commands, please close the Notepad window. Choose "Save" when you are prompted to save the file. Type "reset.bat" as the file name and choose "Desktop" from the left panel as the save location.<br />
<br />
7. Refer to the Desktop and right click the reset.bat file, then choose "Run as administrator."<br />
8. You will see a DOS-like window processing.<br />
<br />
NOTE: It may take several minutes, please be patient. When it is finished, you will be prompted with the message: "Finished, press any key to continue".<br />
<br />
If same thing happens, let's move to the next step.<br />
<br />
Run the upgrade by using the Built-in Administrator<br />
<br />
================================<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start button-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories.<br />
<br />
2. Right click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".<br />
<br />
3. Click Continue when the User Account Control window appears.<br />
<br />
4. Copy the following command and press Enter:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes<br />
<br />
5. Restart the computer and then log into the computer by this Administrator account.<br />
<br />
6. Run windows 7 upgrade.<br />
<br />
Error code 0x80070005 usually indicates that you don't have enough privilege or the operation is blocked. As I know, some programs (Boot Camp on Mac PC, etc.) may not be compatible with Windows 7, if you have installed these programs on the computer, you may
 not be able to perform the upgrade.&nbsp; You need to uninstall these programs before upgrading. Moreover, this kind of issue can be related to UAC, I recommend you toturn off UAC in Windows Vista , if you have installed any security software, try to uninstall
 the security application as well.<br />
<br />
BTW, for your references, I found some similar issues:<br />

</p><blockquote>Have tried several StarTech USB3.0 hubs with Surface Pro 3 and Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Ethernet connection&nbsp;with Startech driver for Windows 8 works most of the time but does cut out.&nbsp; Hopefully they will update their drivers.&nbsp; Was
 able to get&nbsp;USB 3.0 &nbsp;thumb drive to work eventually, after several types&nbsp;did not work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have much worse problems with Microsoft keyboards and Mice&nbsp;combinations.&nbsp; Connection is very&nbsp;flaky doesn't work or&nbsp;stops &nbsp;working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft hasn't&nbsp;updated hardware
 drivers for Windows 10, they need to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the Microsoft Sculpt Comfort keyboard and Mouse but giving up on those.&nbsp; Now trying Microsoft Bluetooth mouse, works most of them time but can go crazy and then have to restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will try&nbsp;Wireless 2000 keyboard
 but it still requires USB dongle so not optimistic.&nbsp;&nbsp; Does anyone had a good experience with USB 3.0 hubs and mice/keyboards?

<p>I had this similar issue with Renesas Electronics driver for my USB 3.0.&nbsp; Try launching your Task Manager (a.k.a. Startup Manager) and check whether your USB 3.0 Monitor is enabled.&nbsp; If disabled, your computer cannot find the device when you start your computer.&nbsp;
 Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I had issues with my Logitech MX5500 Wireless combo (Mouse &amp; Keyboard).&nbsp; While in the Task Manager, check whether the software for the mouse &amp; keyboard is enabled at startup.&nbsp; Reboot.&nbsp; If the issue persist, try reload the software for your mouse &amp;
 keyboard combo and check whether it is enabled at startup. Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>well, it was worth a try.&nbsp; i got my issues with my USB 3.0 and my wireless combo mouse and keyboard working properly.&nbsp; maybe a microsoft tech would jump in here and try his expertise to resolve your issues.&nbsp; good luck.<br />

            Hi MaryThomson2, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Let's try to apply the following suggestions:
<br />
<br />    On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key and R at the same time to invoke the Run box.
<br />    Type devmgmt.msc and click OK.
<br />Double click Sound, video and game controllers to expand the category.
<br />    Right click on your C-Media USB Audio Class driver, and click Uninstall device.
<br />    Then follow the on-screen instructions to finish the uninstallation.
<br />    Restart your computer.
<br />    Go to the manufacturer’s website to download and install the C-Media USB Audio Class driver on your computer.
<br />
<br />After reinstalling, restart your computer and see if your CMUSBDAC.sys blue screen has been fixed.
<br />
<br />Let me know, please. kinds Regards       
        </p>

<p>
</p><p>Are these the only two apps not working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try re-registering Windows apps.</p>
<p>Start &gt; Type PowerShell &gt; Right click on PowerShell &gt; Select Run As Administrator</p>
<p>Type or copy/paste the following into the window &gt; Press Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get-AppXPackage | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Disregard errors in red. Once the command executes, reboot the system then retry the apps.</p>

<h2>            win10 ntoskrnl.exe using broadband upload</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>couple of weeks ago noticed that my pc goes into this stupid more where for a period of time it will be uploading something(i think) even tho i haven't got any programs doing it... traced it back to&nbsp;ntoskrnl.exe, ran scans, health checks etc. nothing finds
 anything... it just does it for lets say an hour and then stops for a day, next time i boot up exact same thing happens.</p>
<p>any suggestions would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>cheers.</p>

<p>to be perfectly honest this is my fault for panicking over nothing, as it was my wifi channel, didnt check for ages and had quite a few wifi's that were on the same channel so obviously the file was doing probably nothing out of ordinary, just sipping small
 amount of data as usual.</p>
<p>all checked and sorted, thanks for help anyhow :)</p>
