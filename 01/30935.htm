    <title>File Explorer doesn&#39;t show thumbnails for photo files such as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack62  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Explorer doesn&#39;t show thumbnails for photo files such as JPEGs, TIFFs, or others&#63;</h2>
                    When I open File Explorer instead of showing a thumbnail of the picture it shows an icon representing the picture file. This is rather recent and I suspect another "new and improved" update. I remove the last update but that didn't help. Also, this same
 thing happens on mu spouse's desktop. Doesn't happen on my Dell XPS 15 laptop thought! Opening each photo file to see what it is can be very frustrating and time consuming. Any ideas on what might help?

            Hi Jack62 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Try following and check after each
<br />
<br />If these are Onedrive pictures (you can right click on a file &gt; Properties and see whether you path has Onedrive in it) - Right click on Onedrive app &gt; Uncheck Files On Demand &gt; Reboot your PC
<br />
<br />Otherwise do following for non Onedrive pictures
<br />
<br />1. I am assuming that in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Extra large icons. large icons or medium icons - One of them is checked, As these are only views which would show a thumbnail of picture. 
<br />
<br />2. Open File Explorer &gt; View tab &gt; Options &gt; View tab &gt; Uncheck Always show icons, never thumbnails (If this is already unchecked, check it and OK..Then go back again and uncheck it and OK
<br />
<br />3. Type control in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Control Panel &gt; Type system in Control Panel search box &gt; Click View advanced system settings &gt; Click Settings under Performance &gt; Check Show thumbnails instead of icons
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Zoo Tycoon Won&#39;t Load Past First Screen</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased and downloaded Zoo Tycoon from the Microsoft Store. All compatibility has been checked and everything. I'm running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I've tried it on three different computers and every single one I can load the game past the first advertising screens but am stuck on the actual gameplay screen that says "Press Space to Start" When pressing space or clicking it pretends it's
 going to load with a loading circle and then goes right back to saying "Press Space to Start".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled the store, reset the store, installed updates etc... so I'm at a lost considering I've used multiple computers. Thank you in advance!!&nbsp;</p>

<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<h2>            Skype for Mac audio volume always resets to a very low level</h2>
                    <p>HI, &nbsp;Im using skype 7.58 on OS X Sierra and just recently it started resetting the audio volume level of my headset to just about zero. &nbsp;Every time I make a call, I need to move up my system audio control to a usable level, but then next time I call or receive
 a call it gets reset back to a very low level. &nbsp;How can I fix this. &nbsp;It seems Skype has set a default level and I can't clear it &nbsp;or change it to default to a usable level</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>

    <title>Miracast in Windows 10 Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoalex1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Miracast in Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    My laptop model is Dell Inspiron 15R SE 7520. My laptop was capable to Intel WiDI software since Windows 8. After I upgraded my laptop to Windows 10, I'm no longer supported for the Intel WiDi software. Then, I decided to ask Intel about the wireless display
 question. They told me that the Intel WiDi software is&nbsp;discontinued and Miracast&nbsp;will be replaced to their software. Although I used the Connect(built-in app) to wirelessly project my screen to TV or projector, it said my hardware wasn't specifically&nbsp;design
 for wireless projection. As I mentioned earlier,&nbsp;my laptop was capable to use wireless projection(Intel WiDi)&nbsp;since Windows 8. That's mean I&nbsp;my hardware is "Designed" for the "Wireless Projection". I don't know why I have this error message and make my task
 more difficult. I will insert the hyperlink into this question in order to make it as a reference.<a href="https://communities.intel.com/message/414628#414628" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Reference">Dell Inspiron 15R SE 7520 in Intel WiDi</a>&nbsp;(

            <p>Hello together,</p>
<p>I use a Microsoft wireless display adapter together with my Surface Pro 3. All woked fine until the Anniversary update. My surface does not find the Adapter anymore. I did some tests and it seems that the wireless driver makes problems and does not support
 the Miracast option. Even the built-in "Connect" function states "Your device does not support Miracast ....". So this is true after the update but worked before.</p>
<p>It seems to be the same problem as described above...</p>
<p>Any recommendations?!?</p>
<p>Best regards</p>

<p>- Update for Surface Pro Embedded Controller Software (was only shown in the device manager but i am not sure, if this was the reason for the problem)</p>
<p>- Wireless Network driver was switched to "5GHz only". Selecting "Auto" it worked perfectly</p>

            <p>I also have Miracast problems since the Anniversary Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently own a Sony MP-CL1 Pico Projector. This is based on the same technology as the Celluon PicoPro (same laser diode). My laptop connected to the projector last month completely fine, and I had no problems using screen mirroring.<br />
<br />
However, one day, the function suddenly stopped working. I spent days pulling out my hair and couldn't figure out why, and would get random messages error messages on the projector saying that the "host device dropped the connection", "host device timed out",
 "could not establish P2P group", etc. The only thing that I could think of that has changed recently was the Anniversary Update, which was the latest and biggest update from Microsoft. (Keep in mind, I usually use my other notebook with Win7, and only use
 the Win10 ultrabook for screen mirroring projection and light web browsing.<br />
<br />
I know the projector definitely works because it continues to mirror both my android phones (android M) fine. And it also has no problem working through HDMI cables (although I guess that's through a wired connection, and an unfair comparison to the wireless
 issue at hand).<br />
<br />
I have tried deleting the device from the previously connected list, and tried doing fresh connections to the projector. I did notice that the computer was downloading? or installing? some type of drivers/files for the Sony MP-CL1 projector. The progress bar
 went all the way to the end and I didn't see any error messages.<br />
<br />
I have tried updating my Intel HD graphics drivers, but it was already updated (15.40.26.4474). The same goes for my Intel Wireless Pro drivers too. (19.2.0)<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone else has had issues with their Windows 10 mirroring function (especially after the Anniversary Update) and if they found any solutions to fix it. Any help/suggestions would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>***Update***<br />
I don't know if this is useful information or not, but I just tried to use my notebook as a receiver display for my android phone (mirror my Android phone onto my notebook display using the "Connect" app from the Anniversary Update), and the whole phone image
 just gets scrambled and frozen.&nbsp; It seems that Miracast is just completely broken in both sending and receiving after the Anniversary Update.<br />
<br />
I see two different errors on the notification window: 1. "Protected content cannot be viewed on device." 2. "The device that is wirelessly projecting doesn't support input from this receiver's mouse."</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying to connect, I also notice that there is a new device added to my device manager under "Miracast display devices".&nbsp; It is named "MP-CL1_DB", which is basically the model of my Sony Pico Projector.&nbsp; Opening the properties of that device, I can
 see that the current driver version is some generic driver named "Miracast display port driver V2" with Driver versions 10.0.14393.0.&nbsp; The driver is also really outdated at 6/21/2006.&nbsp; I try to find updated drivers through the web, but it informs me that that
 is the latest driver available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already contact Intel about the issue, and their tech support has informed me that Windows 10 Anniversary Update has broken their WiDi in their drivers.&nbsp; They suggested that I contact Microsoft on the issue because the OS is blocking the computer
 form using their Intel implementation for Wi-fi Direct for the Miracast.&nbsp; So, its really only Microsoft that can fix the issue now.&nbsp; Is there any updates that will be rolling out to fix Miracast?</p>

            <p>Some of the same issues as Ragnarok7. Using a Surface Pro 4 and Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter, I can typically connect to Miracast, but there is a significant lag now that wasn't&nbsp;there before the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, there is also significant
 pixelation; video playback is impossible due to these issues. The display adapter is working great, I have had to resort to using my Android phone to give presentations using the same adapter.</p>
<p>I purchased my Surface Pro specifically for presentations&nbsp;and have had no issues until the Anniversary Update. Microsoft, I hope you will be able to get a fix out to us soon, my Surface Pro has turned into a very expensive paperweight.</p>

            <p>Yeah, I'm in the same boat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to take a dive and spend about $1300 for nice portable ultrabook and portable projector to use on the go on presentations.&nbsp; Basically, I wanted a portable kit to use for both work and entertainment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything worked great for the first month and I could not be happier getting things done more efficiently and comfortably.&nbsp; But then one day, the anniversary update came out, and as I was shutting down my computer it went through some big update.&nbsp; From
 that day forward, Miracast stopped working completely.&nbsp; Connections just hangs then errors out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I would just refund and return things if they don't work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But since both the notebook and the projector was past the 30 day purchase window, I just have wasted $1300 on a useless presentation kit that I can't return.&nbsp; After contacting Intel, Sony, and Microsoft, Intel and Sony both stated on their support that
 Microsoft was the culprit with its anniversary update and that it broke Intel's wireless direct drivers and compatibility with Miracast.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft support on the other hand, just stated that they understand my issue but can't do anything about it, and that I should just wait for updates to come out (some solution.... =_=).&nbsp; But they have no info about if an update is even coming that would
 fix it (no ETA whatsoever).&nbsp; I just wish that a Microsoft rep could confirm that they logged the issue as a bug in their systems, and that someone IS working on a patch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided as much detail as possible on the issue, but if this goes unfixed, this kit just continues to be a $1300 paperweight.&nbsp; Seriously sucks...</p>

            Just so I can say that I tried, I went out and purchased the new design Microsoft adapter... no luck, the delay is better, but videos are still pixilated and the sound is broken up. But, on the plus side, Microsoft did manage to get another $50 bucks from
 me, so I guess the adapter is a success from a marketing standpoint!

            <p>Wow, if that is the case, then it's really messed up!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, it doesn't even matter if we are willing to buy brand new hardware.&nbsp; The very fact that it is running on windows 10 means Miracast projection will be broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So while Microsoft is claiming the solution is to just sit tight and "wait" for patches.&nbsp; It seems like the REAL solution is to NOT use windows 10?&nbsp; I guess we should be preparing to downgrade to an older OS then?&nbsp; From a profit perspective, that seems like
 a pretty silly selling point to a customer, taking away a feature with an "update".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This reminds me of Apple.&nbsp; They TAKE AWAY an audio jack for the new iPhone and claims that this is a "FEATURE".&nbsp; Maybe Microsoft is doing the same?&nbsp; "We removed Miracast as a new key feature in Windows 10, isn't it great?!?!" =_="</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>While this post is labeled as the answer, it is not the solution for this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you could look at the original post as well as the posts that I have put in this thread, problems are not in regards to the Microsoft Miracast adapter but with Miracast in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, devices that worked with Intel's WiDi no longer work after the anniversary update.&nbsp; The anniversary update has blocked WiDi from functioning properly and did not provide the proper alternative drivers to work with other Miracast devices to maintain
 wireless projection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my particular situation, it is in regards to Sony's MP-CL1, but as others have stated, it affects other devices that originally use WiDi too.&nbsp; Please look into this issue and release a Windows 10 patch to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those that bought really expensive hardware purely for wireless projection just lost all their money because of a silly "anniversary update" that didn't have to be there.</p>

    <title>Why is my audio switching between headphones and speakers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoovz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my audio switching between headphones and speakers</h2>
                    I have recently brought a HP pavillion dm1 which uses IDT hd audio. &nbsp;It has one output for headphone, well actually a headset with microphone.<br />
I have just headphones plugged it and the audio randomly switches between playback through the phones and through the internal speakers.<br />
No, HP have no solution, they don't care, in fact they just remade the entire laptop with&nbsp;separate&nbsp;phones out and mic in.<br />
even when u disable external microphone it still does the switching, im not going to download another IDT codec&nbsp;because&nbsp;the forums reveal that when u do you loose audio altogether.<br />
Is there anyway of getting rid of the IDT codec and using a standard windows codec that'l consider the mini jack I/O port as only a phones out?<br />
Theres no way i can use and keep this laptop if it does this forever, for me its useless without a WORKING PHONES SOCKET, i would have got an ipod or a different laptop if i had known this would happen.<br />

</span><span>Unfortunately the only option is, try to uninstall the current driver and Codec from Device manager (and remove all “ghosted devices”)</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315539</a></span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Then shut down the computer and restart and see if Windows will use a generic driver for the audio device.
</span></p>
<p><span>If this does not work the only other option is to try to work with HP for a resolution.</span><span><br />
</span><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Win10 CmdLineExtInstallerExe.exe Every time for one specific - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill&#39;s lenovo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 CmdLineExtInstallerExe.exe Every time for one specific application</h2>
                    <p>Starting about a week ago (around June 1 2017), when I would start Oxford Hachett French Dictionary, it would ask me each time if I wanted to allow CmdLineExtInstallerExe.exe to run.&nbsp; I'd say yes, and it would start.&nbsp; Since this was a bother,&nbsp; I fiddled
 with it, flipping 'run as administrator' on (perhaps not the brightest idea), and now it asks, each time, if I want to allow OHD.EXE (the program's executable) to run.&nbsp; I say yes, and the program starts.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why it's asking suddenly (though that massive update about a week ago is my guess), or why it does not remember my answer. This is not a big, big deal, but it's irritating.&nbsp; Doesn't help that some sites suggest that CmdLineExtInstallerExe.exe
 is a threat!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea about how to resolve this? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Hello -</p>
<p>I signed into Command Prompt as an administrator and entered this command: SFC.EXE /SCANNOW.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>I received this response when the scan was complete: "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations"&nbsp;

<p>Hello Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The command line that you encounter could be a file extension or an executable file of the program that you're trying to launch. There could be a file corruption that is why you're being prompted by it. For us to get this fixed, we recommend that you uninstall
 the program, then reinstall it. To do that, simply type <strong>Programs and Features
</strong>in the search field or Cortana, hit on the Enter key, look for the name of the program in the list, then click on
<strong>Uninstall.</strong> We also suggest that you search for every folder that is associated with that program and delete everything. Then reinstall. This process will make the program start fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we also suggest that you get in touch with the developer of that specific program for further assistance. They can further assist you as they have the complete resources and tools about your program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h3> paul &#40;dub&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Teams app, camera disconnects every 5 seconds and goes black then comes back on</h2>
                    <p>This happens only in the app. It works fine in the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started out by trying a new camera and ended up changing to a complete new machine and the issue has followed me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens if I connect to someones meeting or even as the only person. If I create a new meeting it will show my camera view preview and before I click the meet now button the camera stays on fine. Once I click meet now the camera starts to disconnect/reconnect
 cycle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype meetings work fine.</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your details. Please reboot your PC and make sure other programs are not using the camera. Then check if the issue persists. Besides, you need to make sure the driver is up to date.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can try to re-install the application to see if the issue persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For further assistance, please provide more details to us:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please try another network to see if there is any update.&nbsp;</li><li>May I know if there is any error message? If so, please provide a screenshot of it.&nbsp;</li><li>Please check whether other users encounter the same issue in your organization.&nbsp;</li><li>You need to check whether the app is up to date.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>

<p>A reboot is not going to fix this... Thats the first thing I tried and did you not see my comment on changing out all hardware and the problem followed me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Another network is not the issue, the web browser teams works fine</p>

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have tried another camera, PC, it is suggested to ask your coworker to sign in his account on your PC and check if the issue persists. If so, the issue might be related to your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, have you tried a re-install as I mentioned? If so, please let us know the result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My Win 10 is activated and when I try to create a systems image it gives me the attached window, no matter how I try to get at the systems image option. I was able to create a recovery CD, but not on a thumb drive. After many attempts I phoned and the tech
 assistance told me that the Intel NUC was considered a computer not supported by Microsoft. That despite the fact that they had activated Win 10

 old desktop. In the end I used a third party backup program, with no problems. But I prefer using Microsoft's backup as that minimizes the possibility of activating a re-installment.</p>

            Before doing that, I want to ensure this will not compromise the activation status of the OS. I needed MS tech support to activate Win10 when I transferred it to this computer. An eight block digital code was used. Maybe the MS techs altered the registry?

            Well, I found there was already a statement on portability in the registry, so I decided to try your proposal and it worked. My OS is still activated. Thanks very much. The question arises of how that entry in my registry got there, as the OS was previously
 on a clunky mid size desktop. BTW I discovered that I could copy your suggested statement into the DOS Command Line rather than having to type it. That was after two statement errors that were tricky to find.<br />

<h2>            download windows 10 1709 to usb</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a hp with 27gb hard drive which i have supplemented with a number of 128gb flash drive that all files are stored on that can used without being on the c: drive and I cant update windows. As it stands 16 gb is categorized reserved &amp; system and the
 update requires 8 gb I have removed all i can but there are still stray gb's that i can't identify or remove. I've gone through the boards and tried all the suggestions. The media creation tool won't let me create a usb boot disk because i don't have 8 gb
 of free memory. surely at this stage Windows need to have sorted this problem which according google is a wide spread problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is greatly welcome</p>

            First make sure your computer is completely virus/malware-free. Having McAfee doesn't prove this.<br />
<br />
Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
If the computer is clean, manage your Startup to remove the call for TrayApp.<br />
<br />
<span>Start&gt;Run&gt;msconfig [enter]<br />
<br />
This brings up the System Configuration Utility. Look on the Startup tab and find the probable culprit. Uncheck the box next to its name, Apply and OK out. You don't need to restart immediately, but the next time you do you'll get a dialog saying you've used
 the Utility. Just tick the box that says in effect, "don't bother me about this again".<br />
<br />
Important - Do not use the System Configuration Utility to stop processes. Instead, use Start&gt;Run&gt;services.msc [enter]
</span><span>and do not stop any services unless you really, really know what you're doing.</span>

<p>Microsoft has broken something recently in the latest Windows and it's not fixed several months later. You used to be able to open (say) www.google.co.uk and then when you looked in advanced settings, you could change the default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But on new laptops/new builds, this doesn't work - it gets stuck at this:</p>

<p>
</p><p>In most cases, rebooting and trying again might work but I've just commissioned two laptops today. One allowed me to change the default, the second is stuck in the above.</p>
<p><br />
Very annoying! And needs fixing...</p>

    <title>GPO Default Driver Location - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason lay  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPO Default Driver Location</h2>
                    <p>I want to configure a default search location for drivers via Group Policy.&nbsp; I have a folder on my deployment server which has all the drivers for the different Dells we use at the Office.&nbsp; I wanted to give computer object accounts in AD read access to this
 folder, and then configure a GPO to set this location so the computers search in the shared driver&nbsp;folder&nbsp;as the primary location by default.&nbsp; Is this possible?</p>

 all and my motherboard and video card drivers are ALL current and up to date as of march 2013. my issue is this, when i boot up my pc i get the bios splash screen for a few seconds, then the widows screen appears with the boot animation logo. as the logo plays
 about the first second of animation it then pauses for 1 whole second, then continues the animation. the screen then goes briefly dark and the login screen gets horribly chopped up in sound and the screen showing and not showing, then all a sudden after 4-5
 seconds my login screen appears normal and everything is fine afterwards. i just cant see whats giving this problem, i have uninstalled and reinstalled windows 7, drivers and everything serveral times to no avail. i have swapped

            <p>Hi <strong>RubenPerez</strong>,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching us out on Microsoft Community Forums. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like there is lag&nbsp;while booting and unexpected behaviour at the login screen. Let's analyze and identify the cause of the issue.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate the steps that you have tried to resolve the issue. This issue could also occur if the&nbsp;RAM is&nbsp;damaged and needs to be repaired.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform the steps provided and check. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><font><font color="#000000"><font>Method 1:</font></font></font></b></p>
<p><font color="#000000">I suggest you to remove the RAM sticks and fix it and try running the memory diagnostic program.</font></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may run chkdsk from WINRE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to troubleshoot this issue will run chkdsk from WinRE(Windows Recovery Environment )mode and check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow these steps to run CHKDSK :</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Use the Windows 7 DVD to start the computer in Windows Recovery (WinRE).</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>In WinRE, open a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>On the Install Windows screen, select the appropriate Language to install, Time and currency format, and Keyboard or input method options, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span> </span></span></span>Click the Windows 7 installation that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span> </span></span></span>Click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the command prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:</p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /p</b></p>
<p><b>chkdsk drive: /r</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important: </strong>While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when chkdsk tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the help so far...
<div>i started out yesterday doing the chkdsk on my hard drive. end result. no errors its 100% fine. then i ran the WMDT. i ran the basic test with 2 passes, no problems found. i then ran the standard test with 2 passes, no problems found. i then ran the extended
 test with 2 passes. the first pass completed no problems found, mind you this took all night. i woke up today with pass 2 in progress so i checked it once i got home from work today. come to find out my system froze on pass 2 while the test was at 91% complete
 of pass 2. it was a total hard lock, nothing would exit the test or turn off my computer. i then had to force it off with pushing the power button for over 5 seconds. i rebooted my pc and of course my issue continues as decribed. with the system freezing on
 the memory diagnostic, is this a good indication my ram has gone bad? i wont be able to test out new ram until i can buy new sticks.</div>

<p>It looks like one of the memory stick is bad or damaged. I would suggest you to replace the memory stick with a new one.

    <title>Joystick z axis rotation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joffleader  say:</h3>
<h2>            Joystick z axis rotation</h2>
                    <p>I have a generic USB joystick and Windows joystick calibration is seeing all the axes and buttons just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it is treating the Z rotation (stick twist) axis a permanently pulled over to one side, and i cannot calibrate it to the centre. This means that every game that detects the axis has constant spinning with the stick plugged in. sure, I can unplug
 it for games where I'm not using it, but this happens in games where i want to use it as well, making them unplayable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to force the configuration to either centre the axis or disable/ignore it entirely?</p>
<p>

<p>That's generally due to the stick/hardware being stuffed. Not to do with Windows or your controllers software</p>
<p>(btw -&nbsp; Controllers that are limited to X-Input don't have profiling software. Those that use both the 'old' D-Input and the</p>
<p>XBOX - X-Input - often have profiling software to create custom button layouts when using the D-Input option).</p>

            OK well it's a brand new stick and everything else is fine, and the axis rotates smoothly, it's literally just offset. What i want is to know how to compensate for this or fix it, not a smug putdown, thanks.

<p>Where did you interpret what I said as a&nbsp; "smug put down" ?</p>
<p>How was I to know your controller it new ? You said 'generic' . <em>New</em> is not in your post.</p>
<p>Regardless, being new does not mean it can't be faulty out of the&nbsp; box.</p>
<p>I've never had a problem with the buttons, only the sticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sticks do often, very often, wear out - go off centre. I've had it happen with a number of controllers&nbsp; over the years.</p>
<p>I have a horrible track record with my favourite controllers stick - Logitech G13, and to a lesser extent other standard gaming controller sticks.</p>
<p>Not out of the box, but sometimes short lived.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try as I may, I have never been able to fix a stick that was 'off centre' by using the calibration settings (or by using DW40 or compressed air).</p>
<p>Software does not compensate for faulty hardware. Frankly... Software 'calibration' is bs (Well, not entirely. It helps confirm the stick does not center).&nbsp; The stick centres, or it doesn't. Well, that's my experience over the years.</p>
<p>If you leave it plugged in, and games go wild when using the mouse... the stick is stuffed. You may be able to wiggle it about</p>
<p>and get the mouse back to normal, but the stick is basically ... stuffed, or soon to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you said - <em>"literally just offset" . </em>That's the telling point. You can verify if the controller is faulty by connecting another one.
</p>
<p>Double down on that test and connect your controller to another PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for including what you may have thought as extraneous information re- Input types. Some people don't know there</p>
<p>are different types of controller inputs because XBOX has ruled the roost (and dumbed-down controller button customisation options)</p>
<p>for so long that I thought you may find that information interesting. I tend to get carried away with offering information not requested.<br />

 with the machine with a new 7200 RPM hard drive. &nbsp;Some friends told me that it is perfectly safe while others informed me that it would burn out and possibly damage my laptop. &nbsp;What do you all think? &nbsp;Thanks in advance to anyone who answers!</p>

            <p>If this is relevant you should be seeing an Event ID 7026 Source; Service Control Manager in Event Viewer.
<strong>Description:<br />
</strong>The following boot-start or system-start driver(s) failed to load: &lt;device name&gt;</p>
<p>Device: SBRE - This was due to a Viper (GFI) product being uninstalled. It apparently doesn't remove all the registry keys and it keeps trying to start a nonexistent driver. You can delete the registry keys:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\Root\LEGACY_SBRE <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SBRE <br />
<br />
If you can't delete one of the keys, right click on that key and choose permissions, then click advanced then go to the owner tab and add yourself as the owner. Then you should be able to delete the keys<br />

<p>Going deeper I think the device has a connection with a mobile phone. I found references to UAG and an adfs driver. It is something that either was or is unsupported.</p>
<p>What happens if you uninstall the device?</p>
