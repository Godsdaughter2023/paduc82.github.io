    <title>Windows 10 not recognizing newly purchased Touch Screen Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sabersonic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 not recognizing newly purchased Touch Screen Monitor</h2>
                    <p>I had updated my Dell Inspiron from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 several months ago. I should also mention that said computer had no touch screen monitor previously.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then recently I purchased a ViewSonic TD2220 22" Touch Screen LCD and downloaded all the drivers required of it from the CD that was included. Yet, Windows 10 did not recognize the touch screen function of the monitor. I have set the tablet mode of my PC
 to "on" and yet it still does not recognize it. I tried other Microsoft Community topics and questions, but I was unable to locate the "Touch and Pen" option to calibrate the monitor to be recognized as a touch screen and I was unable to locate the monitor
 under Human Interface Devices under Device Manager. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do so that Windows 10 can recognize my touch screen monitor as a touch screen besides download drivers since I have already done said process?</p>

</p><p>I am unable to run the Program Compatibility Troubleshooter simply because when I attempted to use the search bar and enter "run programs", Cortana instead searches the internet rather then perform said program search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried to locate the driver in question, that being "monitor.sys", it does not have a compatibility tab for me to open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus I am unable to access any means of compatibility to allow any drivers to perform in&nbsp;a previous version of windows.</p>

            <p>Well, I just realized the problem through the ViewSonic Support e-mail, though they didn't really address the solution directly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, it was described as a "plug and play" operation. Curious, I unplugged the USB cable for the monitor from the computer and plugged it back in, though also note that I was also connected to the internet at the time. Needless to say, Windows 10 was
 not only able to recognize the monitor as a touch screen, but also downloaded the necessary software and drivers for said use. I can only assume that when the instruction manual said to plug the USB cable for the monitor into the PC, it was with the presumption
 that the computer is connected to the internet at the time of installation so that above mentioned drivers can be downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I feel sorry about voting the monitor "not compatible with Windows 10" before even trying this option.</p>

<p>I don't believe the problem is with the console. The ios Xbox app can find my console just fine. It is the ios Game Pass app that can not find my home console nor the other xbox one on the same network. keeps saying "sign in on an Xbox and we'll set it as
 your default" when in the settings.&nbsp; When you try and remote install a game it pops up with "first, select your default Xbox... go to settings&gt;select default xbox to select your default console".</p>
<p>you can uninstall the app and start over and it still does it over and over again.</p>

                    Somthing caused the system to have a stop 7b error, one of the solutions on the knowledge base was to do a repair on XP Home.&nbsp; The repair went well but after I click on the user name, windows tells me I MUST ACTAVATE NOW.&nbsp; Fine go ahead and activate, I
 wait and wait but now activation window appears so I can activate.&nbsp; Any clues as to how I might finish rescueing this system?<br />

<p><strong><span>Warning</span> </strong></p>
<p><span><strong>The following instructions involve editing your system registry. Using the Windows Registry Editor incorrectly can cause serious problems that require the reinstallation of your operating system and possible loss of
</strong></span></p>
<hr />
<p><strong><span><span>Editing the registry</span><br />
</span></strong>Begin by opening the Registry Editor and navigating to<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\WindowsNT\Current Version\WPAEvents<br />
<br />
In the right pane, right-click the ODBETimer binary value and select Modify. Change at least one character of this value to either a number from 0 to 9 or to a letter from A to F, then click OK and close the Registry Editor. This renders the current product
 key invalid and deactivates Windows.<br />
<br />
Now, it’s time to reactivate Windows using your new product key. Click Start | Run and enter the command:<br />
<span>%systemroot%\system32\oobe\msoobe /a</span><br />
<br />
where %systemroot% is your Windows directory. In many cases, this command will look like:<br />
<span>C:\windows\system32\oobe\msoobe.exe /a</span><br />
<br />
At this point, Windows will launch the Product Activation Wizard.<br />
<br />
Follow the activation wizard and select phone activation. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</p>

You know, this would help alot if activation worked in safe mode. I appreciate the help, but activation will not work in safe mode, and it does not start in regular mode, I have seen this problem so many times, after a cleanup of spyware, some spyware programs
 can jack up the registry causing a bluescreen or there is a rootkit with a driver removed causes a bluescreen. so then a repair install is attempted. 8 times out of 10, the repair install does not work, it may or may not complete, sometimes claiming files
 are missing during the repair install. other times it goes through flawlessly, then when windows starts it says Windows must be activated. Here the user accepts the activation, yet it never comes up, all you see is a desktop background. ctrl+alt+del, alt-f4,
 etc do not work. because the system is locked out of those options until windows is activated. Usually the first sign of this outcome is the last part of the windows install where it says please wait, and the hard drive loops activity at a steady rate, yet
 nothing ever happens. You can alt-f4 this part, then you only have an arrow. the only way to get around this is rebooting. then you are left were we left off, windows needs activation yet activation will not start. again, you can access the system in non-networking
 safe mode. but nothing else. The last time this has happened to me&nbsp;the spyware&nbsp;was brought on a clients computer in the form of something called "Wind Optimizer" among other things like a rogue "safety center" disguised like a Microsoft program. it looks really
 close to microsoft security center.<br />
<br />
anything else we can try? I have heard of moving a file from an activated copy on the same machine with the same key.<br />
I would rather find the root of the problem which I believe has to do with the out of box experience software that never starts after a repair install "oobe"<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
After some searching, I found what I was looking for, in safe mode try this:<br />
<br />
In this example: Your activation period has expired, (past 30 days) and you need to get to Normal mode again.<br />
<br />
1. Turn On your PC<br />
<br />
2. Press F8 repeatedly and go to Safe Mode<br />
<br />
3. Logon as per normal <br />
(note: Administrator password is usually blank, but hopefully you know your password)<br />
<br />
4. Allow the Desktop to fully load (answering "Yes" to continue into Safe Mode)<br />
(note: This is just a long way of saying go to Safe Mode)<br />
<br />
5. Click on Start - Run<br />
<br />
6. Type in exactly: rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk (and click OK)<br />
(note: one space, after "rundll32.exe " also the Oo are two letter o's in "oobe"; capitals and comma are important)<br />
<br />
7. Wait a couple of seconds (although you will Not see any change)<br />
<br />
8. Restart your PC normally (Start - Shutdown - Restart - Ok)<br />
<br />
9. You are now able to go to Normal Mode again (For another 30 days !!!)<br />
<br />
10. Install IE8, do not pass go do not install ie7, install ie8. that should solve not being able to browse and not being able to activate somehow it's tied to the broken ie. Let me know if this works. Now do whatever you like, you're back to Normal.<br />
<br />
This fixed it for me but took me a long time to find this and get it going, hopefully it works for you to.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            Rebuy a game&#63;</h2>
                    <p>so I have a game called earth defense force 2017. I have it on a Xbox 360 disc. I put it in my Xbox and it says that' it' not backwards compatible. Okay. So I check the store and it' in the store. Is there a way I can get a code for it since I already own it? I bought it for like 40 when it came out. I figured since it' in the store that I should be able to play it. Or am I screwed and have to buy it again for 15?</p>

    <title>Issues with Xbox One mic audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the ham factory  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Xbox One mic audio</h2>
                    
<p>Like many other people out there, I have encountered the problem where, with my Xbox One headset (the $60 one, not the one that came with the console), I can hear party chat and game volume and everything just fine, but the mic does not pick up audio coming
 from my end. Because of this, party members cannot hear me. I have also tried testing using the Skype voice echo to see if it was a problem with parties, and the result still came out with no audio from my end.</p>
<p><br />
Before anyone tries to suggest the typical solution methods, I will preemptively say that my network connection exceeds all the requirements for Xbox Live online activity and there are no problems with my network. Additionally, I have already cycled power to
 my console, signed out and back in to my account, made sure that the controller that I am using is associated with my account, and checked for controller updates. My controller has no problems with charge (I have tried with both the controller plugged in through
 USB, and with the controller on batteries). I am absolutely 100% sure that I do not have mute on and that I have not muted myself on Xbox Live. The microphone is securely plugged in to the Xbox One Stereo Headset Adapter, which is also securely plugged into
 the controller. I have already tried several times removing and reconnecting both of these, as well as the controller, to no avail. I do not have a Kinect, nor do I have any other audio devices connected to my Xbox One.</p>
<p>At this point, I seem to have exhausted all my options, considering what I've read with other peoples' similar issues online. People usually conclude that it's just the headset that is broken and that I'd just have to suck it up and buy a new one; but this
 is where they're wrong. As I wish not to waste another $60 on a headset that may possibly give me the same issue again, I tried testing my headset by using the microphone as the audio input for my computer, and lo and behold, the headset itself isn't actually
 broken. The headset still works.</p>
<p>Would someone please be so kind as to finally put an end to my tireless journey to find a solution to my headset problem and properly advise me in how to address this issue, rather than regurgitate the usual spiel for technical support? Any real help in
 resolving this issue would be greatly appreciated by me and any others that may also be experiencing this frustrating issue.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t add network printer because &#34;access is denied&#34;. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edwardmoore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t add network printer because &#34;access is denied&#34;.</h2>
                    I have two Windows 7 PCs networked.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Homegroup function works great except for the issue of printing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When using the "add printer" dialogue under "devices and printers", while my computer detects the existence of the printer on the second PC, it is unable to access the printer or install the requisite drivers because "access is denied".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both computers are using only Windows Firewall.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've ensured that Local Security Policy / Local Policies / Security Options / Devices: Prevent Users from Installing Printer Drivers is disabled on both computers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've also ensured that Point and Print restrictions are disabled on both computers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Both the windows32/spool and windows32/spool/PRINTERS folders are shared with full permissions on the network.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The printer itself is set to be shared on the Homegroup.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Homegroup is set to allow sharing of printers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I understand that others have had this issue. It can be partially resolved by adding the printer as a local printer, but this makes printing slow and error-ridden (especially when attempting to, for instance, print double sided).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How can this problem be fixed?</div>

<div><br />
The issue arose after Windows 7 installed manufacturer drivers for the printer.
<div><br />
<div>The driver - in this instance the Win7 64 bit driver for the HP P1005 printer - doesn't work (even as a local printer).</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I rolled the driver back to the "default" Microsoft version. Afterwards, the printer functioned as a local printer, but not as a network printer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The troubleshooter identifies an out-of-date driver as the issue, but when I attempt to install the appropriate driver from the PC (to which the printer is connected) I get the "access is denied" dialogue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Incidentally, UAC is temporarily disabled on both computers. Both have administrator&nbsp;privileges.</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 hangs intermittently, Ctrl-Alt-Delete results in black screen</h2>
                    Greetings - my first post here, so I'll try to be thorough.<br />
<br />
I've been working on a project with a client who had me build them four computers, three of which are identical as far as hardware is concerned.&nbsp; One of the three identical ones is having an issue, the other two have not presented any problems at all.<br />
<br />
System Specifications:<br />
Processor: Intel Core i5-650 3.2GHz Dual Core<br />
Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-H55M-USB3<br />
Memory: 4GB Crucial (2xCT25664BA1339)<br />
PSU: 300W<br />
Hard Drives: 2x Seagate Barracuda ST3500413AS 500GB in RAID 1 configuration<br />
Optical Drive: Lite-On iHAS424-98<br />
OS: Win7 Pro SP1 64-bit<br />
<br />
I have performed a number of diagnostic and troubleshooting steps to try to resolve the issue and it bears mentioning that the specifics of the problem have changed, but not gone away since the beginning.&nbsp; The systems were delivered at the end of May.<br />
<br />
The original problem surfaced when the customer would leave the system unattended/idle for a period of time (for an hour or two while at a meeting, or overnight).&nbsp; When she would attempt to wake the system, the screen would come on, displaying all programs
 that were previously running and she could for a limited time interact with the programs (minimize, restore) and the start menu.&nbsp; However, she was unable to open new programs and after a few moments, she could not interact at all.&nbsp; The cursor indicated busy
 and was still circling, and it could be moved, however the system would not respond to any clicks or keystrokes, including Ctrl-Alt-Del.&nbsp; This necessitated a hard power off.<br />
<br />
We first disabled all of the power-saving settings, forcing the system to maintain normal operation.&nbsp; No sleep, hybrid sleep, or hibernation, and I believe we even turned off the screen power off.<br />
<br />
To diagnose this, I first removed each hard drive from the computer and tested it outside of the RAID array in another computer, using Seagate's SeaTools.&nbsp; The diagnostics found no problem on either drive.&nbsp; Having reinstalled the drives into the system, I ran
 a complete CHKDSK scan, including the surface scan, it reported nothing but a few filesystem errors which I presume were related to the improper shutdowns.<br />
<br />
I ran Memtest overnight for several passes of the memory and it was still scanning in the morning, having reported no errors.<br />
<br />
These steps did not resolve the issue so we reinstalled Windows 7 after formatting the hard drives.&nbsp; The problem resurfaced the same day.&nbsp; Suspecting that it might be a discrepancy with the power supply, I exchanged the one in the affected system with one from
 one of the identical ones.&nbsp; The unaffected system has not had any kind of problems since, yet the affected system continued to act in the same manner.<br />
<br />
Suspecting it might be a more deeply rooted problem, I ordered a replacement motherboard and swapped that out.&nbsp; The new motherboard immediately recognized the RAID configuration of the two drives and no reinstallation was required, however, the same problem
 persisted.<br />
<br />
Since I'd seen some allusions to graphics being the root of this problem and this being a Clarkdale processor with integrated graphics, I ordered a replacement processor, and for good measure, two additional hard drives.&nbsp; I reinstalled Windows 7 on the two
 new hard drives and swapped out the processor.&nbsp; For the record, the two original hard drives have since been installed in other systems with no problems presenting.<br />
<br />
Now the problem has changed.&nbsp; The system no longer hangs after a period of being idle.&nbsp; It has, however, twice in the past week hung during normal use, first while restoring a Firefox session, and the second time while watching a DVD.&nbsp; When the customer presses
 Ctrl-Alt-Del, now the screen goes black except for the cursor which, as before, continues to spin and is movable.&nbsp; A hard power off is again necessitated.<br />
<br />
The only remaining original components in this computer are the chassis itself, two memory modules, the optical drive, and the SATA cables.<br />
<br />
I could easily enough replace either the memory or the optical drive, though I don't personally believe that either of these are at fault.&nbsp; Has anyone else seen a similar scenario and which direction would you suggest going from here?<br />
<br />
Best wishes,<br />
Roy<br />

<br />
Thanks for the reply.<br />
<br />
As stated in the original post, this is a brand new system assembled in late May, 2011.&nbsp; The problem has existed since assembly and delivery.<br />
<br />
The system has been completely reinstalled twice and the problem has persisted through every installation and the software is identical between this system and two other unaffected systems, so it is not a problem with corruption or software conflicts.<br />
<br />

            This is a really old thread. You should start a new one of your own. I'm sure that people will be more than willing to try and help you. In the new thread...does this happen if you *don't* install Office 2010?<br />

If it were only that simple.&nbsp; This particular workstation was using Office 2007, however, after swapping out every part in the system at least once, we eliminated the problem by disabling the hardware RAID1 and going with just a single hard drive.&nbsp; The controller
 was by JMicron.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, it seems that this problem only affects *some* of the systems built in this configuration, leading me to believe there might be a slight manufacturing defect somewhere on the board.&nbsp; There were three identical systems, of which this was one, and
 a fourth which was almost identical but for the choice of processor.&nbsp; In addition, one other system was built and delivered to another client with again, the same configuration (again, excepting the processor) and this computer too exhibited the same behavior
 until RAID was disabled.&nbsp; In all cases, the Gigabyte GA-H55M-USB3 board with the the JMicron controller.&nbsp; Once RAID was disabled, none of the affected systems ever froze again.<br />
<br />
Sorry this doesn't seem to relate to your problem.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Won&#39;t Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kirstilouise  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Won&#39;t Install</h2>
                    <p>Steps I've completed:</p>
<p>1. Downloaded Upgrade Tool from here:&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-upgrade?ocid=win10_wol_banner_upgrade</p>
<p>2. Opened said tool, got this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dca6e04f-3235-4753-b249-139c0397b876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dca6e04f-3235-4753-b249-139c0397b876" /></a></p>
<p>3. Clicked "Upgrade now," obviously, got this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d6f835f-b883-4115-b81d-c15569c1c0e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d6f835f-b883-4115-b81d-c15569c1c0e3" /></a></p>
<p>4. Clicked "Upgrade now" again, got this page:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e2435e3-09db-4774-b463-639b400c5993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e2435e3-09db-4774-b463-639b400c5993" /></a></p>
<p>5. That page just closed and now I have no idea what to do! I did this same thing several times, tried re-installing the upgrading tool, attempted to find any downloaded program files on the system to run, but I have only a very very very very basic knowledge
 of these things, so I couldn't figure it out. </p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Came to this forum for help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what info is necessary to figure out the issue, but I'm running on a first gen MS Surface Pro, 64-bit operating system, Windows 8.1 Pro, and I have 48.2 GB available, so the download size shouldn't be an issue.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> rajan kumar raj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Certification issue with submitting app to windows store</h2>
                    <p>I have submitted and app on windows store. But it fails to certify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app is for our company employee. To login in the app employee needs to enter his ID and then our system sends an OTP to the employee's already registered mobile number. Then employee can enter that OTP in the app and he gets authenticated upon successful
 validation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the tester on windows store is not able to login in the app due to the fact that he is not an employee of our company and so we do not have his mobile number registered with us on which we can send the OTP. However, we have tried to provide a test account
 but the OTP is then sent to a mobile number linked to that test account to which tester on windows store does not have access. Also we can not provide a pre-generated OTP because the first screen in app is to enter the user's employee ID and then comes the
 screen to enter the OTP. While user enter his ID, ever a new OTP will be generated and successful authentication can only happen with the last generated OTP.</p>

<p>I have submitted and app on windows store. But it fails to certify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app is for our company employee. To login in the app employee needs to enter his ID and then our system sends an OTP to the employee's already registered mobile number. Then employee can enter that OTP in the app and he gets authenticated upon successful
 validation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the tester on windows store is not able to login in the app due to the fact that he is not an employee of our company and so we do not have his mobile number registered with us on which we can send the OTP. However, we have tried to provide a test account
 but the OTP is then sent to a mobile number linked to that test account to which tester on windows store does not have access. Also we can not provide a pre-generated OTP because the first screen in app is to enter the user's employee ID and then comes the
 screen to enter the OTP. While user enter his ID, ever a new OTP will be generated and successful authentication can only happen with the last generated OTP.</p>

<p>MW3 multiplayer like most Xbox Live multiplayer games requires a Gold account to be played online. &nbsp;You can create a new account and have a free 30 day trial of Xbox live gold if you wish to trial the service. &nbsp;you can still play local (splitscreen) and
 LAN games without a gold account but for matchmaking or internet based games, a gold account is required.</p>

<p>You would only be able to do this on the same game system with the other controller signed in as the guest account. If they are playing on another game system they would need their own Xbox Live Gold Account to play the online multiplayer.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may already know,<span> you can easily transform a freehand sketch into a three-dimensional object
</span><span>with Paint 3D. As of the moment we recommend searching for third-party applications which may help in converting
</span>.gbl .fxb .3mf files. We also suggest contacting the Wix developer if they are supporting the upload of these file types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back if you have future concerns.</p>

<p>Hi Darian</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already contacted wix with a similar question they referred me to&nbsp; you at Microsoft!also I have trawled the Internet for third party applications with out success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its so frustrating because 3d paint is such a great app however its no good to me because I cannot convert 3d .gbl .fxb .3mf files to a usable format on my website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wix only support .png .gif .jpg to upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried to find out the html code of the 3d object because I can upload html to wix in an iframe and video clips.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only I could convert the 3d paint files to a video format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any way thanks for your help maybe one day we will be able to save the 3d files in a video file extension format!!!</p>
<p>

<h2>            train simulator error insert the correct CD-Rom and restart.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:</p>
<p>train simulator </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Microsoft Train Simulator PC game from Amazon. Once the two CD's are downloaded a four window menu comes up asking me to register and play. Each time I attempt to register or play all I get is a flag with a message saying to insert the
 correct CD-Rom and restart. Now being of a senior age, I assumed I reinsert the CD1 into the reader. But again all I get is the same message complete with a X on a red background. I run on Windows 7. I also bought an add on 'Cambrian ' game but can't enjoy
 that due to the mother programm refusing to work. I've uninstalled twice, but still no luck.&nbsp;

            Hi  jfirstlast 
<br />
<br />Could you tell us the name of the program and website you are downloading it from?
<br />
<br />Its important to know this, since Windows Defender might be protecting you from a booby trapped program. 
<br />
<br />If you are sure it is safe, you can temporarily disable Windows Defender from blocking the program.
<br />
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Ransomware protection
<br />Toggle off Controlled folder access
<br />
<br />Also in Windows Defender Security Center
<br />
<br />Open App &amp; browser control
<br />Set 'Check apps &amp; files' to off       
        </p>

            Well, try the steps with Windows Defender in my previous reply.
<br />
<br />You can also try downloading through Internet Explorer.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: iexplore
<br />Hit Enter

            Hey Jock.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow these steps to resolve the issue:  <a href="https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/error-1603-fatal-error-during-installation-fixed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/error-1603...</a>
<br />
<br />You do NOT need a driver finder program as drivers are delivered by Windows Updates.  You can also Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
