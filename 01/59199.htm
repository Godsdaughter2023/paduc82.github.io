<h2>            Want to replace WebEx training center and &#39;hands on lab sessions&#39;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>We currently use WebEx training center to deliver remote training to new customers. We invite trainees to join the session and have configured Webex to use 'labs' which basically is a collection of physical or virtual PCs that they are given access to via
 the remote session.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question. Is there any way we could do this within Skype for Business?</p>

<p>Hello Steve,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generally, In Skype for Business, we can create a meeting, and then invite users join the meeting. Also, we can send an Instant message, presence your desktop, share your file during the meeting,
 and have a Q&amp;A session, etc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please see:</p>
<p><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Video-What-is-Skype-for-Business-3a21eca4-434d-41f1-ab06-3d4a268573b7</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, as per my knowledge, it's not feasible to have the same actions in Skype for Business. Given this situation, we suggest you feedback your requirements to our related team via the link below:</p>

<p>Your understanding is appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Unable to continue with pen calibration</h2>
                    <p>I switched from windows 7 to windows 10 x64 enterprise recently. And I found I cannot calibrate my pen from pen display (UGEE 2150 which is my primary screen also) drivers (the option is gray and completely disabled). So
 i tried to do this using Windows Pen and Touch settings, but I was unable to do anything more than open a white windows. White screen was not reacting to my pen (even if i can use it normaly and pressure sensitivity works without any problems). I knew the
 pen is 100% working because I saw tapping animations it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried look in google about my problem and solve it, but seems like nobody ever had something like this happening. I reinstalled drivers many times, there is no newer version of drivers than I'm using now also i have updated
 windows and there is no more updates that i can download and install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UGEE site seems not even expecting this problem to be happening as there is no info what to do if this situation will even happen.....</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Skype doesn&#39;t show notifications</h2>
                    Hi, my skype in Windows 10 doesn't give me any notifications when it's minimised, they only show up when I click on the icon in the taskbar and open the&nbsp; window, I am definitely signed in as there is a blue line under the Skype icon in the taskbar. I have
 been into my Skype settings all the notifications switched on. I keep missing messages from people, it's not really "instant" messaging.

<p>Alright, if Do not disturb is disabled you should be receiving notifications and it should show on the
<strong>Action Center</strong>. If you still do not have notification when the app is minimized, can you try uninstalling and re-installing Skype for Windows 10? Re-install it from the Windows/Microsoft Store.

<h2>            How to Cancel Cortana Setup - Not changing Local Account</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 and I was trying to setup Cortana and then it got to the part said it was going to switch me away from a local account. I closed out of the setup before doing this. But now it keeps wanting me to continue whenever I try to use
 search.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I turn off Cortana and stop it from wanting me to continue the setup? I just want the plain search that I had before trying to do the setup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any help I can get to solve this problem.</p>

<h2>            How do I add a category to the Start Screen&#39;s &#34;Apps View&#63;&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know if I could add more categories to the Apps View (the list of applications that show up when you click the small button below the Start Screen).</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/158120f8-9813-42da-bfd2-bd4429cf12a5" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I installed two programs from Piriform: CCleaner and Defraggler. Both have their separate categories in the Apps View. I want to put them in one category named "Piriform." How do I do that<br />
<br />
By the way, I do not want to download an application to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and I hope for a clear and nice answer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting your query to Microsoft forum, I will certainly help you with a clear answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Defraggler speeds up your PC by assembling fragmented files on your machine and organizing them more efficiently. Defraggler does the hard work, so your computer doesn’t have to. Where as CCleaner helps cleaning the unused files and settings which take up
 hard drive space making it slower and slower. CCleaner cleans up these files and makes it faster instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The features are different for each software, doesn't matter if&nbsp;it is downloaded from the same developer or website if the functionality is different&nbsp;it will be categorized in a different section of the category folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a default setting by Windows 8.1 which cannot be changed or customize manually.</p>

<br />
Thank you for the info about the said programs but I already know about them. Let's just say I'll put them in category named "Utilities" along with other tools I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked my friend if this was possible and he said it was. I was about to ask him how but he said that he forgot. He said it was about adding a folder to where the Start Menu folders/categories stay but he also forgot where.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried searching the internet if this is possible but I'll do it when I have time. I'm still looking for an answer. Thanks for the reply.</p>

            You might need to rebuild the index file.
<br />To do this go to search and type indexing.
<br />Open the indexing options.
<br />Select Modify
<br />Make sure there is a checkmark for the folders you want indexed and click OK.
<br />Click Advanced.
<br />Click Rebuild.
<br />Let that run, can take up to an hour if you have a lot of files.
<br />
<br />See if that works.

            I would let it run overnight.
<br />I have about that much and it took at least 3 hours.
<br />The main indexing options window you can monitor it in there.
<br />It will show a Indexing Complete when it is done.
<br />Be aware that this will eat up your resources.
<br />So do it when you don't need to use your machine.

<h2>            Windows Hello Setup</h2>
                    <p>I've recently cleared out by NGC folder in order to get my pin working. However now my Windows Hello setup isn't working. When I click Set-Up, it shows me a text with the options Get Started and Cancel. I click Get Started, input my PIN when prompted, but
 after that it goes back to the original text screen without the Get Started option, only Cancel. Here's an image of that screen.&nbsp;Does anyone know the solution to this issue?</p>

<p>Hello Nithin, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue persist after clearing the NGC folder, I suggest that you perform System Restore. System Restore takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Control Panel.</strong></li><li>Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>View by: Small icons.</strong></li><li>Open<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Open System Restore.</strong></li><li>Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the problematic update.</li><li>&nbsp;Select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Next</strong>, and hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Finish</strong>.<br />
<br />
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you’re not seeing any restore points, it might be because system protection isn’t turned on. To check, go to the Control Panel, search for<strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Recovery<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Configure
 System Restore</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt; Configure and make sure<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Turn on system protection</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>is selected.<br />

            Hey Antoneth Ber. Thank you for suggesting that but unfortunately, the only system restores I have available to go back to are recent. The oldest one is a week ago, whereas I have had this problem for several months now. Is there anything else I could
 do?

<p>Pins have been broken for years. They don't care. What's more, is that if you pin something (Such as a TV show), and then it gets taken off of Xbox Live, you can't unpin it and have a useless pin taking up space.</p>

<h2>            How to use a Japanese keyboard if installing Windows 7 in English</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Not sure if this is actually the right place for this question, but I own a Japanese PC which had originally a Japanese Windows 7 version installed. Thankfully (as my Japanese isn't really PC proof), there was a multilanguage
 Windows 7 installation disk (64 bit, professional) included, which I just installed.</span></strong></p>
<p>Now I have a lovely English Windows 7 but somehow the keyboard doesn't seem to work as expected. As it is a Japanese PC, it uses a Japanese keyboard but despite having the Japanese keyboard layout selected, Windows 7 in fact uses the English layout. Now
 that wouldn't be too bad, but on the one hand it is rather painful if the layout written on the keyboard doesn't match the actual layout (my wife goes nuts) and on the other entering Japanese has gotten real painful.</p>
<p>Usually you can use special buttons (e.g. &nbsp;the Japanese keyboard has no backtick button between Esc and Tab &nbsp;but a button to switch the input mode) to do specific commands (change the input mode, transform a word, ...) but neither of them is functioning
 either - not surprising as it seems to think that I have an English keyboard.</p>
<p>As said the input language and keyboard is setup correctly to Japanese and looking at the device manager it detects my keyboard as a Microsoft eHome MCIR 109 Keyboard. A guess would be that I maybe need a different keyboard driver but I have no idea where
 I would get a Japanese keyboard driver for a standard non brand keyboard from.</p>
<p>The problem seems to resemble &nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927824#FixItForMe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927824</a>&nbsp;for Windows Vista but a quick attempt to copy the manual solution didn't have any effect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help on how to resolve this would be really appreciated, thanks so much,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ben</p>

            Actually it turns out that the manual intervention worked (if only I had known that before), but what caused issues is that I had beforehand changed the switch input method key to the backtick key - which is the @ key in the Japanese layout and I hadn't
 defaulted the input method to IME.

<h2>            Since 360 Live is going down next year, DLC should be free</h2>
                    
<p>Me and a friend have talked about this for a while since about 2010 and said that games that turned five years old should have all of the DLC should become free for achievements and simply helping to raise the population of the game. So since i found out
 about the news of Xbox Live on the 360 going down last year, I've been thinking that if that were the case than I think all the DLC, at least all game add-on DLC should be free so we can all get one last great year of maybe new experiences on old games, what
 do you guys think? &nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyways, good luck on getting free DLC. Cause that's the developers decision. </p>

<p>Its based on paranoia. However, you can bet when there is a time when the disconnect comes....people will rush in and buy the dlcs for their games very quickly. My advice: Just enjoy the games....I plan on getting the One, but that will be awhile from now.

<p>DLC for free I think for oldier games would be. I will say another great way &nbsp;for devs to show their appriciation to the community. But unless game devs have a change of heart. Its not likely to happen.</p>
<p>Example. I have been hoping, and via feedback voting for Halo 4 Spartan Ops 2B fully playable offline, and via System Link on the 360. But now realize that thats likely never going to happen either.</p>
<p>Yet just today. I was amazed by news that external HDD support was coming to the 360. (Sorry, I cannot post links via 360 console) So anythings possible.</p>

<br />you can check the steps in the following link for Windows 7 and try the same steps in Windows 10 and it should work.

<p>My graphic card is an AMD RX560 Radeon 4GB. My games tell me I have 512MB of video memory (which I indeed have) but my friend with a 1050Ti has 4096MB of dedicated video memory.</p>

            Fiddle up your BIOS Settings to change the video memory. It would be something similar to UMA-exact instructions can be provided by the mobo manufacturer.
<br />Please note that you can do it upto a certain extent.

<p>Your RX560 has 4GB VRAM built on to the card. This cannot be upgraded, but the game will still use however much of the system RAM</p>
<p>it also requires, so there is no method to change this in relation to your AMD graphics card.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The amount of system RAM 'dedicated' to games for Integrated graphics (Intel HD &amp; AMD APU) for games is variable,</p>
<p>but the maximum&nbsp;amount dedicated to games is normally 2GB, or less. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Generally, if the games are reporting a low amount of VRAM it is with laptops which are running on the machines Integrated graphics</p>
<p>rather than switching to the dedicated graphics card. This would be common, and OK if playing simple 2D games, but sometimes</p>
<p>the software used by AMD or Nvidia does not properly identify a 3D game and fails to switch to the Dedicated card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not using the <em>High</em> <em>Performance</em> power plan in Windows Settings is one possible reason for a laptop not switching from Integrated to</p>
<p>Dedicated gpu.</p>
<p>AMD would have a similar setting in their Control Panel, but my Nvidia has a&nbsp; <em>
Power Management Mode &gt; Prefer Maximum Performance</em> </p>
<p>option that may also help switching between Integrated and Dedicated gpu's.</p>
<br />

<p>Give more details about what is happening in this and other games.&nbsp; Included the games title.</p>
<p><em>- 0.35fps</em> ? I've never seen frame rates measured below a full frame, and anything below 20fps is generally an unplayable laggy slide show,</p>
<p>so a game would not really run at 0.35 fps. </p>
<p>35 fps is at the lower end of&nbsp; desirable frame rates, but should still be smooth in many games.</p>
<p>- Your friends GTX1050 ti would get better frame rates. How much higher depends in part on the game. The GTX1050 is just a bit</p>
<p>faster than your RX560, but the 'ti' version would be few %&nbsp; higher performance again.</p>
<p>If the GTX1050ti is on a desktop machine the performance difference would be even more significant, as both AMD and Nvidia</p>
<p>gpu's reduce chip speeds&nbsp; on laptops to lower power requirements, and reduce heat.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- If deactivating the Integrated graphics has changed the reporting of the RAM from 512MB&nbsp; it is likely your games were</p>
<p>not switching to the Dedicated graphics card. I don't know what AMD call their equivalent of Nvidia's
<em>Optimus</em> software, which</p>
<p>is responsible for switching from the default Integrated graphics, when not running a game, to the Dedicated graphics card when</p>
<p>you launch a game, but you may need to investigate this if you use the machine on battery power. Unless you are happy manually</p>
disabling/enabling the Integrated graphics.<br />
<p>
</p><p>- As I said before, your RX560 dedicated graphics card has 4GB of VRAM (Video RAM, which is faster than system RAM ).</p>
<p>This cannot be changed, but that does not matter as you are unlikely to require more than 4GB VRAM if you are running games</p>
<p>at 1920x1080.</p>
<p>In addition to the VRAM, games all use the system RAM. When running a dedicated graphics card the amount of system RAM that
</p>
<p>gets used is determined by the game, not the user. Win10 does a good job of managing system RAM, and makes better use of</p>
<p>available RAM than previous Windows.</p>
<p>- The main issue here is having adequate system RAM for the game in question. Currently 8GB is still far more than most games require (assuming the user is not multi-tasking while gaming, and have tons of open browsers or other things that may be using system</p>
<p>RAM while they are playing games).</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Integrated graphics has no VRAM. It uses the system RAM. The terminology varies, but the RAM allocated to the Integrated graphics</p>
<p>used to be called 'Shared', but is also commonly refereed to as 'Dedicated' to indicate that the system sets aside an amount of system RAM</p>
<p>exclusively for the graphics processor to use.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The amount of system RAM that is set aside for the graphics processor is different on different machines. On yours the current</p>
<p>amount is apparently 512MB,&nbsp; but many machines allow for as much as 2GB. You may be able to change the default to a larger amount,</p>
<p>but this will not benefit your RX560 performance .</p>
<p>Graphics memory allocation is generally set in BIOS on desktop machines, but I believe the software used by laptops to switch between Integrated graphics and dedicate graphics may also have&nbsp; an options in it's settings for the user to select a specific amount
 of RAM </p>
<p>for the Integrated graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- As has been suggested, it may be that as your machine has a dedicated graphics card that DELL have fixed 512MB for
</p>
<p>Integrated graphics as this would be adequate for most graphics, and most of the games the Integrated graphics can run well.</p>
<p>. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you could not access anything as the screen is blinking.
<span>The screen flickering/blinking issue that we are experiencing after an upgrade to Windows 10 is mainly due to the Norton Antivirus.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the methods provided below and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1: Boot the computer in safe mode.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For more information you may refer to the article mentioned below.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to <strong><span>disable security software temporarily (Norton if installed)
</span></strong>and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:&nbsp;<em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p><span>In addition to that try to install all of the&nbsp;Windows updates available and if issue persists, try to update the Display drivers by following the steps provided in the article mentioned below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue could also be related to the <strong><span>Display drivers and other updates</span></strong>. I want to inform you that&nbsp;updates will be released by Microsoft. So, I would suggest you to keep checking your Windows updates not only important
 one but optional too. If any available try to install them and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>If issue still persists, then install the drivers for Windows 8/8.1 from the manufacturer's website in compatibility mode and check if that works.<br />
<br />

    <title>Flickering widescreen monitor on dual monitor setup. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> twhp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flickering widescreen monitor on dual monitor setup.</h2>
                    I'm using a nvidia quadro 4000 on windows 7 64bit with two monitors, one widescreen and one "regular" one. The widescreen monitor occasionally flickers on and off but the power light remains on. I've tried adjusting the refresh rates and have even swapped
 monitors, cables, and power cords. Is there anything else I can try short of replacing the video card? It's new, as is the computer, so I doubt that's the problem.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Have you tried using the monitor on a different computer?<br />
2. Are you able to use the widescreen monitor normally on this computer without extending the displays?<br />
3. Did this setup ever worked successfully before?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong></div>
<div>Yes you may try updating the nvidia drivers and check.</div>
<div>You may also refer to the articles below which explains about updating the hardware drivers.</div>
<div><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2.<br />
</strong>If the issue exists even after swapping the cables and monitors and also does not work as expected on a different computer I would recommend you to check with the monitor manufacturer.</div>
<div><br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            Custom folder icon keep changing to default when I Copy&#47;Move it to another place.</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, here is what I am talking about: When I change folder icon with software, then I copy/move the folder to another place in Windows 10, the custom icon resets to default empty folder icon. I found out the solution, so I'm gonna tell you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is because of copier software you are using in Windows, if you copy/move folder with Windows default copier, the problem will fix. But if you are looking for a software for copy/move with no problem like what I said, the "Teracopy" is the best!
 with this software you can also copy/move files to "Program Files (x86)" folder with no more disappearing problem. OK! Hope this help you!</p>

 Then I went to advanced restart and tried resetting from that as well , all was going well until there was a problem resetting my pc, so I pressed cancel since that was the only option and it booted up my pc and said no so was found.</p>

<h2>            Gonna fix my rep anytime soon&#63; </h2>
                    <p>Hey Xbox, or better yet, XBLPET, since you'e the system that always responds with blatant ignorance. Hopefully someone actually reads this and notes that I am serious when I say I'm sick of this ****. I've been playing games for 15 years now, that's quite a lot of time. I've been on Xbox since the release of Modern Warfare 2 (MW2), back on the Xbox 360. So thats been like 8-9 years. I've easily put thousands of dollars into gaming, and at minimum, $900 in just consoles alone. That may be off since I don't remember exact prices. Whatever an Xbox 360 Arcade cost at release, an Elite (I think thats the name) and the 1st generation Xbox one. All I want to do is enjoy games, spend time playing with friends on said games, and playing freely when I'm alone. But because you allow cheaters to remain online, which is a violation of the Code of Conduct by the way, I get penalized with a bad rep, in this case an Avoid Me rep, and now I can't play with friends on some games. And games like GTA 5 Onl

<h2>            Laptop shuts down after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Since updating Windows last week, my laptop will consistently shut down a couple minutes after being turned on.</p>
<p>The screen goes black and then the power and hard drive activity light turn off, which suggests it has shut down but when I power it back on all programs are still open.</p>
<p>This happened with the April update as well but I was able to 'fix' the problem by reverting to a previous version, however this time it won't revert.</p>
<p>I have checked for new drivers and I am up to date.</p>
<p>Also it's completely fine in safe mode.</p>
<p>My laptop is a Medion Akoya P6647 (MD 99062)</p>

<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your Windows update question.

            One other option is you can try rolling back to the previous build.  I would recommend reset Windows 10 keeping your files and apps . . . 
<br />
<br />To do this
<br />1.	 Start your PC as Windows attempts to load and the spinning dots appear, press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds.  This is known as a Hard Shut Down
<br />(Do this twice )
<br />2.	Turn on your computer for the 3rd time and it should come up in the Recovery Environment
<br />3.	You will be prompted for System Repair/Safe Mode/Command Prompt
<br />4.	Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Revert to previous build of Windows 
<br />5.	If this is unsuccessful, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps,

    <title>Another Question on KB3172985 Fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curmudgeon10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Another Question on KB3172985 Fail</h2>
                    <p>This update failed on all auto download/auto schedule reboots and manual reboots.&nbsp; I've attempted it with the "automatically check for updates to other MS products" checked and unchecked, and with Defender enabled and disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter many times.&nbsp; First execution would run for 17 minutes, and then the app would suggest I rerun it as Administrator.&nbsp; I did that --- Troubleshooter indicated it had found some problems and corrected them.&nbsp; However, result
 has always been the same: the installation process stalls at 76/77% complete, the system announces the update wasn't successful, and the configuration is rolled back to pre-update status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, there have been no burps in the normal operation of Windows 10 sans update.&nbsp; Each attempt at installing this and then regaining control of the PC after the reconfiguration back to pre-update status takes approximately an hour.&nbsp; Plus, every time
 there is an unsuccessful update, the WiFi link to my default printer is broken and must be reestablished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beyond running the Troubleshooters.&nbsp; What should I do next? AND, I'm not only interested in solving this particular update anomaly, but would also like to hear from someone at Microsoft about why the problem has occurred, and whether we should anticipate
 similar ones in the future.</p>

            <p>Assuming the&nbsp;computer name&nbsp;<strong>OfficePC</strong> denotes a PC in your office at home...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chances are (99.99%) your HP computer came with a Norton free-trial (or possibly a McAfee free-trial) preinstalled Both are
<em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your #1 troublemaker here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cross your fingers for luck &amp; see if running the following multi-step fix resolves the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You may want to print these instructions for offline reference. DON'T SKIP ANY STEP! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ] </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:
<p>
</p><p>1b. <em>Just-in-case =&gt;</em> Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, too, saving it to your desktop:
<a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the Norton utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Reassert Edge or Internet Explorer 11 [your choice] as the system's default Browser. See
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/news/heres-how-to-set-your-default-browser-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>5. Reset Internet Explorer 11 (not Edge)&nbsp;per the instructions on this page: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/reset-ie-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
