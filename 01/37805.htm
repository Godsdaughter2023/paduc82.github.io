<h2>            Dell Photo AIO 924 Driver Problems</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I recently get windows 7 professional for use on my desktop, and have a dell photo AIO 924 printer. &nbsp;I have tried several times to install the drivers for it, and the computer recognizes that the printer is present and ready for use. &nbsp;However, when i try
 to print something a window pops up that says that the computer is unable to communicate with the printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>is there an updated version of the driver available for windows 7? &nbsp;i have been unable to find one, and the printer is not listed at the windows 7&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;center. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If they're reflected in your gamerscore on the 360's dashboard, and they're not showing up elsewhere on the net (i.e. your PC) then it's just what Greenskull said... give it a while - up to a day I've noticed - and you'll be seeing your new score reflected

    <title>Touch Keyboard &#34;snaps&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simple286  say:</h3>
<h2>            Touch Keyboard &#34;snaps&#34;</h2>
                    Before&nbsp; the latest update, I could grab the touch keyboard and&nbsp; move it around the screen where I wanted it, even partially off-screen. Now the touch screen keyboard "snaps" to the edges of the screen. It always covers&nbsp; part of the screen, making it infuriating
 to fill in forms, searches, etc. Yes, I can change the settings of the keyboard (qwerty, small, locked down) but I prefer my full screen board that floated. Is there a way to fix this?

<p>We appreciate your response. <span>Based on the information that you've shared, we'd recommend performing a clean boot in Windows to isolate software conflicts on your device. To do this, you can perform the steps posted on this<span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a><span>.
 Once you're in the clean boot environment, check if you'll be able to move the touch keyboard after undocking it. The link will also provide steps on how to isolate the cause and how to revert your device back to normal boot after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We look forward to an update on your concern.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 has basically ruined my computer, why did the upgrade assistant tell me my Acer aspire m3910 was compatible with windows 10 when it&#39;s not&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was an early bird upgrader from windows 7, upgrade assistant checked and told me my comp was compatible with 10.</p>
<p>Since then every update has failed due to a page fault in&nbsp;a non paged area, it constantly crashes, with black or blue screens, gives me error 43 messages for my graphics driver. I have had to reset the computer at least once per week since last November,
 reinstalled, updated drivers. It also got rid of my office 2007 and when I tried to reinstall I keep getting told that the registration key is in use on another computer.</p>
<p>Last week I did a new reset and now it's worse than ever. My mail app is no longer syncing and constantly telling me to update account&nbsp;settings &nbsp;that I know are correct and work on all my other devices.</p>
<p>This morning I chanced upon an acer forum and lo and behold my model is not one of the supported devices as per Microsoft regulations.</p>
<p>What to do now as I have no recovery disks to go back to windows 7?</p>
<p>I may as well throw the comp in the bin and get a mac!!!!</p>

            <p>Yes, and Dell told me that my computer wasn't supported on Windows 10 yet it runs the OS very well. You can't rely on third-parties to check these things for you, particularly when those third-parties have an interest in the outcome. Has a car salesperson
 ever said "No, this is not a good time to buy a car"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can't possibly know about every one of the millions of hardware components in the world or be able to detect them in a computer. It's up to you and me to check whether our hardware is supported on Windows 10. In short, as consumers it remains our
 responsibility to be on guard against The Man.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this situation we had several defenses but, again, it's up to us to exercise them. You can't expect The Man to come to your rescue. The lawyers have seen to that. My first defense has always been backing up. Before I did my clean install of Windows 10,
 I made a backup of my Windows 8.1 installation. If Windows 10 didn't work properly, I could easily have gone back to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By now there's no reason not to backup. But there were other defenses against Windows 10. One was rolling back to your previous OS, which worked fine
<em>if</em> you did that soon after installing Windows 10. Another defense was a reset, which would tell you whether you had a hardware problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case, you just kept right on going so unfortunately, you're stuck. You have only one option if your hardware isn't supported, and that's a factory restore, which will reinstall the software that was on your computer on the day you brought it home.
 Instructions should have been included in the box but if you don't have them, no worries, they should also be on Acer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A factory restore erases your hard disk, so make sure to backup all your personal information before you start - all of it. You won't need your Windows 7 license number (although you should know it) because the factory image that you'll be restoring is already
 activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This reminds me of the way my father describes a 'lifetime warranty': You buy something, it breaks, you bring it back to the store, and they say "That's life."</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I did reset to windows 7 after first crash but it kept on automatically updating to 10,
</p>
<p>I have followed many of the posts on forums to try correcting it all but to no avail, I did not just "keep on going"</p>
<p>Why does Microsoft write a compatibility checker&nbsp; that tells you one's hardware is compatible when it's not, why did the recent reset remove my office 2007 when previous restores and&nbsp; installs did not?</p>
<p>no reset has indicated my hardware had a problem. You'd think that graphic&nbsp;card would be a key component to&nbsp;investigate when checking compatibility??</p>
<p>I don't expect the man to come to my rescue but I certainly don't expect him to shaft me on purpose, that's called fraud where I come from. All this experience has done is ruin 25 years of good faith in Microsoft. It's especially concerning when software
 I purchased is removed from my comp and the solution is to buy a subscription to the new office.</p>
<p>Looking at all the other posts and online forums I'm just one of thousands with problems with 10.
</p>
<p>I will never buy another Microsoft product ever after this, they have completely lost my trust.
</p>
<p>I'll be checking to see if I can put a different OS on my comp before I go back to any form of windows</p>

            <p>If you did a factory restore after July 28, 2016, you would not be - could not be - upgraded to Windows 10 automatically. Microsoft stopped automatically upgrading computers on July 29, 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 10 does a reset, your hard drive is erased and a fresh copy of Windows 10 is installed. This is described in detail on the internet. If you still had Office 2007 on your computer, you didn't do a reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you do a Windows 10 reset, the next thing you do is run Windows Update to completion. Then, before doing anything else, you test your hardware. If you crash, or see error messages, or things don't work as they should, that's a sign that some of your
 hardware may not be supported on Windows 10. You can check that with web searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be very careful when you say things like "... thousands [have] problems with Windows 10." In the first place, Windows 10 is being used by more than 400 million devices all over the world. Second, if you've read through the posts here you know that many posters
 are at the bottom of the barrel for computer knowledge, so don't lump yourself with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the vast amount of good information on the internet, it's easy enough for just about anyone to learn how to use Windows 10 correctly. Someone who isn't searching the internet for information and not backing up is going to be forever in trouble, no
 matter which operating system they use.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;There is a question at the end of all that follows :) </p>
<p>Yes like probably 99% of the human population&nbsp;I am at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to understanding how windows works-- I just want my shovels to dig a hole, I don't need to know how to make one from a lump of iron ore. Look, I really appreciate
 your comments but my "10" experience has not been good so far. I was looking forward to it.</p>
<p>My comp is 3 years old has 2 intel i5 processors and an&nbsp;NVidia GeForce card</p>
<p>I upgraded in nov 2015, used the restore to go back to windows 7 in dec15&nbsp; and then in end of feb or march, after that I just gave up and stayed with 10 because when i'm on my computer I need to be working on it not spending ages trying to sort out the os,
 at first it was ok, then when auto updates kicked in it downloaded updates fine but then kept&nbsp;blue screening&nbsp;when installing mostly at 33%, occasionally 40% with a page fault in a non paged area nvddsys...(cant remember the rest) Then it reinstalls to previous
 version. Comp&nbsp;then started&nbsp;&nbsp;regularly crashing when playing back or streaming video or hitting a&nbsp;page with lots of ads on&nbsp;I get&nbsp;a black screen and a pulsing whine from the speakers. Each time the fan goes mad and I have to&nbsp;hold in the power button to turn
 it off&nbsp;&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The net info I found was to check drivers and update them or reinstall&nbsp;which I did many times. I also kept looking for info and came across hundreds of thread and different&nbsp;fixes; trying&nbsp; them to no avail.&nbsp;So after&nbsp;I&nbsp;found out how to do a reset keeping my
 its probably an issue with graphic card/driver.&nbsp; then last week I did a reset and since then no mail app syncing and error 43 and my office 07&nbsp;wont reinstall because it says it's in use on another computer</p>
<p>Then countless hours of searching and trying fixes&nbsp;later I've discovered that&nbsp; a compatibility checker/upgrade assistant&nbsp;from a source that I have trusted and used faithfully since the 90's with no problems at all, didn't quite tell me all I needed to know.&nbsp;I'm
 an old timer- I didn't get IT training at school, we did Latin instead. I learnt my way through windows and office in my work and it's always been reliable and virtually plug and play.Problems were solved by an It chap telling you to turn it off for 10 mins
 and back on again.&nbsp;Why would I doubt what it was telling me?</p>
<p>I'm fairly able at most things but it's taken me a year to get here, I hope you have some empathy for my frustration. It's not easy for my generation to sift through all the search parameters and new to us jargon about bios, split partitions, admin command
 prompts etc. All it would have taken is an "I think this comp is ok for upgrade but check your specific model on the manufacturers website before going ahead".&nbsp;That's why I have lost trust. It feels like a familiar friend has all of a sudden turned on you,&nbsp;speaking
 in tongues&nbsp;and is no longer fun to be with. Never before&nbsp;have I had to learn so much new stuff about the internal settings of windows and learn about so many terms in order to be able to ask more and more explicitly&nbsp;specific&nbsp;questions to find the right answers.&nbsp;The
 many&nbsp; posters you talk of could probably be my generation and there's a huge number of us going to be alive for decades. I can't afford to upgrade components or a new computer so I need this one working. &nbsp;Rant Over!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is my only option to get my pc working properly again to do a full factory restore to windows 7 because it will never be compatible with 10? Am I going to have to backup my huge amount of data to a separate standalone&nbsp;&nbsp;drive and then delete the files
 before factory reset or will I be able to backup to the d: drive and still retrieve them after?

<p>If your hardware is not supported on Windows 10 it will never (not even in the next world) work properly on Windows 10. There is nothing that you or Microsoft can do about it. Only the hardware manufacturer has the proprietary knowledge and legal authority
 (it's their code) to support hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can, you know, find out if your hardware is supported. Here's how I did it: I made a list of all the hardware components in my computer and then went to each manufacturer and asked. Sometimes the hardware manufacturers were not exactly forthcoming, shall
 we say, so I asked people in their user forums. All this took many hours spread out over several days. But I got my answers. So scr*w you, Dell. My hardware
<em>is</em> supported. But I had to work to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to be among the 'smart' computer users ... the people who never seem to get into major trouble ... you need to work at it. Nobody is going to take you by the hand and show you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your hardware is not supported on Windows 10 - you're sure about that - then your only remaining option is a factory restore. That's it. At least it's free. And yes, you will have to backup all your personal information - everything - because your hard
 drive is going to be erased. That should be no big deal. It takes me just a few minutes to backup 25 GB worth of data to an external hard drive.</p>

<h2>            IDT HD Audio CODEC and USB Audio CODEC... Again.</h2>
                    <p>To start off, I'll put the base system specs that are necessary for this issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mobo - HP Angelica</p>
<p>GPU - GTX 1050 Ti</p>
<p>14 gigs of RAM</p>
<p>AMD FX - 6300 Six-Core Processor - 3.50 GHz</p>
<p>Windows 10 Insider Build 17074</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, so on to the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I updated to this build. Well, not me, necessarily, but my computer force updated.</p>
<p>After updating, my audio inputs on IDT were shown as available, but they refused to receive input.</p>
<p>The USB Codec did neither output nor input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both worked fine before the update.</p>
<p>Before it's said, I want to note that yes, I have tried to restore to the previous build, but I was met with many error codes and a corrupted file system, so I was forced to reinstall, and it reinstalled straight to this build. Restoration is not an option</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried multiple times to change IDT to the generic HD Audio, to no avail.</p>
<p>I have tried to reinstall IDT and USB drivers, and that was a lost cause as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anybody who has any idea as to how I can get my mics working again, I would be very appreciative, as recording at home is a job for me and without my mics, I can't do my job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

            Hi Kyle.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You said you reinstalled but it went to the Insider Build and that now "no restoration is possible."   How exactly did you do this and why do you say properly doing it is not possible now?  
<br />
<br />The only media that's available to properly reinstall is the last stable version which is what you should be running if you have those kinds of problems.  You can create bootable media for Fall Creators Update Version 1709 by installing the Media Creation Tool on another PC.  
<br />
<br />Then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try to troubleshoot the Sound issues Please run the Sound Recording troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br /> Right click Volume icon in System Tray to open Recording Devices panel, look for Microphone to click on and Set to Default.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You should actually be asking this question in the Insider forum
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider</a>
<br />
<br />They have more experience with this sort of development problems in the insider releases.  And they want you to report exactly this sort of experience in the insiders forum so that they can (hopefully) fix it before release it to the general public.
<br />
<br />PS: using Insider builds on your "main machine" is a bad idea. For precisely this reason.  MS does try to tell you that when you sign up for the insider program.  In a "truth in advertising" situation, "insiders" would be called "unpaid crash test dummies". 
<br />
<br />I suspect what you are going have to do is a clean install, either of an earlier insider build or of the the current mainstream version 1709.  Which means you will lose your personal files and installed programs.  So make an image copy backup BEFORE going any further  so you dont' lose everything.

            If the camera mftr. doesn't provide a Vista driver (and yes, you would need to go to the camera mftr.'s website to find this driver) then just purchase a USB card reader. Take your camera's memory card out of it, insert it into the USB card reader which
 will be attached to the computer. Then you'll be able to get your pictures off the camera's memory card into the computer.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may be experiencing this on your setup even if the Surface's display is configured to not switch off because the system is unable to carry out the settings. We suggest that you install updates on both your Surface and the docking station. Refer to the
 links below:</p>

<h2>            Forza 2</h2>
                    
<p>Sorry.&nbsp; I only recently (6--4-11) started my Live account.&nbsp; Been owning a 'Box since 2001.&nbsp; I get it that Forza 2's had 4 birthdays.&nbsp; Was just wondering if anyone was still out there racing C and D class cars.&nbsp; Either during my install or Live activation,
 my offline progress seemed to be void.&nbsp; Achievements stood and so seems my saved game.&nbsp; But my Live career started back at Level 0 yesterday.&nbsp; Thought it would be more fun to work my way back up vs. human competition as I get reacquainted with my driving Zen.&nbsp;
 Just completed Asia and Rear Wheel Cups.&nbsp; Hopefully I can upgrade to F3 soon.&nbsp; Just looking for some 360 launch title comp in the meantime.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

When Forza 4 comes out on October 11, you will be able to transfer your Forza 3 career over to Forza 4.</p>

</p><p>For HP printers information the best place to ask would be the HP forums as you may get lucky there.</p>
<p>
HP Support Forums.

            Hi Joyce, your Display Driver needs to be rolled back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />If there is no roll back available or that does not work, go to the Support page of the manufacturer of your PC/Laptop 
<br />
<br />Download the Device Driver they recommend for your Display Adapter/GPU and install that version, until Microsoft come out with a fix . . .       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Option 1:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Make sure recommended settings are selected for Scale and Layout and Screen resolution.
<br />
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try:
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />I recommend you uninstall the KB4048955
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />Select the recent update
<br />(This is the update you want to uninstall KB4048955)
<br />
<br />Right click it then click uninstall.
<br />
<br />Restart then see if stability is restored. 
<br />
<br />The update might try to install again. So, try blocking it.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>  
<br />
<br />If its the icons and toolbars, then Go back to Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display
<br />Click in the Scale and layout list box, try another scale such as 125 to see if that works or play around with custom scaling. 
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Perform a repair upgrade
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

            Customers with AMD Graphics card in their system are encountering similar issues...
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />The next step would be to block Driver updates from Windows updates. For this, 
<br />Option 1:

<p><span>Hi Cristinaladyjane,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers.</span></p>

</span></span></span><span>How are you accessing the Wi-Fi?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to use it before?</span></p>

<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Was there any changes done prior to this issue?</span></p>

<strong><span><span>A)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></strong><strong><span>Enable or disable network discovery</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>If your computer is connected to a network, network policy settings might prevent you from completing these steps.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>By default, Windows Firewall blocks network discovery (formerly called UPnP technology), but you can enable it.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Network and Sharing Center by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Network and Internet, and then clicking Network and Sharing
 Center. </span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If network discovery is off, click the arrow button ‌ to expand the section.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>iii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Turn on network discovery, and then click Apply.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>B)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>The first time that you connect to a network, you must choose a
<span><em>network location</em></span>. This automatically sets the appropriate firewall settings for the type of network that you connect to. If you connect to networks in different locations (for example, a network at your home, at a local
 coffee shop, or at work), choosing a network location can help ensure that your computer is always set to an appropriate security level.</span></span></p>

    <title>Getting error message&#58; Sonic Focus Drivers must be loaded for this - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foxkatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting error message&#58; Sonic Focus Drivers must be loaded for this application to work</h2>
                    
<p>I recently had to have the Windows XP re-installed on my computer.</p>
<p>All updates have been done thru service pack 3, but every time it boots up I'm getting an error pop-up box with the message for the Intel Audio Controller. It says "Sonic Focus Drivers must be loaded for this application to work."</p>
<p>I've looked online but this seems to be a confusing issue.&nbsp; I'd rather not uninstall anything if it's something I might need for the sound to be decent. Is there anywhere to get the drivers online so I can download them and install?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help on this matter.</p>
