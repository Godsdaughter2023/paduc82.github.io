    <title>Surface 2 RT and Bitlocker - Windoes 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface 2 RT and Bitlocker - Windoes 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Twice now my Surface RT ran out of battery completely (I hadn't used it for over a week) and when I turned it on after charging it, it wanted me to enter a Bitlocker key. So I went thru the process of signing on to a "Trusted" PC and got the key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Why does this happen? All that happened to the device was that it ran out of battery. So why all the fuss with the enter key requirement,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's ok for me for I am somewhat savvy, but what about poor aunt Martha who knows nothing of this stuff and can't really get help 'cause she is old and the kids don't see her very often how. How do those such people cope? They are unlikely to have another
 trusted PC lying around. And that, then, would render the Tablet to a brick..</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Regards to all</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tim</p>

Not trying to turn Bitlocker off - What I'm saying is, the behavior is bizarre to deal with a battery going flat.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>It doesn't make any sense whatsoever - there are no security or data theft issues here - the battery simply has gone flat and, really, that is not the end of the world. It eaves me feeling that this is a bug, unless someone can point to a very good reason
 that this is by design. You can't just say "this is by design". A battery goes flat, so this must be a security issue? I really don't think so.
<div><br />
<div>I can't buy the contention that this is by design - the majority of user's would not have the resources to deal with this.</div>

<p>in General everytime something is stolen, the very first Thing i would do is ensure to reduce possible fraud, locking payment instruments or such - then contact Police for any futher assistance, i guess if necessary either they would tell me what to do with
 xbox Support or maybe have their own contacts.</p>

<h2>             region migration not working</h2>
                    
<p>from Mister Gwyther</p>
<p>Hey there guys! Forum support agents have no way of manually changing an account region for you. The only suggests we can make are to double-check the criteria for a region change (haven't done one recently, not a minor, etc.) and that you contact an account
 agent on chat or phone support for more assistance. They'll be able to look into your account much further than we can. Let us know how that goes, thanks!
</p>
<p>Hi Mister Gwyther. &nbsp;You want to know "how that goes".</p>
<p>Still have two accounts under my gamertag. &nbsp;Connectivity Department can not help me until Accounting Department deletes my old region account completely and when transferred to Accounting Department they say only one region account open every time I ask
 for help with anything( can not sign in, error codes, update errors, all friends offline, buying gold online, and many more region related problems) &nbsp;My xbox live connection speed is SIXTEEN TIMES SLOWER than what it use to be after last region change.</p>
<p>Tried many times by phone and email over the past two years to get my region migration fixed correctly. &nbsp;Many of my friends have migrated to computer gaming and PS4. &nbsp;That is why my friends list is so small now. &nbsp;I may switch soon if I do not get this fixed
 by 2015-06-17( when my gold expires).</p>
<p>Eagerly awaiting for help,</p>
<p>xxxSCORPIONSxxx</p>

<h2>            The LAN is called unknown network and always changes to public network on Windows startup, preventing homegroup - what to do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; We&nbsp;have a home network of two desktops with Windows 7. One is connected wirelessly to the router, the other by wire. On Windows startup the LAN is always&nbsp;<em>Public</em>, and&nbsp;I must go through homegroup trubleshooting to change it to&nbsp;<em>Home</em> network.
 The network type can't be changed directly by clicking it (the type text is black, not blue).&nbsp;On the next startup it is&nbsp;<em>Public</em> again, and&nbsp;I'm not joined in the homegroup without troubleshooting. Can I do something to make it&nbsp;<strong>permanently
<em>Home</em> network</strong>, not&nbsp; <em>Public</em>?</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Can someone explain why the LAN&nbsp;connections - wired and wireless -&nbsp;&nbsp;are named&nbsp;<strong>unknown networks</strong>, and why is it made impossible to rename&nbsp;or join them with&nbsp;another network,&nbsp;through clicking the network icon? Might this be&nbsp;the reason for
 the above mentioned problem: because the connections are unknown they are&nbsp; <em>Public</em> by default, for security reasons? How to make them&nbsp;<strong>named and known</strong>?</p>

            Its not pedagogic made, if ever lerned to connect two XP - computers and suceeded with file-sharing, the day you get a pc with Win7 everything is changed, without reason.
<div>You will probably get huge problems when trying to filetransfer.</div>
<div>I used computers since the beginning of 80:s.</div>
<div>Why isnt it possible for me to, in a simple and pedagogic way, see how I can change the aspect for what I connect to the pc from "unknown network" to "home network"?</div>
<div>I simply want to backup some documents from a pc with XP in it.</div>
<div>I use only the "native" firewalls in both (cause I noticed that nothing else makes a difference in my case)</div>
<div>Its much better to keep only the XP-system with workgroup, if the connected computer doesnt have the same workgroup it cant communicate with filetransfer.</div>
<div>In win7 its not easy to find how to set the workgroup, everything is a big big struggle.</div>
<div>For us that got used to XP and dont need anything else, this happens to be my sons small laptop with win 7.</div>

<h2>            Skype for Business App - Can&#39;t Connect Call Message</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the Skype for Business App for several months now and had this same issue back in May/June 2017.&nbsp; The issue I have is that when I place a call (to a Skype Contact or to join a Skype Meeting) I get a message that says "can't connect call".&nbsp;
 It looks like it id dialing in fine but then the clock on the call never starts from 0:00 and then the message will pop-up about 5 seconds after the clock doesn't start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have the same issue?&nbsp; If so, do you know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Tjones0078,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you <span style="font-weight: bold">
let other users check the issue</span> via signing into this Skype for Business client with their Office 365 account in your organization? If not, please do it and tell us the result. Also,
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, please clarify the "Skype Contact or to join a Skype Meeting" whether is Skype for Business contact or to join a Skype for Business meeting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, please provide a screenshot about that message "cannot connect call" for further analysis. Moreover, which version of Skype for business are you using? Please click Help &gt; choose About
 Skype for Business.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rudy</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick response!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other users have the same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;I should have clarified that I am using the iPhone Skype for Business App and it is updated with the most recent version.&nbsp; I have tried to make a call using AT&amp;T LTE cell service (like normal)&nbsp;and also my Wifi at home...both
 end up with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype Contact means someone at my organization.&nbsp; I would try to call the person directly from the Skype app rather than going through a meeting.&nbsp; Normally this works fine but it doesn't now as of today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype Meeting means I try to join a Skype Meeting that someone sent me in Outlook as it shows my meetings in my Skype app with the option to "Join".&nbsp; Normally this works fine too but it doesn't now as of today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the screen I get when I call a Skype Contact or call into a Skype Meeting.&nbsp; As you can see the clock is stuck at 0:00 and the "mute" button is grayed out where I can't even select it.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66887a02-88cd-4314-85b0-89ce23ebf68e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66887a02-88cd-4314-85b0-89ce23ebf68e" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After about 5 seconds of this screen I get this screen showing at the top "can't connect call".</p>

<span>Hi JohnnBoyyy,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Do you receive any error codes or messages?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Since the issue started after installing the windows updates, you can check windows updates for any optional updates for the webcam.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
<span>You can also refer to the HP website and try updating the latest version of drivers for the webcam and check.</span></p>

                    My old skype account which I wanted to close was linked to my microsoft account (Don't know how that happened) and I can't unlink it. &nbsp;I want to delete it because it's not a professional username. &nbsp;But then it says I will lose my microsoft account and
 my outlook and all my e-mails? &nbsp;What the ****? &nbsp;So I can't change my account name (Username), I can't unlink it, and I can't delete it. &nbsp;So basically I'm stuck with it forever? &nbsp;What kind of bull **** is this? &nbsp;You're forcing me to keep my account open and
 not letting me modify anything. &nbsp;That's terrible design. &nbsp;What do I do with this? &nbsp;

unlinking</a> a Skype account that is already merged to a Microsoft account is currently not possible. Linking Skype accounts follow a series of step by step guide so that the user is fully aware that he/she will be merging his/her accounts. Microsoft aims
 to unify all log-in credentials of its products and services and that is the very core of the merging.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Skype name is unchangeable but you can change your account's Display name as a work around.&nbsp;It would be better to keep the account so that your email account will not be closed. You can opt to not sign in to Skype.

            I have Skype on my Linux mint desktop and I pay for a yearly phone number and phone service ...then i updated to&nbsp; my old win7 laptop to win 10 ...and immediately win10 created a new Skype account based on my hotmail address and now the Skype on my Linux
 mint will not ring when I get incoming calls ...this is crazy to do this to a paying customer!! ..i tried to delete the new unasked profile and my only option was to delete my hotmail account which I have had for years...this is an abuse to a long time customer
 of Microsoft ? My Skype service is now useless ...without a ring notification...many others with this same program but they Skype dont seem to care... and there is no workaround...I have spent days on this<br />

    <title>Delete Transaction History and Unwanted Apps from the Library, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Delete Transaction History and Unwanted Apps from the Library, possible&#63;</h2>
                    <p>First, the story starts here, https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders/&nbsp; (this is where all the transaction appear, including what payment I used) I would like to delete some of the transaction as I don't need them as reference, and to make it more clear,
 however, I don't see any option to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, this is the issue in the Store app. It has some preinstalled app, and some apps I installed back in the time but I don't think I will need them anymore. But they are all sitting in my Library which I cannot delete. As I am buying apps if they are
 useful, I really don't want to file the unwanted&nbsp;apps "waiting to be installed". They are only making me harder to find apps I need from my Library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to compare, and Microsoft is always a well-organized company, but Google Play Store has this features for a long time.. The policy of MSFT is too backward in this issue. I would also like to see the customized transaction history made possible, in
 near future.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
For some icons, right click them and choose properties. On the Shortcut tab, change the "run in" dropdown to maximized. Click apply/ok and the application should now open expanded.<br />
<br />
It may also help when you close a window to hold the &lt;ctrl&gt; key and use the file/exit command rather than the red x in the corner.

    <title>Removal of Installation File Remnants after Uninstall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothy r.harris jr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removal of Installation File Remnants after Uninstall</h2>
                    After noticing certain issues with a program after I downloaded and installed it (CyberLink Media Suite 15 Ultra), I decided to uninstall the program and re-install it from the back-up disk. But when I uninstalled the program, the installation folder remained
 in the Program Files folder along with a couple sub-folders and files (several MB in total).<br />
<em><strong>How do I delete these files and clean them from the registry?</strong></em> There was a tool from Microsoft that was supposed to be able to do this, but it requires knowledge of the Program ID as it is listed in the Registry (one of those alpha-numeric
 codes).<br />
<br />
<em><strong>(TO ANY MICROSOFT PROGRAMMERS/ENGINEERS READING THIS: You need to make a simple-to-use method for this sort of issue. It should work like this:</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>In the File Explorer menu, there should be an option where you highlight an installation folder remnant and its entire contents will be removed/deleted, as well as all of the Registry entries associated with that folder being deleted.)</strong></em><br />

<p>You could&nbsp;setup a hosted network with your Windows 7 machine. Here are a couple of free GUI frontends to the netsh commands that implement this. These turn a Windows 7 wireless machine into a virtual router.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.connectify.me/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.connectify.me/index.html</span></a></p>
<p>Presuming your USB dongle is a 3G/4G broadband device you might also look into purchasing a router. Here are examples...</p>

<p>The upside of the router is that you don't need the Win 7 PC on all the time in order for your other devices to be able to access the public internet.</p>

<p>It does look awesome. I am not a zombie fan at all. Hate The Walking Dead(Dont stone me) and wasnt all to keen on anything with the recent zombie craze. But this is one game that I must play. Maybe bringing some other characters in DLC or something is in
 the mix. Maybe some Street Fighters</p>

<p>The game looks great. I've seen them play for 20 mins almost and I didn't see anything that gave me concern, it just looked like a lot of fun in a stupid way. Perfect for coop IMO.</p>
<p>It's frustrating to see people be put off games by figures before they've played it though. &nbsp;Does it have frame rate dips at particularly busy moments? Possibly, but since when did people start choosing games based on resolution, carefully selected stills,
 and machines measuring FPS? Does anyone realise how frigging stupid that sounds? As a gamer whose enjoyed too many classics.. Goldeneye, Ocarina of Time, etc.. Would we now say that none of those experiences are/were valid if some dude hooks a machine up and
 says 'ah but you do realise it was only 20fps right?' &nbsp;This is the nonsense that is the modern game industry and it tends to be the younger players who weren't around during those times and who have been brought up with spec wars on all products, that tend
 to think that games can't be worth playing unless they hit certain pre decided targets.. What a shame. I just hope reviewers still take the concept of fun into account when writing their reviews!.</p>

    <title>No HDMI Audio on Samsung S22D390 monitor &#40;Win 8.1 and ASUS H81M-A - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No HDMI Audio on Samsung S22D390 monitor &#40;Win 8.1 and ASUS H81M-A motherboard&#41;</h2>
                    <p>[Edit:] <strong>Fixed!&nbsp;</strong>[<strong>Solution:</strong>]&nbsp;downloaded the latest "display audio driver" that is supported by your motherboard. On the motherboard provider's support website, it is listed under "Video" or "VGA". In the case of my "ASUS H81M-A",
 I needed to download "Intel Graphics Accelerator Driver V10.18.10.3412". </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was installing this, my computer said "The currently installed driver is newer than the driver you're trying to install." Well, I guess this "newer" driver isn't supported, because when I finished installing this older driver anyway, my HDMI audio/monitor
 was finally detected under "Playback devices".</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Edit:]&nbsp;I just tried the Samsung S22D390 monitor with my laptop (Win 7) through HDMI, and it worked right away. The monitor appeared under "Playback devices" with no installation required, and "Test" made sound go through the output. So monitor seems to
 be working. But what is the problem with my desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>---</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Samsung S22D390 monitor has audio port on rear. Trying to get it working because it's convenient, but can't get it recognized as an Audio device in Windows. When I look at "Playback devices", there is no mention of my monitor as an audio device. I only
 see "Speakers" and "Realtek Digital Output".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already installed the latest monitor driver. Appears as "SD390_S22D390H / S22D390Q (HDMI)" under "Devices &gt; Monitors".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just installed the "Realtek Audio Driver" for the ASUS H81M-A, thought that might help, but no that didn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "Devices &gt; Sound, video, and game controllers" I see "High Definition Audio Device" with a yellow alert icon. I already uninstalled it, restarted computer, but it just adds it again with the broken state. The device status reads: "This device cannot
 start. (Code 10) {Operation Failed} The requested operation was unsuccessful."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that ASUS H81M-A should have HDMI audio capability, it's a new motherboard.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any suggestions on what I can try?</p>

            <p>You are on the right track with the Code 10 error. The HDMI graphics chip&nbsp;has its own audio "card" separate from the Realtek Audio System. This is used to feed audio to the monitor over a digital connection. Until that is resolved the Sound Control panel
 applet will not offer the second Digital output as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried reinstalling the graphics driver from Asus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove all peripherals not needed to eliminate conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is an option in the BIOS make sure Audio over HDMI is enabled, it is not unusual for Windows to detect hardware even if disabled in the BIOS but cannot drive it properly.</p>

<p>Hey Artichoke,</p>
<p>If you open a new project, you wouldn't see a blank project but rather all your previously imported files would remain on the new project as well so that you can use those files for your new project.</p>
<p>Coming to your query, even if the project has been converted to a movie, if it's raw file is saved on your disk, then by opening the raw project, you should be able to edit the project.</p>
<p>Please find more information on windows movie maker from the articles below.</p>

<p><br />
1. Save your last project FIRST.<br />
Click FILE &gt; Save Project As &gt; give it a file name &gt; select where the project is to be saved to. The project will be saved as ( file name ).MSWMM</p>
<p>2. RE : New project. <br />
As long as you have a blank WMM window, don't bother to go File &gt; New Project. It's a waste of time.<br />
Go straigt to IMPORT section.</p>
<p>3. RE : is there a way to edit once a project has been "published " ( not converted. ) ?<br />
Yes and no. You can always import the movie file back to WMM and do certain editing.<br />
But it will not be as easily as having a ( saved ) MSWMM imported back to WMM.</p>

    <title>Tracking cost during Skype call - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> racingsnake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tracking cost during Skype call</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype Credit and use it frequently to call land, or mobile numbers. Since I foolishly updated my iPhone to the latest Skype for iOS (8.1.2 - I even had to go to the app store to find the version number as I can't find it anywhere in the app itself!),
 I cannot find a way to monitor my credit balance while in a call to see how much it is costing, how much I have left. I am sure that was possible before. I can now only check my remaining balance after the call is finished. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I try and submit this question to the community, having indicated that the issue is Skype &gt; Skype for iOS &gt; Calling, I am forced to pick "Audio and Video" as the "Skype Subject" as that is the only option given. Ridiculous!</p>

            Thank you for clarifying, though I have to say I'm disappointed with the answer; I'm sure I've been able to see my credit change while in a call in the past (i.e. that I've been able to monitor the cost of an ongoing call), but can't remember if that was
 on the Mac, or iPhone via the app. It would see a logical function of the service for future at least....

            <p>Hi Pete,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur due to corrupt user profile as well. Also, the option to switch directly to the most recent app could also trigger such issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the methods:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+C </strong>keys and choose <strong>Settings</strong>. Choose
<strong>Change PC settings</strong>. </li><li>Click/tap on <strong>PC &amp; devices</strong> on the left side. </li><li>Click/tap on <strong>Lock screen</strong> on the left side of <strong>Corners &amp; edges</strong>. Under
<strong>When I swipe in from the left edge, switch between my recent apps instead of showing a list of them</strong> on the right side, move the slider to the&nbsp;left to turn off the setting.
</li><li>Sign-out from the Microsoft account and then sign in again. </li></ul>
<p>Check if that fixes the issue. If not, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps to disable the automatic switching mode from Registry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> keys and type "<strong>regedit</strong>". Hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Move to the following registry location: <strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell\Switcher</strong></li><li>Create a new registry by right clicking on the the left side of the window. Choose new&gt; Dword (32/64 value).
</li><li>Name it as <strong>BackstackMode . </strong>Right Click on it and click on <strong>
Modify</strong>. </li><li>Change the value data to <strong>1</strong>. </li></ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added
 protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, you can refer to the following steps to back the registry files on the computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows and R </strong>keys to open the run box.</li><li>Type ‘<strong>regedit’ </strong>and press <strong>Enter </strong>from the keyboard.</li><li>Open the <strong>file </strong>option on the menu bar.</li><li>Click on <strong>Export </strong>and save the file with a name on the desktop.</li><li>If you want to restore the file, you can do so by double clicking the file that you have saved on the desktop.</li></ul>
<p>Please keep us posted on the status of this issue. </p>

            Your best bet is to contact Apple.&nbsp; While we could help you with windows when you get the computer to boot, only apple can give you authorized support.<br />
