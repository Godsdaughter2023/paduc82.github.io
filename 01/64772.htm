            <p><span>&nbsp;</span>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were there any changes made in the Computer prior to this issue?
</span></p>
<p><br />
To troubleshoot such issue, you may refer these methods: </p>
<p><b><br />
Method 1</b><br />
<br />
Try to run the Network Diagnostics tool. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open Control Panel and click on Network and Sharing Center.<br />
<br />
2. Click on Diagnose and repair. </p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
<br />
Try to release and renew the IP address on both the computer which have same IP address.<br />
<br />
To do this, follow these steps: <br />
<br />
a. Click on <b>Start</b> search box, type <b>cmd</b> in the box. When cmd.exe appears in the list above the search box,
<b>right-click</b> on <b>cmd.exe</b> and choose ’<b>Run as administrator</b>’.<br />
<br />
b. In the C:\ prompt, type <b>ipconfig</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.<br />
<br />
c. Type <b>ipconfig /release</b> and press <b>Enter</b>. </p>
<p>The IP configuration information will refresh. You should see your IP address change to 0.0.0.0.
</p>
<p>d. Type <b>ipconfig /renew</b> and press <b>Enter</b>. </p>
<p><br />
Your computer will attempt to obtain a new IP address from the network. This may take a few minutes.<br />
<br />
If this process is successful, you will see a new IP address listed when the IP configuration information refreshes.<br />
<br />
Restart the computers and check if you have similar issue.</p>
<p><br />
<b>Method 3: </b></p>
<p>Follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps:</p>

<div>Thanks for reply, but I have no idea where to start or find all the stuff I I would need. &nbsp;I'm just an old retired techno doofus. &nbsp;If two items have the same address, I don't know where to start. Is it the router, desk top, laptop, tablet or iPhone?
 &nbsp;I have no clue. The only machine that ever came up with a problem statement was the Administrator Desk Top computer. Everybody else is fine, except for maybe the router. I've replaced the Motorola DSL 10/100 modem with an identical unit, but it still goes
 haywire, generally overnight, and shows a red Internet light in the am. &nbsp;I have to pull power cables on both modem and router, and then replug them. Then they work ok for most of the day. &nbsp;The router is new and issues started soon after getting it. It's an
 N router, and my old one was a Pre-N router by Belkin. &nbsp;It was fine except I had major connection issues with my iPhone. &nbsp;Belkin said they had many reports of like issues on the Pre-N and 3G iPhones. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for the long dissertation, but I just got rolling. &nbsp;Honestly, I just don't think the issue is sufficient to worry about at this time to spend much more time "jawing" about it. &nbsp;Just check it up to techno nerd! :-)&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>I thought I had this corrected, but it still is not functioning the right way.&nbsp; When I sign out my volume reduces to zero and I have to go to Control Panel to bring volume up.&nbsp; The solution posed was,...."go to Start" menu, search for "Change Sound Card
 settings", then go to communications tab, and check box for 80% volume.&nbsp; I did check the box accordingly, but the volume still reverts to zero upon sign-out.&nbsp; What now?&nbsp; Whanks</p>

<p>You will get a kick out of this.&nbsp; I told my wife I had to go to the computer to work on solving a volume problem.&nbsp; On this computer, I use Firefox, when she signs in, she uses IE9.&nbsp; On IE9 the bottom screen shows volume control, on Firefox it doesn't.&nbsp; She
 said, "Oh, I've been turning it off, because I don't like the volume on".&nbsp; So, apparently there is now, no problem, and if there is, I will get back to you.&nbsp; Thanks again for your assist.</p>

<h3> liam_aitken  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP&#33; FSX ACTIVATION WIZARD PROBLEM</h2>
                    
<p>On the other hand if this is the right Forum then here is my problem:</p>
<p>I had an old laptop which I had fsx running on just fine. It was activated and ran without a problem. The laptop then broke and I didn't uninstall it before it&nbsp; broke. I got a new laptop (Acer Aspire 5542, AMD TurionII X2 M500, 2.2 GHz, 1MB L2 Cache, 640GB
 hard drive and 4GB memory, running Windows 7) and installed FSX just fine and activated it. I played the game for a few months before deciding that a complete uninstall and reinstall would be a good idea.</p>
<p>So i uninstalled the game without a hitch and reinstalled it just as easily. The problem is that when FSX started up after the installation, no activation wizard came up and fsx started in the trial mode. As I expected i had no multiplayer features and also
 I knew it would cut out after 30mins. After playing it for 30 mins I get the message that the trial time has expired and that I should activate it. So I restarted FSX to try to activate it but as with the previous start, no activation wizard came up and the
 game started once again in trial mode. Infact, no activation wizard came up at anytime I started it.</p>
<p>My question is how can I activate fsx if no wizard box appears upon starting fsx? Because of this, everytime I start fsx&nbsp;I can only run it in trial mode.&nbsp;I have looked for solutions on the internet but it seems no one has the same problem as me. I have also
 uninstalled and reinstalled fsx more than once but the same thing happened where no activation wizard box appears.</p>
<p>A helpful answer would much appreciated because it will decide whether or not I continue to buy Microsoft products. I do hope however that it won't come to that.</p>
<p>I suppose it's also worth mentioning that all my software includng windows 7 and fsx were all purchased legally from well known retailers.</p>
<p>I also ran Service Pack 2 with Fsx before this problem began.</p>
<p>I have my CD box and it is in very good condition and the software product code is still stuck to the inside of the box and is stil easily readable but I unfortunately can't use it because no activation wizard appears when starting fsx.</p>
<p>I hope one of the many experts or regular members could help me.</p>
<p>Could somone please answer quickly because I am desperate to fix it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Liam</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;does anyone know how to copy something on the screen in others ways?<br />
<br />
Assuming you are using Vista. Vista has another but rudimentary application..... print screen.<br />
Look at your keyboard. Somewherre at the top right corner, a key that says .... Prnt Scrn, or SysRq, or just plain Print Screen.<br />
If found, you also need a built-in application called Paint.<br />
Using these 2 programs, you can screen capture. <br />
<br />
Here is the general method of using print screen and paint.....<br />
<br />
<span>Where is Paint :<br />
Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; scroll down to find Paint.<br />
<br />
How to print screen :<br />
Open the page or window you want to printscreen &gt; press&nbsp; <strong>
Alt</strong> key and&nbsp; <strong>print screen</strong> key together ( it will seem that nothing has happened. Relax. )&gt; open Paint &gt; press<strong>&nbsp; Ctrl</strong>&nbsp;+<strong>V</strong>keys
 together &gt; the image is now in the Paint window. You can do some types of&nbsp;editing in Paint window.&nbsp;&gt; File &gt; Save As &gt; navigate to the folder of your choice &gt; Save<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Personally I use a 3rd party screen-capture software. It is&nbsp;<strong>NOT free</strong>, but I like it. It is more than just screen capturing.<br />
It is called Snagit. Cost $49.95 US.</span></p>

Do a system file check. See if filechecking can fond corrupted files and repair them.<br />
<br />
<div>Start button &gt; search box&nbsp; type&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> cmd</strong>&nbsp; &gt; look up, RIGHT click on<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>cmd.exe</strong></span> &gt; click<strong>Run As Administrator</strong> &gt; in that black and white cmd window, type at the flashing
 prompt&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>&nbsp; &gt; press <strong>ENTER</strong> key.<br />
Note : there is a <strong>Space</strong> between "sfc" and "/".<br />
Sit back and wait. It will take some time.<br />
When done, exit cmd window.<br />
Reboot ( re-start your computer )</div>

            Thank you both for taking the time and trouble replying.&nbsp; Davidhk129 - I read a similar answer to yours in reply to someone elses question regarding something similar, but the thing that put me off was the replier said that I could be asked to use the
 Vista DVD/CD - I don't have a cd or dvd because when I bought the computer from PC World it was already preinstalled and I never got any discs with it at all.&nbsp; Do you think it would be OK for me to follow your instructions, or do you know if it will ask me
 for the disc and what will happen because I don't have it, I don't want to make matter worse? Sorry, but i'm thick when it comes to computers! thanks

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; the thing that put me off was the replier said that I could be asked to use the Vista DVD/CD<br />
I don't remember who and where the above&nbsp;reference was said. Perhaps you would give the the link to that reply ?<br />
<br />
In any event, doing system file check has absolutely <strong>&nbsp;nothing to do with Vista DVD</strong>. You will never be asked to insert the DVD.</p>

            Thanks very much once again for taking the time and trouble to reply. There was a few links that suggested they MIGHT need the DVD. I think if you search for 'Snipping Tool' there are quite a few that mention the disk, but, admittedly the problems they
 are referring to are not exactly the same as mine, so maybe the disk thing doesn;t affect me. i've found 2 links a the moment

<p>Hello caterena,</p>
<p>Go to Start, click on Control Panel - select&nbsp;Programs and Features. Click on&nbsp;"Turn Windows Features On - Off"<br />
Uncheck Tablet PC Optional&nbsp;Components. Reboot. Now, go back and select Tablet PC Components and then go back and see<br />
if you are able to open Snipping Tools. <br />
Snipping Tools is under&nbsp;All Programs, Accessories.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>You can try and see if doing a System Restore point would help with your issue.</p>
<p>To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>
<p>Now, see if you can use the Snipping Tool again.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            <p><strong><span>Hi dennis goodwin,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community Forums.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You have an issue with Google Earth not functioning on Windows 7.
</span><span>It can be difficult when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get
 this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Please answer these questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this limited to Google Earth?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you completely uninstall the program and then download Google Earth.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.google.co.in/earth/download/ge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.google.co.in/earth/download/ge/</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Step 1-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you place the computer in a clean boot and then try to install the program.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the article-</span></p>
<p><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span><span><br />

</span><span>Step</span><span>
</span><span>3</span><span> from the article to get the computer back to
</span><span>Normal Startup</span><span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists in a Clean Boot state as well, then proceed to Step 2.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2-</span></p>
<p><span>Try to run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link-</span></p>
<span>Make older programs run in this version of
<span>Windows</span></span>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>If none of the suggestions help fix your issue, then I would have you contact Google Earth for further assistance.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;Now THERE is the bottom line. &nbsp;You just can't afford not to make backups. &nbsp;If you don't, you end up learning via the school of hard knocks. &nbsp;The school of hard knocks is an excellent teacher, but it is painful and often expensive.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Look in the Onedrive folder. &nbsp;Some things are backed up there. &nbsp;However there's no substitute for making backups yourself to an external hard drive. &nbsp;Macrium Reflect and Easeus Todo Backup are two excellent free (for non-commercial use) backup programs,
 and you can buy a 1 TB external hard drive for approx. $50.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 servers shutting down in 2016 &#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've been hearing buzz on Xbox live that you will be shutting down the 360 servers and discontinuing making games for the 360 all together ! That's just plain WRONG ! Some of us simply cannot afford the Xbox one nor can we rebuild the game collection we
 already have ! I actually joined the xbox family about 6 years ago,....back then I was strictly a PS'er until my son convinced me to get an xbox 360 and start paying for a12 month live membership every year so I did and have been amazed at the games and the
 friendships I've made. Shutting down the servers would be a terrible thing for me because I not only have many friends here I also use it to keep in touch with my son who lives in another state and play games with him. PLEASE......don't take the 360 away !
 I will eventually get an Xbox one, just not for awhile ! I really don't want to go back to Sony and the PlayStation. 'Nuff said !</p>

<p>The 360 servers will be shut down at some point, they can`t possibly go on forever.</p>
<p>But at this point no one knows when that will be.</p>
<p>I don`t understand how going to sony would help, ps3 will be shut down too at some point.</p>

<p>...i really do hope they dont . im just about to get a brand new game for the 360 and the last thing i want is to lose online to it the second i get it. thats just ridiculous to do to gamers. look gamers are pouring in money to this console more so then
 ps3 seriously they make a heck of a lot of money off this console its been on for a while and people absolutely love the system but to make new games then shut down the servers to the games right after is just a giant slap to the face and then being unable
 to recreate their collection on the next gen is absurd. &nbsp;and thats even IF we have the money to even afford the next gen in the first place. if anything &nbsp;i think Microsoft is making a big mistake shutting down the servers so soon like this sure xboxone has
 just been released. but seriously. 360 is going surprisingly strong and shutting it down now would just anger if not alienize a lot of valuable customers that could still be pouring in the dough for quite a few more years. some people have kinda been put off
 by xboxones need for online to even play games anyways. and 360 is the best of both worlds. if anything if the Xboxone is losing some gamers they may just end up going BACK to 360 because it allows us arcade play rather then being forced to have a functional
 network. which means games will still be played or bought. but i know what your thinking how does that make 360 still viable to have the servers compared to xboxone needing them? its simple. eventually that person will want to play the games they bought for
 360 online and eventually get it.</p>

<p>That's the unfortunate side of buying digital games also, as you are only buying a licence to play the game they can remove it or make it inaccessible at any point they want, if and when they close the servers to the Xbox 360 there will be a lot of games
 that wont run due to DRM and you would not be able to re download any games either.</p>

<p>Xbox LIVE for Xbox 360 won't be shut down anytime soon. Microsoft released the Xbox 360 Holiday bundles last year, they wouldn't do that and then shut the Xbox LIVE servers for Xbox 360 a year or two later. There are still games coming out for Xbox 360 this
 year.</p>
<p>Looking at past history, the Original Xbox no longer had games being made until 2005 (Madden 2006 was the last game released on Original Xbox in August 2005), and the servers shut down in 2010. So Xbox 360 LIVE servers will probably be running until at least
 2020 (hopefully), if you can look at the past for reference.</p>

<p>I tend to agree with Silvercube, I think they're in a unique position as no other gaming services has provided such a diverse range in digital content on a console before, so just shutting them off isn't going to be as simple as the original Xbox imo.</p>
<p>Also I believe the 360 still has a huge user base that's spending money on the service, until that's dried up and majority of the community is on Xbox One, I can't see them disabling the service by 2016.

<p>I have belief that the 360 will stick around for much longer. We may see update support completely taken away at some point, but I'm sure the servers will be around for many years to come.

<p>Yeah but the 360 is so slow compared to the Xbox One in gameplay.</p>
<p>The controller and console run so smooth together.</p>
<p>It is so accurate you can take the controllers vibration and the light waves the xbox sends to the tv while playing a game and look at a other screen that only displays this controller vibrations in echo waves and you will be able to tell where it will hit
 you in a shooter.</p>
<p>You can then play a racing game and not hit the wall ones because it is such balanced that only focusing on this waves will make it possible to follow the track perfectly fine.</p>
<p>I tried that.</p>
<p>The 360 is worlds behind the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Im sorry you could not explore this yet but man I cant find a way to play my 360 again.</p>
<p>I loved my 360 and still do but I figured this about the Xbox One and I cant resist.</p>

<p>I am also in agreement with the gentlemen above I don't see Xbox live for the Xbox 360 getting shut down for a while. Too many digital games and new games coming out for it. It is still profitable as well for Microsoft in game sales. If you want it to stay
 alive keep using xbox live and keep playing.</p>

<p><span>Hi Stephanie Ruiz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 player are you using to sync on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you getting the sync error on the MP3 player or in Windows?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Assuming that you are using Windows media player to sync I would suggest that you rebuild the Windows media player library and
 later try to sync.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You cannot view, add, or delete items in the library in Windows Media Player 11</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925718" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/925718</a></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above step fails then try to manually copy and paste the music file onto the MP3 player and check if you can play it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are getting error on the MP3 player while syncing you will need to contact the player manufacturer for more information and support.</span></p>

<h2>            No signal after 15 minutes, screen shuts off</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I got&nbsp;a very inexpensive non-smart tv by element electronics, 50"</p>
<p>however, when I play a movie with VLC the movie plays the whole way through but when i'm watching something on youtube, that's long, the screen shuts off after 15 minutes.</p>
<p>I figure it\'s software but can't figure out how to make youtube last.</p>
<p>I do have an hdmi plug but am playing sound off of rca jacked, subwoofer and surround sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my pc is operating windows 8 (Don't bother asking me to upgrade to 10 please)</p>
<p>can I install something that will send/receive signals to my television to keep the screen from cutting off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.</p>

<h2>            Why Microsoft trying to steal my credit card number and personal ID data&#63;</h2>
                    &nbsp;Hi<br />
<br />
I created Skype account 16 years or more ago.&nbsp; Starting from monday 16-04-2018 I have troubles with logon to Skype.<br />
<br />
I can do that without any problems only from Windows 10 but on my machines with Windows 7 Microsoft ask me about 'brithdate', 'parent agreement' then trying to get my credit card number and copy of my personal ID documents - these questions are privacy violations!!<br />
<br />
In my investigations I found that my Skype account&nbsp; named 'xyz' was also migrated to Microsoft Live Id as 'xyz@mail' - there are no family relation between these accounts - these are alises!<br />
<br />
Even more. In Skype account 'xyz'&nbsp; I changed bith date to 1.1.1950&nbsp; then I go to Live as 'xyz@mail' and&nbsp; I see birt date 03.02.2015 ... account are aliases but not synchronized.&nbsp; Moreover in Live account 'xyz@mail' i can't change Country and Birt date - both
 field are non editable.<br />
<br />
Who can fix this synchronization issue - Live Id accounts are created in a pitiful way and not available for users.<br />
Why FAQ asking people with logon problems to 'logon in Live' - we can't logon!<br />
How can Microsoft algoritms can be so stupid thinnking that 3 years old 'user' can use Skype and Live Id?<br />
<br />
Why Microsoft ban Windows 7 users?

<p><span>Unfortunately, Skype is not made for minors and if the birthdate registered is of a child, it will require parental consent.

<p><span>Please be assured that there is no Microsoft ban with Windows 7 users.

<p>It&nbsp;is miserable error of accounts migration of Microsoft programmers.</p>
<p>- Skype account is incorrectly synchronized with Live account, if Skype user change profile data then these data are not sent to update Live Id (and finally both accounts have different birth date)</p>
<p>- invalid logic verification &nbsp;in code, account created 14 years ago can not&nbsp;belong to child. it is impossible. This user must be adult now!&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;got registration date from Skype data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;Skype is not made for minors </p>
<p>That is not true. Skype newer required to use valid birthdate!&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Microsoft "feature" and Microsoft should&nbsp; send kindly message to Skype and Live&nbsp;users to update their date before.</p>
<p>All &nbsp;I see that Microsoft require money for Skype and Live usage.</p>

If you check this account then ypou can see that in Skype I have got birt date 1-1-1950 ...I'm oldest child on the world.</span></a></span></p>

<p>&gt;<span><span>Since Skype is now under Microsoft, it will have to adapt the company's policy.<br />
So warn users before or update code.&nbsp; Current&nbsp;treatment of old Skype users is ridiculos.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The real problem is bug in accounts migration from Skype to Live. After migration old Skype users have two accounts. One with Skype login and second with Skype email. Change of birthdate on this second account is impossible so you can be old
 "child".<br />
If you change date on 'skype login' then this date is not propagated to Live email account.<br />
<br />
&gt;</span></span>It is privacy violation.<br />
It's definately privacy violation if non advanced user follow steps of "parental agreement" then credit card i copy of ID document is required!<strong><br />
<br />
<br />
For all with similar problem.&nbsp; Do not send your credit card numbers nad ID's copy to M$!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>There is simply workaround.&nbsp; Try to logon using Win8 machine and/or&nbsp; use another Live account of "adult user" (with dummy adult birth date). Then on this real or fake account add your old Skype user as an adult. Problem with Skype logon will be solved
 - no more&nbsp;"parental agreement" screen but I still can't change birthdate of this Skype/Live user.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW</p>
<p>Furthermore Skype pages has "Contact/Complaint form" - forget about that, no&nbsp;answers. Problem is registered at all.<strong><br />

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft requires users to provide their date of birth<em> in compliance </em>
with applicable laws and regulations to protect children's online security. <span>
One of the commonly used methods, which is <em>approved </em>under regulation, is to charge a small nonrefundable fee to a credit or debit card. However, if you don't have or can't use a credit or debit card, you can send us proof of age to validate you're
 an adult. See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4090292/microsoft-account-age-verification-for-parental-consent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Age verification for parental consent</a></span></p>

<p>As you see there are not childs here. Basic user behavior analysis show that already.</p>
<p>Small charge is also not problem but I have no guarantee of further abuse from M$.<br />
Why don't you simply tell people that "Live accounts" are not for free? It's clear and honest.</p>
<p><br />
I'm a developer and I know that you have problems with bug in accounts management.<br />
Moreover, current cost of support talks for this problem was much much more than "small charge", you loosing m$oney.<br />

            I probably can't help you. After two weeks of fighing I see only that M$ closes every day next channel of access to Skype.<br />
Now working only Skype for web - working but don't show notifications.<br />
All you can do without charge is to join "child" account to another account as a "mature user".<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>1. Are you facing the issue only with </span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">MS Outlook and MS Lync</span><span>?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Which version of Microsoft Office is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Do you remember making any software or hardware changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to any recent Office updates or other software changes on the computer.</p>
<p><span>If the issue occurs only with Outlook 2013 live tile or with any other Office 2013 application’s live tiles, then the other users who were facing similar issue were able to resolve the issue by installing Office 2013 Service Pack 1 (SP 1) Update.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the thread link and refer to the suggestions provided by CaptainFodder and Argun on March 20, 2014 and check.</span></p>

            <p>Hi t.arodgers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand your issue about WiFi connection. Please follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Run the Network adapter troubleshooter.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Click on search bar next to <strong>Start Menu</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without the quotes, and click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Click on <strong>View All </strong>on the left panel of the screen.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Select on <strong>Network Adapter.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Click on <strong>Next</strong>, and follow the instructions.
</span></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Restart your PC, and check if you can connect to your WiFi again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> If still the same, please perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot.</a></strong><strong>
</strong>It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers, and start up programs. Also, it helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, or an update, or when you run a program in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still occurs, you may check the steps provided on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link.</a></strong></p>

    <title>Not able to maximize Photoshop from taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamejokey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not able to maximize Photoshop from taskbar</h2>
                    This happens only on my surface pro 3 running windows 10 (clean install). If I open photoshop, and minimize it, I cannot maximize it by clicking on the taskbar icon. I can see the preview when I hover on it, but when I click I just get the error sound.
 Happens only when a file is open. Cannot replicate the issue on my desktop running windows 10 either, and others dont seem to have the same problem. Any ideas?

<h2>            Win 8.1 Desktop keeps flashing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Need some help please. I'm not technical but have tried and searched for an answer for two days.</p>
<p>Have got Windows 8.1, with IE 11, with up to date Norton 360, running on a Toshiba Satellite&nbsp;laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday after I logged in, the Desktop image and Task bar loaded but no Desktop icons. Then the Desktop keeps flashing alternatively with a blue screen. Can't effectively click on the Task bar icons.</p>
<p>Works O.K. in Safe mode with Internet connection.<br />
There are no Restore points!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried booting with "Low Resolution Video" but same problem.<br />
Tried "Start up Repair" but it couldn't fix the problem.<br />
Tried "Fix problems with Windows Update" - got two error messages - "One or more Windows Update components are configured incorrectly" and "The location where Windows Update stores data has changed and must be repaired"
<br />
Believe the last update was from Adobe but can't uninstall it whilst in Safe mode.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was pre-installed - I don't have the disc.<br />
Laptop is under guarantee but Toshiba only suggested running "Refresh" but that would mean reinstalling loads of software.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />
Sid.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
Thanks very much for your replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Masterchiefxx17 - before I try to update and reinstall the graphics card driver as you suggest, could you please try to explain how that could resolve the apparent problem with "Windows Update"<br />
not working? Is it because I'm trying to run "Windows Update" in Safe mode and the only problem is in fact the graphics card driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robert Aldwinckle - I tried Win-P to switch to Duplicate - no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm furious with Microsoft and/or Toshiba. Why should I have this hassle with a laptop less than 8 months old.<br />
Is it time to bite the bullet and run "Refresh" then re-install over 30 software programs? What then - live in hope it won't happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks,<br />
Sid.</p>

<p>What did you see then?&nbsp; E.g. was it actually in Extend as suspected?&nbsp;&nbsp; Actually I usually say
<strong>press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter to switch to Duplicate</strong>, in case the user isn't going to see the Project menu at all (usually in a blank screen scenario), so I hope you are implying that you saw something and didn't just assume that pressing Win-P
 was going to switch to Duplicate.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should probably reboot with Low res video specified.&nbsp; Since you can get into Task Manager you could do that via msconfig.exe and not have to bother with either the Advanced Boot Options menu or bcdedit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions but unfortunately neither worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end the only solution was to back up everything and then 'Refresh' the operating system.<br />
As expected, I then had to re-install loads of software but at least the system retained my documents, photos, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After 24 hours, everything seems back to normal.</p>

            <p>I was searching for solutions to this same problem and came across the issue in Win10 systems. &nbsp;The fix that everyone said worked for them was to remove the two error reporting services that were running using msconfig - a little difficult to type when the
 screen flashes but it can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start, Run, msconfig</p>
<p>uncheck Problem Reports and Solutions Control Panel (there were 2 processes and they were named differently in Win10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so far this has stopped the flashing.</p>

            <p>You obtain the full feature software from HP support pages, and dont conect the printer until the installation says to.</p>
<p>If you then get any failure msg, is this a new PC? Have you installed any third party maintenance utilities? What AV/Internet or other protection software have you installed?</p>

            <p>1. Exact message is 'Unsuccessful Newtork Installation'. The printer was unable to be installed over the network. If I try installing by connecting the USB, the message is Device Driver was not successfully installed. Please consult with your device manufacturer
 for assistance getting this device installed.</p>
<p>2. Brief history of this.</p>
<p>I bought this printer a month or so ago, to use it on weekends at my cottage. I could not get it wirelessly installed, and based on some advice I got, I replaced my aging router with a new CISCO.</p>
<p>The printer connected immediately.</p>
<p>I installed the HP software on this machine from the supplied DVD and was able to print immediately.</p>
<p>After a few weekends, I got to the place I am at now, where it will not connect to the printer.</p>
<p>The printer has a valid 192.168.1.138 IP address, so it sees the router. </p>
<p>I decided to unistall the printer and reinstall it. I then had Windows Update problems which I resolved separately.</p>
<p>I have not been able to reinstall the printer either with USB or wireless (the software actually sees the printer, but fails the install).</p>
<p>I use Microsoft Security Essentials which is up to date. The installation still fails with it turned off.</p>
<p>I'd like to know WHY it is failing, but don't know where to look.</p>

<h2>            Changing Lock Screen Picture in Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    I am trying to change my lock screen picture on my laptop running Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; I go into the settings and it allows me to change the lock screen picture. However, when I test it by locking the computer my older lock screen picture still shows up,
 not the lock screen picture I wanted to change it to.&nbsp; Is there a step I am missing to change my lock screen picture?

<ul>
<li>Which build version of Windows 10 is on your computer? To check, click <strong>

    <title>100&#37; disk usage when playing Fez or Grim fandango remastered - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> goosedbylinkith  say:</h3>
<h2>            100&#37; disk usage when playing Fez or Grim fandango remastered</h2>
                    <p>I have an MSI GE62 2QL Apache laptop and the specs are: <br />
Intel i7 -5700 HQ 2.7ghz<br />
12GB RAM</p>
<p>Nvidia 950M 2GB graphics card&nbsp;</p>
<p>1TB HDD (not sure which brand)&nbsp;</p>
<p>running windows 10 64 bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I've been having is whenever I've run Either Grim fandango remastered, or Fez through steam my disk usage shoots up to 100% and the games and my laptop just freeze. This only seems to happen whenever I try play these two games everything else
 runs fine. I've looked up solutions for this problem like disabling superfetch and a few others but the problem still persists. I think it has something to do with the system and compressed memory process as that is what takes up most of the disk usage. I've
 tried to find solutions to fix it but I haven't been able to find anything so if anyone has one it'd be much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unfortunate that you are facing this issue. Let me assist you to&nbsp; resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Share this information to assist you better.</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any recent changes prior to this issue?</li><li>Is the issue particular to that game or other games also?</li><li>Have you installed all the pending updates?</li></ol>
<p>I understand that you get High disk usage error while playing game. I’ll certainly help you with this.</p>
<div><br />
This issue may occur if there are many programs set to start automatically when the Windows start or due to low hard disk space.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong>Run the System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong>.<br />
2. Click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
3. Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
4. On the left pane, click on <strong>View All</strong>.<br />
5. Click on <strong>System Maintenance </strong>to run the troubleshooter.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you refer the following article and&nbsp;try the suggestions&nbsp;to free up drive space in Windows 10<br />

<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue persist, I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>clean boot</strong>.</span></p>

If the System Recovery Software/Process does not work, contact the Computer Manufacturer.<br />
<br />
It is their Recovery Process, not Microsoft's.<br />
<br />
You may have a more deep-seated problem than&nbsp;a failed Recovery attempt.<br />
