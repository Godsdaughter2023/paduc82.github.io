<h2>            Windows update hosed my computer settings</h2>
                    <p>I had a windows update on my machine about 2 weeks ago and there was a restart.&nbsp; When I logged back in it had caused outlook and office pro to stop working and every time I tried to restart outlook it would go into a repair state that never did fix the problem.&nbsp;
 My docs folders were read only which is the main reason I don;t like those darn updates.&nbsp; Also some other programs stopped working.&nbsp; D**m it.</p>
<p>I purchased Outlook 2019 from the MS online store.&nbsp; It won't install either.&nbsp; D**M it again.</p>
<p>It seems as though tech support is so D**m difficult to get too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I played hell getting the docs folder not read only and also tried unlocking other folders that gets locked up for these darn updates.&nbsp; Never had a problem before now, but it has failed in a big way this time by corrupting my smooth running machine&nbsp; &nbsp;STOP
 LOCKING FILES AND CRAPPING OUT MACHINE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dissatisfied and now po'ed.</p>

            I'm afraid its not that easy.&nbsp; I have a cd with the Office iso and a link to the Outlook download install that just stops the install in the process of the install.&nbsp; As a matter of fact, everything I try fails to install.&nbsp; The bar gets to half ways then
 just stops.&nbsp; Thanks for your help Vijay

<p>A few things you can try.</p>
<p>1.) Report all gamertags on Xbox Live; the Enforcement Team will look at all reports and take necessary actions.</p>
<p>2.) Block communications with the gamer tags; do not message them, or they will become unblocked.</p>
<p>3.) Set your Xbox Live status to offline, so they won't see when you're on.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t re-install keyboard&#33;</h2>
                    I uninstalled my keyboard as it was acting up. I restarted computer, forgetting that I would have to type in my password to get back to my desktop to reinstall the keyboard. Now I can't get in!! My kids' accounts are not password protected but they do
 not have administrator rights so their desktops won't allow my to install the keyboard. What do I do now?

<h2>            Skype, HDMI and sound</h2>
                    <p>We have an Android tablet that we use for Skype and other things. Using an HDMI link we bring sound an pictures up on the TV. This all works well for pod casts, films and YouTube. However, it doesn't work for Skype. We get the pictures on the TV but the
 sound still comes from the tablet speakers which is low volume and poor quality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there Skype HDMI settings that I need to use or maybe somthing else? The tablet seems able to work for all sound/picture HDMI tranmissions except for Skype sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone help?</p>

</p><p>There are no Skype HDMI settings that you can configure from within the application itself. These settings should be configured on the devices used for transmission.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing, since support for Skype on TV has long been discontinued, we do not have a guarantee that the full functionality of Skype will work even with an HDMI transmission from a supported device. &nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for your reply and information about Skype software.&nbsp; I can only imagine that Skype has been configured not to transmit HDMI sound to a TV as our tablet can send sound from all other apps we have tried.&nbsp; Seems an odd thing to do?&nbsp; Is there anything
 particular about the&nbsp;way Skype transmits sound to make it different from say YouTube or BBC iPlayer?

<p>
</p><p><strong>A: </strong>There are different support&nbsp;for different applications. We do not have information on how other applications transmit audio but the main difference is other apps still support TV transmission but Skype&nbsp;on TV isn't
 supported anymore. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply.&nbsp; When you say "supported", does this mean that technical support for resolving issues is not available for TV on Skype or that it is now not possible to hear Skype on a TV via a link&nbsp;from a device?</p>
<p>

<p>Support for Skype on TV has long been discontinued. There may be compatibility issues with Skype and some HDMI settings, that is why we do not recommend using this method as there is no guarantee with audio and video transmissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried to make video calls using this method? Currently, Skype users are directed to the Community for general technical assistance.

<p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using an HDMI cable has enabled us to transmit&nbsp;video to the TV but not audio.&nbsp; To overcome the issue we are going to try to link our tablet to an external speaker by Bluetooth.&nbsp; The tablet's external&nbsp;speakers are inadequate, unfortunately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it would be helpful if the HDMI link and support for Skype on TV could be worked on as I would think that many Skype users like to have access to a large TV screen for their calls, particularly families or large groups.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Skype on TV was fully deprecated mid year last year. I understand that some users would want to bring back the support for TV, however as Skype is continuously evolving it is necessary to retire support for some Skype-enabled devices.

            I beleive that we all understand that Slype for TV is no longer supported. My understanding is that Slype for TV &nbsp;was for “smart” TVs that were able to Skype wthout a computer. This question is about getting Skype audio to go from a device connected to
 a TV etc via an HDMI cable. Is that possoble or not?

<p>Thanks.for your reply. Yes, the question&nbsp; is about getting audio from a device (our tablet in this case) to our TV (which is not Skype&nbsp; smart.)</p>

<h2>            mistake - i need to use local account instead of online account</h2>
                    Hi<br />
when I installed windows 8.1 I was stupidly still connected to the internet and i needed to use an outlook.com account to log back in, rather than the local (administrator) user account I had before the upgrade. I don't want all users logging into my pc to
 see my online outlook.com account name, let alone use that account to always log into my computer. How can I revert back to my local user account and not use an online account and still keep all my user documents and settings intact.<br />
<br />
In other words - I just want to change back to local user account from the online microsoft account to log into my computer. How can I do that?<br />
<br />
(also - it's ok I can manage cloud storage myself - i don't need help :) )<br />
<br />
thanks :)<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Wifi does not show all available network connections except for mine with which i cannot always connect</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>On October 9th 2017 there was an update on my windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>the next day i wasn't able to trace any other wifi connection than mine with which i was not able to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following days i tried many things i found over the internet but came up with nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now i can connect only through ethernet cable. I am still not able to trace any other wifi connection than mine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when i open the pc sometimes it connects automatically to my wifi and sometimes it doesn't and of course it disconnects whenever it wants through the day and cannot reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can connect through the desktop and the smart tv and smart phone to my wifi connection and of course i can trace all the other connections around me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a windows problem or do i have some kind of virus in my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please help me i'm starting to lose my mind...</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<h2>            Transfer Windows 10 Pro license to another computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an old laptop that has basically run its course, so I want to install some Linux OS on it, just for fun. But I don't want to lose the Windows 10 Pro license I have on it. I originally received the license from a Windows 7 Professional installation
 disk that I got from my school, since it's my old school laptop, and then I upgraded it to Windows 10. The computer has a digital license and is tied to my Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>So is there any way I can transfer it to my other main PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Thanks, I've been taking a look at that, but I honestly don't know if my license is eligible for transfer because of how I got it. I'm having a hard time understanding it myself. So I guess the question should've probably been more close to "is my license
 transferable", now when I think about it...<br />

            I understand. I’m assuming the windows 7 from your school was a volume license. Let me do some digging and see if it’s transferable. I bet if it is it’s a once shot deal. I’ll be in touch <br />- C

            Well that’s promising... <br /><br />I feel like if there was an issue with the license (win 7) it would have barked when upgrading to 10. <br /><br />I have 2 methods below that should help you retrieve your license. Let me know if it gives you a valid key when you run the command. <br /><br /> Open a new command prompt window. - click start, type cmd and hit enter <br />Type the following command:<br /><br />wmic path softwarelicensingservice get OA3xOriginalProductKey<br /><br />It will immediately show you the product key.<br /><br />If that doesn’t work, ProduKey should help identify your key.<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> <br /><br />- C

            The command just returned "OA3xOriginalProductKey" and then a few new lines. But ProduKey worked and gave me a product key that seems valid.

<h2>            Some fonts are being replaced by weird characters</h2>
                    <p><span>Looks like Verdana Bold is being replaced by weird characters in Safary, Explorer and Chrome, and I went to see the "Live Timing" from the Formula 1 website and their java application is switching all the fonts
 to weird characters. Also, if I visit the page of the new fonts in Windows 7, at Microsoft website, the page keeps reloading and showing the title's characters with Asian characters.</span></p>
<p>I am having this problem over a year now and no one seems to know what this is. Microsoft is a hassle, to be true.</p>
<p>And in my "fonts" folder, I have around one hundred and forty font's files that have their icons light gray, like they are not selected (?), and they names shows with Asian characters. What the heck is that?</p>
<p><span>Anyway, can anyone help?</span></p>

            <p>Hi Contiusa,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Check the region settings in Windows whether it is correct or not.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-the-country-or-region-setting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change the country or region setting</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Run System File Check (SFC) scans and checks if it helps.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows
 7</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> System File Checker gives an administrator the ability to scan all protected files to verify their versions. If System File Checker discovers that a protected
 file has been overwritten, it retrieves the correct version of the file from the cache folder (%Systemroot%\System32\Dllcache) or the Windows installation source files, and then replaces the incorrect file. System File Checker also checks and repopulates the
 cache folder. You must be logged on as an administrator or as a member of the Administrators group to run System File Checker. If the cache folder becomes damaged or unusable, you can use the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>, the <strong>sfc /scanonce</strong>, or the <strong>
sfc /scanboot</strong> commands to repair its contents.</p>

            <p><span>Yes, "hide fonts based on language setting" was checked already, but today I discovered that the Asian fonts are also available in Photoshop. I don't use it much, so I just saw it today. It offers me font options
 for Arabic, Japanese, Chinese and the whole ball of wax in&nbsp;</span>Photoshop. It never happened before when I was using Windows XP (for almost a decade).</p>
<p><span>And my language is set for Portuguese, with "hide fonts based on language settings" checked. I don't know what else to do, and this is going to become a problem for me.</span></p>

<p>Microsoft is aware of an issue in which an Intel Wi-Fi driver update may cause a Bluetooth® driver error due to incompatible Wi-Fi and Bluetooth® driver versions. The Wi-Fi update may have been installed with your latest Windows critical update. All devices
 using a combination of an Intel Wi-Fi driver newer than 19.80 but older than 20.50 along with a Bluetooth driver newer than 19.0 but older than 19.50 are affected by this issue. The current solution is to install the latest Intel Wi-Fi driver (version 20.50+)
 available for your system and then perform a cold reboot of your device. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Part 1:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>Check the Bluetooth driver version to confirm whether this issue applies to your device
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong> and ensure the “View” tab is set to “By Type”.</li><li>Expand <strong>Bluetooth® </strong>and locate your Bluetooth radio which will most likely appear as “Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Confirm that a yellow exclamation mark appears for this device.</li><li>Right-click “Intel(R) Wireless Bluetooth(R)” and select <strong>Properties</strong>.
</li><li>Click the <strong>Driver</strong> tab and check the Bluetooth driver version.<span>&nbsp;
</span>(See Figure 1.)<span>&nbsp; </span>If your driver version is 19.50 or greater, you are not experiencing this issue. If your Bluetooth driver version is newer than 19.0 but older than 19.50 continue to the next section.
</li></ol>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Part 2:</span></strong> <strong>
Update your Intel Wi-Fi driver version to 20.50+</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In Device Manager, expand <strong>Network adapters </strong>and locate your wireless controller.
<ul>
<li>If you’re using having trouble identifying the name of your Wi-Fi controller you can also check its name using

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you share folders, all of its contents will also be shared. If you don’t want to share certain sub-folders, it is recommended to separate it up to one level and share only specific folders which are applicable to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative, you can set read and write permissions on any folder to add security and control. Here’s how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click a <strong>Folder</strong>, then click <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab.</li><li>Click <strong>Edit…</strong></li><li>Tick <strong>Allow </strong>or <strong>Deny, </strong>to manage permissions for your folder<strong>.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to finish<strong>.</strong></li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this answers your question.</p>

            Hi, I just followed the steps and it said that Windows Essentials was repaired successfully however the problem is still happening. By the way, my computer is still new and I hardly ever used Photo Gallery. The only reason I need it is because I need to
 have a lot of pictures cropped but the Looking for People's tag suggestions makes it very slow because it's importing hundreds of photos.<br />

            Hi Tsubasa Kumo,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I understand how inconvenient&nbsp;that Looking for People's tag suggestions cannot be disabled. To troubleshot your issue, kindly performed a clean installation of Windows Essentials to make sure that there are no corrupted files that are causing the issue. To
 do this follow the steps on this <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/messenger-wlinstall/installation-failure-when-installing-windows/857a40cd-0ac2-4401-b881-89696299900c">

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting back. Though you've mentioned that you hardly use Photo Gallery, performing a clean installation of Windows Essentials has steps that would actually permanently remove all Windows Essential related files on your system giving you a fresh
 new program to work on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly refer again to Vivien's link on how to do a clean install of Windows Essentials then inform us of any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should issue still persists, please let us know immediately.</p>

<h3> maxine1ab  say:</h3>
<h2>            THUMBNAILS ARE NOT FULL SIZE - WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded thousands of photos from the same source to files in my File Explorer over the last couple of years.&nbsp; I have have never experienced this problem in all this time.&nbsp; I have not had any change in equipment of any time.&nbsp; Most of the day, I
 got normal, medium size, thumbnails.&nbsp; Later in the after-noon, my thumbnails started downloading in about 1/3 the size, top to bottom.&nbsp; I have a copy with the properties page opened.&nbsp; There is just ........</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f04011a3-a071-4d47-9eaa-fad608053b4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f04011a3-a071-4d47-9eaa-fad608053b4b" /></a>&nbsp;
 nothing different about these pictures.&nbsp; I might add tat when you open the thumbnail there is a perfect full size picture there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone cane see any thing at all, or just has more knowledge than I do, I would appreciate hearing from you.&nbsp; I'll be happy to send additional screenshots should you need them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to get back on this project.&nbsp; For every thousand I have done, I have 5 thousand or more to go.&nbsp; Guess I am too meticulous; I know I could use the narrow thumbnails but, I just want to have them all look the same after getting this far.&nbsp; Thanks
 for any help anyone can give.</p>

<p>Thank you for tour very prompt reply reply. &nbsp;As to the screen shot;below is copied from my first post. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a copy with the properties page opened.&nbsp; There is just ........</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5052227-4f8f-4690-987f-5169089101a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5052227-4f8f-4690-987f-5169089101a9" /></a>&nbsp;
 nothing different&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did explain that it was opened to "properties". &nbsp;Looking at the bottom with the blue line, you can seen where I hose "Advanced" and the top part is what I got as as result of that. &nbsp;Loo at the small colored part to the right in my first post (for
 some reason it did nit copy) That is my tiny 1/3 size thumbnail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to check out the things you provided and see how I come out. &nbsp;As to changing folders, I'm not sure I see the advantage of doing that. &nbsp;I have all my photos sorted by Country - Years X- Z or according to occasion. &nbsp;Therefore, the thumbnails
 with which I have problem must be in this particular folder. &nbsp;Everything else has worked fine in there. &nbsp;This is a folder that I recently opened.</p>

            Hi LesFenter1,&nbsp;
<br />My name is Rogelio. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting our support.
<br />
<br />HOW TO REMOVE BITLOCKER ENCRYPTION IN WINDOWS 10
<br />
<br />Open the power shell as administrator, by right clicking on it and choosing “Run as Administrator”.
<br />Check the encryption status of each drive by entering:
<br />1
<br />manage-bde -status
<br />To disable bitlocker enter (note to put quotations too):
<br />2
<br />Disable-BitLocker -MountPoint "&lt;drive letter&gt;:"
<br />For example:
<br />3
<br />Disable-BitLocker -MountPoint "C:"
<br />To remove encryption of the desired drive enter:
<br />4
<br />manage-bde -off &lt;drive letter&gt;:
<br />For example:
<br />5
<br />manage-bde -off C:
<br />Let the decryption continue in the background such that you have fully decrypted status. You may check the status of Encryption while it is running in the background.
<br />6 
<br />Restart the PC.

    <title>Cannot launch Rumble Fighter and also getting DirectX error when I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot launch Rumble Fighter and also getting DirectX error when I boot the operating sytem.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Directdraw and Direct3D</p>
<p>So, I upgraded(loosely termed) my desktop from Windows XP, and things went awry. I was playing a game called Rumble Fighter, and it used to run on said desktop just fine. Now, after the upgrade i'm having all sorts of problems. Simply put, my game will no
 longer launch. When I try to boot it, it say Direct X.. (and a bunch of illegible characters). So I did some research, and I ran a DX diagnostic on my computer. It seems that with directx11, my computer no longer has DirectDraw nor Direct3D available. So,
 I try to get it back, and install the dxwebsetup program. Though the installer installed just fine, it refuses to launch..ever. So, I just tried to manually install Direct x 9.0c (which my computer had before), which failed.<br />
My graphics card is an ATI Radeon 9200. My card is allegedly updated to it's latest version, so that's eliminated, and the ATI catalyst program seems to have compatibility issues with windows 7, so that's...pretty bad too. Any other ideas?</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Solution 1: Restart Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) Service
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Type services in the search box, and then you will see services application is on the best match position. Open the services desktop application.
<br />
<br />2. Find the Windows Image Acquisition (WIA) in the services.
<br />
<br />3. Right-click Windows Image Acquisition and select Properties from the context menu.
<br />
<br />4. In WIA services properties, select the startup type as Automatic. And then click Start button in service status.
<br />
<br />
<br />Tips: if the services status is running, try to stop it and then restart it again.
<br />
<br />After you click the start button, windows 10 is attempting to start the WIA service on local computer. The process takes several seconds.
<br />
<br />5. After the services control finish, click OK button.
<br />
<br />6. Follow above steps to start other two services: Shell Hardware Detection and Remote Procedure Call (RPC).
<br />
<br />After that, you can use the printer and scanner to test if it needs WIA driver when scanning.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 2: Uninstall Scanner Driver
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open device manager and expand the Imaging devices.
<br />
<br />2. Find the scanner and right-click it to select Uninstall.
<br />Then the scanner driver will be uninstalled in your Windows 10.
<br />
<br />3. Restart your computer, system will scan all the devices and install Windows 10 WIA driver for your scanner. And now, when you scan the documents, it can copy files properly.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 3: Update Scanner WIA Driver
<br />
<br />If the computer cannot help to install the WIA drivers correctly, you should do this thing by yourself. And sometimes, after you upgrade system to Windows 10, the incompatible or corrupted scanner driver may cause this problem. And there are two ways you can do to update WIA drivers for your scanner.
<br />
<br />As the error remind, there is a CD containing WIA drivers for your Scanner, so reboot the CD with the CD/DVD drive to install the WIA driver step by step. But if you cannot find the CD media, you should go to the manufacturer’s website such as HP, Dell, Epson, Fujitsu.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Enter the scanner manufacturer’s website to find the scanner drivers and firmware, download them manually.
<br />
<br />2. Install the scanner driver and update firmware step by step.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 4: Troubleshoot for your Scanner
<br />
<br />
<br />If the Scanner appears the error of “You need a WIA driver to use this device”, you can troubleshoot to fix the WIA driver missing problem. It is an automatic tool which can help to fix all the scanners whatever it is, Canon scanner, HP scanner or Dell scanner.
<br />
<br />1. Go here: Windows &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />2. Find Hardware and Device, and then click Run the Troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />
<br />It will start scanning all your Windows system devices including Scanner and find the Scanner error and then repair it automatically.
<br />
<br />Tips: If you are using a printer which contains the scanning function, you can also choose to troubleshoot the printer.
<br />
<br />I think these three solutions will help to solve WIA driver disappearing problem. And if the scanner cannot scan, you can do a system restore to solve it if you want.

    <title>Event ID 1002 hang, My desktop app is not responding after windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> polychronis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Event ID 1002 hang, My desktop app is not responding after windows 10 1803 update</h2>
                    <p>
I have a desktop application (x86) which worked normally till Windows 10 1803 update.<br />
<br />
After the windows 1803 update, the app opens but freezes.<br />
<br />
After a while the Not Responding appears at the app title. And at the Events says that the application hangs with EVENT ID 1002.<br />
<br />
This application uses IBM DB2 drivers (9.7.5 or greater) to connect to a SQL database on the Server computer. And I figured that the problem appears when the app is trying to make a connection to the database. I tried the latest versions of&nbsp; DB2 Client, but
 the problem not solved. If I uninstalled the DB2 Client the app doesn't freezes anymore. But the app cannot work without its database!<br />
<br />
So, if I uninstall the Windows Upgrade 1803 the app still working normally.<br />
<br />
This problem appears to many computers with Professional and Home editions. But not to all computers. I think that the most computers work after the update, but I still have to solve this problem.<br />
<br />

    <title>Error code 80153003 when Downloading Halo 4 Map Packs from Map Pass. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Error code 80153003 when Downloading Halo 4 Map Packs from Map Pass.</h2>
                    
<p>As the title simply states, I've been having issues recently with Halo 4's Map packs. I just recently purchased the Map Pass which allows me to download all three current map packs. However, when I hit the "Confirm Purchase" option a screen pops up telling
 me that an error has occurred and to look up the code 80153003 on the Help section of the Microsoft site. However, following the instructions on the help site have not helped, and attempting to start a fresh download of the packs continues to show me the code.
 I've Cleared the system cache, deleted the failed attempted downloads from my hard drive and restarted my console all with no results.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if anyone else was having this problem and if/how they've managed to overcome it?</p>

<p>@op and above poster</p>
<p>That error is twofold</p>
<p>First it can be a billing error which means update your payment method</p>
<p>Or your physical region and account region don't match</p>
<p>Did you buy your disk from in region?</p>
<p>Or do you have an out of region account?</p>
<p>If you have an out of region account you must make it match as halo maps and most triple a titles are region locked including their dlc</p>
<p>If you purchased it via prepaid code you can't exchange it</p>
<p>However if you bought it via the marketplace you have to talk to support</p>
<p>No matter what if your account region and actual region don't match you will continue to have issues</p>
<p>If you don't live in a X box live region then you have to wait for support in your region</p>

<p>@Ngocphi I got it via Digital download. using the same method as what i used to buy the Bullseye pack, and the Map pass. I do have not moved out of region or anything. Everything is in Region. And my Billing information is up to date. However like I said,
 I purchased other things that downloaded perfectly fine without an error, but it seems to only be the Map packs, that aren't downloading.</p>

<p>I am having the exact same issue. Purchased a brand new copy of Halo 4 from EB games, got home and purchased the war pass to get me the three map packs. Map pass downloaded fine, but when I tried to download the maps the error code came up (80153003). Have
 followed all the cache clearing steps etc, but still no good :( had bought it for a games night which is now past so that blows. Paid $25 for the map packs for nothing!!</p>
<p>Searching google for this issue I have found a few people with similar problems, all in the last few days, so I'm guessing it may be an issue on Microsofts end rather than ours. Can we get a solve please?</p>

<p>After hours with Xbox Support, I was told to talk to an Xbox Network Specialist. I am on the phone now with them and will share anything I learn.</p>
<p>The only things that I can think of that would cause this for me are:</p>
<p>1. When I load Halo 4, it tells me to choose a storage device. I always choose Cloud Storage, but the maps are so big they have to be saved to Hard Disk.</p>
<p>2. I don't have a credit card attached to my account because I don't like auto-renewal. I purchased the map pack Season Pass from the Xbox Live Marketplace online and checked out using PayPal.</p>

<p>Well, on the one hand I'm glad to see I'm not the only one having this issue (send my Elite in for repairs...right) but on the other this is a bit aggravating. Bought the collector's edition at launch (US) and punched the code in the same day. Finally got
 around to playing again after a brief hiatus and I'm getting the same error message.
</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the items still appear in 'active downloads' and even progress through downloading. They just don't seem to 'stick' once they're done. Downloaded Forge Islands easily enough, definitely no problem there.
</p>
<p>Keeping my fingers crossed :)</p>

    <title>Do I really need to put system repair on a CD&#47;DVD or can it just - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> buceoguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do I really need to put system repair on a CD&#47;DVD or can it just go on an external drive&#63;</h2>
                    I take it I do need a 'system repair' method aside from creating system images? &nbsp;I've set my back up to include system images, but Windows has a warning at the bottom of the screen saying 'A system repair disk might be required to restore a system image'.
 I think this wording is very vague (surely I either need this or I don't) and &nbsp;I haven't found anything that tells me why such a disk only 'might' be required, so I think the wise move would be to create one - agreed?<br />
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
That said, although references are always to a system repair 'disk', I'm hoping I can have everything to do with backup/repair on my WD external drive. &nbsp;Is there any need to create a system repair disk on DVD/CD or can I create effectively the same thing in
 a folder on the external drive? &nbsp;It makes no sense to me to use a DVD/CD if I don't have to.</div>
<div>
<br />
</div>
<div>
(As an aside, I'd like to share the following for other non-techies - my WD passport would not allow me to create a system image at all at first, and I found that this was due to WD using the FAT file system (an old system but one still used by Macs I understand)
 rather than one used by Windows 7 called NTFS. &nbsp;There's a simple and quick conversion which worked for me -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/11106-convert-fat-fat32-volume-ntfs.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/11106-convert-fat-fat32-volume-ntfs.html</a>)</div>

    <title>We need Soul Steal Gauntlets&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wretchkiller  say:</h3>
<h2>            We need Soul Steal Gauntlets&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying out an Unarmed Khajiit right now, and so far, I'm loving it. (Doing way more damage then I thought I would. At level 1 I'm one shotting normal wolves, yet my 32 mage with a conjured sword takes two hits to kill them.) As of yet, my only complaint,
 is not being able to get souls without a weapon. We should be able to enchant gauntlets (Not bracers or gloves, just Gauntlets) with a soul trap ability so I don't have to break my unarmed fun to soul farm. I killed about 8 wolves in the last half an hour
 with my fists, and didn't get a single soul. If I had enchanted gauntlets though...Or perhaps a necklace/ring that allows for unarmed soul stealing.<br />
<br />
Such things could work from a game mechanic standpoint, and an RP one as well.</p>

<p>I'm going to ignore the urge to say something sarcastic about Bob's non-helpful post, and just agree with Sargon. I don't want to have to run around with Soul Trap in one hand, plus, I think I only have enough mana to cast it once at this level. Using a
 melee character, I don't have any magicka enhancing gear on, and I haven't put any points into Magicka, only Health and Stamina. And I don't want to have to invest perks into the Conjuration tree so apprentice spells cast for half price.</p>

<p>Cast it once per fight then?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I don't get it. It's a ranged spell and it does have decent range on it, and you don't have to cast it in the middle of a fight. Do it every fight and you'll end up with plenty of soul gems.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also consider putting it on a dagger, though that isn't exactly what you want.</p>

<p>Also use some of the magic potions to refill your magic reserves and you can easily trap many souls quickly.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also fist fighting 1 handed is really not that different than using both fists. Fighting with Shield and Fist is kind of fun too.</p>

<p>Its pretty interesting to see how so few people seem to grasp how someone could want to play a character a certain way. &nbsp;I understand the point of using a spell, or a weapon with soul trap enchanted into it. My point is, I don't want to have to break my
 current play style to be able to do enchanting. (Barring buying every gem I use.) Yes yes, enchanted weapons, spells, and magicka potions are all fine and well, but I have to change my current play style for them. It may not seem like much, changing out one
 first for a spell, but this character isn't supposed to be a caster, he's supposed to be a hand to hand fighter. Thus he should not be using spells, or weapons.</p>

<p>There is a difference in grasping the concept of what you are saying and the reality of what the game offers.<br />
<br />
Everyone here was just giving you alternatives to get the souls trapped that you wanted.&nbsp; No matter how much anyone agrees&nbsp; the game mechanic that you want does not exist in the game and it most likely never will (on console).&nbsp; Bethesda removed Hand to Hand
 combat as a true from of combat in Skyrim ( Morrowind and Oblivion had it as a skill that could be improved) so there is a very slim chance that they would be adding anything into the game for it..<br />
<br />
So you have to play within the confines of what Skyrim offers. Use Soul Trap spell, weapon, or forgo them and just buy filled gems.<br />

<p>I tend to agree... at least in my case, I just make suggestions to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, I have to ask... why would you&nbsp;want to soul farm with a character that wouldn't need to have, or use very many soul gems? Weapons and staves are the only enchanted items that deplete their charge with use. If you are using hand to hand combat
 only, you wouldn't need to be farming souls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hand to hand only fighter would only need to have enchantments on armor, which doesn't deplete with use. That being the case, it would be just as easy to buy what few filled soul gems you would need to make enchantments from NPCs or find them in Draugr
 crypts / Dwemer ruins. The logic for needing soul trap on gauntlets just isn't there except for&nbsp;the... 'sole' purpose (pun intended, sorry couldn't resist)... of farming just to max the skill tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said and don't take it the wrong way, but... have you considered the fact that wanting to farm souls is actually breaking the style, in a manner of speaking, of your character, in and of itself?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If your system meets or exceeds&nbsp;the following requirements, it should be able to run it:</p>
<p>Whether you have a logo PC or you’ve built your own PC, the recommendations for Windows 8 include:</p>
<p>1 GHz or faster processor <br />
1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit) <br />
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) <br />
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver </p>
<p>One new element to Windows 8 is the requirement that Metro style applications have a minimum of 1024x768 screen resolution, and 1366x768 for the snap feature. If you attempt to launch a Metro style app with less than this resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x600)
 you will receive an error message. <br />
