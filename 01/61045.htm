    <title>Can&#39;t setup VPN on Windows 10 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t setup VPN on Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>We're having a problem setting up one of our computers with a PPTP client.&nbsp;<strong> I have set it up on my laptop and it is working fine</strong>, so please don't send me a link on how to set up a VPN. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so "settings", "Network &amp; Internet", from the left panel "VPN", "add a VPN" and one gets the VPN setup menu.&nbsp; When I do it on my laptop, I select the VPN Provider "Window built-in" which is the only option.&nbsp; In the next place I enter a name for the connection
 ie "VPN to work", although we have tried several others.&nbsp; Now in the next place I enter the IP address of the VPN server.&nbsp; At this point the remaining data entry locations are open and the VPN type allows me to select PPTP, enter a username and then password.&nbsp;
<strong>All is fine!</strong>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other computer I proceeded as above but the VPN Provider selection area does not seem to hold the "Windows built-in" selection and then after entering the name and IP address, the rest of the entry areas (VPN Type, Username and Password) are greyed
 out/locked, ie no data can be entered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both computers are Windows 10 Pro, fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the issue and how do we get it fixed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks....RDK</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand how difficult it is, when the device doesn't work in the way it should. For us to isolate the issue and to assist you better, we'd like to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is your system connected to domain network?</p>
<p>2. Were you able to create a VPN using the same computer and same connection before?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd suggest you to set up a VPN through control panel and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on <strong>Start icon</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>Control Panel</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Click on <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Click on <strong>Set up a new connection or network</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Click on <strong>Connect to a workplace</strong> and click on <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Follow the on screen instructions to set up a VPN connection and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We can try a few steps and check if we can fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Uninstall and reinstall the WAN Miniports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> together to open <strong>Run</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>3. Expand <strong>Network adapters</strong>.</p>
<p>4. Right click on <strong>WAN Miniport (IP)</strong>, <strong>WAN Miniport (IPV6)</strong>, and
<strong>WAN Miniport (PPTP)</strong>, and select <strong>Uninstall device</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart the system and try to set up a VPN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I'd suggest you to post your query in the <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home?category=windows10itpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TechNet forums</a>, where you'll find&nbsp; support engineers who are equipped with the knowledge on VPN, they can assist you better on this.</p>

            Naveen....Yes, using the "old" Control Panel method did work which we actually discovered shortly after I posted this question.&nbsp; Now the question is why didn't the Windows 10 settings app work on that computer???....RDK

    <title>Windows 10 - Problem in using TableTextService.dll - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kenmacau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Problem in using TableTextService.dll</h2>
                    <p>For inputting Chinese charactors, I've been successfully using the function of TableTextService.dll to upload my Chinese Input Table ( called 3 corner method ) since Win7 &amp; Win8 for so many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this cannot work well with Windows 10, even I use the same Chinese Input Table &amp; also the same procedures in Command prompt with administrator's right, my input method can be added into the select window, but in 'fade' color that cannot be selected by
 the language setting arrow. I've ensure that my Windows 10 version is most updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something wrong with this TableTextService function in Windows 10 ? Or should I do anything additionally to enable this TableTextService function&nbsp; to work well with Windows 10 ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please assist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

    <title>Windows 8.1 with Bing OEM downloads the Windows 10 update but returns - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> exnor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 with Bing OEM downloads the Windows 10 update but returns &#34;missing boot.wim&#34; file on setup.</h2>
                    <p>Also ISO creation tool does not works since licence is OEM and keeps asking for a valid key.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unit is running on a original and legally licenced Windows 8.1 with Bing (multi language) 32bits, pre installed by manufacturer, with recovery partition. There is a licence key for the product but when asked for via ISO setup is said that the key is not
 "appropriated" (note it does not says that is invalid).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using WinUpdate, the files are downloaded but the size of the contents on the setup directory are always different (tried 4 or 5 times now) and always returns error 800020(?) and running the setup file returns "missing boot.wim".</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to various opinions on several forums this might be because the windows update does not validate the windows 10 setup files for either corrupt or complete download. Also people are reporting a average size of 6GB on the install directory when mine
 never got up to 5GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Get windows 10" icon/app confirms my system is compatible and my reservation was registered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            What is  the Skype System Port Range in order fo configure QoS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My DSL modem/router supports QoS and I would like to configure the Skype port in QoS to assign it in the large bandwidth category. What are the ports used by default? Are they assigned dynamically at Skype Startup? Can I fix the number or number range so
 I know it will always be in the right bandwidth category?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do this because video quality has consistently been bad the last 8 months. I talk from where I stay in the Netherlands to my family in Greece.
<br />
I checked my internet connection to my ISP, it is pretty good 77000mbits and low ping (&lt;8ms), so it should be fine in general. It could be a problem of assigning the QoS properly, as Skype is pretty inefficient in terms of resources because of its legacy algorithm
 and needs a lot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or maybe ISP connection between Greece and Netherlands is bad but I don't believe that. It probably is the legacy algorithm of Skype.</p>

    <title>Windows Update is Stalling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bell23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update is Stalling</h2>
                    My Windows Update keeps stalling.&nbsp; This problem started yesterday.&nbsp; I have my Windows Update set to tell me when updates are available, I let it install the important updates it shows, then restart if it has to. Also it does updates without having to be
 prompted, sometimes.<br />
<br />
So yesterday it started an update and I noticed after around 20-30 minutes that it was still on 15%.&nbsp; I watched it for longer and it didn't progress at all.&nbsp; I tried stopping the update and restarting it, but that didn't work.&nbsp; I then decided to restart my
 computer, but it got stuck on the screen that reads "Configuring updates....do not power off computer".&nbsp; I left it alone for awhile and it didn't progress.&nbsp; I was forced to shut down my computer using the power button.
<br />
<br />
When I started up again my computer ran normally.&nbsp; Now today, Windows Update tells me that there is an important update. "System Readiness Tool for x64-based systems..."&nbsp; to be exact.&nbsp; I hit install to allow the update, it gets to 75% percent, and then stalls.&nbsp;
 It's been at least an hour and it's still on 75%.&nbsp; I tried stopping the update but it hasn't stopped.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I haven't installed any new programs recently, so I'm not sure why Windows Update stopped working.&nbsp; Now I'm worried about shutting down and restarting my computer because I don't want to get the frozen "Configuring Updates"&nbsp; screen.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Wait at least a couple of hours as sometimes they do take time.<br />
<br />
I am guessing that part of the issue might be a driver which is really older or similar which should not be loaded.<br />
<br />
Do this to leave Windows Updates on (after you gain access) and to stop Driver Updates from loading.

            Well at the moment I'm doing a scan with Malwarebytes to make sure I have no infections.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Yesterday I <em>did </em>do a Startup Repair after I got out of the "Configuring Updates" screen.&nbsp; It told me that it found now problems with my Startup.&nbsp; I also did an sfc scan.
<br />
<br />
My computer didn't come with a Vista disk, and my System Restore has never worked when I've tried using it.

<p><br />
The manufacturer is required to provide you a way to restore the computer to OOBE state. If you didn't receive a set of disks, there will be a hidden Recovery partition (not to be confused with System Restore).<br />
<br />
Is this a sudden, new problem and has Vista Service Pack 1 or 2 been installed yet?<br />
<br />
What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
is your subscription current</span>?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>Has a(another) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on this machine (e.g., a free-trial version that came preinstalled when you bought it)?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair from the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not have a<br />
Vista disk you can borrow a friends (they are not copy protected) or make one. Also your System maker will
<br />
sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

This is a sudden, new problem, it started yesterday and is continuing into today.&nbsp; I looked at my install history and the only thing that resembles that is this:

<br />

<br />
I have Malwarebytes Anti-Malware installed on my computer, and it's the free version.&nbsp; I also have the paid version of Kaspersky Internet Security (and yes, my subscription is current).&nbsp; It also provides a firewall.
<br />
<br />
Norton was installed on my computer, a trial version, when I bought it.&nbsp; I removed it however once I got Kaspersky, and that was about 2 months ago.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update causes problems</h2>
                    <p>For the last few weeks every time windows 10 installs updates I'm either getting bsod or (the last time it happened) windows couldn't even boot and I had to do a system restore.At first I thought it was just a coincidence,but it has happened so many times
 getting a bsod and then seeing "windows couldn't install the updates correctly" or "installing updates" notifications etc...Now windows couldn't even boot and I did a system restore and the moment windows booted , it said "updates didn't get installed properly"(Is
 it possible that I was just seeing a blank screen and windows was installing updates on the backround?I waited quite a while and I rebooted several times,still getting a blank screen).Sooo what do you think the problem could be?</p>
<p>Just a clarification (to avoid answers like "have you scanned for viruses","did you install any new programs or made any changes") I have the computer for a few months(haven't had time to fill it with junk),I consider myself to be an advanced computer geek,I
 know several things about both software and hardware,I'm very suspicious with programs that I download(therefore very careful),I have very little start up services (only what's necessary) and yes,I have scanned for viruses ( I scan every week).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 10 home edition on an SSD 120gb brand new hard drive ,16 gb ram and an intel i7 4790.</p>
<p>All latest drivers,programs up to date etc....&nbsp; </p>

<p>In Windows, printer pooling does not "load balance."&nbsp; That is, all print jobs will go to the first printer (printer port alphanumerically first) unless that printer is busy or off line.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If you disable the printer that currently is getting all of the print jobs, does the second printer get the next print job?</p>

                    <p>PLEASE HELP!</p>
<p>My computer suddenly failed to respond and after a while started to respond with big lag. I didn't change anything from my programs/updates. I tried to restart and it restarted also vey slow. I checked all similar situations on internet in order to find
 a solution but useless. I have tried also to make a windows refresh, it took 4-5 hours to complete. I tried then to boot from a Windows CD in order to reinstall fresh Windows, and I have waited for about 2 hours and it didn't started the boot.
</p>
<p>When could possibly be the cause. I checked all maintenance troubleshootings and it did not find any error.</p>
<p>What should I do? My PC was running perfectly before.</p>
<p>I checked also in BIOS, found CPU temperature at 90 C, I think is a little to high. Everything is clean inside..</p>
<p>Hope to find a solution. I don't want to throw to garbage my PC. It is abt 5 years old, AIO Acer Z5710 but still very good.</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

            <p><span><span>Your computer is trying to install a large number of updates and looks to be having difficulties. Connect your tablet to a main electricity supply, turn off hibernation until updating Windows has completed, and change from a wireless to ethernet
 cable connection to your router. These should give a quicker and more reliable internet connection.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Select Start, All Programs, Windows Update, <strong>Check for Updates</strong>. If optional updates are available click optional updates and make sure that the box before Windows 10 is unchecked. Check the boxes before the remaining updates.
 Restrict downloads to batches of 10 to make installation more certain. Click on <strong>
Install</strong> and click again on <strong>Install</strong> in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will
 tell you what is going on. You need to be patient. Restart the computer when prompted to do so. Repeat the procedure until you have no more updates to install. If you get too many failing updates provide the information requested below.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for replying. I will do all and revert with logs.</p>
<p>Regarding updates, I want to mention that my Windows is updating&nbsp;since I made the refresh, so this is why it is a large number of updates. But I have the problem with the lag before I made the refresh to Windows and it was updated than.</p>
<p>I will get back when I have all logs ready.</p>

            <p>Hi. Sorry I did not reply for a while. I gave up trying to fix this computer. I finally lost my patience, so I made an upgrade.</p>
<p>I just buyer an iMac 27 inch 5K, late 2015, with Skylake, 1 TB Fusion Drive.</p>
<p>I am not a big fan of OS X, but I love MAC computers. I own also a MacBook Pro Retina 13".</p>
<p>So now I tried to install Windows on my iMac, using BootCAMP. First time succeed, windows 8.1 installed, made upgrade to Windows 10, and after that the Magic Mouse did not work, so i downloaded a driver from some website. After installing this driver something
 happened to my Windows and I wasn't able to open any window anymore. So i decided to reinstall Windows. The only thing is that since then I am not able to install any more. I started from Internet Recovery with OS X, redownloaded the Windows ISO image to be
 used in BOOTCAMP, but nothing. When I try to install Windows using BOOTCAMP, In the phase when I have to choose the partition where to install Windows, I always get the same message "We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one".</p>
<p>I checked a lot on various threads, I used all methods, but keep coming same.</p>
<p>In Terminal, when I try distil list, i get the following:</p>

            Hi, 帆郑, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Sorry but the official way is one by one, so another option is to use third party software like "Device Cleanup Too" that we can Remove all non-present devices from Windows PC:

<h2>            Why would I want to use the &#34;NEW&#34; Microsoft-Edge browser when Edge won&#39;t even open&#63; Again&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Once again, it appears Microsoft has started something it isn't anywhere near ready to start. &nbsp;I was away from my computer for a couple of weeks over Christmas. When I logged on, and opened Google (my search browser) a pop up came on asking me to try the
 New Microsoft and Windows Edge browser. &nbsp;I ignored this invitation because using Edge translates to using IE-11, which has been a complete nightmare in my life. So, I just closed the pop up and went on with my business. And I have closed it several times.</p>
<p>Now, surprise of all surprises, Edge won't open, Windows store and all apps that originated from the oh so wonderful Windows-10 will not open. &nbsp;And if that is not enough, I suddenly can't sync my iPhone with iTunes on my PC. &nbsp;I keep getting the message that
 the USB device is not recognized. Even though they were like old friends before. &nbsp;Heck, I can see right now, I have notifications in the action center. But can I open it to check those notices?</p>
<p>I can't get to my photos. Troubleshooting anything comes back with no problems found.</p>
<p>Microsoft.......people are getting tired of your instability. &nbsp;You are a massive corporation. It's time you behave like one.</p>

            <p>Hello Ramesh. :-) &nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to thank you for your reply. And thank you so much more for your attempt to help me figure out a "work around" for these never ending problems. &nbsp;And yes, I know what a work around is. I worked in a nuclear power plant for over 30 years, and if you
 work there for that amount of time, you learn what a work around is. (Unless you are just really, really naive).</p>
<p>I have run the trouble shooters. I have done system checks after system checks. I tried different USB ports. I plugged in thumb drives that worked fine. &nbsp;I have checked my iPhone many times. &nbsp;I don't get an error message when using Edge, because Edge will
 NOT open. My start menu will NOT open. My "Photos" app, or Photo Shop Express (which I down loaded from the Windows Store will NOT open. My KVADPhoto+ (also loaded from the W-10 store) will NOT open.</p>
<p>Good news. My Action Center WILL open. SOMETIMES. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, again, I really, truly do appreciate you trying to help with all these suggestions. &nbsp;But once again also, if you have to use multiple work arounds to get something to do what it was intended to do in the first place, then you may as well pull the rods,
 remove the fuel, and shut down until you can fix <strong>all </strong>the bugs to make it run right.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>

 as well as Photoshop express. &nbsp;I tested the start icon, and it opened and brought Edge with it. &nbsp;Then I went to the last problem, Windows Store, and good golly it opened! &nbsp;I did a little happy dance, went into the photos app and started deleting duplicates

<h3> phuzzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            It&#39;s not WORKING&#33;  That&#39;s all I know&#33;  &#40;Key not Working&#41;  Microsoft is Dumbing Windows down on us&#33;</h2>
                    <div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">But.. &nbsp;</span><i>What is it saying</i><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">?</span>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't even imagine how many times I have asked this question of relatives, or friends, who have called me, and said their computer refused to do something. &nbsp;I can't help but wonder why, in their minds, they so easily dismiss the messages on the screen
 as just more things needing clicked on to make them go away. &nbsp;Why&nbsp;<i>wouldn't</i>&nbsp;a modern computer give you some details about why it's not doing what it thinks you want it to?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But... &nbsp;wait. &nbsp;I think,&nbsp;<i>now</i>, Microsoft is listening, in an ironic way.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why would I say that?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been using Windows 8 since it came out. &nbsp;I quickly installed a start menu replacement at the&nbsp;beginning, and, for the most part, chose to ignore the 'Metro' screen stuff as if it was another bad idea, like the active desktop, or, you know, Windows
 ME. &nbsp;However, My mother asked me about Windows 8 because of a new app she was interested in which is only available for Metro, Android, and IOS. &nbsp;I started thinking.. &nbsp;Could Metro be designed for a person like&nbsp;<i>her</i>? &nbsp;Someone who still hasn't figured
 out the start menu anyhow, and who hasn't found any connection between the taskbar and the windows on the screen yet?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Her Windows 7 desktop was more then up to the task. &nbsp;We picked up the upgrade DVD, and I went to work. &nbsp;To make a long story short, I am pretty sure Microsoft wants you to install Windows 7&nbsp;<i>first</i>, or&nbsp;<i>have</i>&nbsp;it installed, and&nbsp;<i>then</i>&nbsp;install
 the upgrade to 8. &nbsp;Now, I don't think I am the only one who prefers the idea of a&nbsp;<i>clean</i>&nbsp;install. &nbsp;I pulled a stunt I have used many times before with great success. &nbsp;I booted off a live OS CD, and made a folder on the root of her C drive called 'Old
 Stuff', and MOVED EVERYTHING from the entire rest of the drive, into that folder. &nbsp;Only takes a second. &nbsp;Then I installed Windows 8 onto the drive as though it was a fresh install, even though the old windows 7 was lurking in that folder for salvaging files
 from. (The installation saw that folder and went ahead with the upgrade without asking for further proof of ownership of windows 7.) &nbsp;One of the first things that happened when I installed it was the product key entry. &nbsp;Yes, Windows KNEW the key from the very
 beginning. &nbsp;I spent several hours really setting it up nice with metro apps for all her needs, and I even began to revisit the screen on my&nbsp;<i>own</i>&nbsp;machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Then it happened. &nbsp;The next morning, as my eyes cleared, her PC was reminding me to activate. &nbsp;I wasn't concerned with it, and thought it would be nice to give it a try. &nbsp;I went into the Metro activation screen, and let her go. &nbsp;Then I started having all
 those flashbacks of the friends of relatives calling. &nbsp;'The product key doesn't work.'. &nbsp;I proof-read it. &nbsp;Then again. &nbsp;Then my wife did. &nbsp;'The product key doesn't work'. &nbsp;This was weird. &nbsp;No error number, no additional info. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;It was as if all those
 people who had never looked at those details had won, and&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;had dumbed windows down to match. &nbsp;I surfed a bit, and found information with error numbers, but nothing to match this situation Microsoft had placed me in.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Eventually, I found a phone number that would connect me to a real person at Microsoft. &nbsp;She connected to the machine by remote, and entered into another activation screen which was based on the old windows desktop system. &nbsp;(She used a command I didn't
 recognize, or remember.) &nbsp;She tried to enter my key, and BOOM! &nbsp;There was an error number, AND an explanation. &nbsp;The number was not meant for a clean install. &nbsp; Now I don't even HAVE to go into how retarded that is.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is the funny part. &nbsp;She tried about five times, and each time she completely ignored the message. &nbsp;There was no time to read it for the first few tries. &nbsp;She was clueless. &nbsp;She was just like one of my relatives. &nbsp;She didn't even find out about the
 clean install problem until after she had given me a new key that did work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So the question becomes, why, Microsoft, have you dumbed Metro down so much that the essential information is completely missing? &nbsp;Why kill off ten years of progress? &nbsp;I just sincerely hope they don't try to kill off the desktop mode in favor of some kind
 of Metro interface, otherwise we'll all be left saying, just like Bill Cosby used to say when his car went into the shop, simply, "It's BROKE."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here is another question though. &nbsp;Why, oh why, did Windows not tell me about this impending problem when it first started doing the clean install, with the key already in it's hand? &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I had known the error's cause, I would have had to 1. LOSE all my work, 2. Install Windows 7, and 3. Upgrade it to windows 8, and 4, RE-DO all the setup work I had already done once. &nbsp;I don't understand how this design would even fight piracy. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We have seen years of work go into the error reporting and diagnostic capabilities of our modern OS's. &nbsp;Long gone are the days when it would just reboot, or give you an incoherent message that didn't help. &nbsp;Does it not look, now though, like Microsoft
 has pulled a U-Turn? &nbsp;This would only make sense if Metro was just a SKIN for beginners, and the underlying desktop based system was destined to remain for serious work.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It doesn't end there though. What if you are using a Metro APP, and there is NO other way to get at the information? &nbsp;Here is what I mean.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I set up the Metro Skype applications on mine and Moms computers, and tried to call one from the other. &nbsp;Hers wouldn't connect a call. &nbsp;All it would say was 'Called, Call failed.', in an instant. &nbsp;No reason, no error given. &nbsp;There WAS a good reason, I
 didn't have speakers plugged into hers, only the webcam to try the video. &nbsp;I guess I'm not used to auto sensing speaker jacks yet. &nbsp;Still, Microsoft, would it have been so much trouble to just give me a little clue? &nbsp;It would have saved me a few hours. &nbsp;I
 guess I shouldn't complain, I got off easy.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Why is Microsoft making our lives so hard?</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I had this problem when I first upgraded to Windows 8 too. There's 2 installation methods&nbsp;with 2 different options.</p>
<ol>
<li>Windows 8 Upgrade DVD - This one requires a previous version of Windows installed on the PC to work. If you try to make it look like a fresh install, Windows will not activate.</li><li>Windows 8 OEM System Builder DVD - this one doesn't require any previous versions of Windows installed and can be used on a newly formatted hard drive. You will most likely need to buy this at a retailer who specializes in computers.</li></ol>
<p>The upgrade DVD never worked for me as I was running Windows XP Media Center edition before and I was trying to install this on brand new hardware. Plus Windows XP and Windows 8 are so vastly different in terms of technology that the upgrade would not be
 easy. Luckily I got a refund from the Microsoft Store and went to a retail computer store to buy a System Builder version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You're lucky though Windows 7 to Windows 8 is not that much of&nbsp;a stretch so you can do the upgrade.</p>

<h2>            CD or DVD drive is not detecting media on Windows and Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> OS (Win7) does not recognize CD or DVD disc when inserted into drive after first play.
</p>
<p>Win7 Ultimate; Dell Inspiron 516.</p>
<p>When system boots, OS will play discs in opticial drives (D &amp; E) but does not recognize discs after changing disc (music cd or dvd or data).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system does not recognize opticial drives (D&amp;E) after disc is changed.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling hardware and drivers.&nbsp; Upon reinstallation and&nbsp;reboot, all is well; system recognizes drives.&nbsp; (System will reboot from disc.)&nbsp; But when changing disc, new media
 disc&nbsp;is not recognized.&nbsp; Windows tells me to insert a disc into the&nbsp;drives when I've already inserted the disc.&nbsp; This behavior is on both opticial drives (D &amp; E).</p>
<p>Windows media player&nbsp;shows drives but will not play media.&nbsp; No other media players installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What is causing OS not to recognize media when inserted into drives?&nbsp; IDE channels?&nbsp; In device manager, there&nbsp;is one&nbsp;IDE ATA/ATAPI controller
</p>
<p>with 3 sets of channels: two channel 0; two channel 1 and two&nbsp;Standard Dual Channel PCI IDE controllers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Can I uninstall these&nbsp;IDE channels and allow the OS to recognize the hardware upon reboot?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>As I understand the issue, CD or DVD drive is not detecting media on Windows and Windows Media Player. Please let me know if this is not correct.</p>
<p><strong>Before proceeding with the troubleshooting steps I may need a few more information to understand the issue better.</strong><br />
1. What is the make and model number of the CD/DVD player?<br />
2. Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
3. Do you get any error messages?<br />
4. Do you face this issue with all the discs or with any particular disc?</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Let's first try to run this fix it which will fix the problems with DC or DVD drives that can't read and write media.

<h2>            Windows 10 WiFi not found</h2>
                    <p>I will occasionally lose WiFi connection after a few hours or minutes after I start using the computer. I am within range of my WiFi networks, but I am unable to find any network at all on my computer, even though the WiFi is on. I can resolve this by running
 a troubleshoot that resets the wireless network adapter, but after awhile the problem comes back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a recent issue, and I believe it came after an update. I have tried uninstalling and installing my wireless network adapter after restarting my computer, and have also updated it to the latest version. However, the problem still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently using windows 10 home [Version 10.0.14393]. </p>
<p>Driver Provider:&nbsp;Qualcomm Atheros Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Driver Version:&nbsp;12.0.0.230</p>

    <title>With Xbox One Backwards Compatibility, Changing Gamertag can Cause - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spiderdust8  say:</h3>
<h2>            With Xbox One Backwards Compatibility, Changing Gamertag can Cause Failure to Logon Xbox Live in Gears of War 3</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know if the scope of this problem is wider. I did discuss it with support chat and let them know that I found a problem and found a workaround.</p>

<p>The problem is that the downloaded Gears of War 3 for Xbox One backwards compatibility seems to "lock in" your gamertag when installed. I know this because after playing the game under one gamertag, I purchased a name change, then the game stopped logging
 in to Xbox Live to access my settings or the ability to save. You would think that backwards compatibility would take into account synching your Xbox 360 gamertag, but this wasn't the case.</p>

<p>There is a workaround: Once the game has loaded and is at the start screen. Press the Menu and View buttons (two black buttons under the lit Xbox button) simultaneously to bring up the Xbox 360 system menu in the emulator. It will show your old gamertag
 and that you're not signed-in. So go to the option to re-download your profile. Enter your logon credentials, wait for the download to complete, then make sure that you're signed in to Xbox Live. Exit this system menu. That's all there is to it. From this
 point forward your logon should be correct, at least for this game.</p>

                    I just got a subscription for a South African skype number. When I call South African numbers, it takes the money from my prepaid credit on my Skype account.&nbsp; Isn't it supposed to be free for SA numbers, because of the subscription amount I'm paying? Not
 charging me additional rates?&nbsp;

<p>Hi <strong>Murray B500</strong>,</p>
<p>1. Since when are you facing this issue? Do you recall making any changes to the computer before this happened?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:&nbsp; Put the computer in clean boot and test </strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow Step 1 in the link below,</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</p>
<p>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.</p>
<p>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling it.</p>
<p><strong>Important: - Remember to put the computer back to normal startup follow step 7 in the link.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Disable and re-enable Windows Media Centre</strong></p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Control Panel, and then double-click Programs and Features.<br />
b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Turn Windows Features on or off.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand media feature</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncheck windows media centre</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Ok and then restart the computer</p>
<p>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the same steps, now re-enable Windows Media center by placing a check mark.</p>
<p>Now check if it makes any difference, if the issue still persists,</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Run an online scan for any threat and try to fix them</strong></p>

<h2>            Broadcom wireless adaptor</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded windows 10 the day after release .</p>

            <p>Can I please ask further on this. I have a Windows 7 machine that when it goes to the Microsoft 10 reservation check, reports for the same adapter (Broadcom Virtual Wireless Adapter) from Microsoft: "You might not be able to connect to the adapter. The device
 manufacturers haven't made these devices compatible with Windows 10, so they will cause problems."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am checking this given the advice given to the other community member. Thank you</p>

    <title>HID-compliant touch screen driver missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> evinreilly  say:</h3>
<h2>            HID-compliant touch screen driver missing</h2>
                    <p>Now before anyone goes on with the scripted responses, please do read thoroughly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo-Thinkpad Yoga 14 running Windows 8.1 (64-bit). I recently bought a Wacom&nbsp;tablet for professional uses. Two days after downloading the tablet's software, my touch screen driver went hidden and did not work. I used the methods from other forums
 and they did not work. I am at a stopping point, as I had uninstalled the driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code the driver showed was <strong>- (45) Currently this hardware device is not connected to the computer. To fix the problem, reconnect this hardware device to the computer. -
</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I highly do not want to upgrade to windows ten unless that is the //only// option to return my touchscreen driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had...</p>
<ul>
<li>Restarted my computer multiple times.</li><li>Removed drivers that were not being used and/or won't be used.</li><li>Attempted to update the driver, but it stated that the driver was up to date.&nbsp;</li><li>I uninstalled the driver. Then I tried opening Control Panel &gt; Add new Hardware, yet there was not "Add New Hardware" option</li></ul>
<p>Also, throughout this entire process my computer was restarted and powered down a number of times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated, </p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
