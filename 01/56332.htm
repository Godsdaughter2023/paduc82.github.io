    <title>Need Windows XP driver for Western Digital external hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tb player  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Windows XP driver for Western Digital external hard drive</h2>
                    
<p>I recently reformatted my hard drive (XP), and no longer can recognize my external hard drive (Western Digital, My Book Essential Edition 2.0 - WD6400h1U-00). Been looking everywhere for drivers, and WD doesn't provide them. They supposedly run on standard
 drivers built into the OS. When I first used the HD to back-up my files it worked fine, but since the reformat it's a no-go. If these drivers are in fact native to the Windows OS, why can I not find them anywhere? Am I barking up the wrong tree here?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated, as the HD has a lot of pictures and files I would hate to lose.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            So you reformated / reinstalled winxp but omitted to install drivers provided by your PC maker or various hardware makers if a generic PC, eg chipset drivers, but relied on default winxp drivers

<p>Sorry, I should have given you more information.</p>
<p>Yes, I did reinstall/reformat Win XP. I installed the drivers provided me by the PC maker (Dell).</p>
<p>When I plug in the HD, the computer tells me a new USB element has been detected. I cannot however see it under My Computer. Using Device Manager, I used the New Hardware Wizard to find and install a driver (Initio Default Controller). I still cannot see
 the HD anywhere. I tried to find it in the Disk Management Section, but no luck.</p>
<p>On the Western Digital website, it states: <strong>"Most WD drives do not include drivers because they use a standard driver built into the operating system. If your driver is built into your operating system or is already installed, and your OS continues
 to look for a driver, <em>your drive has most likely failed or been damaged</em> and needs to be replaced."</strong></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure that the internal hard drive is not damaged, so I'm tending to believe that it is a driver issue.</p>
<p>Sorry to sound so obtuse, but with my last job of 7 years I was strictly on a Mac, so I'm not as PC savvy as I once was.</p>
<p>Again, any help that you can offer would be greatly appreciated.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I think this is a pretty fair statement by Western Digital.&nbsp; You normally should not need additional drivers to recognize removable storage devices that connect via USB Port.&nbsp; The Windows XP Drivers should be sufficient.</p>
<p>Please try your Western Digital USB Hard Drive on another PC to make sure this is not a hardware or OS configuration issue.</p>
<p>Also, you might want to see if your Western Digital USB External Hard Drive has a slot for a DC power adapter that plugs into the wall.&nbsp; One of the more common situations&nbsp;of advanced external USB device failure is lack of power.&nbsp; While it is true that many
 USB devices can be powered directly off of a PC's USB bus or a USB Hub, this is often not the case with high power devices such as Audio Cards, Hard Drives or CD ROM Drives.&nbsp; If you have an external USB Hard Drive, you will most likely have to give it more
 power (via a DC Adapter) than your bus or hub provides alone.</p>
<p>One last question, how are your other USB Devices doing on the same PC?&nbsp; Have you checked on the Microsoft Update site to see if you can get more recent Chipset drivers for your Motherboard?&nbsp; You mentioned previously that you had installed drivers provided
 by your PC maker (Dell), but sometimes it is possible to install only part of the drivers provided by a PC maker (such as printer and sourd) and overlook some of the more critical ones like the Motherboard Chipset Drivers.</p>

            I have a very simular problem.&nbsp; On a desktop, I am using the same operating system as always, XP Pro with Svc. Pak #3. Today, I attempted to connect my&nbsp; Western Digital My Passport WDBAAA3299ABK&nbsp; and the system will not recognize it either in Explore or
 Disk Management. I was also advised by Western Digital to obtain the usb drivers from Microsoft. I search the support site at microsoft .com but could not locate any drivers to download. I tried&nbsp; a second and older My Passport drive with the same results.
 I tried three different USB ports, one on the front and two on the back of the Desktop.&nbsp;Both the My Passport dirves install and show in my Win 7 64 bit laptop so I am sure the drives and cords are OK.

<p>I am not certain, but I think something is draining the power from the USB HUBs on your computer.&nbsp; I just looked at one of the Product Guides/Advertisements for a WD My Passport drive and it said:</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong><span>
<p>USB 2.0 interface</p>
</span></strong><span><span>
<p>Powered directly from the USB port on your PC. No separate power supply is needed.</p>
</span></span><span><span>
<p>An optional cable is available for the few computers that limit power from the USB port.</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
<p>I think you might consider trying to get the optional power cable.&nbsp; While it is true that your computer<strong>should
</strong>be able to power the drive without the optional power adapter, it looks like something else is eating up the power.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had the same issue.&nbsp; I purchased a 2 TB WD Elements External HD.&nbsp; Used it on one Dell PC and the USB driver loaded perfectly.&nbsp; Completed my HDD backup and moved the external drive to my second Dell PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>System recognized the new device and loaded the Initio Default Controller.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled and reinstalle the device several times with the same result.&nbsp; When I read a response further down this chain that discussed connecting as an unpowered device I left my connected, unplugged the external power supply to the device, waited 10
 seconds, reconnected the power, and Windows then recognized the device as a WD External USB Drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think the order you make the connections are important, apparently power connection should be last.&nbsp;</p>

<p>TB player, just ONE 'sillly question ...for you to answer here? But, first, I'll do a bit of 'cut-n-paste' here......so that I hope you can spot 'where' you went wrong?</p>
<p>Then, I will tell where you DID go wrong.</p>
<p>"I recently reformatted my hard drive (XP), and no longer can recognize my external hard drive ."</p>
<p>Okay, now, my Question...................."Did you&nbsp;bother re-installing the MOTHERBOARD drivers, namely the USB 'drivers' when you had finished that REFORMAT?"</p>
<p>Your EXTERNAL HARD-DRIVE.....runs on a USB connection, right?</p>
<p>In a DELL computer? Where can you get that USB driver? Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! Let me guess!?!</p>
<p>I don't know, where would you look for them?</p>

            Ok, had the same problem, WD 320 Elements ext usb powered drive was working fine, then one day wasn't picked up. Instead windows went on to install initio driver and HDD could not be accessed, this was the same on 3 different PC's. First thing I tried
 was new usb cable as I had another in the house and it worked fine on all machines. Hope this helps a few of you.<br />

I'm curious to know, if there is a "well" of .inf driver files that I can draw from a good source somewhere so that I can have my XP Machine see the USB device.&nbsp; The wizard is not successfully installing the device (which used to work fine, but now it doesn't
 even show up in Disk Management).&nbsp; I know that the HDD is not the issue, because the HDD worked on a different computer.&nbsp; For some reason XP's USB driver installation wizard isn't working.&nbsp; Can someone help with a .inf file I can use for my USB Device?<br />

                    I just cloned an old hard drive with a newer SSD hybrid. No other hardware changes occurred. Now I am getting the following error message: "Display Driver Error: The video display device does not support playback of protected content" I can minimze and
 maximize the WMC window and it works. But everytime I close WMC and reopen it happens again. Any idea why this is happening and how to fix it?

<p>"Cloned HD"...Very few software can do that task,reason being Windows Security settings.Either way,XCOPY&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; ROBOCOPY&nbsp; the 2 default image copy software that is installed by default,3rd party software in youre situation could/might work if you install pc
 hardware controller software/drivers..Intel says,1st software to install after the OS,should be Chipset software/driver,then maybe storage controller (Matrix Storage Mgr) then Intel has separate SSD HD software to install...</p>
<p>Good idea to purchase newer SSD HD,the older SSD is slow in Read/Write ability......</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 File History - Non C&#58;&#92; drive folders</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community members,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing a minor issue regarding the File History app in Windows 10</p>
<p>Among the folders I have set it to backup are my library folders (Documents, Pictures, Music etc) which I have previously relocated to a second internal drive
<strong>S:\</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The File History drive in which the backups are saved, is an external drive <strong>
F:\</strong></p>
<p>Windows manages to make copies of all the files I want.</p>
<p>However, running the File History app again only displays the files that have been taken from the
<strong>C:\</strong> drive. The backups of my library folders taken from&nbsp;<strong>S:\</strong> do not show up at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have went into the File History folder in the external <strong>F:\</strong> drive and the backup of my library folders are actually in there.</p>
<p>I have tried deleting all the backups to redo it all over again, only to get the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this happening because File History doesn't restore files that are not on the system drive? How can I get my library folder backups to show up in the File History app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to resolving this soon.</p>
                </div>

            <p>Hi Ruth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot of the situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25676dfd-e1e3-480d-8dc3-6c95a0fba91d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25676dfd-e1e3-480d-8dc3-6c95a0fba91d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see I have selected several library folders on S:\ to be backed up (left window)</p>
<p>When it was done backing up the files, I could find them in the backup drive E:\ (right window)</p>
<p>However when I open up the File History app again, only two of the backup up folders are available for restoration (center window)</p>

<h2>            Shortcut for Windows Key</h2>
                    Hello:<br />
<br />
I have an older keyboard which I will not part with but it has one drawback - it does not have a Windows key. I have seen lots of shortcuts which involve the Windows key, but what do I do if I do not have a Windows key?
                </div>

<br />
Hi<br />
<br />
You can use the Ctrl+Esc key to simulate the Windows Key, however, this does not&nbsp;work with many of the default Windows Key shortcuts. Sometimes you can press the Esc key first followed by the Ctrl key plus a shortcut key to make it work, but much of the functionality
 is lost.<br />
<br />
I haven't tested this in Windows 7 yet to see what works and what does not.<br />
<br />
You can see the current list of Windows Key shortcuts at the following link.<br />
<br />
Windows logo key keyboard shortcuts<br />
<br />
Of course, you can also create shortcuts to some functions and assign your own shortcut key in the Shortcuts properties.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p><span><span><span>Thank You for using Windows 7</span></span></span></p>

            Hi  Edmore,
<br />
<br />Disconnect your laptop from the mains and remove the battery
<br />
<br />Press and hold the power button on your laptop for 30 seconds
<br />
<br />Re-insert the battery and connect to the mains
<br />
<br />Try starting your laptop again
<br />
<br />Does it boot properly this time?

                    I want to create a Win 8 rescue disk and bought a 16 GB flashdrive for that purpose; but windows rescue program can't "find" it. What kind of media do I need to use? I originally tried to use an external harddrive, but was scared off when I got the message
 that all data on the harddrive would be erased.<br />

            <p>Hi Tom,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description, it shows that you would like to create a Windows Recovery disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will help you to create the Windows recovery disk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to ask a few questions for a better understanding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Are you referring to Create a system image when you say “rescue disk”?<br />
2) How are you trying to create the disk?<br />
3) When do you exactly get the error message and what is the complete error message?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are trying to create a system image on Windows 7 file recovery then a system image is an exact copy of a drive. By default, a system image includes the drives required for Windows to run. It also includes Windows and your system settings, programs,
 and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer if your hard disk or computer ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it's a complete restoration—you can't choose individual items to restore, and
 all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced with the contents of the system image.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please refer this <strong>link to create a system image:</strong></p>

<p>Please revert for any clarification on this or any Windows issue. We will be glad to assist you.<br />

            Thanks for your reply, but I think this question needs to go to Dell. My computer has a Dell Backup and Recovery program, which has several choices: 1) is to create Recovery media (which is what I think you are referring to); and 2) is to create a Rescue
 disk, which it says contains all necessary files to restore your system. This is the one that I have a question on - on what media I need to use, it's not selecting the flashdrive that I have.<br />

                    <p>original title: Missing Windows Installer</p>

<p>All of a sudden, I seem to be missing Windows Installer. Certainly not in my Services list. As a result, the latest Microsoft Update K2656374 would not install with error codes 80070641 and 641. A couple of other updates failed as well. This is the first
 time Microsoft updates have failed. I can't install Windows Installer 4.5 (or any other version) because I get an error message that says it's not for my system. I think this is because it's not there to update. And I can't install any software updates with
 the .msi extension. Can somebody tell me how to retrieve or install Windows Installer?&nbsp;
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm using Vista Home Basic SP2 32 bit and have been for several years. This is the first instance of this problem. Using Kaspersky Internet Security and have been for years as well. &nbsp;</div>

            I'll tell you what worked for me. Once you have the file "msiserver.reg" on the desktop, right click it. Now I didn't have a "Merge" option but I did have the "Open" option. So I opened the file using "regedit.exe". You can find this in C:\Windows I believe.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I received a confirmation window that my registry was going to be modified. I said O.K. Then I got a confirmation that the change was made. I re-started my computer and looked in "Services" for Windows Installer. Lo and behold!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I also discovered that System Mechanic was the culprit in deleting an important file in Windows Installer. SO I've excluded that from from the System Mechanic scan. So far I'm good.</div>

                    <p>What is the file.&nbsp; Couldn't find clear info except that it caused crashes in some IE.&nbsp; Do I need this file to allow Windows 10 to operate correctly?&nbsp; I have had so many problems, I hate to download something else that creates my system to go wonky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some comments said it can hide viruses in this application....Afraid to let it download and install.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated.&nbsp; This was not a download thru Windows 10 but a message from Panda virus protection</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> k. williams jr.  say:</h3>
<h2>            ACPI- Compliant Driver Signature Issue</h2>
                    <p>I am having an interesting issue with none other than the "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery". The battery symbol won't display because the device isn't starting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device status is as follows: "Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software
 from an unknown source."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The specific&nbsp;driver file in question is "CmBatt.sys". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried uninstalling the driver and reinstalling (via restart). The diver&nbsp;simply reinstalls itself&nbsp;with the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have even tried uninstalling the actual file from the directory and inserting another one from a driver package that I downloaded from the web.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas? Any advice would be much appreciated. The system in question is a Surface 2 RT.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sadly, however, mice and music receivers don't seem to appear anywhere in the Windows Explorer views.</p>
<p>
</p><p>May I suggest an enhancement to the Bluetooth management functions to allow renaming of these devices? The devices themselves are simple and have their names hardcoded into them at time of manufacture. Renaming the device entry in Windows allows these to
 be distinguished at the the time of pairing, when I physically am handling the device and simultaneously configuring it in Windows.</p>

            This issue is still a problem as far as I can see. I am using Windows 10 and still have this exact same problem. Nowadays, you can purchase multiple Bluetooth transmitters and plug them into any audio input to convert the&nbsp;input to Bluetooth. How do I rename
 these devices In my "Pairing List" on my Windows 10 phone?

<p><span>Hi yuanlinsh,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>What is the make and model number of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span>What is the service pack installed?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the below methods:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>Disable the security software and the firewall temporarily on the computer and then try to connect to internet.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Antivirus software
 can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're
 connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps from the below link: Troubleshooting network connection problems:<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/maintain/troubleshoot.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/networking/maintain/troubleshoot.mspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3:</span></p>
<p><span>Also try resetting TCP/IP protocol and check the results: How to reset Internet Protocol (TCP/IP):<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</a><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations.

<p>Hi! Recently, I have problems with Windows 10. </p>
<p>A driver called dxgkrnl.sys causes a large DPC latency, which is why I get video and audio stutters for about 500 ms. I searched everywhere for the definitive fix for the latency, but found nothing.</p>
</div>
<div>Is there a way to fix this? Seriously, I bought a new PC, and I still have problems with stutters while playing games. All my drivers are updated, I have no viruses, Windows 10 was installed 2 months ago, I did not download any bad software. Please give
 me a solution that works. What do I need to do to have this isue solved once and for all?</div>

            Hi terittake,
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />Can you tell me which graphic card are you using?
<br />However you can try to uninstall your video card from device manager following this procedure:
<br />
<br />1. Press WINDOWS + X
<br />2. Click on "Device Manager"
<br />3. Click on "Video card"
<br />4. Right click on your graphic card
<br />5. Click on "Uninstall device"
<br />6. Click on "Detects Hardware change" (monitor icon)
<br />
<br />Then you can go to your graphic card's manufacturer site and download the driver, then install it and see if that solves your issue.

            Sorry, I'm trying to help you. Because the problem you are having is driver and system related I had to ask you to try checking filesystem corruption. Because of the problem being driver related, I would suggest you to perform a clean install of Windows 10. 
<br />Other than that, you can try to perform a clean boot in order to check if there is some program that run in background starting on boot that create a problem with your graphic card driver. 
<br />If you have your driver up to date, uninstalled and reinstalled them and still have the same problem, you could both try with a clean install or a REPAIR UPGRADE.
<br />If you want to try a REPAIR UPGRADE you can follow this guide:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />That's Operating System related. Other than that you can check for BIOS update available on your motherboard manufacturer site.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update failed - Restoring to previous version of windows</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I’m here because of my failed update. It resulted in an endless loop of the same screen telling me “restoring to previous version of windows” I had the 1709 version and my computer initiated an auto-update to the most recent Win10 version (1803)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m aware that this means the update was corrupted and my computer is stuck on an endless loop. I’ve consulted and looked to other forums for support, but the usual fixes don’t work. I don’t have a backup of my files, or a system recovery point. I’d also
 like to note the other things I’ve tried with the other “usual fixes”</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Attempted to use Reset PC with keeping my files option, resulted in a 1% and immediately going into “undoing changes” and going back to windows recovery environment</li><li>Attempted to run in safe mode, and safe mode with command prompt. Both resulting in a “Your PC ran into some problems” blue screen, restarts back to recovery environment</li><li>Attempted to use startup repair, resulted in the usual “diagnosing your PC” but immediately went back into recovery environment telling me startup repair could not repair my PC.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have that much technical knowledge to solve this problem on my own, the nearest Microsoft store is also miles away. I am trying to install Windows10 on another laptop on a USB stick to use for recovery. But its still downloading. I need to know
 if this will actually work and why the other fixes did not. As far as I’m concerned, this is my first time updating anything on a Win10 computer as I bought this laptop only four months ago during February. I’m beginning to regret ever allowing the Windows
 Update service to being enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Aldous</p>

            Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.   
<br />I will give you some steps at the end of this post to do that when you get back up and running so they are not risked unnecessarily as they are now when Windows won't start.
<br />
<br />You should still try to rescue your most valuable files via USB external or using a flash stick to transfer them to another PC.  
<br />
<br />But to preserve them on the drive when reinstalling then during the booted install do not delete or format any partitions!  Just choose the C partition where WIndows is installed, by size and position.  If you need help doing this post back a picture and I'll confirm which one it is for you.  You will see in the tutorial where it is that these partitions can be viewed during install.  Choose the C partition and then without deleting or formatting just click Next to start the install.  This will archive your User files in a C:\windows.old file as long as they are still there.  This is why I said to check first using the Rescue method.  You want to locate those files and see that they are all there, rescue as many as possible.
<br />
<br />To avoid this in the future by having your files backed up by two of these methods:  
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better automated file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>

<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />There is always a way to boot the media and install if the hardware has not gone bad, so try following the steps and if it fails report back the exact failure behavior and any verbatim error message and we will get you through it.  
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue your files first using the booted media if you don't have them backed up:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  Then follow the steps in tutorial to have an external and cloud file backup from now on as your hard drive can die at any time without notice.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Stuck on Xbox One Green Screen on Boot &#40;3 white bubbles Loop&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi xbox support,</p>
<p>My xbox one won't get pass the xbox one green screen on boot-up. I just turned off my xbox one last night and back on this morning and&nbsp;didn't work.</p>
<p>I read about and have&nbsp;tried to do the latest os restore using OSUDT2 but when I load folder onto usb drive and boot (whilst holding down bind + eject keys), nothing happens. I want to keep all my games and apps so I need a method that works.
</p>
<p>Could you please provide a method/technique to get my xbox one back to working condition as it is stuck on this screen which I have left for an hour but doesn't progress?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Ok I think it is fixed for now.</p>
<p>Had to do a restore to factory defaults using the 21mb update that successfully reset the xbox one using the usb drive.</p>
<p>Problem is I now have to reinstall all games and apps. I'm hoping that my saved games in the cloud can be retrieved. So all good for now but I can't explain why this happened in the first place.</p>
