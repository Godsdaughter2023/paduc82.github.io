Good statement.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/Windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Lexmark%20X2250%20All-in-One%20Printer&amp;v=Lexmark&amp;uid=21T0000&amp;pf=1%26%23960%3B=8&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Multifunction&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Compatibility Center web page for that particular printer</a>, it is compatible with Windows 7 as long as you go to the manufacturer's web page and get the driver for it (like all other hardware - support comes from the hardware manufacturer, not
 the operating system manufacturer.)</p>

<h2>            A very complicated issue, not for the faint hearted</h2>
                    
<p><span>All joking aside this is not a clean cut issue. My account is a child account which I want to change to an adult account because the adult account attached to it 'CateredPillow7' I cannot
 get into as someone in my family managed to delete it. I don't know the email or password to the adult account which comes with considerable issues: my child account 'halonatordjcc' has restrictions on it which mean I cannot buy anything on the Xbox store
 and the only way to change the settings is through the adult account which I can't get into. If I am not allowed to change the child account to an adult account then by all means I will settle for at least removing the restrictions on buying from the Xbox
 store as I have Â£25 worth of points I want to spend but cannot.</span></p>

<h2>            Gears of War 4 download problem with PC storage</h2>
                    Hi. I want to download Gears of War 4 but I do not have enough space. The real problem is that I deleted a lot of stuff to play it and when it was 85ish percent down, it said their was an error. Download ended and I guessed that it deleted those files.
 I want to try to download it again but it says I do not have enough space to do so. I looked at my storage and it said I have 164 GB of apps &amp; games space used up. There is nothing from the last time I tried to install Gears of War 4 and there really should
 be a lot more space on my PC. Does anyone have any suggestions of what to do? Thanks.

<p>Hi Stephen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A factor why you're getting an error on downloading an application/software is due to damaged downloaded files. We may need to do further investigation to identify the issue and its cause. Please provide the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the exact error message/code you're getting?</li><li>Are you downloading the application from Microsoft Store?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you already tried?</li></ul>
        </p>

            When I first downloaded the game, it just said "error, could not download". Now when I try, it says I need more space on my PC. I am trying to download it from the Microsoft Store app. I have tried looking into my storage on my PC to see what I can delete
 but nothings is big enough to even come close to filling up the storage.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />If you're duplicating your display, the resolutions will be duplicated as well. You won't be able to display different resolutions between your PC and TV.
<br />
<br />You'll need to Extend the display, which can be done by pressing Windows Key+P and selecting Extend.
<br />
<br />More information on multiple displays and extending your desktop can be found here:

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

<p>Thanks Graeme but it sound like you're just stating the obvious: if the 2 displays run at the same resolution, then you can duplicate them with no changes of resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is what is going on when the 2 displays are running at different resolutions? In my case, display 1 (PC) is running at a higher resolution (4K) than display 2 (DTV)'s FHD, but I can still duplicate display 1 on display 2. While I don't expect
 display 2 to be running at 4K, why is it running at only HD? Seems like something is converting the 4K signal to HD and not to FHD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Display 2 looks exactly like Display 1 except that everything, like text, looks fuzzier due to the HD resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "Advanced display settings" for Display 2: DTV, it shows "Desktop resolution" at 3840x2160 but "Active signal&nbsp;<span>resolution" at only 1280x720.</span></p>
<p><span>Is there some way to change the conversion ratio?</span></p>

    <title>Windows 7 Setup tips for ISO missing driver boot problems, double key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> em_1336  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Setup tips for ISO missing driver boot problems, double key problem, and unexpected restart problem</h2>
                    <p>This post consists of several problems that I came across while reinstalling Windows, and solutions that worked (at least for me).&nbsp; I took extensive notes for future reference, and figured that others might benefit from my notes.&nbsp; Some of these solutions
 have probably already been suggested in other posts.&nbsp; If so, this post will simply provide reinforcement.<br />
<br />
There were once ISO files that you could download to burn your own Windows DVDs, using your existing Windows registration number.&nbsp; My understanding is that these downloads are on their way towards being shut down, or are already shut down.&nbsp; These were the English-language
 ISO versions that were most useful to me:<br />
<br />
X17-24281 or X17-59186 or X15-65805 = Professional 64-bit SP1.<br />
X17-24209 or X17-58997 or X15-65733 = Home Premium 64-bit SP1.<br />
<br />
The X17-24-series are Win7 Pro x64 SP1, whereas X17-59-series are SP1 with an added bug fix.<br />
I don't know how the 65-series differ from the 24-series and 59-series.<br />
<br />
Bootability on my Sony Vaio laptop, manufactured around 2011:<br />
I could not boot from DVDs created with the 65-series.<br />
The 59186 and 58997 ISOs boot, but Windows Setup has driver hiccups.<br />
The <strong>24281</strong> and <strong>24209</strong> ISOs boot fine.<br />
<br />
You would think that you should use 59186, since it has the added bug fix, but this bug fix is unimportant in the grand scheme.&nbsp; Windows Update will bombard your computer with 200+ updates after installing with either ISO.<br />
<br />
Consistently, each time I reinstall Windows 7 Professional 64-bit on my laptop, this is what occurs.&nbsp; Using the 59-series ISO files, the DVD-ROM boots and Windows Setup starts, but Setup always freezes in its tracks.&nbsp; There are two similar-sounding error messages.&nbsp;
 Sometimes I see one, sometimes I see the other, and sometimes I see both.&nbsp; I can't make sense of why they appear.&nbsp; Normally, when I see either one, I just switch to another ISO (such as 24281) and I don't bother trying to troubleshoot.&nbsp; This time around, I
 wanted to experiment and see if I could learn anything about the source of the errors.&nbsp; They appear after the screen that asks you for your language, time, currency, and keyboard preferences, immediately after the next screen that says Install now.<br />
<br />
The exact words of one are:<br />
<br />
<strong><em>A required CD/DVD drive device driver is missing.&nbsp; If you have a driver floppy disk, CD, DVD, or USB flash drive, please insert it now.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Note:&nbsp; If the Windows installation media is in the CD/DVD drive, you can safely remove it for this step.</em></strong><br />
<br />
The exact words of the other are:<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Select the driver to be installed.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>Load Driver.</em></strong><br />
<strong><em>No device drivers were found.&nbsp; Make sure that the installation media contains the correct drivers, and then click OK.</em></strong><br />
<br />
Searching online, I saw two successful outcomes:<br />
<br />
(Solution 1 to missing driver problem)<br />
Windows 7 has no native support for USB 3.0 chipsets.&nbsp; Therefore, try to temporarily disable USB3 in the BIOS if possible.&nbsp; See if the laptop has at least one USB2 port, and if you're installing Windows with an external USB DVD drive or USB stick, use the USB2
 port, not a USB3 port.<br />
<br />
My laptop doesn't even have a USB3 port, so I don't think this solution applies in my case.<br />
<br />
(Solution 2 to missing driver problem)<br />
Make the partition active on which you want to install Windows.&nbsp; Boot from the Windows 7 Setup DVD â Repair your computer â Recovery tools â cmd â Diskpart â list disks â select the disk on which you want to install Windows â list partitions â select the partition
 where you want to install Windows â make that partition active.<br />
<br />
I didn't try this solution.&nbsp; Instead, I tried swapping DVDs, which turned out to be a mistake.<br />
<br />
(Failure)<br />
I tried swapping in a retail Windows 7 Home Premium DVD, at the point where the error message pops up about missing drivers.&nbsp; This took me to the next screen, saying:<br />
<br />
Please read the license terms.<br />
Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1<br />
<br />
At this point, I swapped DVDs again so that the Windows 7 Professional version was back in the DVD drive, hit the checkbox for "I accept the license terms", and clicked Next.&nbsp; I deleted the primary partiiton and selected to install Windows into the Unallocated
 Space.<br />
<br />
This technique seemed promising, until I reached the point much further along, where Windows Setup asks for your registration number.&nbsp; My W7P64 registration number didn't work.&nbsp; I had to use the W7HP (retail DVD) registration number.&nbsp; Windows Setup then finished
 installing Home Premium, despite copying files from my Professional-version DVD for most of the Setup process.<br />
<br />
(Solution 3 to missing driver problem â my customary solution)<br />
I switched to the DVD created with ISO X17-<strong>24281</strong>.&nbsp; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
This booted without any issues.</span>&nbsp; I didn't see either of the two error messages about missing drivers.<br />
<br />
The next two problems occurred about 5 minutes later.&nbsp; I selected the Custom (advanced) option for installing Windows from scratch:&nbsp; "Install a new copy of Windows.&nbsp; This option does not keep your files, settings, and programs.&nbsp; The option to make changes to
 disks and partitions is available when you start your computer using the installation disc.&nbsp; We recommend backing up your files before you proceed."&nbsp; Then I came to the screen asking, "Where do you want to install Windows?"<br />
<br />
I deleted my first partition, about 100 GB, that had been my decayed, former installation of Windows.&nbsp; The result was Disk 0 Unallocated Space, 102.5 GB.<br />
My second partition, D: (Documents), about 900 GB, type Logical, remained untouched, and was now called Disk 0 Partition 1.<br />
<br />
I wanted to try installing Windows on an NTFS-formatted primary partition C, so I selected Unallocated Space.&nbsp; I clicked on the New button with the yellow sunshine icon, and clicked Next.<br />
Size 104926 MB, Apply, Next.<br />
<br />
This message appeared:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Install Windows.&nbsp; To ensure that all Windows features work correctly, Windows might create additional partitions for system files.</strong></em><br />
<br />
I clicked OK.&nbsp; Setup created two new partitions and changed the former D partition:<br />
Disk 0 Partition 1, System Reserved, 100.0 MB, type System.<br />
Disk 0 Partition 2, (unnamed), 102.4 GB, type Primary.<br />
Disk 0 Partition 3, Documents, 829.4 GB, type Logical.<br />
<br />
I clicked Next.&nbsp; Setup asked me, Where do you want to install Windows?<br />
Partition 2, the 102.4 GB Primary partition.<br />
<br />
Setup started "Expanding Windows Files" and took about 22 minutes to finish.<br />
Note:&nbsp; Windows Setup takes about 6 minutes to go from 0% to 1%.&nbsp; (Don't panic, this is normal.)<br />
<br />
(Solution to Windows key included with the paperwork not working = look for the "real" key)<br />
I encountered a problem that I'm quite familiar with.&nbsp; The original Windows installation on my laptop had two registration numbers.&nbsp; One number was printed in the papers that came in the box, and also appears in an output file when I use a key discovery utility.&nbsp;
 The other number appears on the label stuck to the bottom of my laptop.&nbsp; The first number doesn't work.&nbsp; The second one does.&nbsp; Apparently the second key is the "real" one.<br />
<br />
The next problem was this error message:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>The computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error.&nbsp; Windows installation cannot proceed.&nbsp; To install Windows, click OK to restart the computer, and then restart the installation.</strong></em><br />
<br />
I rebooted from the Setup DVD, chose the Repair option, and tried to continue in Safe Mode, resulting in another error message:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Windows cannot complete installation in Safe Mode.&nbsp; To continue installing Windows, restart the computer.</strong></em><br />
<br />
Thinking there was something wrong with my hard drive, I rebooted from the Setup DVD again, chose the repair option again, and tried to run Chkdsk from X:&nbsp; Chkdsk reported that "Windows has checked the file system and found no problems," but also had a strange
 message:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Failed to transfer logged messages to the event log with status 50.</strong></em><br />
<br />
I figured this was simply because I was running Chkdsk from the X: drive, and it couldn't write its log to the hard drive like it normally would.<br />
<br />
(Solution to unexpected restart or unexpected error problem)<br />
I rebooted from the DVD and started Windows 7 Professional Setup again, but this time, instead of installing to a new partition, I chose to install into the Unallocated Space.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Everything proceeded flawlessly from that point forward</span>.&nbsp; I was finally able to complete the installation of Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.&nbsp; The only other concern were the failed updates that I saw in Windows
 Update, with <em><strong>error code 800F0902</strong></em>.&nbsp; I did some research and learned that these are OK.&nbsp; Windows Update error code 800F0902 simply means that a later update fixed the first update, and the first one is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if the reason why I had the "computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error" problems could be because I created a partition but didn't format the partition before clicking Next?&nbsp; Maybe Windows 7 Setup doesn't know how to
 handle an unformatted partition?<br />

<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would run either Dell Factory Recovery or the WIndows 10 Reset.  
<br />
<br />See Dell Recovery Steps here:  <a href="http://www.dell.com/support/contents/us/en/19/article/Product-Support/Self-support-Knowledgebase/software-and-downloads/dell-backup-solutions/Media-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/contents/us/en/19/a...</a>
<br />
<br />Access the Windows 10 Reset via Repair Mode by whichever method here will work:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If no other method works to access the Troubleshoot Options to Reset then you may need to create bootable media which doesn't require a password to access the Repair Mode and Reset, and can even be used to do the vastly superior Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Troubleshoot Options, then Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  fjjf2006 ,
<br />
<br />On the login screen at the bottom right is a Power Button
<br />
<br />Press the Shift Key and click Restart 
<br />Your PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment 
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the Reset does not work, you should clean install Windows 10:
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Paint changed .pes files to open in Paint, can&#39;t change them back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ten10myfriends  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paint changed .pes files to open in Paint, can&#39;t change them back</h2>
                    <p>My embroidery files with the extension .pes &amp; .fcm (scanNcut extension) were changed to Open with Paint. Paint cannot open this type of file extension. How, when, where, or why this change occurred I do not know. I chatted with MS support who suggested running,&nbsp;mdsched.exe,
 but this did not work. However, I can now open the file in the Embroidery program but they are distorted. I have Windows 10 on an Asus laptop. I could do a restore which might clear up the problem but don't want to lose a new program I installed recently.
 This program did not cause the extension change as it existed before I installed the program. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ten10MyFriends 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your question on the default application to open your .pes files.
<br />
<br />To change your particular .pes file
<br />
<br />1.  Select the icon for the embroidery software.  
<br />2. Click Alt-+Enter at the same time.  (Make note of the Target as you might be referring back to this information)
<br />2. Open your file explorer by pressing the Win+E keys at the same time
<br />3. Go to the folder containing your .pes and .fcm files
<br />4. Select the file and press Alt+Enter at the same time
<br />5. At the line where it reads Opens with: click on the button that says Change
<br />6. Select your embroidery software
<br />   6a. If your software is not listed
<br />   6b. Click Browse
<br />   6c.  Copy and paste or type the information from step 2
<br />   6d.  Click Open
<br />7.  Select OK
<br />8. Select OK
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            <p>Thank you Steve.&nbsp; I called Suddenlink and went over the settings I have with them.&nbsp; We found nothing that was incorrect.&nbsp; The POP3 address was correct as was the SMTP address.&nbsp; The outgoing and incoming server port numbers are correct.&nbsp; I have not checked
 the boxes that say "This server requires a secure connection (SSL)" on either the incoming or the outgoing mail.&nbsp; The person at Suddenlink could not advise me about anything further to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7.&nbsp; The Windows Live Mail Error ID is Ox800CCC19.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do receive email, but email that I send just stays in my Outbox.&nbsp; This just happened recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would appreciate any further ideas you might have.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>If you receive an error message, post it. If you do not receive an error message, do the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a new Outbox, and Sent Items folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do the following for the Outbox, and Sent Items after you move any messages you wish to save to a local folder you create.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In WinXP, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer | Tools | Folder
 Options | View.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the Outbox.dbx and Sent Items.dbx file and delete them. New files will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To help prevent this in the future:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

            <p>OK Disregard my previous post. That is a possible fix for a different program. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Make sure you are not scanning e-mail in your anti-virus program. If that does not resolve it, please ask the experts in this dedicated forum.</p>

            <p>One thing you didn't mention was that the SMTP server requires authentication.&nbsp; I am not a user of WLM (you would be better off asking in that forum as Bruce indicated), but you need to find that option and make sure it is checked and the user name and password
 for the that authentication is the same as for the POP3 server.&nbsp; This page indicates that:&nbsp;
<a href="http://help.suddenlink.com/Internet/Pages/EmailandNewsServerNames.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://help.suddenlink.com/Internet/Pages/EmailandNewsServerNames.aspx</a>&nbsp; I couldn't find what the port numbers should be or whether or not SSL should be checked, but there is this page which indicates you can't send through their SMTP server unless you are
 connected via their services (<a href="http://help.suddenlink.com/Internet/Pages/AdditionalEmailSettings.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.suddenlink.com/Internet/Pages/AdditionalEmailSettings.aspx</a>&nbsp;) .&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't help at all, you might check in the forum for WLM as Bruce suggested.</p>

            <p>Thanks Steve.&nbsp; I talked with another tech person at Suddenlink yesterday.&nbsp; We tried checking the authentication box.&nbsp; We went over all the settings together very carefully and everything was ok. Then someone suggested another number - I think it was 587
 for the place where I had 25.&nbsp; I tried that as well.&nbsp; I did go to the other forum as Bruce suggested.&nbsp; So far, we have not fixed it.</p>

            <p>The port number is going to depend upon the ISP.&nbsp; So someone from Comcast may say to use that other port number, but it is your ISP that indicates what you should use.&nbsp; 25 is the default, but not all ISPs use 25 for the outgoing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also try removing the account completely and close and reopen WLM and then add it back again.&nbsp; Some setting may be corrupted or set wrong and stuck and that could fix it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista Toshiba laptop installation freezes at &#34;Applying Final Configuration&#34; Do not Interrupt-This may take a few minutes.</h2>
                    
<p>I have a toshiba laptop model&nbsp;<span>p205-s6337.</span><span>&nbsp;I
 first deleted everything on the hard disk, then reinstalled vista onto this toshiba. it went through fine, it even boots up fine, and then it says: 'Applying Final Configuration'. Do not interrupt! This may take a few minutes. Then the screen goes black and
 blank. I've waited for it to do something for 30 minutes, and nothing changes. I don't think it's doing anything at all, because it's very quiet and not doing anything. So I got impatient and interrupted, tried it in safe mode, and it said it couldn't complete
 the installation in safe mode, so i went to debug mode, which gave me the black blank screen as well. I'm booting it from the hard drive, not cd-dvd drive. I guess I'm going to wait some more hours until I hopefully get something, but I don't think it's doing
 anything... BIOS is on default settings. As I type, it's on the blank black screen. Does it usually take hours?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Murphy, it came with two installation discs. should i use the first or second?</span></span></p>

<h2>            Massive CHKDSK messages &#39;Replacing invalid security id with default security id&#39; after Windows 10</h2>
                    I
<p><span>I got a new (ssd) disk for my system. I use this disk to install a clean Windows 10. To do that I disconnect the (w7) system drive and connect the new drive. I left the other drives (with data etc) on the system. I configured W10 with
 all the drivers and most of my software. So far it worked OK. </span></p>
<p><span>But as I needed my system and wanted to do some more (W10) test later, I stopped W10, disconnected the W10 drive and reconnected the W7 system drive.</span></p>
<p><span>After reboot of W7 it started a CHKDSK on my data drives. CHKDSK ran for more the Â½ hour with thousands of messages:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Deleting Index entry with IDâ¦.</span><br />
<span>And</span><br />
<span>And</span><br />
<span>Replacing invalid security id with default security ID for fileâ¦.&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Replacing invalid security id with default security ID for fileâ¦.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>After this W7 booted normal but all files and directories on the data disks were inaccessible. I had to spent over 1 hr to change the security setting for all directories. I do not think any data was lost. Even a USB(3) connected data
 disk got this problem.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>I wonder what causes this.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Does W10 change something within the file system that causes w7 CHKDSK to âthinkâ something is wrong?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Is there anything else I could have done wrong to cause this?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
</p><p style="margin-left: 36pt">Thank God I disconnected my W7 system disk and did not leave it connected while W10 was running.<br />

<h2>            Two windows 10 keys in one computer&#63;</h2>
                    I had windows 10 installed in computer, but then hdd crashed, and I was thinking I need new license key ( didn't knew that key associated with motherboard) I entered new license key. Now I am thinking to remove license key and install to other computer.
 My question is, it's possible that computer stored two license keys? Or I just replaced old license key with this new one? Sorry for my broken English.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
IE - click the Gold Start/Favorites to the left of the Address Bar<br />
<br />
You can Right Click on a Folder or a Favorite and have options there.<br />
<br />
Also click the down arrow&nbsp;next to "Add to Favorites..." v&nbsp; and Organize Favorites.<br />
<br />
Also&nbsp;on&nbsp;Menu&nbsp;bar&nbsp;-&nbsp;Favorites&nbsp;- Organize Favorites<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
<br />

<h2>            URGENT&#33;&#33; GAMERS DO NOT UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 10 &#40;yet&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Finished my upgrade to windows 10.&nbsp; EVERY GAME IS BROKEN.&nbsp; Hitman: Absolution, Serious Sam, Wolfenstein: New Order (this one was funny - I got an instant blue screen crash),&nbsp;Witcher 3, Far Cry 4, Elite: Dangerous, Batman: Arkham Origins - the list goes on.&nbsp;
 All these games on windows 8.1 ran smooth at 1080p on ultra with 60fps on my pc build.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Msi Gaming 5 motherboard has a built in led that displays the CPU temperature. Playing all these games always has that number sitting between 50 and 74 degrees Celsius.&nbsp; Post windows 10 upgrade, EVERY game runs at most likely less than 10fps (Unplayable)
 with the cpu temperature jumping to 85-95 Celsius. ****??! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, my gtx 970 SC 2.0 / i7 4790k/16gb vengeance ram build easily runs everything I throw at it on ultra settings, 1080p, 60fps. Having all that taken away is...well it leaves a very cold feeling inside</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT IS launch day. I understand not all drivers/games are optimized. It is my own fault for being so eager to jump in.&nbsp; Apart from my cpu melting, however, everything seems to run very VERY smoothly. BUT no games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF, like me, you are a serious gamer on the PC, then for all that is good DO NOT UPGRADE! YOU WILL BE VERY MAD TRUST ME.</p>

            Yup. Second that. I am running a 970 GTX, can't install the driver from the NVDIA website, games will not run. Cortina very helpfully referred me to this post. Edit Friday morning: After all the restarts, compatibility &amp; security checks, and configurations
 are finished, and you're using Windows: Restart again. Yes, that's it, at least for me. My rig is gaming after the umpteenth restart, the "notifications pane" popped up with a message that drivers were being updated. So, it's still Windows, you have your desktop,
 you just can't use it yet. Same stuff, different distro. Don't freak out now!`

            Everything's working fine for me and I have an HP Pavilion I bought from Best Buy three years ago... even Final Fantasy XIV with every graphics setting on medium-to-high (and we know how much SquareEnix loves detailed graphics).

            <p>I'm having the same issue. I have one game I always loved to play SimCity 4 Deluxe, and never had a problem with it until I upgraded. I've updated the driver etc. restarted the system many times already and still the game doesn't play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone finds a solution I would love to know about it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>U know I have the same issue. I built mine a little lower end than yours, using amd hardware. My radeon r9 280x was perfect with windows 7. I could run assassins creed unity, far cry 3, farcry 4(turning down some other settings), wolfenstein, oddworld and
 gta v on ultra. This upgrade comes out, I'm all excited, jump on it and end up feeling extremely disappointed. I get HORRIBLE frame rates. Bro, ODDWORLD SKIPS FRAMES. That's how bad it is. AMD supposedly came out with some new drivers that support windows
 10, nothing. I used the display driver uninstaller (DDU), clean installed the drivers, at least now my resolution correctly fits on my TV. It even messed that up.I couldn't even go at 480p without the desktop flying off the borders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is one thing though. I have this other game, Toukiden. It's kinda like monster hunter. It doesn't demand much from the PC as the graphics aren't spectacular, but it actually runs smoothly. So the issue may be that the games do not support windows 10
 yet. I tried running them in windows 7 compatibility mode and still get the same thing. It's too late for a clean install; I don't want to go through the trouble of reinstalling everything.
</p>
<p><br />
I have this even older, lower end pc with a radeon hd 6950. It runs arkham city and mass effect 3 perfectly. It never had any driver issues. I have to reinstall the wlan drivers on one of my laptops every time I boot it after this windows 10 upgrade. Free?
 My ****!<br />

            For me it's all OK with my gaming laptop. Maybe try and look for new drivers. I had problems upgrading to windows 10, but all went smoothly after installing latest drivers. (I used iobit driver booster 3 free)
