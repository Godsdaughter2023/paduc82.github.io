<h2>            Converting an External Hard Drive back from Xbox One Drive</h2>
                    
<p>So I converted my external hard drive to use on Xbox One and it worked fine but now I have a bigger drive and I am trying to change it back but when I plug it into my computer it shows up as an Xbox One instead of an external Hard Drive in Devices and Printers.
 &nbsp;I cannot get it to show up at all in My Computer. &nbsp;I have windows 7 if that helps. &nbsp;I found another forum post from a while ago where someone said they fixed this but when you click the link they used to fix it, the page apparently does not exist anymore.
 &nbsp;Anything anyone can tell me to help me fix this would be greatly appreciated. &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Yeah is a bit tricky, but definitely possible :)</p>
<p>Open Computer Management by clicking the Start button, clicking &nbsp;Control Panel, clicking &nbsp;System and Security, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Computer Management. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation,
 type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Right click on unallocated disk (your hard drive you want to fix)<br />
Click on new patition<br />
Then follow the steps on screen</p>
<p>I don't think I can link to other forums (where I got this info from), however if you google 'reformat xbox one hard drive' you should find some articles that will assist :)<br />

Cheers<br />

<h2>            Error 0x80004005&#58; Unspecified error when trying to edit metadata</h2>
                    <p>I am attempting to add metadata (eg: Artist, Title, or Genre) to .m4a music files. When I click "apply" or "okay" I get Error 0x80004005: Unspecified error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs with all .m4a files, but only .m4a files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to apply these properties via the Details pain of the Properties menu accessed by right clicking the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also used Windows Media Player to apply the metadata. The metadata appears only when viewing the files in Windows Media Player, but it does not appear on the actual files viewing them directly.</p>

<p>It is possible that it's already an issue with the music files since it returns the same error on a different computer. For us to see if it's really the case, we suggest that you try obtaining the files again from their original source and check if their
 metadata can be edited.</p>
<br />
<p>As a workaround in resolving the issue, you can try converting the .m4a files to mp3 format. Once converted, edit their metadata, then convert them to its original format.</p>

</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Today I have been experiencing a problem that frustrates me. I've been using my new Skullcandy Hesh 2 Wireless Bluetooth headphones. But when I try to connect my headphones to my computer using bluetooth, it doesn't show up! Is there
 any fix? I tried troubleshooting, turning off my network off and on, and even tried to restart, but nothing works. The second problem is that when I turn off my headphones, the don't reconnect even if I turn my headphones back on.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I am really frustrated with this, and I can't find a fix to this! I try to check the box "Allow Bluetooth devices to find the computer" as well! But it says that my settings won't apply for some reason.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Lokomaikai,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I would really appreciate you have tried many troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you &nbsp;check whether other Bluetooth devices are working on&nbsp;your computer?</p>
<p>
&nbsp;Did you &nbsp;check whether Hesh2 wireless headphones are working on a different <br />
computer?
</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow some steps to check what exactly cause of <br />
this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are receiving a signal, but it is not clear, first change the radio <br />
frequency with the CHANNEL selector switch on the transmitter, then briefly <br />
press the AUDIO TUNING button on the headphones.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>•Verify that the headphones are firmly plugged into the correct jack on the <br />
Audio source. In most cases this will be a headphone jack or audio out.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>•Make sure that the POWER switch on the Headphones is in the ON position. <br />
When the Headphones are on, the</div>
<div>POWER LED of the Headphone should light up green. If it does not, your <br />
headphones will need to be charged.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you <br />
better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Hi Vikki&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have already tested an external keyboard (which is working) it appears there is something wrong with the laptop's keyboard. - Generally if several letters appear when you press a key this is liquid damage...<br />
<br />
You could try leaving the laptop powered off and leaving it somewhere dry for a day to see if it dries. If you're happy doing it (and the laptop is not under warranty) you can try removing the keyboard - if you reply with the full model e.g. Dell Latitude &lt;number&gt;
 I can link you the service manual for it. Removing the keyboard and ensuring everything is dry - including carefully removing any dried residue on the connectors can resolve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not take it to a local computer repair shop and see if they can have a look - replacing the keyboard may be enough. If it is still under warranty (and it includes accidental damage) you may be able to get it repaired by Dell.<br />
<br />
As an external keyboard works this seems to be more of a hardware issue than a Windows one.<br />

<h2>            My Xbox one has damaged my game disc</h2>
                    Recently I have been having trouble with my Xbox reading my game disc (I only play the one game at the moment so the disc pretty much stays in there all the time) so when I try to fire up the game I get the please insert disc message. So I would eject
 the disc and put it back in and after a couple of times the game would eventually launch, this wouldn't happen every time maybe one in ten. So this has been going on for a couple of months now, but I could still get the game to work so I just left it be. Until
 today, I was unable to launch the game at all so I pulled the disc out to have a look, and no wonder the Xbox can't read it. 1/4 of the edge of the disc has been completely damaged by the xbox, and these aren't little scratches I'm talking about, it's like
 the Xbox has melted the disc or something. I'm too scared to put another disc in there from fear of losing another game I've spent $80+ on. Surely this is something covered by Microsoft as it is their product that is destroying the

<p>so i check that im using latest intel driver (from march 2017), ran netsh winsock reset, trying to reinstall drivers and wireless software, trying to do network reset - all with no result.</p>
<p>also i have try to turn off firewall and antivirus software, and the same no result..</p>
<p>i have stable connection, good ping response, but pages in all the browser are opening extra slow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>so i do some test in the same network with other laptop without CU installed - and im pretty sure that is no internet problems in my place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>could you please help with any suggestion?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Microsoft has recently announced a fix for this particular “RSC” (</span><span>Receive Segment Coalescing)</span><span> issue, with
<strong>OS Build 15063.447</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try installing the latest Windows 10 cumulative update (KB4022716, OS Build 15063.447) to see if it helps. To install the update, go to&nbsp;</span><strong><span><span>Start</span></span></strong><span> &gt;</span><strong><span><span>Settings</span></span></strong><span>
 &gt; </span><strong><span><span>Update &amp; security</span></span></strong><span> &gt; </span>
<strong><span><span>Windows Update</span></span></strong><span> &gt;</span><strong><span><span>Check for updates</span></span></strong><span>.
</span><span>To confirm OS Build, go to&nbsp;</span><strong><span><span>Start</span></span></strong><span> &gt;
</span><strong><span><span>Settings</span></span></strong><span> &gt;</span><strong><span><span>System</span></span></strong><span> &gt;
</span><strong><span><span>About</span></span></strong><span>. More information on the update is in the Windows 10 update history page
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4022716/windows-10-update-kb4022716" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><span>For reference, the issue they fixed states:</span></p>
<p><span>“Addressed issue where, after updating to the Creators Update, devices that have Receive Segment Coalescing (RSC) enabled have significantly low wireless throughput.”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note about previous workarounds:<br />
</span><span>If you had manually changed RSC or MTU or installed older drivers....&nbsp;and now have Build 15063.447 or later, you should undo those workarounds, restart the PC, and test that wireless performance works as expected.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7/7/2017 Update: For my particular testing scenario, it looks like the network administrators must have implemented a workaround on their end. I say this because things were working correctly, even when I reverted the workarounds and had not yet installed
 15063.447. I suspect they disabled Rsc or lowered MTU ranges, on the Wi-Fi switches. Therefor, I am unable to test Microsoft's fix, as I am unable to reproduce the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I will still list the story and workarounds, below, for reference.</span></p>

<p>My story:</p>
<p>My wife's HP Spectre x360, which has a <strong>"Intel(R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 7265"</strong>, has this issue
<strong>caused by the Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703</strong>. On our home network, everything runs great, but on the work network...
<strong>Web pages load extremely slowly, or stop loading altogether</strong>, even though signal is great and ping is great. It is easily reproducible, even if Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are both completely disabled; netsh reset doesn't help.
 Uninstalling Wireless Display (Wi-Di), did not help the situation.</p>

</p><p><strong>Fortunately, I found some workarounds!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>==============================================================</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Workaround #1 (Recommended by Microsoft):</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disabl</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>e&nbsp;</strong><strong>"Receive segment coalescing" (Rsc)</strong><strong>
</strong></span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on your wireless adapter</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Tripp Parks [MSFT], provided an excellent workaround, that is recommended by Microsoft, and appears to resolve the issues. Thanks Tripp! And Tyler [MSFT] has provided a tool that automates it. Thanks Tyler!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Steps to disable Rsc using Microsoft's automated tool:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Download the ".diagcab" file located here:</p>
<p><a href="https://aka.ms/diag_cssemerg11005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://aka.ms/diag_cssemerg11005</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Run it, and let it see if it can determine the problem and fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Re-test your wireless internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you'd rather do it manually, then I have those steps below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Steps to disable Rsc manually:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Open an Admin Command Prompt window:<br />
Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows System -&gt; Right-click "Command Prompt" &gt; More &gt; Run as administrator<br />
... Note: If you want this available on your Start's Right-click menu, you can go to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Taskbar &gt; Replace Command Prompt &gt; Set to Off</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Get your network adapter name:<br />
powershell Get-NetAdapter<br />
<br />
3) Note your adapter's name (mine is: Wi-Fi)<br />
<br />
4) Get your network adapter "Receive segment coalescing" (Rsc) settings:<br />
powershell Get-NetAdapterRsc<br />
... Mine listed a table that had 1 row, for adapter name Wi-Fi, that had IPv4Enabled True, and IPv6Enabled True<br />
<br />
5) Disable Rsc for your network adapter:<br />
powershell Disable-NetAdapterRsc -Name ADAPTER_NAME_FROM_BEFORE<br />
... Be sure to replace ADAPTER_NAME_FROM_BEFORE with whatever your network adapter name is, without quotes<br />
<br />
6) Verify Rsc is disabled for ipv4 and ipv6, on your network adapter:<br />
powershell Get-NetAdapterRsc<br />
... Should now show IPv4Enabled False, and IPv6Enabled False, for your network adapter<br />
<br />
7) Re-test your wireless internet connection.</p>

<p>- Click the "Scan for hardware changes" button at the top of Device Manager</p>
<p>- Let it reload the Wi-Fi network adapter</p>
<p>- Keep Uninstalling, until it reloads the same version it had last reloaded.</p>

</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Prevent Windows Update from updating driver 17.15.0.5 (2/22/2015):</strong></span></p>

    <title>USB modem stops receving on reboot but OK after placing call - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB modem stops receving on reboot but OK after placing call</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this is a modem problem or a Windows problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Zoom 56K USB fax modem (Model 3095), and I use Win 8's built-in fax function. I can send and receive faxes without problem, except that whenever I reboot the computer, the modem is not accessible to incoming calls. By this I mean that from the phone
 that is calling the modem, you hear it continue to ring, but on the computer, there is no indication that there's an incoming call. (It is NOT an instance where the incoming fax alert window opens but the modem does not pick up. Rather, there is no evidence
 at all of any incoming all.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If go into Device Manager, find the modem and the Diagnostics tab, and Query the modem, it passes all the tests</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I place an outgoing call through the modem, the alert opens showing an outgoing call. Once I close that out, incoming calls are received without any problem. Until I reboot the computer, at which point the problem recurs, and I have to remember
 to place an outgoing call so I'll be able to receive incoming faxes...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<br />
I appreciate your willingness to help, but it would be more helpful if you read my post more carefully. I specifically said that the issue is NOT that the modem won't answer (automatically or not). The modem does not recognize that a call is coming in. Thus,
 it's not an issue of setting the modem to answer automatically (which it is set to do anyway).<br />
<br />
As for any recent changes to the system: None.<br />
<br />
Please re-read my post.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<p>Having the same problem here. Trying to add microsoft points through the xbox and it "worked" the first time, but when I was about to get the content it said I didn't have enough credits and the counter was set to 0 msp. When I tried again it popped up back
 to what I used to have, but when I tried to add msp again, I just kept getting that message. I am also unable to purchase through the xboxlive's webpage.</p>
<p>PS: Shouldn't be a problem with money or the credit card.</p>

<p>Hey there guys! If you're unable to purchase from both the website and the console, I would recommend getting in touch with the billing experts at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">phone support</a>. This sounds like an account issue, and they'd be the ones to track it down. Please let us know if you have any trouble with that process or what you find out. Thanks!</p>

<p>Same error here for the last month. I've had a ticket open with MS phone support for a week or so now but no luck. They've asked me to double check all security settings and my email attached to the account, which is my live email for everything microsoft
 so it can't be that.</p>
<p>Really frustrating. Has anyone got any luck on this yet?</p>

<h3> chris-5678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows malfunction</h2>
                    <p>When i log into my laptop everythjng runs for about 2-5 minutes and the microsoft account “you need to fix your microsoft account for apps on your other devices to be able to launch apps and continue experiences on this device” then the whole computer freezes.
 The mouse still works and the little blue rotating circle will sit there in place of the mouse cursor the entire time. After a while it will pop up another window saying “microsoft windows is not responding.” And only gives me the option to end task which
 makes the computer go to a black screen after a 3-5 minute wait. No matter how many times i reset the computer (hard shutdown and turn back on) it still does this. I never had this issue until i got the desktop. Is there anything i can do to fix this before
 i wipe it and reinstall the OS? Computer came with windows 8.1 but forced itself through updates to run off windows 10. Now running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works perfectly on my desktop. Only the laptop is having this issue.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Does Windows 8.1 Support Windows Essentials&#39; Movie Maker&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vikil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Does Windows 8.1 Support Windows Essentials&#39; Movie Maker&#63; Cannot add audio files.</h2>
                    After upgrading to Windows 8.1 several months ago, I finally got around to using Movie Maker (from Windows Essentials 2012 package) yesterday but I found that I cannot add any audio/music onto my project at all. The "Add Music" icon at the top of the "Home"
 row is shaded out, thus not allowing me to click it. When I try to import the audio file through the file menu, a pop-up says "Movie Maker doesn't support the selected file type." However, the audio file is a .mp3 and I have had no problem adding this particular
 file before I made the upgrade to Windows 8.1 several months ago. <br />
<br />
If 8.1 does not support Windows Essentials 2012, will there be any plans of new Essentials package for 8.1 users?

</p>
<p>Movie Maker won't let you add audio until you have added a visual element.&nbsp; I suspect that is why you are not seeing the option enabled yet.&nbsp; Try adding one single photo, at least, and then see if the
<strong>Add Music</strong> option is enabled.</p>

            Hi DonnaSnell 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Not sure which Spider Solitaire was this. Microsoft Store has two Spider Solitaires. You can download as per what you had earlier.

<h2>            Can I use a any external hard drive to download GTA&#58; San Andreas and other Original Xbox games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have the 4gb internal Hard Drive Xbox 360 that comes with the Kinect and downloading GTA: SA is more than 4gb. &nbsp;I don't have money right now to by an official Xbox 360 Slim Hard Drive (ex. Microsoft 320gb Hard Drive with Lego Star Wars). &nbsp;But on some websites
 they have an Xbox 360 Agptek Hard Drive that is much cheaper. &nbsp;Could I use that to buy and download old Xbox games on the Xbox Live Marketplace??</p>

<p>I tried downloading GTA: SA on my USB, but it says I need an external hard drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox original games require an official Xbox hard drive.&nbsp; You can't use external hard drives or USB Flash drives as they won't work with that game, even if you managed to download it to them.&nbsp; Xbox original games require both the Xbox emulation software
 and a hard drive cache to run. Both the emulator and the cache are only available on an official hard drive.<br />
<br />
Don't bother with cheaper Xbox 360 hard drives from private sellers on Amazon or auction sites such as eBay either as these are fake hard drives and are missing the emulator and the required hard drive cache.</p>

<p>Yes, that would be correct. You would need to make sure that it's an official Xbox 360 hard drive and not a used or another brand.<br />
<br />
I know that Best Buy also sells an off brand named AGPTEK and that would not possess the emulation files, same goes with Gamestop as they sell used hard drives that are sometimes not officially Microsoft branded.<br />
<br />
I highly suggest you purchase only an official new in box Microsoft branded drive from either of the two stores.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dedicated video card RAM is the max limit of RAM phyiscally installed (aka soldered onto) on the video card.&nbsp; You can "never" increase this type of RAM because you MUST "modify" (aka un-solder and then solder on new larger RAM) which is most often IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p>Consider purchasing a video card that is listed as compatible for your games, that is compatible with your desktop PC and will have at least 512 MB of RAM.</p>

            Dedicated graphics memory has to be ON the graphics card. For this reason, you can't increase it using software..

<p>Thanks for the reply. I have already reverted to version 1709, but the steps are simple:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install any 3 languages, for example English, Spanish and Italian.</p>
<p>2. Try to remove the Italian keyboard language, so that Alt+Shift would only switch between English and Spanish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not completely remove Italian (this is possible), just the Italian keyboard input language.</p>

<p>This is where you can remove input (keyboard) languages in Windows 10 v.1709. It has been removed in the Spring Update and there's no other way to do it.</p>

<p>What you are suggesting removes ALL FEATURES related to that language: keyboard input, text-to-speech, handwriting etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, and please note the difference: we are not looking how to completely uninstall a language. We only want to remove the KEYBOARD INPUT language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was possible in every Windows version in history, including Windows 10. Please pay attention to the video below: I am removing the Spanish KEYBOARD language only, while the Spanish language REMAINS installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow us to do this as Windows always did. The method is irrelevant (Settings, Control Panel or whatever). This feature is ESSENTIAL for multilingual systems.</p>

<h2>            Why do I have Duplicate of Program Files</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I have upgraded my Windows 7 from 32 to 64 bit. I did a clean install and did a quick format of the drive first. This went OK, but I have duplicate of "Program Files". One is the usual Program Files and the second Progam Files(x86). I want to get
 rid of this. I find that programs that are being installed that don't give an option of an installation location are by default being put into (x86), which I do not want. I have tried to delete this file but the user accounts control will not allow me to do
 this, even though the control slider has been moved to the bottom and the computer rebooted. I am the only user and owner of the computer. The (x86) duplicates all the normal Microsoft Standard programs taking up unnecessary disk space, and now a large proportion
 of the self installed progams. I don't mind having to reinstall these if this problem can be solved. Ken Brown</strong></p>

            Leave it as it is. You&nbsp;will make Windows 7 unworkable if you succeed in what you are trying.<br />
<br />
Program Files is for 64-bit programs and Program Files (x86) for 32-bit programs. These use different routines and Windows 7 will call the appropriate routine when it recognises the type of program. If you change the structure Windows 7 will simply not work
 properly.<br />
<br />
Most programs are still 32-bit and will therefore be installed to Program Files (x86).

<h3> bobhewsonzv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activating Windows 8&#58; The product key is not accepted after re-installing Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>My autistic 11 years old son loves his computer. He wanted to upgrade from XP to Windows 8, so&nbsp;I bought him a copy and we installed it. It worked fine, except that we had to spend many hours reinstalling all his programs, but never mind. Then, when I wasn't
 around he did something with the machine which made exerything go wrong. He then put the installation disk into the computer and, to cut a long story short, caused the whole thing to get wiped off. So, I re-installed Windows 8 from scratch. Then we started
 to get messages that we must 'Activate' windows and certain functions (such as customising the desktop background)&nbsp;no longer&nbsp;work. Needless to say, the entirely legitimate product key isn't accepted and we can't activate the copy of Windows that I have paid

<p>You upgraded to Windows 8, but didn't have a previous version of Windows installed (error 0xC004F061)</p>
</b>
<p>If you see error 0xC004F061 when you try to activate Windows 8, it means that you're using a product key for an upgrade version of Windows 8 and a previous version of Windows wasn't on your PC when Windows 8 was installed. To install an upgrade version of
 Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8. For help with the activation process, <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=260480" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I don't see an error message; it just says that the product key is not acceptable. I tried ringing the activation centre by telephone but it just gives an automated answer asking for&nbsp;screen codes, which&nbsp;I haven't got. There doesn't seem toi be any way of
 actualy speaking to a human being.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but it looks like we're screwed. The original windows was XP, but I can't find the particular disk used for this computer (I found another one in the cpuboard but it was for different PC in the house). When we installed the new Windows 8, it put
 all the files from the old XP version into a folder called windows.old. After the successful installation, that folder was so big it was taking up all the space for my son to re-load his games and programs. So, I deleted all the contents windows.old. Perhaps
 that's why the system thinks there was no previous version of windows.</p>
<p>The Windows 8 we have was sold to us (the retailer was Comet) on the basis that it was a full clean-load version. Looks like that was untrue too.</p>
<p>Now what happens? Obviously my son can't customize his PC. Presumably he won't receive updates and so on. Will his Windows stop operating altogether? We are in a fix now because we can't go back and can't go forward. I can't afford to buy him a new PC or&nbsp;another
 Windows. Is there anything I can do? As I say, he is autistic. His PC is his life.</p>

            <p>Thanks Andre. OK, I made the Win + x, slui.exe 4 thing but all that comes up on teh screen is a dialog box saying that Windows is not activated. There is no list of countries, phone numbers or anything like that and no options to find them. So, I still can't
 get to speak to anyone. It's all very frustrating.</p>

    <title>How do I get hold of Windows XP Service Pack 3&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I get hold of Windows XP Service Pack 3&#63;</h2>
                    I apparently need Windows XP Service Pack 3 installed for another program to load. &nbsp;I followed the links and found a place where I could supposedly download the Windows XP Service Pack 3, but it stated that the version there was for developers and people
 who wanted to load the Windows XP Service Pack 3 onto multiple computers. &nbsp;If one only wants to load it onto one computer, which is what I need to do, one is directed to go to "upgrades". &nbsp;But when I click onto the "upgrade" button for the Windows XP Service
 Pack 3, I get thrown back to the page with the version that says it is only for developers and people who want to load it onto multiple computers. &nbsp;How do I get hold of a single copy of this program?

            <p>Thanks for all the suggestions. &nbsp;I have so far spent 3 days trying to get hold of this file and then get it to load, and am now on day 4. &nbsp;I have now encountered new problems, and spent 6 - 7 hours on Wed. trying to get through to Microsoft's online help.
 &nbsp;I have tried the phone help, but while I can understand German accented English, French accented English, and several other accented versions of English, Indian accented English combined with the distortions of phone lines plus the use of technical terms
 I am not familiar with results in total frustration as I simply don't understand what the the clearly knowledgeable techs are saying. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, here are the problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I did get through to Microsoft's on-line help on Tuesday, and was given a link to the "Windows XP Service Pack 3." &nbsp;However the tech neglected to inform me that this is a 6 - 8 hour download, and there are basically no instructions on what to do with
 the file once I get it. &nbsp;So far I have downloaded it twice. &nbsp;When I tried to copy it or activate it the first time, I got an error message that basically said first that XP did not recognize the file or the source as being a genuine Microsoft file and seriously
 did not want to open it, strongly urging me not to open it. &nbsp;Very disturbing when the file was downloaded from the Microsoft website. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) &nbsp;Apparently there are or were 2 versions of this file. &nbsp;To keep things straight I will refer to the version for Developers and people wanting to load the program onto multiple computers as Version A. &nbsp;I found Version A sort of by accident, but the text
 description said that if one only wanted to load the program onto one computer, one should not use "Version A", but another version, which I will call Version B. &nbsp;I hunted all through the website as best I could, but every time I tried to follow the directions
 to Version B, I ended up back at the screen that has the first line that says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Thanks for your interest in getting updates from us."</p>
<p>
</p><p>"To use this side, you must be running Microsoft Internet Explorer 5 or later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another line that is not pertinent to this discussion here, then:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If you prefer to use a different web browser, you can obtain updates from the Microsoft Download Center ..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However when I go to the Microsoft Download Center, I end up back at Version A, the version for developers and people who want to load the program onto multiple computers, and which states clearly that this version should not be used for loading the program
 onto 1 computer. &nbsp;There is a link to get to the Version B for loading onto 1 computer, but when I click on it, I end up back at the Screen whose top line says: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Thanks for your interest in getting updates from us."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem because I am running XP with Google Chrome as my browser because the version of Internet Explorer I was using abruptly started crashing on a regular basis, and at that time, several years back, there was no upgraded version of Internet
 Explorer that would work with XP. &nbsp;I gotten accustomed to Chrome and rather like it. &nbsp;The only time it has crashed on me in the 3 years I've been using it was yesterday after 6 hours spent trying to get in line for an on-line chat with one of Microsoft's "answer
 techs". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am running into is that I keep going around in a circle trying to get hold of the right version of the Windows XP Service Pack 3. &nbsp;Unless the only version now available is the developer version?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my online chat on Tuesday when I did get through relatively easily, I specifically asked the "Answer Tech" if the link he was giving me was to the Version B, the one for loading on only 1 computer, not the Version A, the one for developers, and he stated
 that the link would take me to the 1-computer version, not to the developer version. &nbsp;But his link took me to the developer version. &nbsp;So maybe now that Microsoft no longer supports XP, there is only the developer version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) &nbsp;I bought this computer loaded with XP as when I bought it, XP was the only stable operating system Microsoft had come up with, and the shop I bought the computer from strongly recommended I go with XP and loaded it onto the computer (and moved files
 from my old computer to the new one) for me at no charge. &nbsp;But this means that I did not load XP on myself, and have so idea what "extras" were or were not loaded. &nbsp;The shop has since closed, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere in my exploration of the Microsoft website pages concerning the Windows XP Service Pack 3, I came across a statement that said that the Service Pack 3 would not load unless either Service Pack 1 or Service Pack 2 was already installed. &nbsp;So perhaps
 the reason my XP did not recognize Service Pack 3 is because I have neither Service Pack 1 nor Service Pack 2 already loaded?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I spent over 6 hours trying to get in line for an on-line chat, and in the end I never did connect, and whatever was going on finally crashed Chrome, so I gave up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten more info from you people than I have gotten from Microsoft in 3 days. &nbsp;I am not a computer whiz, not even a power user. &nbsp;This is all very confusing, and I find Microsoft's statement that I am using their "premium" on-line chat service when I
 sit for 6 hours in front of a screen that says it is taking longer than expected to connect me to an "answer tech" and thanks me for my patience very very very annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help you can give me would be most appreciated.</p>

            <p>Windows Update (or its closely-related site Microsoft Update) will not give you any Windows XP updates until you are already running service pack 3 for Windows XP.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Starting with no service packs (sometimes called Windows XP Gold), there have been Service Pack 1, 1a, 2, and 3.&nbsp; There are some prerequisites for the later service packs, so the first thing you need to do is to find out what service pack you now have.&nbsp;
 RIght-click "My Computer" and select "Properties."&nbsp; You will see the "System Properties" display, which will show which edition (Home, Pro, Media Center) and which service pack (none, 1, 2, 3) is installed.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Service Pack 3 requires that either Service Pack 1 (or 1a) or 2 be installed first.&nbsp; Thus, if your System Properties shows no service pack installation, you first need to download and install Service Pack 2 and then download and install Service Pack 3.<br />

<p><strong>Before you actually start the installation process, be sure to temporarily disable your antivirus program.</strong>&nbsp; Don't forget to turn it back on when you're done.&nbsp; Reboot twice after the installation completes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also need to install Internet Explorer 8.&nbsp; Go here --&gt; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/internet-explorer-8-details.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 sp 3 and rebooted twice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, you can go back to Windows Update and it should scan your system and tell you about the many (many) post-sp3 updates you need to install.</p>

            <p>Thank you so much for the help, Lem P. &nbsp;I had sort of figured out that there is probably only 1 version of the SP3. &nbsp;Leave it to Microsoft to leave wording up on the website that is incredibly confusing to everyday people like me. &nbsp;Sometimes I feel like
 Microsoft is sneering at the non-power users &amp; non-computer whizzes like me who are competent on a few programs we use regularly, but get easily lost when it comes to Windows, any version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The info I have gotten here is far more detailed and better explained than what I have gotten from the on-line chat "answer tech's", when I could actually connect to them instead of sitting by the computer for 6 hours trying to connect and having screen
 messages pop up praising me for my patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I switched over to Chrome because my older version of Internet Explorer kept crashing, as it apparently could not deal with websites designed to handle the newer, with more bells &amp; whistles, websites. &nbsp;My local computer gurus, whose shop has since closed
 when the owner decided at 72 that it was time for him to play instead of work (who says us older people can't master computers!!!), suggested I switch to Chrome because it would co-exist happily with XP, work with the current design of websites, and Microsoft
 intensionally had no version of Internet Explorer that would work with XP because they wanted everybody to switch to their newer, but incredibly flawed, operating systems. &nbsp;I'm guessing that enough people, like me, chose the stability &amp; reliability of XP over
 the bells &amp; whistles of the newer systems, so perhaps Microsoft finally accepted that to maintain their market share with Internet Explorer, they would have to come up with something that also worked with XP. &nbsp;I have gotten used to Chrome, so what does IE
 offer me that Chrome doesn't that would be reason enough to switch back to Internet Explorer 8? &nbsp;I made the change to Chrome because I had no choice. &nbsp;If it makes sense to switch back I will do so, but there needs to be a good reason, not just more bells and
 whistles. &nbsp;I do tend to operate on the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" theory. &nbsp;So far, the only problem I have had in the 3 or 4 years with Chrome is when 6 hours of waiting on-line for the Microsoft on-line chat with an "answer tech" crashed Chrome. &nbsp;Admittedly,
 I don't ask Chrome to do anything fancy, but I probably won't in the future either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks to all of you who have posted suggestions and explanations. &nbsp;You seem more knowledgeable and explain things better than the official on-line "answer techs". &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

 under the hood. No, they went and made the 3 pigs Vista, 7 and 8. They take up a lot of space just to install. And I don't care what anybody says they are dumb down and slow. We'll just have to rely on our old faithful friend XP. Because I don't care how old
 it is, it still works. And I agree with you about crippled IE8. It will never work right in XP anymore. They did something to it to rendered it useless.&nbsp; If Firefox, Opera and Chrome can run smoothly in XP, than why can't IE work. We know why. Force "upgrade'.
 Yep, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Wish Gates thought that way too. All they care about is phones, catching up with Apple and the "great"cloud. Forget about the loyal XP users. I'l make a backup of the whole XP OS install with Acronis. And if something
 goes wrong. Just delete and install my trusty backup. Takes about 12 minutes to come back to new and untouched by the "hacker or virus" that they said we XP users will get. Xpocalypse will be a coming.
