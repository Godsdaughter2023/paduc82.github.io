<h2>            Stuck with windows 7 failure configuring service pack reverting changes do not turn off your computer&#43;how long it takes</h2>
                    Good Afternoon Every one. <br />
I am using Windows 7 Ultimate edition. I tried updating the Windows 7 service Pack 1 but unfortunately the Pack didn't install and the system was stuck in Failure configuring service pack, reverting changes, do not turn off your computer. It took more than
 3 hours but still no further processing. I rebooted the PC by taking plug off and again the system was stuck on same screen, I tried restarting in safe mode but still same screen pops up of reverting changes. I tried using the repair your computer option&nbsp;
 from boot screen but didn't have any kind of backup or system restore point created. Can anybody please help me through this. Regards.

            Hello there,<br />
Thanks for your reply. Well currently i am not having my Windows7 CD with me so i opted for Method:4 Step 1<br />
However after executing the command at command prompt<br />
<br />
&nbsp;i m getting this:<br />
<br />
</span><br />
<br />
Also one strange thing being observed is that when i selected command prompt option from System recovery options, the director path is :<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 update freezing cd&#47;dvd then whole system freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have a 1 year old DELL Laptop that came with windows 10, the recent update causes my CD/DVD player to freeze after running for a few moments, more so if I am opening small individual files and browsing from a data CD. If I play a music cd it plays ok.&nbsp;
 A Microsoft engineer remote updated my computer and told me to try that but it did not resolve the issue, when the CD/DVD freezes I have to reboot the Laptop as it crashes</p>
<p>The Dell software in my computer has checked my Laptop and says everything is working fine. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a software that's causing the issue with your CD/DVD, after an update. A compatibility could also be the reason why the freezing is happening. We suggest&nbsp; that you perform a clean boot. It's to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers
 and startup programs. This also helps eliminate software conflict that occur when you install a program or an update. Follow these steps to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click the Windows icon on your screen, then search for msconfig.</span></li><li><span>Select System Configuration from the search results.</span></li><li><span>On the Services tab</span></li><li><span>Once done, click on <strong>Disable all</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Go to Startup tab, click on <strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once the Task Manager is up, go to <strong>Startup tab</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on each item, then click <strong>Disable</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Close the Task Manager.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in <strong>System Configuration</strong>, click
<strong>Apply</strong> then <strong>OK.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Restart your computer to save the changes. Once your computer restart, check if the issue persists. Once done observing, follow these steps to "<strong>Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Click the Windows icon on your screen, then search for msconfig.</span></li><li><span>Select System Configuration from the search results.</span></li><li><span>On the Services tab</span></li><li><span>Once done, click on <strong>Enable all</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Go to Startup tab, click on <strong>Open Task Manager</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once the Task Manager is up, go to <strong>Startup tab</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on each item, then click <strong>Enable</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Close the Task Manager.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong>Startup</strong> tab in <strong>System Configuration</strong>, click
<strong>Apply</strong> then <strong>OK.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>We're looking forward to your feedback</span></p>

<h2>            Headphones aren&#39;t working</h2>
                    <p>I need help trying to fix my audio problems, I've run every troubleshooter that is relevant, tried to install legacy hardware,&nbsp;tried to install the audio driver from my motherboard manufacturer's website (it caused my computer to bluescreen) and scoured
 a hundred forum posts. I can't seem to fix the issue, but my headphones (that are maybe a week old) aren't working at all. They aren't being detected, which makes me think that it is a driver issue. I've even tried wiping the drive and reinstalling Windows
 today, didn't help. The HD Audio Controllers are listed under system devices instead of audio devices and one has a code 10 presenting this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the events, it gives me this error:</p>

            Hi Evan.  I"m Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for headset problems so at least something will work.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by here to help:
<br />
<br />First try the steps here:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-headset-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/setting-your-hea...</a>
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Autoplay to look for the device and change the default behavior in it's Dropdown Menu.
<br /> 
<br />Right click Volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, Open Sounds Settings, in dropdown menus at top make sure Headphones are selected and Connected for both Playback and Recording Default Devices.
<br />
<br />If not again right click Volume icon in System Tray to choose Troubleshoot sound problems.
<br />
<br />Also try the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Go to the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Sound controller device, on Driver tab choose Roll back or Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.
<br />
<br />Do the same for the headset device and/or it's microphone.
<br />
<br />Update the Sound driver from the PC or Device maker's Support downloads web page. While there also check that the Chipset, BIOS, Display, USB, Network and all other drivers are the most current.
<br />
<br />Sometimes it helps to unpair or disconnect all other Bluetooth devices from the PC in Bluetooth settings, then try again to connect the headset.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  
<br /><a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.  
<br /><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you are an Insider I can also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Turn off notitfications from Sports App</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Sports App - issues and question</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I turn off notifications from the Sports App?</p>
<p>I dont remember selecting those and I got a notification about auto racing which is not part of my favorites. How do i stop those from coming in on sports I do not follow???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have the issue of not being able to add the Philadelphia Phillies to my sports team. Can someone look into that one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected topics here as People because i had to select something. There is no choice for Sports there. THis should be added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE &nbsp;.. &nbsp;half an hour later or so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, i called in and found out how to disable app notifications for specific apps. &nbsp;My only question now is ... can you make the notifications follow our favorites choices? That would be nice.</p>
<p>ALso, for the apps, do we get notifications only for the apps we are signed into?? &nbsp;because i think i am signed into the Sports app and the Flipboard app.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but that is not correct. &nbsp;I can turn off notifications for the Sports App. &nbsp;The correct statement is.. You cannot turn off specific notifications within sports app. &nbsp;You get all of them or none of them. &nbsp;WHat it should do is provide only notifications
 for the favorites you select, but it may work that way in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already provided feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what you are talking about when you say pending updates. &nbsp;I install whatever updates come in.</p>
<p>Sports app needs to add Philadelphia Phillies to favorite teams. That still doesnt work.</p>

<p>Found Corrupt files and unable to fix....that "could" be an issue.<br />
<br />
Since you have an Acer, I am assuming you do "not" have a Windows Vista Installation CD?&nbsp; Correct?, if you do, you can do a Inplace Upgrade - repair - on Vista....if you do not, you can still do the repair, but you'll need to get a Utility that will allow you
 to do this.&nbsp; See link below:<br />
<span><br />
Here is a link to download an ISO file to make a bootable disk, which will allow you to work on your Vista Operating System.<br />
<br />
Startup repair, system restore, etc.</span></p>

<br />
The steps listed below were taken from another Post where Support Engineers Posted how to do a Inplace Upgrade<br />
<strong><span>Repair Installation:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>You may reinstall your copy of Vista while keeping your files, settings, and programs by performing a
<strong>repair installation</strong> or an <strong>in-place </strong>upgrade with the following steps: (<strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span></span></strong>:
</span><span>&nbsp;This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need to do a clean installation if this is unsuccessful.)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&nbsp; &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; &gt;&lt;&nbsp; &gt;&lt;&nbsp; &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;&lt;&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please make sure you
<strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Backup</span></span></strong> any and all important data before proceeding. Please see:&nbsp;</span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/0625443e-f5c7-4bec-a5e3-3b7e00503c481033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>Methods
 for backing up your files</span></span></strong></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Always make sure you have&nbsp;the means&nbsp;to reinstall your programs, either through an install disk or having access to the installation files.</span></p>
<p><span>&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;&gt;&lt; &gt;&nbsp; &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Insert the Windows installation disc into your computer's DVD or CD drive. You must start Windows installation while running your existing version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the
<strong>Install Windows</strong> page, click <strong>Install now</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the
<strong>Get important updates for installation</strong> page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation and to help protect your computer against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get installation
 updates.</span></p>
<p><span>4. On the
<strong>Type your product key for activation</strong> page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid problems during activation.</span></p>
<p><span>5. On the
<strong>Please read the license terms</strong> page, if you accept the license terms, click
<strong>I accept the license terms</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. On the
<strong>Which type of installation do you want?</strong> page, click <strong>Upgrade</strong> to begin the upgrade. You might see a compatibility report.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Follow the instructions.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Note</span></span></strong><strong><span>:</span></strong><span>
 If your installation disk does not include <strong>SP1</strong>, and you are updated to it, then you will have to uninstall it before performing an upgrade install.
<strong>Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Programs -&gt; View installed updates</strong>, then select
<em>Service Pack for Microsoft Windows</em> and click <strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br />

<p>That sounds a bit unlikely. Yes, TWC are making changes, but they probably haven't affected you yet. Visit their help pages to find out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the
<em>Servers</em> tab, change the server addresses to read</p>
<p><strong>pop-server.berkshire.rr.com</strong></p>
<p>and</p>
<p><strong>smtp-server.berkshire.rr.com</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you've made the changes, compose and send a test message to yourself. Post any new error message in your reply.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks. Socket error 10061 indicates that the server actively refused to make a connection. Socket error 10060 simply means that no connection could be made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds as if you ought to try the TWC settings I referred to. I would in your shoes right-click on this non-working account and deselect
<em>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing</em>. Then press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the
<em>Add your email accounts wizard </em>and set up a new account using the TWC servers.</p>

<h2>            Is there any way to link xbox live account onto my Minecraft Mac account&#63;</h2>
                    I both own minecraft for the Mac and nintendo switch my friends have a realm made on the nintendo switch but i cant join them anymore due to a bug that wont allow me to connect my microsoft account on the switch. So i was wondering if there is a way to link
 my microsoft account on the mac so i can join the realm they have.

            HI, fellow Mac user here as well.... unfortunately the Mac version will not allow the linking of a Microsoft account. You would have to have the Windows 10 version on PC in order to do so. Sorry there wasn't a way for you to do this.

<p>Hey Deathlord, sorry to hear about the issues with RE:4--the game is a blast, and I'm hoping we can get you up and running (well, marching) shortly. That being said, I think the memory might be at play here. Could you try borrowing a friend's HDD, or using
 your profile on a friend's console with an official HDD, to see if that allows you to play the game?</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last month I bought SP4 and I am having problems with wi-fi. Regardless of the band, ping has constant spikes and random packets loss. This does not just happen in one location or one router. Any wifi connection has poor performance and it does not matter
 if I am sitting next to the router or in the room next door.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi MaciejO90,
<br />
<br />Could you please try running the Surface Diagnostics Toolkit, and let me know if it finds anything wrong with your network adapter. The toolkit will try to find and fix any problems. It can be downloaded from the following Microsoft website: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/4037239/surf...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can advise further.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

<p>It appears to be software related issue because the issue also affects USB wifi dongle. After performing the clean boot wifi is stable so now it's just a matter of identifying which service was causing the problem.</p>

<p>This also happened to me recently and appears to be the result of a "fix" to protect against the recent WannaCry ransomware attacks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I found was that some program (either Windows Update or maybe IObit Advanced Systemcare - not sure which one) added two rules to Windows Firewall to block Port 445. Those rules basically shut down file sharing. To restore file sharing you need to disable
 those firewall rules.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some fixes for WannaCry also remove the SMB Windows feature. This will not affect HomeGroup sharing, but it will disable the older Windows file sharing methods. So you can remove SMB as long as you do all sharing via HomeGroups.</p>

<p>Okay I had to redo my HomeGroup Sharing all over again after the Creators update.&nbsp; First you must make sure all computers are set to the correct network proxy.&nbsp; Then you choose one computer to be the master and leave it on.&nbsp; Shut all the other computers
 on your Network off.&nbsp; Once they are all off you have to start a homegroup.&nbsp; When you get the password DO NOT CHANGE IT you must first invite the other computers.&nbsp; Now you turn all of them back on and leave them on don't shut them off.&nbsp; Make sure they are all
 connected to the internet (this time I had trouble with one that is set up to connect both by an ethernet cord and wiifi - I had to shut off the wiifi before it would accept being part of the homegroup - of course i had to figure this out on my own with only
 a slight hint to what was wrong via the troubleshooter) using only one way (ethernet or wiifi) not both.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the Guide I used it is better than my blab:</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's just frustrating that I have to do this all over again.&nbsp; It would be nice if MS would work on making this easier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also there are going to be some people who will want to say, "Just connect using your Network."&nbsp; Dudes, that does not work unless you first get the HomeGroup to work.&nbsp; That option to connect to your Network above the Homegroup is useless since you have to
 set up the HomeGroup to get the Network to work.</p>

<p>I feel your pain. The last two updates have broken file sharing on my media server. Non-Windows devices will not connect to Windows 10. After spending nearly 8 hours after the Creator's Update fiasco, I finally determined that no matter what I did the file
 sharing was not going to work. Others agreed. A rollback was the only way to fix the issue. I have had to rollback the update twice now. Frustrated that Microsoft will not address this file sharing issue in Widows 10, I've had to disable the automatic updates
 to prevent Windows from breaking itself by updating to version 1709. </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS, Simply file sharing so that file sharing on a private network will not require one to edit the registry. Please! I beg you. Simplify. Thanks.</p>

<p>I read recently that Microsoft will be eliminating the Homegroup "feature". Just as well since it was breaking with every update. If you have all up-to-date Win10 PCs on your network then file sharing should be working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had an issue recently where my Sonos sound system could not access a folder share on my Win10 PC. That turned out to be the result of a Windows update removing the SMB 1.0 feature. That version of SMB is now considered insecure, but some devices (like
 the Sonos) and older Windows PC still need it to do file sharing. It's still in the Windows feature set so you can add it back in. Just hit the Start button and type "windows feature" and select "Turn Windows features on and off".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, if you have older versions of Windows on your network or have devices that use sharing, then make sure Port 445 is not blocked in Windows Firewall and make sure SMB 1.0 is turned ON.</p>

<p>Good recommendations but.. My sharing also broke on the last "Creators Update" and I haven't been able get it working despite the sage advice here and in a "Windows Ten Forums".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, Homegroup still works but I can't share the folders on my Windows10 machine with a legacy Windows Server 2005 machine (error message is "\\W10_BOX is not accessible. You might not have permission to use this resource. Contact the.. The network path
 was not found.") or with a Linux box (error message is "mount error (112) Host is down").
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unlikely to be the Firewall as the same errors occur when it is turned off (in Private, Domain and Public mode) and the "Allow" File share rules are active for both ports 139 and 445. As far as SMB 1.0, I DID need to activate the "Server" feature as
 the "Client" and "Automatic Removal (whatever THAT is)" features were already activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Windows10 box I can see and access the shares on my Windows Server box with no problem but from the latter I can only SEE the W10_BOX (in My Network Places -&gt; Microsoft Windows Network --&gt; MyWorkgroup).. when I try to access it, I get the above
 mentioned error. I also checked all share permissions and everything seems to be intact. Before "Creators", it asked me for an authorized user and PW.. now, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be much obliged if anyone has some additional insight.. a rollback is risky and I imagine a lot of work to do and maintain (I'm not even sure HOW to do it).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Nuff said.. another tremendous disappointment from Microsoft. Any takers?</p>

            I suggest uninstalling the "Automatic Removal..." feature. What it does is uninstall SMB 1.0 whenever Windows "thinks" that feature is no longer required. Reboot and check. It's possible that your Win10 box has already removed SMB 1.0. Your older server
 will probably need that protocol to access the Win10 box.

<p>Hi WDPS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for not getting back. I'd wanted to thank you immediately for a CORRECT answer but it didn't work out that way. Uninstalling the automatic removal had no tangible effect (except for the fact that the legacy box then did not even SEE the W10 box.. but
 that may have been due to the reboot.. so much nonsense). Now I have EVERYTHING activated in SMB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, after a "Network Reset" (¿sage? advice from another forum) which effectively broke EVERYTHING at first, after reconfiguring the network, I somehow managed to be able to SEE the W10 box from the legacy box.. BUT I had to redo all my W10 shares to
 be able to access them and there was/IS a ton of garbage in many permissions and I had to open up Public sharing to ALL??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't like opening everything (as I also connect to some other private VPNs), BUT the big boner is that now my W10 box can NOT see the legacy box.. and I just noticed that changing the Public "Network and Sharing" options to Turn OFF discovery also
 nucked my legacy box access.. but, here's the kicker, even turning it ON again in the W10 box, the explorer window I had open on the legacy box still has access although any new one does NOT now see the W10 box either.. answer REBOOT EVERYTHING UNTIL IT WORKS..
 but..</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's up with the Microsoft geniuses who you would suppose are monitoring this forum? Silence..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm waiting for some CORRECT AND COHERENT fixes to all this nonsense. I've spent WAY TOO MUCH time trying to solve these MICROSOFT INDUCED problems to BASIC FUNCTIONALITY. I'm LIMPING right now but at least I've been able to make ONE step forward.. that
 is, until the next reboot of whatever box..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.. but I need a REAL and PERMANENT solution.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear of your problems. As I recall this all started a couple of years ago when Microsoft began trying to make Windows networking more secure. It's now so secure that even authorized users can't access computers. Homegroup was their initial solution,
 but that breaks frequently as well so I gave up on it. I've heard that Microsoft is giving up on it too. I've also noticed that sharing settings that I make are often reset, which I think occurs after Windows updates. Very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SMB trick worked for me and allowed my Sonos system to access a share on a Win10 computer. However, that same computer is often not visible at all to other computers on the network even though the Sonos share continues to work. I think this has something
 to do with the designated network "browser" - a computer on the network designated to keep track of shares.</p>

<p>Thanks for your empathy.. "feeling my pain". Also, of course, thanks for your observations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I initially installed the W10 box in December 2016 and the setup and configuration of the shares were relatively problem free at the time.. Homegroup worked as far as needed (basically printer sharing with&nbsp; another W10 box and not much else), and my legacy
 boxes had the needed access (with only "Authorized User" permissions). It was only after the Creators update (which I put off as long as I could but finally did in December 2017) that my legacy sharing broke (from the legacy to the W10 box.. at first the W10
 box could see and access the legacy box) and now I've got a pretty big mess of permissions on my W10 box and now it refuses to see my remaining legacy box. I'm afraid to touch anything now since for 3 days of "fixes" it went from bad to worse before I was
 finally able to limp again and to tell the truth, I have no firm idea why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I correct in assuming that this forum is monitored by Microsoft? If so (or even if not), do you know of any way to get their attention?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my first MS-DOS PC in 1982 back when life was simple and have gone through dozens of boxes and Operating Systems since.. so I'm not a novice and have always been able to accomplish what I needed to. After XP/Windows Server 2000 (.NET or DUH!NET
 as I like to call it), Microsoft got so out of control that it's impossible to get reliable info about anything and it always gets worse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thanks again for your insights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: you mentioned that you "gave up on" Homegroup.. my question is.. how do you then share printers or files on a W10 box with ANOTHER W10 box without it?.. Let me guess.. you DON'T. I also could never get printer sharing working from my legacy box to my
 W10 box (local USB connected printer).. any ideas.. let me guess.. you CAN'T.</p>

<p>The key issue here seems to be with network browsing and the concept of the master browser - a computer on your network that is designated to keep track of all other computers and be a source of that list. That's what Microsoft appears to have abandoned
 when they dropped SMB v1. Here's a link that will take you deeper down the rabbit hole if you dare.&nbsp;This link is to an MS developer forum so you may have to create an account to get to it:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/bd0af6aa-51ec-477a-8c81-888a4e60bd94/master-browser-service-broken-after-creator-update?forum=win10itpronetworking</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using printer sharing. I think it still works because it was a share established before the problems started with browsing the network. Once a printer is in the Devices list it should remain and continue to work as long as share is not removed at the
 host end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this also applies to drive mappings, which is another way to get to files on a remote computer. The difference now is that you will have to enter the host and share name in a search to establish the mapping.&nbsp; You can map drives with File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both printer sharing and drive mapping can be done without SMB v1 if you're willing and able to enter the exact path to the host and share name.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>Uploaded on OneDrive is a dmp and msinfo file.&nbsp; I consistently get a hang on cold boot that the laptop eventually gets past on power off/on after one or two more tries.&nbsp; It works fine after that until next cold boot.&nbsp; I have swapped out hard drives and swapped
 out memory, but it still hangs the same.&nbsp; I updated BIOS from A18 to A19 and no improvement.&nbsp; I ran FurMark to test the GPU/video and TweakBit to update drivers and while it did update several drivers the problem persists with the same dmp messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>THREAD_STUCK_IN_DEVICE_DRIVER (ea)</p>
<p>The device driver is spinning in an infinite loop, most likely waiting for</p>
<p>hardware to become idle. This usually indicates problem with the hardware</p>
<p>itself or with the device driver programming the hardware incorrectly.</p>
<p>If the kernel debugger is connected and running when watchdog detects a</p>
<p>timeout condition then DbgBreakPoint() will be called instead of KeBugCheckEx()</p>
<p>and detailed message including bugcheck arguments will be printed to the</p>
<p>debugger. This way we can identify an offending thread, set breakpoints in it,</p>
<p>and hit go to return to the spinning code to debug it further. Because</p>
<p>KeBugCheckEx() is not called the .bugcheck directive will not return bugcheck</p>
<p>information in this case. The arguments are already printed out to the kernel</p>
<p>debugger. You can also retrieve them from a global variable via</p>
<p>"dd watchdog!g_WdBugCheckData l5" (use dq on NT64).</p>
<p>On MP machines (OS builds &lt;= 3790) it is possible to hit a timeout when the spinning thread is</p>
<p>interrupted by hardware interrupt and ISR or DPC routine is running at the time</p>
<p>of the bugcheck (this is because the timeout's work item can be delivered and</p>
<p>handled on the second CPU and the same time). If this is the case you will have</p>
<p>to look deeper at the offending thread's stack (e.g. using dds) to determine</p>
<p>spinning code which caused the timeout to occur.</p>
<p>Arguments:</p>

            To evaluate the BSOD please post logs for troubleshooting.<br />
<br />
Using administrative command prompt copy and paste this whole command.<br />
<br />
Make sure the default language is English so that the logs can be scanned and read.<br />
<br />

    <title>Significant CPU temp decrease after updating to Windows 10 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> milesbaughman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Significant CPU temp decrease after updating to Windows 10 1809</h2>
                    <p>Significant CPU temp decrease after updating to Windows 10 1809 today&nbsp;and my CPU temperatures&nbsp;have dropped significantly while idle. The increase started about 2ish months ago and I was baffled. Both my water cooled CPU &amp; GPU (AMD 8120 and GPU R9 290) were
 running hot. But the CPU was really running hot I mean 27c normal to about 45c regularly&nbsp;at idle and 50ish in games or running video. I have even had a few shutdowns due to heat. Never ever an issue before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this is new - and it seemed completely off. I check the water coolers, I checked what was running, everything seemed to point to the motherboard? I am diligent about software upgrades and drivers - so that was not it. I checked the computer thoroughly.
 There did seem to have been some weird&nbsp;conflict with Google Chrome and Windows with GPU usage (a known issue for a bit that seems to have been fixed by Google) a while back. But the CPU temp issue just kept getting worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well today after the update all this is back to normal. Now yes that&nbsp;is great. But what the heck Microsoft? What the heck did&nbsp;you guys have running or not running before this update? I am pretty computer savvy and it is clear that something inside windows
 back end was doing something that it shouldn't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again what is or was up? What was happening? Did anyone else notice&nbsp;this?&nbsp;</p>

                    <p><u><em>Original Title</em></u><strong>: Drop-downs keep scrolling to first position</strong></p>
<p>Anytime there is a drop down involved or anytime there is more to a list than what can be seen on the screen, something is causing the list to scroll back to the first position.&nbsp; It also happens on anything that uses a mouse to move a bar sideways, using
 keyboard does not help, it just returns to begining.&nbsp; Please, someone let me know how to fix this, I cannot get anything done as a lot of what I do has lists in dropdowns.</p>

<h2>            DRM won&#39;t play on Windows Media Player</h2>
                    <p>For years now, I've been downloading audio books (WMA) from Overdrive and listening to them on my computer.&nbsp; The DRM has never been an issue.&nbsp; Now suddenly it is.&nbsp; Everytime I try to play any protected file, I get the "Windows Media Player has encountered
 a problem while playing this file."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've scanned this forum and others.&nbsp; I've carefully and repeatedly followed the directions
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-sound/windows-media-player-encountered-a-problem-while/9c756c53-d337-4850-b78a-20afacfaa1b3?tm=1330819306732">
here</a>.&nbsp; I've used ResetDRM (again, repeatedly).&nbsp; And the result is always the same.&nbsp; I can play video files, mp3s and unprotected wma files to my heart's content.&nbsp; No problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;But DRM won't work.&nbsp; After I run ResetDRM, WMP tells me it needs to upgrade it
 software in order to play a DRM file.&nbsp; It does so.&nbsp; And then I get the SAME error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm at a loss.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?&nbsp; Please?</p>

    <title>Win10 PC slows down after clearing registery - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davisyang  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 PC slows down after clearing registery</h2>
                    <p>So I used CCleaner to clear&nbsp;my registry and despite solving my apps compatibility issue, it significantly worsens my laptop's performance:</p>
<p>-PC slows down in every way</p>
<p>-FPS much lower than before in multiple games</p>
<p>-Browsers and Solidworks loads much slower as well</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The registry&nbsp;restoration was not successful through CCleaner, so I attempted the following (basically all the tips I could gather from the internet):</p>
<p>-reinstalled win10 without preserving data and apps</p>
<p>-restore and reinstall</p>
<p>-upgraded Graphic, CPU, Network drivers</p>
<p>-Windows upgrade</p>
<p>-defragmentation and clean up</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is running smoother now, but not on par with its pre-registry-cleaning level. Also, performance issue in apps, especially in video games, are not improved at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Running Resource and Performance monitor shows that level of all 5 aspects including CPU, Graphics etc, is low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sfc/scannow command&nbsp;returns no error in the&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running a Dell XPS 15 9550, Win 10 Family Version Single Language (Chinese)</p>
<p>My rig is Geforce GTX 960M, Intel Core i7-6700HQ CPU @2.6GHZ, 16G RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am desperate and will appreciate any form of help. If any report &nbsp;is needed I will post here.</p>

<p>Windows 10 doesn't need any maintenance like that because it's built in and runs in the background.&nbsp; You'll only risk problems if you mess with the registry at all.&nbsp;

<span>Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause problems. If they always caused problems, they would disappear from the market almost immediately.
 Many people have used a registry cleaner and never had a problem with it.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it the substantial *risk* of having a problem. And since there is no benefit to using a registry cleaner, running that risk is a very bad bargain.</span></div>

<h2>            Vista&#58; Windows Update error 0x80070005</h2>
                    <p>Yes, this problem again... "Windows Update cannot currently check for updates..."<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OS = <strong>Vista Ultimate 32bit</strong> SP1 + all detected updates up to 4th Jan 2015</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (including the update to Update, and <strong>SP2</strong>)<br />
</p>
<p>Last update: information no longer available due to attempts to resolve this problem.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This was a fresh installation on a new hard disk (the fourth on this PC!), following failure of the old one.<br />
</p>
<p>Update was working OK until installation of driver updates and Comodo anti-virus.<br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not check that Update was still working at every stage of driver/AV installation, as the last check had revealed no Updates pending.<br />
</p>
<p>Hindsight is a wonderful thing.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>This problem also occurred with the previous installation, 2 years ago, but I forgot that I hadn't tried to resolve it. Hence Update was not working all that time!</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>That previous installation used the same drivers, but a different anti-virus package (Avast!), which suggests that it is a driver installation issue rather than the AV program.</em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OK. I have been trying solutions for several days now.<br />
</p>
<p>-- I have run three different FixIt programs, several times: MicrosoftFixit.wu.Run.exe, MicrosoftFixit.wu.LB.Run.exe, MicrosoftFixit.wu.MATSKB.Run.exe<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">always as Administrator, from an Administrator-level account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">(I can provide the URLs to the Answer pages if required.)<br />
</p>
<p>In all cases the results were as follows, and Update still didn't work:<br />

</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In some instances I remembered to turn off Comodo's AntiVirus and Auto-Sandbox activity, but at other times Comodo required me to allow full access for the Windows program doing the checking (which I did).<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-- I have checked that the three <strong>Services </strong>(Windows Update, BITS, Cryptographic Services) are running (see
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_update/windows-vista-windows-update-not-working-because/b1f5d182-a052-4ff4-b79f-33075b56fecd?auth=1" title="Windows Vista windows update not working! because the service is not running. You may need to restart your computer">
this question</a> from 2012)<br />
</p>
<p>The nomenclature is slightly different, but the three services are all marked as 'Started'.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-- I have created 'reset.bat' to use <strong>subinacl </strong>to reset the administrator and system access permissions (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_update/window-update-error-windowsupdate80070005/a9a2c92d-793b-4050-bdb1-720bb97bd78d" title="Window update error">described
 here</a>).<br />
</p>
<p>During this process I noticed an error reported.<br />
</p>
<p>I created a modified form of reset.bat that output the logging to eight different text files (total of about 770MB ASCII!)<br />
</p>
<p>This revealed an error:<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(153, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Perflib\009 - RegSetKeySecurity Error : 6 The handle is invalid.</span></strong></span><br />
</p>
<p>I don't know whether this is the problem with Update, nor how to investigate it.<br />
</p>
<p>Comparing with my Windows 7 Laptop, there is a second subkey ( <span>Perflib\CurrentLanguage</span>) which is not present on the Vista machine.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Because it takes nearly a day to install the OS and 300+ updates, I really don't want to start again if this can be avoided.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Help, please?<br />

            <p>Hi PA Bear</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply. Short and long answers below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>1. How long...?</em></p>
<p><strong>6-12 hours</strong></p>
<p>It took a good 6 hours to download and install all of the updates!</p>
<p>The browsers and Comodo were installed later the same evening.</p>
<p>The default Windows tools (Defender/Firewall) were running from installation time.</p>
<p>The PC was connected through a broadband modem, which would have been providing a degree of protection as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>2. Which first...?</em></p>
<p><strong>"b" -- updates before AV</strong></p>
<p>2.1) All Windows updates first -- just running Windows Update over and over.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The OS disk included SP1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SP2 and IE9 were installed during update.</p>
<p>2.2) Next stage was to use IE9 to download Firefox.</p>
<p>2.3) Firefox was installed and used to download Chrome, Opera and Comodo Dragon, which were then installed in that order. Firefox used exclusively thereafter.</p>
<p>2.4) Researched Firewall Software to see if Windows Firewall was now good enough.</p>
<p>Conclusion it IS up to the job, but that Comodo Internet Suite (CIS) would provide enhanced protection: better Firewall AND Anti-Virus AND Anti-malware.</p>
<p>2.5) Followed a lengthy installation procedure for CIS which included a pre-check that the PC was clean, namely: downloading and running Kaspersky TDSSKiller (to check for Rootkits) and then Comodo Cleaning Essentials (to look for anything else).</p>
<p>Since then the CIS Firewall/AV has been running almost continuously. (Only disabled for a short period while trying some of the Update tasks).</p>
<p>2.6) Check for driver updates, download / install drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>3. Free trials...?</em></p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>The PC <em>was</em> originally supplied with MacAfee, and this was used for the first year, but PC has had three replacement hard disks since then and MacAfee was never re-installed.</p>
<p>The Vista Installation disk was provided by my office IT department, as the PC was not supplied with one. It only contains the OS and perhaps some DELL-specific drivers. Certainly no other AV packages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
        </p>

<p>Answer-by-number, preferably without quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Does the computer belong to you or your employer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Does the disc say <strong>Dell </strong>and/or <strong>Recovery </strong>on the label?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Did you scan any data backups with at least two (2) reputable online scanners (e.g., ESET; Kaspersky; Bitdefender) before you restored the data to the HDD?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[You should have gotten your anti-virus application installed first. Note that Windows Defender provides no realtime
<em>anti-virus</em> protection.]</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>2. It is an ISO-image copy of a (re-)installation DVD for DELL PCs.</strong></p>
<p>The company exclusively used XP, to support legacy software, some of which was also dependent on IE6. New PCs came with Vista installed. My own PC also came with Vista installed, but no installation disk was provided.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. No,</strong> <strong>no online scans.</strong></p>
<p>The old hard disk is still accessible, but will not boot Windows fully.</p>
<p>I have it connected as a D: drive, and I am copying data across as needed.</p>
<p>I was using Avast! Anti-Virus on it previously, so had not anticipated any need for further checks.</p>

<p>Not yet installed for Firefox, Chrome, etc ...yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7. Yes</strong></p>
<p>I note in OP that I had run three versions of the Windows Update Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>This was a fourth version. Your linked page indicates that it is for Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran it and the reported 'Fix Status' was similar to that shown in my first post, but note:</p>
<p>-- the Windows Update error 0x80070005 is marked as FIXED</p>
<p>-- the 'Problems installing recent updates' is still marked as Not Fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While running, the FixIt displays a message:</p>
<p><em>"Restart your PC</em></p>
<p><em>Changes have been made and you need to restart your PC.</em></p>
<p><em>Please save your work and restart your PC after the troubleshooter finishes."</em></p>
<p>The only way to stop the Troubleshooter is to press the 'Cancel' button, or close the window.</p>
<p>I am assuming that the changes will have already been applied and 'Cancel' means 'Close'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run it several times. Mostly I have selected 'fix automatically'.</p>
<p>Sometimes the 'Windows Update error 0x80070005' is marked as NOT fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried a 'fix manually', and then cancelled it after the first "Restart required" message is displayed. I rebooted, checked Update (still not working), then ran the Troubleshooter again.</p>
<p>This time it only detected 3 errors, and all were reported as fixed.</p>
However, rebooting and checking Update showed that the original problem was still there.

            <p>Let's make sure&nbsp;any Norton or McAfee free-trialware included on&nbsp;Dell disc has been fully-removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You may want to print these instructions for offline reference. DON'T SKIP ANY STEP! If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em> ] </strong></p>

</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3a. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1a above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the Norton utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3b. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1b above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the McAfee utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot again.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your continuing help, but I need some urgent, quick advice, please.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have started working through the steps.<br />
</p>
<p>I am currently on Step 3a (removal of Norton).<br />
</p>
At time of this posting it has now been about an hour and a half since I started the utility.
<p>Some time ago, the screen went black, but the hard disk light is still flickering, so I presume the PC is still working...
<br />
</p>
<p><em>(NB - it is NOT simply powersave as the monitors came back on</em><em> when I moved the mouse</em><em>, showing nothing.)</em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>I did not hear Comodo sound an alert to say it had trapped an unrecognised process, and I would have expected it to have alerted soon after the utility started if it was going to.</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>I was not watching when the screen went blank, so I don't know what state the utility was in.</em><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With a 1 TeraByte hard disk (80% unused), should I expect the utility to take this long, or has it gone wrong?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>How will the utility behave if there has never been any known presence of Norton anywhere near the computer?<br />
</p>
<br />
<p>Am I being impatient? or do I need to "simulate a power outage" to stop it?<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>============<br />
</p>
<p>Update: after several hours, gave up waiting and simulated a power failure. PC appeared to boot OK. Continued following instructions. Report to follow shortly.

</p><p><strong>5 </strong>- Re-assert IE as Default Browser<strong> -- FAILED -- APPLIED MANUALLY USING BROWSER SETTINGS</strong></p>
<p>I followed the instructions, but the change would not 'stick'.</p>
<p>When I opened the page to check the setting, it had been reset to 'Use Current Browser'.</p>
<p>I tried this several times (eg by disabling Comodo Auto-Sandbox) without success.</p>
<p>Instead I configured this manually (started Firefox, unchecked 'set as default browser', closed it,&nbsp;opened IE,&nbsp;selected 'Set as Default').</p>
<p>Thereafter I only used IE9 for the remaining tasks.</p>

<p>Windows Update 'Check for Updates' still launches popup saying service is not running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating.</p>
<p>Is there no version of Windows Update with debug output enabled that can give a clue where it is getting upset?</p>

            <p>[These forums were down for maintenance from 18:00 UTC, 09 Jan-15 to 08:00 UTC, 10 Jan-15 (and they're still somewhat "buggy"), hence the tardy reply.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could be seeing the effects of an ongoing malware infection, possibly due to the computer being connected to the internet for "6-12 hours" without an anti-virus application installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OPTION A:</strong> No guarantees but you could download &amp; scan with a suite of anti-malware scanners (e.g., AdwCleaner; Junkware Removal Tool; MalwareBytes Anti-Malware; HitmanPro).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OPTION B:</strong> For all the time Option A will take you, it'd be more efficient to format the HDD &amp; then do another clean install of Windows. This time around, get the anti-virus application (e.g.,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/security-essentials-product-information#tabs1=features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> - free) installed within seconds of connecting the computer to the internet &amp; before you install any updates or restore any data backups to the HDD.</p>

            <p><em>[That maintenance came at a very unfortunate time!</em></p>
<p><em>The warning message no longer appeared once maintenance had started, and I hadn't converted the stated times from PDT to GMT...]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It <em>might</em> be a malware infection, well-hidden and targeted at Windows Update...</p>
<p>...or it might be something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option B was already on my mind: a case of 'cutting my losses'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately it's already taken a week to try to avoid another 6 hours of Vista Updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time I will have the AV code ready on Flashstick, to load off-line, and will watch for problems with Windows Update as I install the drivers, to see if I can see where it goes wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, many thanks for your time, and I hope I won't have to come back for a second attempt!</p>
