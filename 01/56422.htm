<h2>            Windows 7 HP laptop Intel USB enhanced host controller 3B34 device driver problem on boot up</h2>
                    Have new HP DV8 Laptop with Windows 7 Professional and recently experienced problem with the subject device driver.&nbsp; Windows 7 will not load the Intel 5 series/3400 series chipset family USB enhanced host controller - 3B34 device driver and thus my fingerprint
 scanner, bluetooth wireless doesn't work&nbsp;and most of my USB ports are not operable on log in.&nbsp; When I log in I go to troubleshooter in control panel, select add hardware device and it checks for problems.&nbsp; Message comes back that windows did not load the driver
 and offers to load the driver to fix the problem.&nbsp; After this all the items mentioned above&nbsp;start to work.&nbsp; This is problem since I can't use the fingerprint reader to log on computer. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; have tried to search for solution online
 and can't find one.

    <title>MS Edge and WIndows 10 SUCKS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nancy and jerry  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Edge and WIndows 10 SUCKS</h2>
                    Not only does MS Edge not open certain site but when you go to use a different browser it is slow and sometimes not working. MS is forcing us to use an inferior product. The printing portion is beyond words. There is no way you can print the selection
 of something. Where are the person's brains who invented this? He should be fired. You can tell he/she never had any experience with working in an office. I am very disappointed with Microsoft. Each time they come up with a new version, it is worse than the
 one before it. UGH I am not buying MS products again. This does it for me!!!! Waste of money and my time also!!

<p>Microsoft will do something against windows 7 soon you can possible imagine&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe they already doing that..!!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&amp;qpcustomd=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">and HERE IS WHY..!!!</a></p>
<p>Windows 7 must die..!!</p>
<p>because <strong>RIGHT NOW</strong> Windows 7 is the only operating system&nbsp;</p>
<p>that is holding back windows 10</p>
<p>so I will very very careful to the future windows updates </p>
<p>for windows 7 coming from microsoft&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I personally don't wait for microsoft to drop the support for windows 7 in 2020</p>
<p>because is pretty damn obvious that there is nothing </p>
<p>positive microsoft could possible do for windows 7 anymore</p>
<p>everything it takes to make windows 7 become a very bad operating system is a bad update or worst.!!</p>
<p>so I already turn off my windows update and I'm running third party security software just in case..!!!</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>The Microsoft support for Windows 7 ended in July 29-2015</p>
<p>now we can join the Windows XP users &nbsp;for the Last Stand</p>
<p>and they're doing a pretty damn good job..!!!</p>

            Microsoft will do all it can to poison Windows 7 with "security" updates. And I hear Microsoft are going to get Very Aggressive in 2016 with Windows 7 users to get them to update to Windows 10. Like putting Full screen notices on your screen when you boot
 your PC. And popups while your using your PC !

<p>if anything happen to my computer&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no problems to live my life without a computer</p>
<p>I done that for many years .!!</p>
<p>I don't even have a mobile phone because I hate those kind of devices</p>
<p>so a computer for me is just a hobby and is not a necessity..!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>HOWEVER..!!!</p>
<p>It's funny because I was planning to build a gaming rig next year</p>
<p>but I totally suspended that project after realize all the **** microsoft is doing</p>
<p>because we spend ton of money and dedicate a lot of our time </p>
<p>to build and provider maintenance to our computers</p>
<p>for then let people like microsoft to screw everything up with their obsession to control everything?!!?</p>
<p>no freaking way and fk that</p>
<p>and then they have the nerve to cry because the desktop industry is dying..!!!</p>

<p>Large business's with internal information security capabilities have ALL opted out of windows ten. It is rife with built in engines designed to gather and disperse information. Which means it is basically a engine built to hack our information. That is
 what is was designed for, from front to back.</p>
<p>We should emulate these high dollar companies, stick with windows seven. There are shops on every corner that have experts on windows seven. If you have or can get 7, just do it, use any browser other that the built to be invasive Edge.
</p>
<p>If the shop suggests you use windows ten, just leave, find another one with someone who actually understands the product they are selling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do anything you can to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>avoid</strong></em></span> windows 10 and
<em><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">especially edge</span></strong></em>. Unless you like Robocalls at 2 AM.</p>
<p>Microsoft has lost it's privileges to sell product by making products that are merely tools for gathering and then selling EVERYTHING that goes through your PC. Everything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who would have thought that a company would find value in knowing what kind of slipper we bought on amazon, and the suddenly we start getting mail everyone from LL Bean to Macy's.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would suggest the alternative, that someone who refuses to sell the latest technology should be avoided as they are out of date and a greater security risk.</p>

<p>Every time I start up my laptop I get this notification. It used to say 'A device attached to your system is not functioning' but now it changed to this. I cannot access the WindowsApps file and I wouldn't know what to do if I'd gain access to it because
 I don't understand what this notification means. Does anyone know how to fix this?</p>

    <title>Peer Name Resolution Protocol and Peer Network Grouping Service errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> highstream  say:</h3>
<h2>            Peer Name Resolution Protocol and Peer Network Grouping Service errors</h2>
                    I was taking a look at the Win 7/64 Events log during startup and just after, and noticed under Administrative Events a slew of PNRP and related errors, as well as a few under System Events. &nbsp;I'd like to understand why, as I didn't see at least the latter
 under Win 7/32 (I upgraded to the 64-bit version last week). &nbsp;I'm still new to Win 7, but from what I can tell these are related to a Homegroup, which Win 7 says I belong to although this is a single desktop home system, with a laptop that I use as a standalone
 (no wireless printing or any connection to the desktop). &nbsp;There is a wireless router, which the laptop uses and which the desktop is connected to the local cable company through its modem and the router. &nbsp;Does that de facto make it a Homegroup, and the laptop
 being off causing the Event errors? &nbsp;I did a bit of a search online, but that didn't really clarify anything. &nbsp;Any pointers as to what's going on and where to read more appreciated. &nbsp;Thank
                </div>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>Troubleshooting connection problems can be a challenge because there are so many possible causes. If your computer is having problems connecting to the Internet, or to other computers on a network, try using one of the networking troubleshooters to fix
 the problem.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Open networking troubleshooters</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-networking-troubleshooters</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Let’s follow the below steps to enable IPv6:</div>
<div>1) Right click on the network icon and select ‘Open Network and Sharing Center’.<br />
2)&nbsp; In the resulting window, select Change adapter settings.<br />
3)&nbsp; In the Network Connections window, select Local Area Connection for the onboard NIC [Network Interface Card], then Change settings of this connection or file&gt;properties.<br />
4) In the connection property page, check the box for Internet Protocol Version 6 (TCP/IPv6).<br />
5) Close all the windows and reboot your system.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>If the above method doesn’t fix your issue, we might have to enable each and every service that is dependent on Home group that includes the service that is dependent on ‘Peer Networking Group’ and ‘PNRP Machine Name Publication Service’.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step1:</strong>Let’s first start the ‘Homegroup Provider’ service and check if you get any error message.</div>
<div>‘Homegroup Provider’ service depends on the following system components. Go to each of the inter-related service and try to start them.</div>
<div>1. Function Discovery Provider Host.<br />
a. HTTP<br />
b. Remote Procedure Call.<br />
2. Function Discovery Resource Publication<br />
a. HTTP<br />
b. Remote Procedure Call.</div>
<div>3. Network List Service.<br />
a. Network Location Awareness<br />
b. Remote Procedure Call.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step2: </strong>Peer Networking Group’ and ‘PNRP Machine Name Publication Service’ depends on the below components, try to start them first and then check for the issue:</div>
<div>1. Peer Name Resolution Protocol<br />
2. Peer Networking Identity Manager</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>As a work around you may try the following steps and check if that works fine:</div>
<div>Try deleting the file “idstore.sst” under the location: C:\windows\serviceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking.</div>

            <p>Naman R, your reply is not helpful. &nbsp;What problem are you trying to help me solve?</p>
<p>I'm not aware of any connection problems, so I'm not sure what I it is I'd be correcting with your solutions. That's why I asked about my setup, what makes it a Homegroup and why in that context I could be seeing Peer Networking issues. &nbsp;You didn't speak
 to those matters at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, following Method 1, IPV6 was already checked. &nbsp;Method 3 had no effect on the Events log upon reboot. &nbsp;</p>

            I found that soon after I uninstalled Cisco Direct from my desktop computer the error messages related to Peer Networking disappeared from Administrative Events. &nbsp;There are still other types in each session, especially related to search but not those.
 &nbsp;OTOH, I had to go back 4 days to find a system error.

            Hello highstream,
<div><br />
<div>This article may be helpful for further understanding the event log viewer tool and what information commonly shows up in there:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div>It is possible that if you have security software installed, it may be causing some of the errors that you're seeing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have you attempted to uninstall any other software to see if that stops the errors?</div>

            <p>Rob, That page wasn't anything new to me, but worth checking, thanks. I'm hesitant to start uninstalling security software unless I know what follows from doing so. &nbsp;That is to say, if there is a problem associated with MSE or Comodo firewall or SAS Pro,
 then what? &nbsp;I have had an *occasional* freeze at the end of a cold computer start up, but that's about it. &nbsp;For example, the freeze just occurred on cold start up. &nbsp;There were no System, Application or Security errors, but there were the following in Administrative
 Events, in chronological order:</p>
<p>- (Error) Event 3, Kernal-Event Tracing - Session "Microsoft Security Client OOBE" stopped due to the following error: 0xC000000D</p>
<p>- (Warning x 2) Event 4006, Winlogon - The Windows logon process has failed to spawn a user application. Application name: . Command line parameters: "C:\Program Files\Soluto\soluto.exe /userinit".</p>
<p>- (Error x 2) Event 315, PrintService - The print spooler failed to share printer Canon MP640 series Printer with shared resource name Canon MP640 series Printer. Error 2114. The printer cannot be used by others on the network.</p>
<p>- (Warning) (Winit Event ID 11) - Custom dynamic link libraries are being loaded for every application. The system administrator should review the list of libraries to ensure they are related to trusted applications. (6:09:21pm)</p>
<p>Manual shut down at 6:10:07pm.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>So, three errors and three warnings. &nbsp;Any thoughts? &nbsp; It may be the Admin Events errors and freeze are unrelated. &nbsp;For instance, Mailwasher Pro opens on start up and it uses .NET. &nbsp;That could be causing the freeze. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Btw, on rebooting, there was one more error that's commonly there (which the freeze preempted):</p>
<p>(Error) Event 2004, PerfNet - Unable to open the Server service performance object. The first four bytes (DWORD) of the Data section contains the status code.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
        </p>

            Hello again,
<div><br />
<div>I will attempt to analyze each specific error you are receiving one-by-one. I would still advise removing some of your security software to see if conflicts are eliminated.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><span><b>- (Error) Event 3, Kernal-Event Tracing
</b>- Session "Microsoft Security Client OOBE" stopped due to the following error: 0xC000000D</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>This error is being caused by&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Security&nbsp;</span>Essentials. I would suggest uninstalling it temporarily and then re-installing. If you encounter any issues with the uninstall,
 please refer to this article and run the FixIt tool:</div>
<div><br />

<div><br />
<div><span><b>- (Warning x 2) Event 4006, Winlogon</b> - The Windows logon process has failed to spawn a user application. Application name: . Command line parameters: "C:\Program Files\Soluto\soluto.exe
 /userinit".</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>For this issue, I have seen many people have luck with performing a repair installation of Windows. However I would remove some of your security software packages before-hand to
 see if it is needed.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>

 The printer cannot be used by others on the network.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>This issue is related to an issue with your printer drivers.
<a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/printers_multifunction/pixma_mp_series/pixma_mp640#DriversAndSoftware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Try re-installing them.</a></span></div>

</span></div>
<div>I would suggest looking at this TechNet thread that addresses this specific error:</div>
<div><br />

            Thanks for the detailed reply. &nbsp;As a first step, I disabled soluto and that eliminated all but two errors and one warning: Kernal-Event Tracing (ID 3) and Print Service for each printer, plus the Winit warning. &nbsp;I had already just reinstalled MSE, so I'm
 not sure there. &nbsp;That thread you cited started with freezing and undesired rebooting and then seemed all over the place. &nbsp;So I'll play with SAS Pro and Comodo and the printer drivers to see. &nbsp;

            <p>I got rid of the Print Service errors and now have only the two: 1) Kernal Event Tracing and 2) Event 2004, PerfNet , and two warnings:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Winit Event ID 11 &nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Event 3036, Search</p>

However, step 3 works</p>
<p>

<div>As a work around you may try the following steps and check if that works fine:</div>

<p>Try deleting the file “idstore.sst” under the location: C:\windows\serviceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking.</p>

<p><span>Hi Bones77,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What happens when you try to login with Internet Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might check if any change has been made in the connection settings within the Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>To check that:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to Tools.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select internet Options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Go to the Connection tab, click on LAN setting.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check if any proxy setting has been changed in there.
</span></p>
<p><span>If anything has been changed set it back to original settings and check if your issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that does not resolve the issue try troubleshooting the Network Adapter from Network and Sharing Center.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, </span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<strong>Control Panel</strong></span><span>‌</span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span><span>In the search box, type
</span><strong>troubleshooter</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>, click <strong>Network and Internet</strong>, and then click the type of problem you are experiencing.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />

<h2>            0xDDD100F</h2>
                    
<p>I can't download activeX for checking if my Window xp is genuineI'm having trouble re-validating XP. The ActiveX info bar doesn't show up on the top of the page.&nbsp; It shows as Genuine, but when I try to validate to be able to use Microsoft update. I seem
 to get stuck in a "validation loop". Here's what I get when I try to validate:</p>
<p>[ Support ID: 0x8DDD100F ]</p>
<p>To get updates, you must first validate your Windows software. Validation assures that you are using an authentic a<br />
and fully licensed copy of Windows.</p>
<p>I choose "yes" then press "continue" then I receive this message:</p>
<p>The validation process cannot continue because your web browser is not configured to run the components required by the genuine validation process. The following will help you fix this problem and continue with validation.</p>
<p><br />
AT the bottom of the page I hit "Validate Now" and here is the message that I receive:</p>
<p>Validation Complete! Thank you for completing the validation process and for using genuine Microsoft software.<br />
By using genuine Microsoft software, you can be confident that you will have access to the latest features, security, and support, which will help to improve your productivity and expand the capabilities of your computer.<br />
You will also have access to new innovations and offerings available only to genuine Microsoft software customers.</p>
<p>When I go back to the Microsoft update page I get the "Validate my software" message again.&nbsp; I'll go through the same validation process again and again, but still can't use the Microsoft update page.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your help,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please answer <strong>all of the following diagnostic questions</strong> by number in your next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Are you running WinXP SP2 or SP3?</p>
<p>2. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>3. Has a(nother) Norton or McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton or McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i just had a upgrade from 32 bit windows 7 to 64 bit windows 8.1 (my processor supports it), and
<br />
installed Photoshop cc.</p>
<p>when i start editing and open(click) a option such as collor range, or <br />
content aware delete, then my photoshop just freezes, and crashes. compatibility <br />
mode&nbsp;on windows&nbsp;doesn't work either. i tried the 32, and the 64 bit version&nbsp;of <br />
photoshop, but they both freeze. on windows 7 it worked just fine.</p>
<p>about my PC:</p>
<p>4 GB ram</p>
<p>Intel Pentium 1.8 ghz.</p>

            Most likely you need a new version of Photoshop for win 8.1. Visit the Adobe site to see if there is an update. The Windows Compatibility Center is<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/CompatCenter/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;HERE</a>&nbsp;to look up your
 version. You need version 7 or higher for win 8. You should always use the 32 bit version of software.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Jan, that should be no problem <br />
<br />
MSI laptops have an extra utility called SCM and the webcam is usually turned off from there
<br />
<br />
Right click the icon indicated as 1. in the image below and choose Control Panel <br />
<br />
Then click 2 to enable your Webcam . ..<br />

    <title>Computer not assigning itself IPv4 address after startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fia webmistresswebmistress  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer not assigning itself IPv4 address after startup</h2>
                    <p>This is a rather fustrating problem I've been dealing with as of the last few weeks.&nbsp; I somewhat have a solution, but it is not one I can continue to do for several days at a time.&nbsp; What is happening is I am getting the error "Wi-Fi doesn't have a valid
 IP configuration".&nbsp; I've had windows10 for quite a while, and I know many people had this problem when they first got win10, but none of the solutions I've found on the internet have fixed my problem. (example of most common troubleshooting I am finding: https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/wifi-doesnt-have-a-valid-ip-configuration-on-windows-10-solved/).&nbsp;
 Below are the most key points to my current experience with this error.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The problem exists only on one computer, not on any other computer running windows10 or any other opperating system.&nbsp; Desktops, all in ones, laptops, smartphones, tablets, gaming systems, all of them still connect to the internet with absolutely no problems</li><li>The affected computer can still connect to the home network without any issues.&nbsp; It logs in fine, detects and communicates with other computers, but cannot obtain internet access.</li><li>The problem exists both on wifi AND ethernet.&nbsp; Plugging the computer directly to the modem exhibits the exact same behavior</li><li>Resetting the modem and the router does not correct the problem</li><li>Consolting the router shows my computer as having an unknown IP adress.&nbsp; Further consolting the effected computer's properties shows no info assigned for IPv4.&nbsp; What is shown is as follows:</li></ul>
<p>SSID: (private info)</p>
<p>Protocol: 802.11n</p>
<p>Security type: WPA2-Personal</p>
<p>Network Band: 2.4GHz</p>
<p>Network channel: 4</p>
<p>IPV6: DNS servers: fec0:0:0:fff:1%1&nbsp; (following 2 other entries, with 1% changed to 2% and 3%)</p>
<p>Manufacturer: Qualcom Communications Inc&gt;</p>
<p>Description: Qualcom Atheros QCA61x4A Wireless network Adaptor</p>
<p>Driver Version: 4.0.0.262</p>
<p>Physical address (MAC): (will provide if needed)</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Manually assigning an IPv4 address either does not fix the problem or I am unsure of what is the correct info to assign for my computer</li><li>my computer's drivers are fully up to date as of the time of this message</li><li>I have uninstalled and reinstalled programs attempting to diagnose if any of these are the problem, none seem to be at fault, nor can I identify any program or windows update occuring that might be responsible for the trouble (though if windows is doing
 more stealth updates I may be unaware of them)</li><li>Notably uninstalling and resinstalling Steam (game client) and prevenging auto-startup of the program allowed uninhibited internet access for 3 days, but the problem has returned again.&nbsp; Steam has had no updates since the uninstall, nor has its settings
 changed.</li><li>Performing a system restore WILL restore internet access</li></ul>
<p>There-in hits the most unusual nature of this problem - with no other adjustments to the computer, activating the system restore thus far has fixed the problem.&nbsp; I've begun resorting to implementing a manual restore point to my computer any time I make adjustments
 to the computer or a program, and that restores my internet once I revert to one of these points.&nbsp; However this is a long process and absolutely not something I can continue to do every day I need to use my computer, especialy when I am waking up early in
 the morning and need my computer before work.&nbsp; Everything on my end points back to that IPv4 address that the computer is somehow losing the ability to assign for itself, and that my internet cannot provide access to without it.&nbsp; How can we fix this problem?</p>

            Wonderful.&nbsp; After typing this subject while doing the latest restore, internet access did not restore itself.&nbsp; After testing multiple restore points I was finally able to obtain cooperation, but it further illustrates that I can't continue to use this
 as a solution, I need to fix the problem.

 the commands right now it would come up all correct.&nbsp; I am looking for someone who has experience with this issue that can provide further troubleshooting that has not been tested yet, or explain what is happening.

</p><p>You can also go to your network adapter settings or in device manager and delete all the drivers or just delete the network adapters, restart PC, it will detect and reinstall all network adapter drivers. restart PC again. Then do the above step rebooting

<p>
</p><p>Next, happens with Wi-Fi and Ethernet. Also beside checking the IPV4 for Ethernet, check your wireless adapter properties. Make sure one or both&nbsp;is not set to Static and on Automatic in IPV4 and IPV6&nbsp;property settings (5)</p>
<p>Open modem settings and maybe delete old devices connected in past. Some IP providers will only allow you so many devices at a time or in a lifetime.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>1) It's rude to only read part of the info and assume you know what the problem is and then offer support that has already been addressed, which wastes both our times.&nbsp;sadly this is expected results, and why I hesitated so many weeks to come to a forum in
 the first place. My reason for coming here isn't for random guesses, it's for someone to read the topic, realize they've seen this particular situation before and offer suggestion based&nbsp;on that experience that hasn't been tried yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&amp;5) Yes, that's how as the title says, I know I'm not getting an IPv4 address assigned to my computer, addressed in bullet 5 and 6, though I suppose I need to be more specific in saying it was originally automatic then I troubleshooted manually assigning
 it, if that was not clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Addressed in bullet 7, all drivers are up to date, again&nbsp;I guess needs to be more specific that no errors were spotted when I checked them for most recent driver.&nbsp; What I did fail to specify was that I did delete and reinstall the drivers, but that was
 listed on the troubleshooting html that I liked as having done all of that already</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Bullet 8, this means no update occurred unless ninja updated by windows without user knowledge or permission, as they love to do lately</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) This one I did fail to mention, done as part of troubleshooting from another source.&nbsp; My modem allows for unlimited connections and I have already purged old computers.&nbsp; My computer is also one of the first ones turned on in the day so if there was going
 to be spacing issues it would be for one of the later-activated devices, not my own.</p>

<h2>            Diagnosing Windows 10 WHEA Internal Error</h2>
                    <p>I have recently configured <a href="https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/user/RelentlessLotus/saved/dD4qsY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="pc part picker config">
a new server/workstation</a>, but in Windows (and Linux), I experience frequent BSOD and freezing on Linux, on Windows 10, with the BSOD of
<strong>WHEA_INTERNAL_ERROR</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible causes:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Faulty xeon processor (I am using the ES (engineering sample) version of the xeon-e5-2630v4)</li><li>Faulty graphics card (GTX 780)</li><li>Incompatible graphics card driver</li><li>Faulty external sound card, via PCI: RME Fireface 400</li></ul>

<p>Hi Sherry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why this issue occurred. Since you're facing multiple issues, let's try solving it one-by-one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, for drivers, not all AMD drivers are compatible to Windows 10. We suggest checking the AMD website directly for a complete list of drivers compatible to Windows 10 and download the updated driver from there directly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, for you VPN connection, we'd like to know how you're connecting to it so we can provide proper resolution to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Third, about registering your new device, does your device came with a pre-installed Windows operating system? Is it asking you to activate an Office product?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll wait for your response. </p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player - gapless CD burning problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 OS and Windows Media Player 12. I would like to burn a CD without gaps. When I attempt to do so, I obtain the message "drive does not support gapless burning."</p>
<p>My drive is a TSST CD-RW and firmware appears to be up to date. WMP 12 is also up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally, I would like to use WMP and not resort to an alternate burner. Please help. Thanks.</p>

</p><p>I have verified my drive does indeed support gapless burning, so there is a bug in Windows 7 or WMP 12.

            Hi Plutian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact command you've used?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running following command in administrative Windows PowerShell:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't works, create a new user account and check, if Store is available then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case if issue still persists, perform <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-repair-windows-10-using-in-place-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
repair upgrade</a>.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Case Badges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techyouth12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Case Badges</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering if there was a way to obtain case badges for the Windows 7 Operating Systems that you purchase from retail stores. I understand how OEMs like HP and Dell apply Windows 7 case badges to their laptops and desktop as a means of advertising and
 saying what the system runs. All the badges look the same across PC manufactures so I am believing they must obtain the sticker badges from Microsoft somehow.</p>
<p>So do Microsoft create and distribute case badges for their operating systems like Windows 7? If so, how can you obtain a set? I've have gotten into building PC's as a hobby and somewhat business service and wants to add some "authenticity" the newly built
 PCs.</p>

Sorry I mean it came with the&nbsp;COA License Key sticker that you put on the side of the computer case. I have the Installation DVD, with the case, and everything it normally comes with.

    <title>Why do .EML files modified date change on mouseover&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordangallagher  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do .EML files modified date change on mouseover&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I have a series of .EML (email) files sitting in a folder on my hard drive. &nbsp;When I view the contents of the folder in Windows Explorer (details view), then move the mouse to hover over one of the files (with a modified date from 2 days ago), the tooltip
 appears and has today's date showing as the modified date. &nbsp;If I then refresh the view, today's date appears in the modified date column for the file, overwriting the previous value. &nbsp;This all happens
<u>without opening the file</u>, nor even clicking on it (neither right-click nor left-click).
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Apparently I am not alone in this, and it has been a problem since Windows Vista days. &nbsp;Why does this happen, and
<u>is there a fix or workaround</u>?<br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Below are links to some other threads related to this problem, with some suggested registry hacks and such. &nbsp;<u>I would like to know why this issue still exists 3 or 4 years later.</u></div>

<div>(Note that the above threads also mention issues with deleting the EML files; this part is not related to my question. &nbsp;But plenty of other users had issues with the weird update of the timestamp when hovering on a file.)</div>

<div><span>Nope. &nbsp;It corresponds to the exact moment that I hover over the file in Windows Explorer. &nbsp;Try it yourself and you'll see. &nbsp;And you can check my provided links for more people who had the same problem as far back as 2009. &nbsp;And I'm not clicking on

<div><span>Nope. &nbsp;Last Modified timestamp immediately changes by simply hovering until the tooltip appears. &nbsp;Just like I described. &nbsp;I'm not "accessing" the file in any way, by the way. &nbsp;Not clicking on it, nor pressing Enter, nor otherwise opening it, nor
 anything of that sort.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>The file's modified date is permanently changed. &nbsp;This is not an issue with the view, or with what is displayed. &nbsp;If you close and reopen Windows Explorer and go back to the file, the newly updated modified date is still there. &nbsp;<u>This is a bug in Windows</u>,
 I'm convinced of that.</div>

Not true. &nbsp;If you hover over any other file type in Windows Explorer, the Modified Date does not change, nor should it. &nbsp;Test it with both .EML and other file types (as I have done) and you'll see. &nbsp;Hovering does not change the file contents, and there is no
 logical reason why it would update the modified date. &nbsp;This is an issue specific to .EML files. &nbsp;Did you look at the links I included in the original post? &nbsp;I'm not the first person to report this.

<div>Not sure how the acronym applies here. &nbsp;What I see is exactly what I get -- a bug in Windows Explorer related to .EML files. &nbsp;I'm not a novice user. &nbsp;If you were to stop assuming that I've made a mistake in the expected behavior, and actually try it yourself,

<br />
How has it 'been a problem'?<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<div>Below are links to some other threads related to this problem</div>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Again, why is it a problem? Files have many different properties, depending on&nbsp;their filetype. All files have an owner and a folder location. Image files have sizes in pixels, photos have a date taken and possibly even a camera model, video files have bit rates,
 mail messages have a sender, a recipient, a date sent and a subject. It is useful to be able to see these properties, so the OS provides ways of examining them, including displaying some of them in a bubble when hovering over the file name in Explorer.</p>
<p>However, this function depends on the properties involved having been recorded somewhere. Some file types - e.g. JPEGs - are capable of carrying these properties within the file itself. Others - e.g. EML files - aren't, because they are simple text files.
 So when Windows Explorer wants to display them in a bubble, a 'property handler' is invoked to extract the interesting property data from the file and write&nbsp;them to&nbsp;the file's&nbsp;Alternate Data Stream. Explorer then reads the data from the ADS and displays them.
</p>
<p>Writing to a file's ADS is of course a modification to the file, so the file's
<em>Date modified</em> property has to be updated to reflect this modification. The EML file's most meaningful properties - what it's about, who sent it, to whom and when -&nbsp;remain unchanged, as does the message content itself.</p>
<p>Of course, if you've read the threads you refer to, you already know all this.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks Noel. &nbsp;I had originally skimmed past some of that ADS stuff, but after your post I looked at it more closely. &nbsp;I would disagree a little with the way you phrased it ... from reading a bit elsewhere, the ADS doesn't have to exist to allow viewing
 properties on a file. &nbsp;Yes of course, text files don't store their properties inside the file contents. &nbsp;This data is stored in the NTFS structures, even without the ADS being created. &nbsp;But from what I can tell, the purpose of Windows Explorer creating an
 ADS in this case is for indexing, to speed up searches etc.
<div><br />
<div>Maybe if I turn off indexing for those file types, this behavior will go away. &nbsp;However, the user "barryd815" (in the thread deemed unhelpful by PA Bear above) actually gives a good technical explanation of this, but he says that turning off indexing doesn't
 resolve it. &nbsp;Maybe I'll try it and see, now that I'm curious enough.
<div><br />
<div>Bottom line is ... This is not what an average user should expect to have happen to a file when they roll over it with the mouse. &nbsp;And I still believe it should be classified as a bug, or at least a design flaw on Microsoft's part. &nbsp;Feel free to disagree.
 &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;But rolling over an item should not modify it or change its modified date. &nbsp;This date is an important piece of information that could need to remain pristine and untouched for various reasons. &nbsp;If MS were to create a separate file property called ADSModifiedDate
 and update that instead, this would make more sense perhaps.</div>

I think you'll find that <em>NTFS structures </em>is just another way of saying ADS.</p>

<br />
Yes, it's a good rundown - not very different from mine. Indexing of course makes use of the file properties, but because the property stream is needed for other purposes (so you can select and populate columns called
<em>Date sent</em>, <em>Date received</em>, <em>BCC </em>and so on&nbsp;in Explorer's <em>
Details </em>view), stopping indexing of .eml files won't stop Windows from writing those properties to the files' ADS.<br />

<p><br />
No. Different file types have different characteristics, and it would be wrong to expect Windows to treat them in the same way.</p>
<p>Think of the file as a container for information. There are different sorts of containers. A JPEG is a big box containing a primary object - some image data. But there's space in the box for other objects with different information, like dozens of different
 sorts of properties. A text file is a box with room for only a single object - some text. So to add different types of information to the box, you stick labels on the outside of it. These labels bear vital information extracted from the text inside the box
 and present it in a readable fashion.</p>
<p>The vital information contained in&nbsp;a mail message&nbsp;- apart from the message itself - that
<em>could need to remain pristine </em>includes the timestamps when it was sent and when it was received in the addressee's mailbox. The date it was put in a box by the recipient is essentially irrelevant.&nbsp;This is not the case with, say, a Word&nbsp;document, where
 the date it was last modified can be crucial. A&nbsp;mail message&nbsp;is (or ought to be) static.</p>

            Yep, I just encountered this problem this morning with Windows server 2008.&nbsp; In my case, hover does not seem to trigger it, however just selecting or right-clicking on a .eml file (not opening it) in Windows Explorer causes the last date modified to be
 changed.<br />
<br />
I have further discovered through testing that this only happens once for each file, i.e. if Windows Explorer has previously changed the date modified on selection, it will not do it again for the same file.<br />
<br />
I have read the technical explanation earlier in this thread of why this happens, but I find it hard to believe that Microsoft have done this deliberately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Systems need to operate in an expected manner for people to trust them, and Microsoft has a great track
 record (imho) of building systems with this in mind.<br />
<br />
Why would someone keep .eml files?&nbsp; Wouldn't it be logical to assume that the last date modified of such files is actually a critical piece of information?<br />
<br />
In my case, a workaround solution is to depend on the date created rather than the date modified.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this will fit the needs of the original poster.<br />
<br />
Can someone suggest an answer that includes a solution (e.g. modifying some registry settings) ?<br />
