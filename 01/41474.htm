<h2>            Need FTD2XX.DLL driver for Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: FTD2XX.DLL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My software requires the FTD2XX.DLL driver.&nbsp; I found a version on the internet that is compatible with XP,Vista and Windows 7.&nbsp; I copied it into my System32 directory on my Vista machine and the software worked fine.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;&nbsp; on my laptop running Windows
 8, it does not work.&nbsp; running regsvr32 FTD2xx.DLL gives an error&nbsp; saying that it may not be compatible with this version of windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have this driver on a windows 8 machine?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>​Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most programs created for earlier versions of
<span>Windows</span> also work in this version of <span>
Windows</span>, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of
<span>Windows</span> doesn't work correctly, you can try changing the compatibility settings for the program. I would suggest you to install the FTD2XX.DLL drivers in Windows compatibility mode and check if it works for you.
</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong>:<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply with the status of the issue, so that we could help you in a better way.</p>

    <title>broken surface pro 3 kick stand - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katelyn_123  say:</h3>
<h2>            broken surface pro 3 kick stand</h2>
                    earlier this week one of my hinges on my surface pro 3 snapped, i take very good care of it and dont drop or throw it around so i dont know why it would have broken (it is a bit over 2 and a half years old so i dont know if it broke because its a bit old).
 and today the other hinge broke and the kick stand is no longer connected to the computer. i looked up to see if you could get replacements for it and you can but im pretty sure getting a new one wouldn't work because its the hinges that are broken not the
 kick stand. is there anywhere i can go to get it fixed or would i have to send to to Microsoft to get it fixed? would it still be included in the warranty? i dont relay know what to do, has anyone else had this happen to theirs, if so how did you fix it?

<p><span>Hi atliti,<br />
</span><span><strong><br />
IME issue:<br />
</strong></span><span>Do you get any error message when IME stops working?<br />
</span><span>Did you make any software change to the computer recently?<br />
</span><span>Is it happening with all the music files that open? Try playing the files using a Media Player/Media Center and check.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>No Sound Issue:<br />
</strong></span><span>Have you installed the Audio drivers from the manufacturers website?<br />
</span><span>Let's try the following methods and verify if it resolves the issue:<br />
Let's make sure that the speakers are connected to the computer and switched on and Windows Audio sound is up and running and not mute or low.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1: Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services for No Sound in windows 7</strong>
<br />
Lets try Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services for No Sound in windows 7, Visit the link below and click on green button that says "Run Now" and follow the instructions appears on the screen.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</span><span>
</span></a><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Show Disabled devices and Set speaker as default</strong> <br />
Perform the task mentioned below to set speaker as default:<br />
1. Go to Start and click on control Panel.<br />
2. Click in Sound, then a new window will open up.<br />
3. In the new windows click on the tab"Playback" and right click in the window and click on Show Disabled devices.<br />
4. Now check if Speaker is listed there and right click on it and choose enable.<br />
5. Highlight that speaker and click on "Set as Default"<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3: To update your Audio driver in device manager: </strong>&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, and then click Control Panel<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click System and Maintenance<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Underneath Device Manager, click View hardware and devices<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click your Audio controller, and click Properties<br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select the Driver tab<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Update Driver button.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Windows will now search for an update for your Audio drivers locally and on the internet, then walk you through the process of installing the driver.&nbsp; If it is unable to find a driver you can go to your Sound Card manufacturer’s website and download any updated
 drivers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information refer to the article below:<br />

Avg free edition &amp; Norton Internet Security 2009 to name a few (they're both up to date.)<br />
<br />
I went to Services and restarted Windows defender service from there and that seems to have solved the problem. I restarted my system a couple times and Windows defender stays enabled. thnx anyway though

            <p>Partiton Magic 8 was compatible with Windows up to XP, but should never be used with anything later. There are free parttition managers that do work with Vista and beyond..
</p>
<p>Easeus.. <a href="http://www.partition-tool.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.partition-tool.com/</a></p>

<p>You could try this to get your partiton back.. <a href="http://www.partition-recovery.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.partition-recovery.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work, you may have to use the recovery partition.. </p>
<p>Your computer has been supplied with a recovery partition in place of disks.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes</span></p>
<p>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p><span>For Advent, r</span><span>estart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</span></p>
<p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to contact
 the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks for the model.. </p>
<p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"> all</span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus solution. ONLY AFTER you have
 done this should you replace stuff from backups or install anything else.</p>

    <title>Windows 7&#58; Disable Alt-Tab Application Grouping - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> uniment  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Disable Alt-Tab Application Grouping</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I normally keep &gt;20 windows open at a time. When using Alt-Tab in Win7, I find it annoying when Win7 decides to re-arrange my alt-tab order, randomly deciding to group windows by application (it seems to occur when the last three selected windows belonged
 to the same application, but I'm not sure). This is a HUGE nuisance. I hate that MacOS's Command-Tab is so crippled by tabbing through applications rather than windows, and now Microsoft is jumping onto a similar crapwagon!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>AeroPeek sucks too, so I've disabled it (uncheck System Properties&gt;Advanced&gt;Performance Settings&gt;Enable Aero Peek). As for the application-centric program switching, I've seen that it can be restored to WinXP behavior (in RegEdit through HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer
 by setting DWORD AltTabSettings to 1). The problem is that it also restores the old WinXP look, but I've grown fond of the Win7 appearance -- having a thumbnail of the window you're switching to is actually kind of nice, and WinXP didn't have that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Auto-Grouping by Application is a really, really dumb idea. Following a non-intuitive behavioral pattern is also a dumb idea. Is there a way to rid myself of the application switching curse without giving up the neat thumbnails?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<h2>            Screen Not Stretching to Fit on Lower Resolutions</h2>
                    When I lower my laptop's resolution to anything below 1600x900, I get black bars surrounding my screen.&nbsp; Instead of it stretching 1280x720 to fit my entire screen, I just get an actual 1280x720 screen within my screen.&nbsp; This problem came out of nowhere.&nbsp;
 Earlier today I had lowered my resolution, and it filled my screen like usual.&nbsp; I tried uninstalling and reinstalling my display driver, which did nothing.

            Yes, you need to go to 64-bit to use all the RAM.<br />
<br />
32-bit may report the presence of all 6GB but can only address 4GB and part of that 4GB is used for hardware - principally video memory and device BIOSes.

<h2>            Confirmation on Offer</h2>
                    I just want to clarify something if you please. On the 29th of July 2016, will my Windows 10 running devices (via Upgrade) remain licensed and will continue to receive updates? I just love Windows 10 and Microsoft that I wouldn't want to receive sudden
 news at the last minute that I wouldn't be able to stick to the OS and receive updates any longer. It's just that I read a lot of articles disproving this (Free for the device) and that bothers me.. Also, the terms and regulations didn't specifically state
 it in particular. Please provide me with the most truthful answer so that I can prepare my devices in certain circumstances that affect them (like switching back to my previous licensed OS or not)... &nbsp; All of my devices are running the update version of Windows
 10. PLEASE HELP ME!

            <p>Notice how you've been ignored?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you were given an answer, it would be either "evasive" or "unclear."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has occasionally answered this question by stating "The Windows 10 Operating System that was updated for free will _always_ be free on the computer it was originally installed on."</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, that does _not_ answer your question, does it?&nbsp; You specifically want to know if, at some point in the future, you will be required to pay a _fee_ for future UPDATES.<br />
</p>
<p>Consider this...&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The license for Windows 10 is written in completely different legal language than all previous versions of Windows.&nbsp; Nowhere in the license is the subject of update status, or _future_ update status, mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) The Microsoft "Office 365" subscription scheme is set up in such a way that you are paying for the _updates_, not the software.&nbsp; In fact, if you do that math you'd see that when you buy "Office 365", you're really buying "x" amount of time of updating
 service for the program.&nbsp; Therefore,&nbsp; after the "free" update offer expires for Windows 10, and a "price" is set on retail installation software, who's to say (now anyway) that what you're actually "buying" is "x" amount of time for the update service,&nbsp; just
 the same as you are when you currently buy "Office 365"???</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Microsoft has advertised that they are aiming for "x" million of FREE computer updates to Windows 10 within one year.&nbsp; Their largest shareholders were initially raving mad over this, but are now no longer causing a hoopla over it.&nbsp; Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Windows Update in Windows 10 _cannot_ be turned off.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Especially that the current "cumulative update" is wreaking so much havoc with _so_ many user's computers.&nbsp; We're talking _very_ serious problems with _very_ significant numbers of users.&nbsp; The
 fact that Windows Updates are forced upon the user is causing alarm in businesses around the country, and the latest flaws with the "cumulative update" have resulting in businesses literally threatening Class Action lawsuits... _all_ over the singular issue
 of the inability to turn off Windows Update.&nbsp; WHY?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) The rumor mills says (and I am "suspect in agreement") that after the "free upgrade" period expires, Windows 10 will be sold either extremely cheaply, or the sale price will include one to two years of update "service."&nbsp; Supposedly, the update subscription
 service will be called "Windows 365."&nbsp; Also, anyone who subscribes to "Office 365" will be exempt from paying for Windows updates.&nbsp; Supposedly, the "fee" will amount to about $5 dollars per month (cheaper per year, and cheaper per several year subscriptions).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think about it, the whole idea of a "Windows 365 Subscription Service" just makes sense.&nbsp; The current "reason" for the "free upgrade" is that it makes it easier for Microsoft to update just one system instead of three; (Win7, Win8 &amp; Win10).&nbsp; That
 stated "reason" doesn't hold water.&nbsp; There will be people who will not update.&nbsp; Microsoft will _still_ have to program and issue separate updates even if there are only a dozen pre-Windows 10 users.&nbsp; Bluntly stated, their "reasoning" cannot save them a dime.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 That leaves "x" million of _free_ upgraded computers adding up to being nothing more than a _big_ loss of revenue for Microsoft... precisely what their largest shareholders complained about when they first announced this whole "free upgrade" scheme.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now we get to my opinion of the upgrade itself.&nbsp; I am fortunate that I decided to hold back my main computer from Windows 10 upgrade until after seeing how all of my other computers did with the upgrade.&nbsp; I upgraded four other computers.&nbsp; The _only_ one
 that has not been a problem (so far) is an _older_ computer, with a 32 bit system.&nbsp; One of the other three computers failed (twice) to complete the upgrade, and it now has a Windows Update "corruption," which I have been unable to repair; and it will probably
 need to have Windows 7 completely reinstalled.&nbsp; Another computer had it's validation key corrupted upon "roll-back" and because the sticker under the computer had several letters/digits worn off, I could not leave Windows 7 on it.&nbsp; I had to resort to installing
 Linux.&nbsp; (Which it turns out I like _a lot_).&nbsp; The other "failure" was a 6 month old Pipo W2F tablet that was updated via "Windows Update Reservation" and worked flawlessly for several months until today when I turned it on and it auto-updated to the latest
 "cumulative update."&nbsp; The tablet auto-rebooted after the installation, and never fully restarted.&nbsp; The power button now does nothing at all.&nbsp; The Windows 10 "cumulative update" literally _bricked_ my tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are Windows Registry edits you can do to forever prevent Windows 7 (or 8) from _ever_ upgrading to a newer version (Windows 10 or otherwise).&nbsp; I have entered these edits into the Windows Registry of my main computer, and the fact that it _cannot_ be
 even forcefully upgraded to Windows 10 is of at least some consolation for all of the grief I have had with Windows 10 failures on my other computers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the simple fact that Windows Update cannot be turned off, I have truly felt all along that _any_ computer that has been upgraded to Windows 10 is a potential disaster waiting to happen.&nbsp; Apparently my fears were confirmed today by the loss of my tablet
 to the latest "cumulative update."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my opinion that anyone who has not upgraded, should avoid it like the plague.&nbsp; Anyone who has recently upgraded and is still within the 30 day window to "roll-back", should take advantage of the (soon to expire) opportunity to do so.&nbsp; Lastly, anyone
 who is capable (via software &amp; license key) to "go back" to either Windows 7 or 8 (8.1) should do so before a year goes by; (Note: Any previously registered Windows licensed computer that has not been updated via Windows Update for more than _one year_ becomes
 _invalid_ for re-registering the same license key.&nbsp; Many people are not aware of this, even though it has been Microsoft policy for over a decade).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To restate:&nbsp; Let's say you have a computer that for whatever reason you have not used online for a year.&nbsp; Now lets say that for whatever reason you need to re-install the operating system; (perhaps the hard drive failed, or it needs a new motherboard).&nbsp;
 If you try to reinstall the operating system, and/or re-validate the key due to a new motherboard installation, when you go online to validate it, it will be rejected as "invalid" due to the fact that more than a year has gone by.&nbsp; The only case where you
 will get away with it, is if the computer _does not_ need the OS re-installed.&nbsp; Such as if you had it in a closet and after more than a year you start it up and connect to the internet. _That_ is ok because the system is _already_ validated.&nbsp; And, even if
 the very next day you had to re-install and re-validate, that would be ok because the last time that particular (already registered/validated) machine was online was yesterday; not "over a year ago."&nbsp; (Hope that makes sense).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Considering the absolute carnage that is occurring to vast numbers of computer users of Windows 10 "free upgrade", especially since the release of the "cumulative update"... the wisdom of sticking with a computer's Windows 10 upgrade is highly debatable.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 The wisdom of updating if it hasn't already been done is even more debatable.&nbsp; And allowing the ability to "roll-back" to expire is equally debatable.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I am saying that given the fact that there is reason to suspect that Microsoft will eventually charge a fee structure of some sort for _updates_ to Windows 10 (11, 12, etc)... and given the fact that as time passes there are far too many victims
 of poorly written/tested updates, and (very importantly) given the fact that such updates simply cannot be prevented from being installed onto your computer, with zero control for even the time of day it will occur...&nbsp; (My conclusion is self evident).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But consider this...&nbsp; For the moment, forget all of the "maybe's".&nbsp; Given the fact that all new software (_particularly_ new operating systems) tend to have serious flaws that need to be worked out, doesn't it just make sense to wait for the very last minute
 to do this "free" upgrade?&nbsp; The free offer expires in July 2016.&nbsp; Why not let everyone else deal with the headaches, while you "sit it out" with a known stable operating system, of which the license clearly assures you of _free_ updates until the clearly stated
 date of support expires?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And who knows, maybe by July 2016 the issue of the "fee for updates" _may_ be a bit more clear?&nbsp; If not, even a last minute free Windows 10 update, you'd still have 30 days to "roll-back."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck to you, whatever you decide.</p>

            Long enough to finally get it off my chest.&nbsp; Windows 10 has been a disaster for me.&nbsp; You can dismiss my statements about having to pay for updates in the future if you simply don't "buy it,"&nbsp; but there are those at this forum who have been told by Microsoft
 representatives&nbsp; (on the phone) that future updates for Windows 10 are _not_ guaranteed to be free, and there are those who have been bluntly told that there will, in fact, be a fee for the updates.&nbsp; You can choose to ignore that also. However, you cannot
 dismiss everything else I wrote in my post above.&nbsp; Every word of it is true, and it is happening to many thousands of people.&nbsp; Businesses (plural) _are_ threatening Class Action lawsuits; (right here on this forum). Finally, given what has happened to me with
 Windows 10, I'd have to be a glutton for punishment to even _consider_ updating my main computer; _especially_ given the fact that "roll-back" ended badly on two of my computers; (one ended up with a Windows Update corruption, and the other had it's license
 Key invalidated).&nbsp; You'll note, however, at the end of my post, I do leave the door open for last minute updating after the nightmarish bugs with this system have been ironed out.&nbsp; Note: "Nightmare" is in specific reference to the "Cumulative Update."&nbsp; I suspect
 it will not be long before even someone like yourself will have no choice but to concede the "Cumulative Update" for Windows 10 will have proven itself to be a disaster and a PR "nightmare" for Microsoft.&nbsp;

            <p>Ps... The one single computer (out of 4) that updated successfully (an _old_ Gateway AIO), just had a "New Build" installed by Windows Update.&nbsp; It actually worked out well, right up until I decided to follow the instructions given by Microsoft Reps (here
 at this forum) for deleting the "Windows.old" folder left over by the "New Build Upgrade."&nbsp; The result was the total loss of my Windows 10 "Program Menu" system ("location missing"), plus the additional loss of all Networking, and the "screwy loss" of the
 ability to "left click" anywhere on the Desktop (note: Yet, "left click" still worked inside open folders).&nbsp; I spent all day looking for answers here that didn't involve YET ANOTHER complete clean re-installation, and came up empty handed. And because this
 was a _new_ "Upgrade Build Installation" _all_ of my previous "restore points" were gone!&nbsp; I had nothing to "restore" to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wasn't about to go through the loss (_again_) of several days worth of 3rd party program RE-installations, and so I decided... That's it, I'm _done_ with Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did a brand new installation of OS 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>JuLinux 10, that is!&nbsp; (My other computer that got it's Win7 validation key invalidated upon "roll-back" is getting an installation of Zorin 10 64bit Ultimate tomorrow).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good riddance Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(After having also said "Good Riddance" to Apple 15 years ago, when they dumped their DRM nightmare - aka: "OSX" - on an unsuspecting, sucker, public).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now _officially_ a Linux user, and I'm _very_ happy with every aspect of the Linux experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This _whole_ Windows 10 HORRENDOUS experience has left me more "fired up" against a company than I've even been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps... For the record, every Desktop PC I've ever owned I've built myself, and I was installing, programming and repairing (circuit level) computer system in Businesses way back in 1978.&nbsp; (I'm not some ignorant schmoe who cries "I'm lost" at the slightest
 little problem.&nbsp; And quite frankly, _most_ of the Windows 10 problems are something that no "Grandma &amp; Grandpa" out there should have to be dealing with).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have _no_ excuse Microsoft!&nbsp; (i.e. "A system that remains dependent on the files located inside a "Windows.old" folder is nothing less than a BUG.&nbsp; It's a FLAWED OPERATING SYSTEM!!!)</p>

            <span><span>Hi,&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing currently. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try to manually reset the Windows Updates Components and check if it helps.</p>
<div>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</div>
<div>1.&nbsp;Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.<br />
2.&nbsp;Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop wuauserv<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop bits<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop msiserver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start wuauserv<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start cryptSvc<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start bits <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net start msiserver<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.<br />
Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern about stopping the Windows Defender updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 you don't have a direct option to hide/disable the Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, <span>I would like to inform that Microsoft has also released a troubleshooter that allows you to hide updates and thus prevent Windows from reinstalling them until a revised version becomes available.</span></p>
<p><span>Download the troubleshooter <strong><span>wushowhide.diagcab</span></strong> from Microsoft; it’s a standalone application,&nbsp;no installation required.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer: </span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to temporarily prevent a Windows or driver update from reinstalling in Windows 10
</span></strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you run the application, you will receive:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Show or hide updates </span></strong><span>screen, click on <strong>
<span>Next</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>You may click on <strong><span>Hide updates </span></strong>to hide and on
<strong><span>Show hidden updates </span></strong>to see which updates are hidden.</span></li><li><span>For now, select <strong><span>Hide updates</span></strong>, check mark the updates for Windows Defender, click on
<strong><span>Next</span></strong>, and follow onscreen instructions.</span></li></ol>
<span>

<h2>            EMC Captiva Cloud Service service not starting</h2>
                    My customer is having a problem with a scanner (Canon Image Formula DR-C125) that has been working fine until the last few weeks.&nbsp; When I came on site I found that they were getting the message "Scanner is not ready. (Power may have been cycled.) Try operation
 again.(-4400)"&nbsp; Using the test scanner or camera button in the scanner properties I got "Your imaging device successfully completed the diagnostic test."&nbsp; Further research revealed that the EMC Captiva Cloud Service wasn't started.&nbsp; When I try to start it
 I get the message "Windows could not start the&nbsp;EMC Captiva Cloud Service service on Local Computer.&nbsp; Error 1053: The service did not respond to the start or control request in a timely fashion."&nbsp; I tried the fix suggested in this link:&nbsp;https://www.kapilarya.com/the-service-did-not-respond-to-the-start-or-control-request-in-a-timely-fashion
 without success. I don't know how to continue from here, please advise.&nbsp;&nbsp;
