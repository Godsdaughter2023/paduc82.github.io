<h2>            Windows 10 Spring Update broke search. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>After updating to Windows 10 1803 and installing all the latest cumulative updates, my search is now a buggy mess. When I bring up taskbar and click the search button, nothing happens. After double clicking it like 9 times it opens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked from task manager and see an power saving indicator next to the search task. It seems like everytime I click the search it opens runtimebroker. Next click opens search (Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy). The last opens search background
 task host. The search background task host and search are stopped even though they shouldn't.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to enable all background programs so no power saving feature would break the processes.</p>
<p>I can can open the search everytime by clicking the Windows button next to it first and it opens instantly like it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And there is an another bug too. I can't right click any search results because the right click menu just instantly opens and closes. I can't for example run cmd with admin rights so I had to go to Windows/System32 and create a shortcut of the cmd.exe just
 to run it with admin rights.<br />
</p>

            <pre>OK, here are some generic trouble shooting process you can try:
Win10 Store apps  / Metro / Modern / UWA / UWP
In Windows 8.1, Microsoft introduced Universal Windows Apps (UWA), colloquially known as “Metro apps” or “Modern apps.” In Windows 10, Microsoft took the idea even further and ended up with the Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
Based on my own experience, and the reports of many others it appears that the store and it’s associated “environment” is rather fragile, causing various problems with the store itself and store applications. 
2016 07 19- 5 TIPS TO FIX WINDOWS STORE AND APP ISSUES IN WINDOWS 10
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/5-tips-fix-windows-store-app-issues-windows-10/ 
Restart the computer
Win Store Trouble Shooter
Clear store Cache (WSReset.exe)
Reset Windows update (use the tool in the following link)
Reg hack for Connection errors
Re-Register the Store
Here are some additional instructions for the 5 tips defined in the article above 
Remember to test the problem applet between each of the steps.
#0 RESTART THE COMPUTER
Simply restarting the computer is one of the simplest trouble fixes we have. But it is all too often forgotten or skipped.  Too often programs get “confused”. While restarting the program may clear the confusion, sometimes they have an unseen component constantly running in the background.  The easiest way to reset them is to restart the computer. 
#1 MS DOWNLOADABLE WIN10 STORE APP TROUBLE SHOOTER
http://aka.ms/diag_apps10 
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-run-the-trouble shooter-for-windows-apps 
Note: both of these links above should take you to download the same diagnosis “CAB” file. 
Use the built in Trouble shooter
Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot 
Scroll down to the bottom 
Click Windows Store Apps
#2 WSRESET.EXE – CLEAR AND RESET STORE CACHE
http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-clear-reset-windows-store-cache-in-windows-10/ 
Run as Admin.
Be sure to run the WSReset (Windows Store Reset) program AT LEAST 5 times. It appears to fix one problem per run, SLOWLY working thorough multiple problems in subsequent runs. Unfortunately the tool is poorly written so it gives the user no indication of what it is doing or if it was successful or not. All you can do is run it several times in the hope that you run it often enough for it to clear all of the problems.
#3 MANUAL RESET WINDOWS UPDATE SUBSYSTEM
If the problems remain, you have to revert to a manual process to reset Windows Update
Check that System Restore is turned on and configured 
https://www.pcworld.com/article/2955023/windows/how-to-turn-on-system-restore-in-windows-10-to-protect-against-bad-updates.html 
https://www.tekrevue.com/how-to-enable-system-restore-windows-10/ 
Create a System restore point. (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point )
Use the following process to effectively delete the folders used by Windows Update:
Follow the instructions in this page: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components - How do I reset Windows Update components? (Win7-Win10)
The first paragraph in the above process includes a link to the Windows update troubleshooter. Make sure to run through it also.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6eHDtylDYo How to Fix Win Update Errors
This is a Video of manual process very similar process to the one described in the link to KB971058 (above)
After doing the process in the above link, including restarting the computer Check for outstanding updates:
. – in start menu search for Windows Update
. - click on “Check for Updates”
. – updates are often sequention, they require an earlier one to be present before being installed. So you should repeat checking for updates until you get no more updates

8 MICROSOFT STORE ERRORS AND HOW TO FIX THEM 
https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-microsoft-store-errors/ 
Joe Keeley February 15, 2018 5 minutes 
&lt;snip&gt;
The Windows Store, recently rebranded as the Microsoft Store, is the official marketplace for downloading games, apps, themes, and more. It’s not uncommon for it throw out errors, many of which are hard to resolve. We’re here to help.
Whether your Store is apparently missing, has a damaged cache, stuck downloading, or something else entirely, we’re here to offer all sorts of solutions that should hopefully get everything sorted.
.  0. WINDOWS STORE APPS TROUBLESHOOTER: START TROUBLE SHOOTING WITH THE STORE TROUBLESHOOTER (FIND IT HERE: HTTPS://SUPPORT.MICROSOFT.COM/EN-US/HELP/2970908/HOW-TO-USE-MICROSOFT-EASY-FIX-SOLUTIONS 
.  1. WINDOWS STORE WON’T OPEN: IF THE STORE WON’T OPEN AT ALL, LET ALONE GIVE YOU AN ERROR MESSAGE
.  2. WINDOWS STORE CACHE MAY BE DAMAGED: TRY CLEARING THE CACHE.
.  3. WINDOWS STORE IS MISSING: F YOU CAN’T FIND THE STORE ANYWHERE ON YOUR SYSTEM THEN YOU’LL NEED TO REINSTALL IT.
.  4. WINDOWS STORE DOWNLOAD IS STUCK: IF YOUR APPLICATIONS WON’T DOWNLOAD OR UPDATE PROPERLY, FIRST CHECK THAT YOU’RE NOT TRYING TO INSTALL THEM TO AN EXTERNAL HARD DRIVE.
.  5. ERROR CODE 0X80072EFD: THIS ERROR WILL APPEAR WHEN THE STORE IS HAVING NETWORK ISSUES. 
Temporarily turning off the firewall was reported to work for one person.
.  6. ERROR CODE 0X80072EE7: THIS PARTICULAR ERROR CODE CLAIMS THAT THE SERVER HAS STUMBLED. IT’S A NETWORK ISSUE
•  This particular error code implies that the server has stumbled. It’s a network issue and can occur even if your internet browser is working perfectly. For this, try resetting your proxy settings. Press Win + R, input cmd and press Enter. Input this and press Enter:
netsh winhttp reset proxy
Restart your computer and open the Store, which should now be working.
.  7. ERROR CODE 0X8000FFFF: THIS ERROR WILL APPEAR IN THE STORE AND SAY THAT THE PAGE CAN’T BE LOADED.
.  8. ERROR CODE 1: THIS IS A VERY CURIOUS ONE. IT’S THE FIRST ERROR CODE AND WILL APPEAR WHEN YOU TRY TO LAUNCH THE STORE.
&lt;/snip&gt;
RESET ALL STORE APPS / REREGISTER / APPS MISSING FROM WIN START MENU
Re-register all store apps, so they appear again in start menu.  For that, open a PowerShell window as Administrator. Copy and paste the following line into the PowerShell window and press Enter: 
Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose } 
Note:	if you re-register all applications, all your apps are back, however all your pinned apps will be reset (the right panel will be empty) so you need to re-pin everything that you want. Personnaly I did a screen capture before, to remember what I pinned and where (use the “snipping tool” in startmenu/windows accessories, with a delay to be able to open the start menu before the capture) 
RE-INSTALL ALL STORE APPS USING POWERSHELL
…*  In the Start Menu, search for PowerShell 
…*  right click and select “Run as Administrator” option.
…*  Enter the following commands one by one in the PowerShell window:
………  reg delete “HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\TileDataModel\Migration\TileStore” /va /f
………  get-appxpackage -packageType bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}
………  $bundlefamilies = (get-appxpackage -packagetype Bundle).packagefamilyname
………  get-appxpackage -packagetype main |? {-not ($bundlefamilies -contains $_.packagefamilyname)} |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmanifest.xml”)}

Standard boilerplate legalistic bafflegab disclaimer for any links to non-Microsoft websites:
The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<h2>            ZTG Zero Tolerance Gaming clan recruiting, all levels, ages 15 15&#43;</h2>
                    
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">How we started!</span><br />
<br />
Zero Tolerance Gaming, also known as Zero Tolerance, we are recently new to the Battlefield clan revolution and we are looking for new recruits, now don't just read this and think these guys don't even know anything about clans, myself and the other two creators
 of the clan all have clan experience under our belts, i used to run a call of duty 5 clan with about 80 members, but it died because of more and more call of duty games being released. Then i got battlefield, a whole other game type than call of duty, this
 game makes call of duty look like a peice of mud.<br />
<br />
When i started playing Battlefield i realized no body used microphones for tactics or anything, so we decided to make Zero Tolerance because we were fed up of constantly playing by our selfs with no tactics involved and this is a tactical game.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What do you need to have to be apart of ZTG/ZT!</span><br />
<br />
We have very little requirments at this moment in time because we are looking for players who do not want to play on their own, as soon as we take more and more members everyday we will be introducing requirments. So we take all levels, all KDR, all Score per
 minutes. The one thing we do ask is that you are a respectable age and are not to imature because if we find out your about twelve you will be gone before you know it! We don't even have class requirments, so non of this you need the M16A3 for the Russian
 team as well as the American team. We want you to be active on the website checking for new news and updates and reading messages sent to you from other members. You need a microphone though but if you don't have one at the moment we will make an acception
 on the basis that you get one.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">How to join!</span><br />
Joining our clan is very easy, you only have to do about 3-4 things and then your in.<br />
1. Head down to our website @ <a href="http://www.ztgaming.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ztgaming.net</a><br />
2. Click the 'Join Us' page or go to <a href="http://www.ztgaming.net/join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ztgaming.net/join</a><br />
3. Wait for your application to be submited<br />
4. Click the 'New Recruits' page or go to <a href="http://www.ztgaming.net/nrinfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ztgaming.net/nr</a> there are a few things you have to do which are stated on that page. Once done you are apart of Zero Tolerance Gaming.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">What we want to achieve!</span><br />
<br />
We want to achieve alot of things over these coming months.<br />
<br />
We want to start a website and Battlefield team called the Board of Directors (BOD) This is a team that will help keep the clan going in a straight line and in the right direction, by taking things in that is happening in the clan and being able to state them
 and make a change so the clan can benefit in so many ways and become alot better, this will come around the more members we get.<br />
<br />
Squads, the more members we get the harder it will be to keep them in place so we are going to set up squads: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta. Just like the 4 mains ones in battlefield. This squads will be used for clan training. Events: Squad tournaments,
 obviously there will be alot more than 4 in each squad so there will be squad tournaments set up for each squad, example (Squad Alpha Side arm ONLY Tournament), there will be squads inside the squad, Alpha 1(A1), Alpha 2(A2)....<br />
Each squad will have its own specific forum section where only the squad members can post, so if you are in squad Delta you can not post in Alpha, Bravo or Charlies forum section this is the same for all squads. So when the tournaments are set up they will
 be posted inside the squads section and all squad members can see it and discuss it.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold">Tournaments and Events!</span><br />
<br />
There will be tournaments and events set up out side of squads with a set amount of members that can enter, these events may have prizes like microsoft points and other thinks we don't quite know yet.<br />
<br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Alot more to come!!</span><br />
<br />
We have already achieved a BF3 server which will be used for training, clan fights, events, we might even close it for our premium members/players only. We have it open to the public all the time unless the above are needed to be played in our server, we have
 rules for our server and consequences for it so if you break the rules you have to suffer them and learn from your mistakes.<br />
<br />
We have also nearly achieved the squads creation and are under way with this as you read it unless this post has been round for months then we have already done.<br />
<br />
So come and join us @ <span><a href="http://www.ztgaming.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ztgaming.net</a></span><br />

    <title>If you cannot download the black ops annihilation map pack or any - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wargravewarrior  say:</h3>
<h2>            If you cannot download the black ops annihilation map pack or any other content please read&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Many of the issues people may be having are down to the geo-IP providers (not your ISP) and Microsoft.</p>
<p>Either the location your being given by the geo-IP provider is correct and is not being given the correct 'status' by Microsoft (most likely) or the Geolocation is incorrect and being treated as such by MS, either way you will not be able to download content
 that should be available to you.</p>
<p>If you have had no problems downloading content before then that is most likely because your geo-location was previously incorrect, more recently the larger of the geo-IP providers have started being more accurate in their classification and now Microsoft
 need to update their data.</p>
<p>These issues seem to be most prominent in islands off the coasts of larger countries such as Puerto Rico (USA) and the Isle of Man (UK), these would have previously been shown by the geo-IP provider as being part of the larger country but is now being shown
 correctly in its own right.</p>
<p>I realise this doesnt solve the issue but hopefully it will shed some light on the issue.</p>

<p>If your on Sure you could try rebooting your router a few times on the off chance you are issued a UK IP address, this used to be doable on Manx Telecom but as far as I know not anymore.</p>
<p>As for Guam I don't know the details but it's highly possible you are having the same geo-IP issues.</p>

    <title>What happened to the margins in Notepad &#40;Win10&#41;&#63; They were - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cm-nyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            What happened to the margins in Notepad &#40;Win10&#41;&#63; They were still part of the program in Win 7</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">It is really sad that Microsoft decided that the "white space" margins were not necessary in Notepad (Win 10).<br />
They were still part of the program in in Win 7.<br />
Not sure what I am talking about, it is the white space between the window edge and the text, that is missing now in Notepad.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
&nbsp;edge |&nbsp; text&nbsp; (Win 7)</p>
<p class="contentStandard">&nbsp;edge |text (Win 10)<br />
<br />
Very user unfriendly.<br />
<br />
Anyone have any tips / tricks on how to get it back?</p>

            Hi CM-NYC, 
<br />
<br />Being a simple text editor, there aren't many editable settings for notepad. 
<br />
<br />I did find this <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/81968-notepad-margins-0-after-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/software-apps/81968-n...</a> - looks like others have found this upsetting as well. Trying to find a possible tweak for you, but in the meantime have you tried changing the font? I understand that isn't a margin fix, but it may help. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />

<p>ok well today i was playing forza horizon and all of us sudden i get singed out and it says sing out because someone singed in else ware so i start freaking out thinking someones hacking my account and i keep trying to sign in hoping it will work and then
 I'm trying to get on my computer at the same time and and log in to xbox live thinking who ever is trying to hack me maybe i can change my password b 4 they can get a chance to do anything and i sing in and it says banned until 12/31/9999 and right after i
 see that my phone got an email saying i have been banned and why and it says i have been banned "due to cheating,inappropriate gameplay and or system abuse" and I'm thinking what the heck I'm never online and when i am all i do is play forza so then i see
 another email saying how my account had an unusural sign in and its from Canada and it shows the ip address so someone was on my account and my password had been changed and stuff like that so i call xbox support and they say they can't do anything to help
 me out because they don't have any contact with the enforcement team and they can't help but they just referd me to the xbox forums and saying if i post on here someone will be able to help me but when i talked to the employe over the support line he says
 i was last playing mw3 and at that point I'm really confused because i don't even own mw3 so i think some one had gotten a hold of my account and used it in order hack or attempt to mod or was just showing flat out wrong conduct in the game causing me to get
 banned i just hope someone here can help me out and if it is at all possible get restore my account and change the password and sucure my account from anyone who may have access to it .</p>

<p>Hello there<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span><strong>ManicMushroom85,</strong> I`ve got to agree with&nbsp;</span><strong>TrippIE</strong> on this one.</p>
<p><span>If you believe your account was compromised you will need to contact phone support. They do investigations for these types of situations, Your account May be&nbsp;locked for the duration of the investigation. Please reach out to them by visiting this page&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a><span>&nbsp;You
 can always check out the&nbsp;</span><strong>International Xbox Support phone numbers&nbsp;</strong><span>for your region by</span><strong>&nbsp;clicking here&nbsp;</strong><span>Good Luck</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note - Ask them to do an&nbsp;Unauthorized access investigation on your account. They can not say "No".</span></p>

<p>my account isn't locked it says i am banned until 12/31/9999 when i try to sing in but I'm guessing they used my account to do something to get me banned is there any possibility i could get everything restored and back to normal like my password reset and
 change my security stuff and unbanned because I'm really upset i have years of gameplay lots of achievements and i have done so much online like ranks and one of my goals was to have every call of duty maxed out on my rank and guns and stats and so on ,on
 every call of duty up till the release of the ps4 and xbox one and i would hate for all those years of gaming to go to waist all because some kid probily thought it was funny to hack my account and get me banned which I've spent all day long trying to figure
 out how can fix this problem and yet all Microsoft dose is refers me to this stupid form which i retied because basically there saying "oh were sorry but &nbsp;it suck to be you you can go to our forums if you'd like have a nice day" like really i would except
 them to at last help and see what they can do like look up to see where my account has been who did it and see that i haven't been on in several days and give me a chance to change my password and get my account unbanned and do anything else they can do to
 make sure no one else has access to my account like they get paid to help ppl not just refer everyone to the stupid forums all day

<p>What Prince is saying is that your account will be locked during the investigation, as we both stated though you need to contact phone support and tell them you want to claim an Unauthorized Access on your account and they cannot say no they have to do it
 no if ands or buts man.</p>

<h2>            Como Unificar conta do Xbox com a do Windows&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, sei que tem como vincular uma conta na outra para poder trocar facilmente de usuário (ja fiz isso), mas eu não queria ter que ficar trocando de usuário.</p>
<p>Quero unificar minhas contas e não vincular ... tem como? pois agora tenho um usuário no Xbox e um no PC ... assim fica dificil para acumular os achievements do campo minado! haha</p>
<p>Obrigado!</p>

<p>Não tem como unir as 2, as 2 contas já são contas microsoft, só que uma vc usa um serviço a mais que é o do Xbox Live. Você tem 2 opções:</p>
<p>1 - Trocar o email vinculado a conta do Xbox Live e colocar o que criou para a conta do windows (esta troca é feita pelo console apenas)</p>
<p>2 - Excluir a conta que colocou no windows e colocar a mesma que você já usa no Xbox no windows (se não conseguir pesquisa no google sobre trocar ou excluir contas no windows 8, tem vários tutoriais)</p>

            Hi Jerry.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd  nstall Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />

<br />
It appears that fbw files are generated by an HP backup tool, not by Vista. I would check the HP FAQs or post the question on an HP forum. Using these terms for a search engine also turns up useful links:<br />

                    Smalltalk Express is a 1992-to-1996-vintage 16-bit application that I am using in my research. I have been running it successfully on Windows XP SP3 on Parallels Desktop 11 on a new Mac without trouble until I started using WinSock, which isn't behaving
 as expected, even though it did work several years ago. (Server sockets created with formerly working code and without error are rejecting connections from a Python CGI program &nbsp;in an Apache server. This code used to work.) &nbsp;I've installed Microsoft Fix It
 50203 for XP WinSock but that doesn't seem to help. Now I'd like to try it on Windows 10 (32-bit, also on Parallels Desktop 11) to see if I can get sockets working there but I'm getting apparent compatibility problems. (The Windows 10 installation on Parallels
 Desktop 11 has been successful.) The Smalltalk application appears to enter the startup process then fails with a "sharing violation" Smalltalk debugger window, from which I can get no additional information. Has anybod

<p>
</p><p>I try to&nbsp;create inbound connection&nbsp;to&nbsp;phone's Mac Address. Even&nbsp;phone said that it&nbsp;connected successfully but still no internet. I must create a secondary rule with outbound connection to&nbsp;Mac address: 64-70-02-61-6C-59 (this MAC not exist on any of my network,
 including my virtual networks and phone)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal? If yes then that MAC belongs to what? Why&nbsp;phone need that Mac address to get network connection?&nbsp;Why I can't&nbsp;find it with command line: ipconfig/all</p>

            The virtual network uses a unique mac address purposefully, that's how it's designed.&nbsp; This is to prevent mac address duplication.

<h2>            Why can I not send or recieve messages through the Xbox App&#63;</h2>

I am thinking that this must be an account glitch? Either way, I would like to be able to send and receive messages through the Xbox App.&nbsp; I have tried all the "fixes" mentioned in other threads, including a clean install of Windows 10...No joy :(</p>

<p>This is the third person openly stating that this issue is happening to them and the third time they been turned away to call support, the second one by you @XBF Brad A. I don't know what power you have in this situation but it's not getting solved. Is there
 someway to get someone higher up aware of this issue. I've been having it for over a year. When I called support they just said that they didn't know, needed to consult someone else and would call back within so long, and they never did. That also happened
 to the person on the thread you just shut down. This is the third time. This is getting silly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For those curious, these are the steps that both I and Yuji, the closed thread OP had taken to no avail:<br />

<p>Some of the things that I tried:</p>
<p>- re-installing apps</p>
<p>- resetting apps</p>
<p>- logging in and out of profiles</p>
<p>- logging into other profiles (same issue!?)</p>
<p>- deleting old conversations on xbox/browser</p>
<p>- windows app repair / troubleshoot</p>
<p>- signing out of all devices + hard resetting xbox console</p>
<p>- logging into the MS reputation site (that doesn't seem to work at all btw)</p>
<p>- clean start-up</p>
<p>- installing latest windows updates</p>
<p>- removing xbox from xbox preview programme</p>
<p>- ...</p>

<p>This is what happened to Yuji when they called support -<br />
<strong>Yuji </strong>-<br />
<span>"This is my update from yesterday where I tried to call Xbox support again: they said "we can't help you, need to direct you to Windows/Microsoft support". Microsoft support agent said after having a discussion with his
 superior: "Sorry, I may not help you, please contact Xbox support chat (not phone), only their chat can help you". I was in contact with Xbox support chat from the start and they did not help me so far. Anyway, I tried to contact them again, and then they
 said something like: "We did not forget you, it's still an open case, the guy who is on the case will contact you tomorrow". Well, he did not.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>One guy from the phone said that there were already 10 ppl involved / on my case. However, I have never received any feedback from Xbox support pro-actively. The only 2 times or so I got feedback in the past months was when I contacted them again
 to ask about the status of the case. As a paying Xbox Live Gold member for 15 years I'm especially disapointed about how this is handled. I think one of the support agents said that the case is open since mid-November (I couldn't even remember anymore, it's
 that long ago).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't get any feedback on Monday, I will contact them again on Tuesday. I want this finally solved... :("<br />

            Seems like juggling us around is easier than actually coming up with an answer to this Xbox App problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp; I have been a faithful customer of Microsoft products since DOS first came into existence.&nbsp; This is
 the first time I've ever seen such <strong>[Mod Removed- Inappropriate]</strong>&nbsp; customer service.&nbsp; This is really a let down.&nbsp;<br />
If these Microsoft techies don't know how to solve this, I just wish they would admit it rather than send customers on wild goose chases that accomplish absolutely NOTHING.<br />
I'm not going to bother to waste my time waiting for a call back from support.&nbsp; My time is way too valuable to spend what little I have left of it, waiting for a phone call.<br />
Good luck Shadowed Figure, and Yuji....<br />

<p>Hello Dukes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the frustration you are having with your issue. Unfortunately, here on the forums pointing you in the right direction is all we are able to do. When you had a case open have you responded to any of the emails sent to you, letting them know issue
 isn't resolved or anything? If they do not get any responses they will close the case.</p>

 PC works in Windows platform. As such, they can't communicate directly with each other. Therefore, a middleware, the KIES software is needed. This is&nbsp;required&nbsp;for operations such as contacts transfer, messaging, internet connectivity, etc. Also, serial port
 is required for these kind of operations. But as such, you can connect the phone in mass storage mode, meaning, the built-in storage of the phone can only be accessed, just like a USB storage device like pendrive.

            Hi Owen.C, &nbsp;
<br />My name is Ana. I am an Independent Advisor. Thanks for contacting us.
<br />
<br />This type of programs with unknown names installed on the PC, almost always cause a virus or install a third-party program downloaded from an unreliable site causes install programs without permission.
<br />
<br />Recommendation for uninstalling the program:
<br />Create another Global administration user on your pc and from that new user access the pc and from the control panel try to uninstall it.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402692...</a>
<br />
<br />Run a virus scan, scan in depth on your PC with the antivirus software you have.
<br />
<br />I wish I could have helped you, let me know any questions.
<br />Best regards

            Hi Owen.C
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP application supplied by Windows 10 installation like Clock, Calculator etc
<br />Uninstall it using Windows 10 Store App Unistaller - Apps-Cleaner.zip
<br /><a href="https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Windows-10-Store-Apps-5f60b9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcen...</a>
<br />
<br />(This can also be uninstalled using Powershell scripts but scripts are different for different app. The utility is a good one to uninstall)
<br />
<br />B. If this is UWP application but installed by your from Microsoft Store and not supplied by Windows 10 default installation
<br />Windows key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click on the respective application &gt; Uninstall
<br />(The method of point A can be used for this also)
<br />
<br />C. If this is a third party application but not installed from Microsoft store
<br />Same as in B - Windows key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click on the respective application &gt; Uninstall
<br />
<br />D. If still the problem in previous point
<br />Use Revo Uninstaller (Free) to uninstall.
<br />Download from - <a href="https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstalle...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Hi Owen
<br />
<br />4.88GB is huge for a Windows App, that may be some sort of game . . .
<br />
<br />Does that App have a tile on your Start menu, or does it just appear in the list of installed apps?
<br />
<br />If that does appear on your Start Menu, if you right click that app icon, what options do you get on the 'More' menu?

<p>Thanks for the response, Ana.<br />

I'm still unable to uninstall this program despite making a separate user with administration privileges. In addition, the app in question does not appear in control panel, only in Apps and Features.<br />
<br />
So far, to defend against malware, I've use Rkill to stop malicious processes (which it didn't find any), Malwarebytes and ADWcleaner scans. None of which affected the app mentioned in the picture.<br />
<br />
I've also tried to search for the file based on file size and date modified. For example, searching for .exe size:&lt;1GB, or .folder. No celebrations :s<br />

            I suspected it was a game at the beginning too, but the lack of an uninstall button made me suspicious.<br />
<br />
I've checked my start meun folder and found nothing suspicious. In addition, this program appears in Apps and Features, but not on control panel uninstall list.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response!<br />

<p><strong>The light on my power supply is green.</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Check your power supply cables</strong></span></p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug the power supply from your console, and remove the power cord from the outlet and the other end of the power supply. Reattach the cables, making sure everything is plugged in nice and snug, and try turning on the console.</p>
<p>If the light on the power supply is still green, and your console will not turn in, then it will require a repair. You can check your warranty status and set one up using our Online Service Center.</p>

<p><strong>Try a different outlet</strong></p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug your power supply from the console and the wall outlet, and then take the power supply and console into another room. Don’t worry about the video cables for now.</p>
<p>Plug the power supply into an outlet in the room, and then plug the power supply into the console. Make sure everything is nice and snug, and then power on the console. (The console will flash four red lights, but only because the video cable isn’t attached,
 so don’t worry.)</p>
<p>What color is the light on the power supply now? Is it green? If so, don’t plug the power supply into the original outlet until it’s been inspected, or until you get a new power strip. If the light on the power supply is still red, move on to the next step.</p>
<p>Let your power supply cool down</p>
<p>Turn off your Xbox 360 console. Unplug the power supply from its outlet and from the console, and let the supply cool down for one hour. Once cooled, reattach the&nbsp;cable to the console and outlet, make sure everything is nice and snug, and turn the console
 back on. If the light on the power supply is still red, the power supply will need to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong>The light on my power supply is orange</strong>.</p>
<p>Check your power supply cables</p>
<p>Turn off your console. Unplug the power supply from your console, then remove the power cord from the outlet and the other end of the power supply. Reattach the cables, making sure everything is plugged in good and snug. Turn your console back on. If the
 light on the power supply is still orange, continue to the next step.</p>
<p>Try another power supply</p>
<p>See if you can borrow a different power supply to try on your console, to determine if the issue is with the console itself, or the power supply. Remember, power supplies from the Original Xbox 360 are not compatible with the Xbox 360 S, so be sure to borrow
 the right one!</p>
<p>If the console powers on with the new power supply, then your power supply will have to be replaced. If the console still won’t power on, then it will require a repair. You can check your warranty status and set a repair up using our Online Service Center.</p>

<h2>            My Xbox one does not recognize every button on my mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Xbox one now supporting keyboard and mouse, I decided to buy a mouse. The Corsair M65 Pro to be precise.</p>
<p>Left and Right click buttons work perfectly as well as the scroll wheel. There is also 2 buttons on the left and they work fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is this one button tho.. a third one on the left side of the mouse, that is not recognized... I tried to play fortnite, a game that supports mouse and keyboard on Xbox, and when I want to assign the button to an action in the keybinds menu, nothing
 happens. It is like the console did not even know I was clicking that button.. Please help me.. Thank you very much!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Juko23!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention here on the forums. I understand you have a mouse with more than the usual amount of interface options and some of them are not being detected is that correct? You can take a look at our support article:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/ease-of-access/mouse-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mouse and Keyboard Support on Xbox One</a>. That being said you may want to contact the manufacturer of the mouse and see if they have further information about their product. The keyboard and mouse feature is fairly new and may still evolve and possibly become
 more compatible with more devices in the future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Thank you for your answer!&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the computer I can use the mouse software to remap le third thumb button to another key such as *9* and it work fine.</p>
<p>Do you know if there is a way I could that on Xbox ? A Microsoft app maybe?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Have you checked Settings - Kinect &amp; devices - Mouse? That should allow you check/setup the mouse button mapping if Microsoft included that functionality. I haven't used it myself yet so I'm not 100% familiar with that part of the app's features as I've
 only used it for my controller via the Devices &amp; accessories section.</p>

            No unfortunately, it does not seem like there is a feature like this on the xbox. The only options in the Kinect &amp; devices menu for mouse are the pointer speed and switch primary &amp; secondary buttons...&nbsp;

<p>Hi Juko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for expressing your concern here. At the moment, mouse and keyboard support is still new to Xbox, this means not all macro keys etc will be recognized and supported by the system. Hopefully, sometime down the line, additional support will be added
 to allow for use of extra keys on these devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps, thanks again.</p>

Read the manual of your wireless router to find out how to access and configure your router. What you need to find when you configure the router is the wireless key, by default you would be using&nbsp;"WEP" which&nbsp;typically has a&nbsp;longer&nbsp;wireless key than most. I
 use WPA2-PSK and use my own customized passphrase because it is easier to distribute. Instead of a long jibberish key that is crackable within 30 seconds, you can set a less complex combination of characters and use your own custom passphrase.</p>
<p><strong><em>Examples:</em> WEP</strong>: 1889d8fddfdf98908fen3n3 <strong>WPA-PSK</strong>:MyD0gP4co!s4M4st!ff</p>
<p><em>Also note that instead of using a direct words, I added symbols or numbers based on a specific letter. A=4, I=! and I also used variances of upper and lower case lettering.</em></p>
<p><strong>Connecting to your wireless network</strong></p>
<p>Plug your laptop back in by the network cable.</p>
<p>You need to connect to the router, view the wireless settings, and copy and paste the WEP or WPA key into notepad or wordpad. For ease of obtaining the key again without connecting and also you can print out that paper to share your wireless network with
 friends or family that bring a laptop over.</p>
<p>Disconnect from the router</p>
<p>View the wireless networks in your area, select your routers SSID(the name of the wireless connection) and paste that network key into the box.</p>
<p>That should conclude your wireless configuration on your laptop.</p>
<p>Best Regards!</p>

<h3> social media - ag  say:</h3>
<h2>            I receive an error, &#34;NVIDIA GeForce GT220&#58; NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 305.93 has stopped responding and has successfully recovered.&#34; while playing World of Warcraft.</h2>
                    <p>I'm posting on behalf of a customer. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The customer is having issues with his <strong>NVIDIA <span>GeForce GT220</span></strong>&nbsp;graphics card on his Medion PC ever since he upgraded to
<strong>Windows 8</strong>. He has updated to the latest drivers available but is still experiencing problems, especially when attempting to play World of Warcraft.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He is receiving the following error message: </p>
<p><em><strong>"NVIDIA Windows Kernel Mode Driver, Version 305.93 has stopped responding and has successfully recovered."</strong>
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has tried adjusting his PC settings&nbsp;for performance and manually selecting the graphics card from his settings, the latter of which worked for approximately an hour before reverting to the same problem as before; the former did not work at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He has attempted to contact the manufacturer, NVIDIA, and has yet to receive a response. The information on the Windows Compatibility Center site would suggest that it<em> is compatible</em>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone have a solution at this point to fix this error for Windows 8? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Social Media - AG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. You seem to be facing issues with
<span>NVIDIA GeForce GT220 while playing games on Windows 8</span>. Well, this can be frustrating. We can
 sort this out by approaching this issue in a systematic way. But, not to worry, I will help you fix the issue.</p>
<p>Let us start with a few questions-</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is this issue limited to the World of Warcraft?</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any other changes on the computer?</p>
<p>I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1-</p>
<p><span>I would have you run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “Start” and type “troubleshooting” (without the quotations) and then select “Settings”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, Click on “view all”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Run the “Hardware and Devices”.</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you run the drivers for
</span><strong><span>NVIDIA GeForce GT220</span></strong><span>
</span><span>in a compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Download the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website and Right Click on the driver.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, select “Properties”.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the “Compatibility” tab and then, select “Run this program in the compatibility mode” (select Windows 7).</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you uninstall the drivers from Device Manager first and then proceed with the steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you place the computer in a Clean Boot state. A Clean Boot state helps us identify conflicting
 applications (third party programs) interfering with functioning of the application.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps for the same-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1-</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ window type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck the ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then uncheck the box
 next to “Load startup items”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, check the box next to ‘Hide all Microsoft service’, and then select ‘Disable
 all’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under the “startup
 tab”, right click on each startup item that are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then check the box next to ‘Hide all Microsoft service’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c. Select half of the check boxes in the “Services” list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, uncheck half of the check boxes
 selected earlier.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, check the remaining boxes. Repeat
 these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and the issue persists then, that service would
 be causing the issue. Go to step 6. Proceed to step 4 if, the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If none of the services are causing the problem, then it is most likely that the startup items are
 causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The method of identifying a faulty startup item is similar to identifying a faulty service. The only
 difference being that the, “Hide all Microsoft Services” box should not be checked.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Once the culprit has been identified then, you either contact the manufacturer of the service or try
 to resolve the issue on your own. If none of the two methods work then, you may uncheck the box next to the faulty service or the startup item.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished with the troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Select the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            xbox one not recognizing xbox one discs</h2>
                    
<p>Had this issue for near 3 years. Why have I waited 3 years to report it? Simple...my life is not revolved around this hardware that fails to read xbox disc's new. So, here I am trying to get support after chat was pointless and ended. ANY xbox one disc I
 insert into my xbox one fails to read. It takes me around 10 minutes for it to see that the disc in in the drive, and that it really is a xbox one disc. Funny how my sons PS3 and PS4 do not have this issue, nor the Wii U. Blu Rays are not read until after
 10 minutes of trying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>yes it is a read disc error as the amazing tech told me after 20 minutes of chat. That is common sense, but I guess not for some. I am tired of a piece of crap $400 junk sitting flat in my entertainment center causing me stress when I want to play a game
 once a month. Xbox one is the worst investment I have made since it does not allow me to actually do anything but watch Netflix...which my Smart TV is for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus I never got a SR from the chat tech after 25 minutes of igonrance chat. How does M$ plan to address this *** up issue? Should I forget about it, or hope that M$ actually cares for paying customers?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommended that you hard reset ur Xbox one to factory setting maybe then it will read the disc if not then it could be and internal damage and Xbox HQ would have to fix.</p>

            <p>Hey fieldsg,</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the disc drive errors. I understand this solution is not ideal, but based off of the details provided in your post, it sounds like your Xbox One Console may be in need of a repair. You can begin that process over at our&nbsp;<a href="https://devicesupport.microsoft.com/en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Online Service Center</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please feel free to keep us posted along the way!</p>
