<h2>            Kinect Fan Query</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I recently bought an Xbox One and noticed that the fan on the back of my Kinect is not spinning, it hasn't spun since I setup the console. I can't find any information to state whether this fan should be spinning all the time or just when the connect gets
 hot. Does your Kinect fan spin all of the time? It's easy to see the fan at the rear of the Kinect to see if it is indeed spinning.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Spec</p>

<p>I don't think mine has spun either. &nbsp;I think it probably will once you start Skyping more and playing more Kinect-oriented games then I'm sure it would start.</p>

<p>^Do you have your Kinect above your TV? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, SpecOps, I wouldn't worry about it unless you feel that the Kinect is in a spot where it's extremely warm. &nbsp;The fan probably works if it feels it needs to cool down.</p>

    <title>Movie maker file corrupted&#47;not compatible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgv_95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Movie maker file corrupted&#47;not compatible</h2>
                    I tried making a movie twice and both times I'm getting the same error message.&nbsp; The first time I had saved the movie on a couple of occasions, but then the program shut down.&nbsp; After that I couldn't open the file anymore.&nbsp; The second time, I tried making
 the movie again, and this time saved more often.&nbsp; Again it does not let me re-open the file because it is either corrupted or not compatible.&nbsp; I tried saving it to a usb and opening it on another computer only to get the same message. The error message is
 0XC00CEE26. I need the movie for a graduation ceremony, and I still need to make another movie by next week, but I'm afraid to use movie maker again and get the same result.&nbsp; What should I do?

            <p>Please tell us;</p>
<p>Which version of windows you have and which version of Movie maker you are using.</p>
<p>The file types you are inserting in your project.</p>
<p>Whether you have the latest version of directx and graphics driver for your card from it's manufacturer</p>
<p>By saving movie, do you mean saving the project?</p>
<p>This was a common problem with a past version, so updating to the latest should sort it, unless the other items aren't up to date and/or the files you are using are not totally supported, in which case converting them would help.</p>
<p>Also, if the file has grown very large, making several small projects, saving the movie file for each and joining them up afterwards might also help.</p>

            I do have an older version of windows (windows 7).&nbsp; I don't know which version of movie maker other than windows live movie maker 2009.&nbsp; The file types are mp3, .jpg and .avi.&nbsp; As far as directx and graphics driver, I don't know.&nbsp; Where can I find that
 information.&nbsp; It was my mistake to call it a movie. I hadn't gotten that far in the process; it was still only a project .wlmp.&nbsp; The file was not very large yet.&nbsp; one version of the project is 1.81kb and the other version is 1.48kb.&nbsp; I've made movies as large
 as 240kb without any problem.&nbsp; I thank you so much for your help!<br />

            <p>avi is just a wrapper and can contain over 800 different file types many of which are not compatible with MM.</p>
<p>Your particular problem though, I hope will be sorted by installing the latest version of MM.</p>

<p>Laptop mfg's usually stop driver support sooner the component mfg's, but I see that AMD start their</p>

            The iPad will not use Bluetooth to sync.&nbsp; The sync options are 1) via wifi if both the computer and the iPad are using the same router and iTunes or 2) via USB cable and iTunes or 3) via iCloud.&nbsp; By Apple's design, the bluetooth connectivity of an iPhone
 or iPad with a computer (PC or Mac) is extremely limited.&nbsp; Per page 37 of the current iPad User Guide (iOS 5.1):&nbsp; "You can use iPad with the Apple Wireless Keyboard and other Bluetooth devices, such as Bluetooth headphones. For supported Bluetooth profiles,
 go to support.apple.com/kb/HT3647."<br />
<br />
If you are trying to connect via bluetooth to sync or to transfer pictures or files, that is not supported by Apple.&nbsp; Syncing and picture transfer is only via iCloud, USB cable, or with iOS 5 and later via wifi if both the pc and iPad are on the same router.&nbsp;
 All of those options work for me with Windows 7.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 acting as a mean, control-freak nanny - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vesnasunrider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 acting as a mean, control-freak nanny</h2>
                    <p>Some six months ago, I've gotten the latest Surface Pro with windows 10 preinstalled, unfortunately. Unfortunately, because I have worked in tech support for a computer hardware company at the time it rolled out, and we had enormous amounts of troubles with
 it - from it installing itself like some goddamn malware on people's computers without their consent, to their entire system crashing and behaving like crazy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Immediately I went on to set some stuff like I did in my beloved Windows 7 Ultimate, and I realised that Windows 10 just won't let me do it. Also, one of the first things I did was to turn of UAC and guess what - it still behaves like it's on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning Windows Updates seems impossible (everyone probably knows that by now), even if you turn off all services related to it (which, I suspect, then ruins your experience for other, should-be-completely-unrelated stuff).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, when I set the startup type to selective (which was an attempt to disable some of the unavoidable bloatware, in addition to it being my default), it turned off my wifi and sound (like in darned Safe Mode!).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edge, in an attempt to force me to use Bing search (when I tried to check how it works, in comparison to when it rolled out), would not allow me to change search engine to Google, even though there's a (completely useless) option to do it (WHY IS AN OPTION
 THERE IF IT DOES NOT WORK?!). All it did was make me install back my firefox and chrome that much quicker.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I bought and tried to install Office Professional Plus 2016 - which wouldn't install and report an error constantly. I contacted their useless support and ended up with Office Support. The first guy blabbed something about Scrub tool and something
 else I-forgot-what, connected to my computer, did nothing, typed something in LMI which I haven't seen because at the same time he was poking around my browsers (even though firefox was opened (with many tabs), he opened chrome (with also many tabs) which
 eats RAM), for some reason opened another chat window, which I closed, thinking he refreshed the page so it opened automatically (we were perfectly able to chat through LMI, and that is how we did the job back when I worked in tech support). Only after that
 did I see that he disconnected from my computer and said that he will transfer me to Windows Support team.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started chat support yet again, got another guy who was not autistic and communicated with me, and as I asked of him, informed me of the steps to be taken in advance (like is common decency and like my team did back in the time). However, he did everything
 I did before him and for some reason with him remotely connected, the installation dragged itself up to 74% (my attempts wouldn't even start it) and then popped another error code. He then said he will send me an email with chat transcript (which it didn't
 contain) and that he will write every step taken into the case (which I presume he hasn't because the next person said they don't see the steps in the case... before they got disconnected or hung up and never called back).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I contacted them to continue with the windows troubleshooting, the first person said the abovementioned, then I got hung up on twice and since I restarted computer meanwhile after which all the system text stopped showing, decided to reset the system,
 since it hasn't created a single restore point (I turn that as soon as I start the new computer for the first time) and was reporting that it is TURNED OFF (I also check volume shadow copy and other services related to SR, paging file size, if I have enough
 space etc.) even though nobody turned it off. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting windows (the nuisance of reinstalling and setting all over again all the programmes I used notwithstanding), I attempted to install the office again - to no avail. This time, the issue is that "a 32-bit office is already installed on my system"
 - it being the "click-to-run" office 365 which I don't even want. Who in their right mind preinstalls a 32-bit programme on a 64-bit system? On to uninstall that office - uninstalling it crashes every time. Every. time. on. a. freshly. reset. system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never thought I'd say this, but in 4 years now that I have been using my partner's Macbook Pro for my work, Mac OS hasn't crashed ONCE. We never had the need to make any fixes within the system, let alone bother to go through the entire, tedious process
 of reinstalling and re-setting everything. And that computer, 5 years old now, still works better than 6-month old bloody Surface!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to mention, the Surface Pro (or MacBook Pro) has never been used for porn or unsafe-websites-surfing (I presume this is hard to believe, for some of you), but strictly for work, study, movies/music/reading/shopping, and some light gaming.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I know is that this was the first and the last time we bought a PC with preinstalled system (not much of a choice on that matter in North America, or at least in Canada), and I cannot wait to go back to Europe and civilisation, where I can buy the hardware
 I want, with the system I want, which I can set the way I want, and where people's rights are still actual rights in everyday practice, not just an abstract thought.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone from Microsoft is reading this, I honestly wonder how can you people live with yourself, selling overpriced products and not even offering the support in accordance to the prices?! What does that say about your "care" about the people who pay you
 good money?</p>

            This means that you are supposed to run it as admin.
<br />
<br />Right click on the icon &gt; Properties &gt; Compatibilty tab &gt; At the bottom, you have Run this program as an administrator which you should check
<br />
<br />This you will have to it for all other problematic icons.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cdc6bfba-811a-4430-ad51-8f9b48e11422?upload=true" />

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to go to the manufacturers website in the link below install the said drivers in compatibility mode and see if
 it works:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;releaseid=R141246&amp;SystemID=INS_PNT_1501&amp;servicetag=&amp;os=WLH&amp;osl=en&amp;deviceid=9707&amp;devlib=0&amp;typecnt=0&amp;vercnt=1&amp;catid=-1&amp;impid=-1&amp;formatcnt=0&amp;libid=27&amp;typeid=-1&amp;dateid=-1&amp;formatid=-1&amp;fileid=188377" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/download.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=19&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;releaseid=R141246&amp;SystemID=INS_PNT_1501&amp;servicetag=&amp;os=WLH&amp;osl=en&amp;deviceid=9707&amp;devlib=0&amp;typecnt=0&amp;vercnt=1&amp;catid=-1&amp;impid=-1&amp;formatcnt=0&amp;libid=27&amp;typeid=-1&amp;dateid=-1&amp;formatid=-1&amp;fileid=188377</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here are the steps to run a program in compatibility mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type troubleshooter,
 and then click Troubleshooting. Under Programs, click Run programs made for previous versions of Windows.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file,
 usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Error Code: 31 means that&nbsp;a driver (service) for this device has been disabled. An alternate driver may be providing this functionality. To resolve the issue I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try reinstalling the device driver or the sync software from the device manufacturer's website and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Try installing the device driver in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update service is not running, Unable to check for updates</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows Update and Microsoft Security Essential Not Working after HD Replaced
</p>
<p>I am currently running Windows 7, 64-bit.&nbsp; I just had my ASUS Laptop (model # K52JR) sent away for servicing as the HD crashed. They successfully replaced the hard drive. However, now every time I attempt to run Windows Update I get this error message "Windows
 Update cannot currently check for updates because the service is not running. You may need to restart your computer."<br />
<br />
As well, every time I try to install MS Security Essentials I get this error message:&nbsp; "An error has prevented the Security Essentials setup wizard from completing successfully. Please restart your computer and try again."<br />
<br />
I have restarted my computer a number of times and had no success.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As for the Windows Update, I have searched through many help threads, and have ensured that Windows Updates are enabled (and automatic), that the service is running, and I have attempted to run the Windows Update troubleshooter (Microsoft FixIt). None of these
 options have worked.&nbsp; I have also attempted a system recovery 3 times, and these services will still not work.<br />
<br />
As for Microsoft Security Essentials, I ensured that all other possible security software had been uninstalled from the computer before I attempted the install of this program.
<br />
<br />
I attempted to request help from ASUS's customer service, but nobody there has been able to help me.<br />
<br />
If anyone has ideas, please let me know.&nbsp; Many thanks!<br />

            Hi again, and thank you for your response.&nbsp; I<br />
<br />
I have followed all of these steps, and tried them more than once.&nbsp; Here is what happened:<br />
<br />
Method 1:<br />
I followed these steps, and the troubleshooter indicated that it had attempted to "repair windows update components" with the results of "fixed".&nbsp; However, this did not actually fix the problem.<br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
I made the changes listed in Method 2, clicked 'apply' and 'ok' for each one, and then restarted my computer.&nbsp; Upon restarting my computer, the Background Intelligent Transfer Service had changed back to Manual, and Windows Update was changed back to Automatic
 (Delayed Start).<br />
<br />
Method 3:<br />
When I attempted to reset the Windows Update components, I received several error messages throughout the process.<br />
<br />
For example, after typing the very first command "net stop bits", I got the message "The Background Intelligence Transfer Service is not started" even though I had previously followed your steps to change it from Manual to Automatic.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I went back and repeated Method 2, ensuring that BITS was set to Automatic, and then retried the command prompts.&nbsp; This time, after typing 'net stop bits' I got the message "System error 5 has occurred".<br />
<br />
I attempted to continue following the steps, but this did not work.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have any additional advice.&nbsp; This problem only began after I had my laptop sent away for servicing, and they had reinstalled Windows 7 onto it.&nbsp; When I called customer service, they indicated that this was a Microsoft problem, but
 at this point I am considering calling and demanding that they look at it again.<br />

            <p>Hi sask1652,</p>
<p>With those other errors you are getting, it sounds like something else is going on.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I would suggest running the System File Checker tool to see if there are any corrupted system files.&nbsp; Take a look at the article
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> with instructions and further information.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

            <p>I imagine that you have fixed your issue by now but the fix is to update the IRST drivers since they replaced your hard drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The below link is for your system through ASUS</p>
<p><a href="http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;s=245&amp;m=K52Jr&amp;os=30&amp;ft=11&amp;f_name=IRST_WIN7_64_Z9601014.zip#IRST_WIN7_64_Z9601014.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.asus.com/Download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;p=3&amp;s=245&amp;m=K52Jr&amp;os=30&amp;ft=11&amp;f_name=IRST_WIN7_64_Z9601014.zip#IRST_WIN7_64_Z9601014.zip</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If those are not new enough to resolve your issue, &nbsp;than go to Intel and find the IRST drivers for your Sata controller driver (device manager IDE/ATAPI controllers)</p>

            Thanks for your reply. The problem has not yet been resolved. Unfortunately, following the first step you suggested did not work, and I am still unclear as to how to follow the second step.&nbsp; Under Device Manager/IDE ATA/ATAPI controllers it reads 'Intel(R)
 PCHM SATA AHCI Controller 4 Port'<br />
<br />
I am unsure about locating the correct drivers for this.<br />

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are using the Windows operating system, the .NET Framework may already be installed on your computer. Specifically, the .NET Framework 4.5 is included with Windows 8 and installed on your computer with the Windows 8 operating system. Similarly, the .NET
 Framework 4.5.1 is included with Windows 8.1.<br />
<br />
There is no download for the .NET Framework 3.5 for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1. You must enable the .NET Framework 3.5 in Control Panel.<br />
<br />
If you are trying to enable .Net Frame work from control panel and if you are getting the error message, then I would suggest you to try the steps from the following link:<br />
<br />
Installing the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8 or 8.1<br />

<br />Looks like your systems are a part of corportate environment.
<br />please ask on Technet forum as this is a consumer-oriented forum:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />
<br />If you face this issue, here are a few things you may want to try. See which applies to your system and proceed with those suggestions.
<br />
<br />1.... First, install all the latest available Windows Updates and scan your computer with you antivirus software. You may want to also run System File Checker to replace corrupted system files, if any. You may want to also physically ensure that your RAM, Hard Disk, and other hardware components and accessories are connected properly.
<br />
<br />2.... Boot in Safe Mode or Clean Boot State and see if the problem disappears. If the problem does not occur then it you will have to identify the offending program or driver and uninstall it.
<br />
<br />3....Run the Driver Verifier Manager to check for corrupt drivers. If need be uninstall and reinstall or update the drivers.
<br />
<br />4....Windows 10 has a Memory Diagnostic Tool which you can use to check for possible memory problems, including testing of the Random Access Memory (RAM) on your computer. Run it and see if it throws up any issues.
<br />
<br />5.... Scan your Hard Disk for errors. To run Check Disk on your System Drive (C), type the following in CMD and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />                     ""chkdsk /f C:""
<br />
<br />If required, restart your computer.
<br />
<br />6.... If you cannot log in to your Windows computer, boot into Advanced Startup Options and open an elevated command prompt window. The process is explained there in detail.
<br />
<br />Once at that screen, select Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt;  Command Prompt. Using the CMD, you can access the more advanced built-in Windows tools easily.
<br />
<br />If you wish to directly access these Advanced startup options when working on your Windows 10, you can do so via the Settings app of Windows 10 &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Advanced startup and click the Restart now button.
<br />
<br />Now you will have to enable the Legacy Boot Policy. Type the following command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />                  ""bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy""
<br />
<br />Now you will be able to log into you Windows desktop or Safe Mode to carry out the troubleshooting suggestions mentioned above.
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know, if that helps.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards:
<br />Engr. Malik Yasir

            Hi Tofeeq,
<br />
<br />Blue Screens are in general caused by a bad driver
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The following procedure describes how to remove a specific application package from the SoftGrid cache on a client PC.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open the SoftGrid Client Management Console (e.g., Start à Settings à Control Panel à Administrative Tools à SoftGrid Client Management).</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select the Application(s) object in the left window panel.</span></p>
<p><span>c. I - Right-click on the name of the application that you want to remove from the cache and select Unload from the drop-down menu. This maintains the application shortcuts and
 file associations. </span></p>
<p><span>or</span></p>
<p><span>II-<span>&nbsp;</span>Right-click on the name of the application that you want to remove completely and select Delete from the drop-down menu.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<span>Note: You must have administrative rights on the client PC to fully remove the application from the SoftGrid client cache. If a user that lacks administrative rights the “Unload” and
 “Delete” commands will not be available. A non-administrator will have the option to “Clear” an application which will remove the program shortcuts and file types for the current user.</span>&nbsp;

    <title>DVD drive does not recognise discs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffrey999  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD drive does not recognise discs</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 10 on a new machine (Bought Feb 2015).&nbsp; Two weeks ago I had no problems with my DVD drive.&nbsp; Today whether its a blank disc, a cd with music or a dvd with video when I insert the disc and try to burn the blank disc or play the music cd or video
 dvd I get the message&nbsp; "please insert a disc in drive D" and the drive opens.&nbsp; Since the machine is new I don't think it is a hardware malfunction or driver problem - I have updated the driver in Device manager and it says I have the latest driver for the
 drive, and it says the drive is working properly.&nbsp; So was there some win 10 update during these two weeks that caused this problem?</p>
<p>For those who understand these things in the properties of the drive in the tab "events" I notice this strange message&nbsp;dated yesterday:</p>

            <p>I got to Hardware and sound and worked through all the different media player instructions and none suggested a problem was detected and the situation still exists, it does not recognise discs.&nbsp;Any disc I put in , blank or with music or video, after I click
 play or burn it opens the tray and says insert a disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a. when I right click properties on the driver file there is no compatibility tab.</p>
<p>As for b. when I search for run programs and get run programs made for previous versions of windows "box" does not appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling driver file and then rebooting, still&nbsp;no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I restore windows to a week ago? or should I roll back to 8.1?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>System Image Backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meg crucial  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Image Backup</h2>
                    <p>Thank you for taking the time to read, and hopefully, respond to this query. I have to send in my windows 10 computer for some hardware repairs, so I performed a system image backup to an external hard drive. Everything seems to have worked ok, but I cannot
 seem to find any music from my itunes on there. How can I get it to backup all my itunes music? I have over 11,000 songs on there and would really hate to have to re-acquire all that music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I almost forgot. When I attempt to manually transfer the music library over to the hard drive, it only transfers about 4,000-some of the 11,000 or so files. Why would it do this?</p>

            <p>I don't think you will see the individual itunes files in your system image backup because everything is kept in one large file.&nbsp; but it should be there as an image backup contains everything on your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you are really curious, it is possible to mount a VHD file in Disk Management, then you can see the files that are in the backup.&nbsp; your iTunes music would be in the C:\Users\username\Music\iTunes folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>here is a link to a page that describes how to see what is contained in an image backup:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/extract-specific-files-windows-7-8-system-image-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/extract-specific-files-windows-7-8-system-image-backup</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>when I tried this on Windows 10, you did have to do one additional step and assign the mounted VHD volume a drive letter before you could see what was in it</p>
<p>
</p><p>be careful - this is advanced stuff so don't mess up your backup if you are unsure if how to do this</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did verify image backup works on Windows 10 - I backed up one to a large USB drive, then restored it and seems OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>to restore it, you will need to boot recovery media or the install media and click repair, then advanced options poke around for restore image backup</p>
<p>
</p><p>hopefully your hardware repairs don't change things significantly enough that you loose your windows activation!</p>

    <title>How to fix copy &#38; paste problems in Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melbyjane  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to fix copy &#38; paste problems in Windows 8</h2>
                    In Windows 8 we cannot copy (cut &amp; paste using all methods) from an e-mail into any Word document -- it will sometime copy the first selection only and after that any other selections are highlighted and copied but it still pastes only the original/first
 item we copied and pasted.&nbsp; I have seen doxens of complaints about this bug in Windows 8 but the suggestions to fix it are drastic like editing the registry or&nbsp; re-installing I.E. and Windows 8.&nbsp; Will Microsoft ever get an update that fixes it?&nbsp; I do not recommend
 buying Windows 8 !

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can't "CUT" from an email unless you have saved a copy to your machine...</p>
<p>You can't "Cut" from Yahoo Mail's server, for instance...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Copy and Paste should work just fine... I just got done doing exactly that 10 minutes ago.</p>
<p>I pasted into Wordpad, and have used a text file also.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>EDIT... I might suggest one thing though... Sometimes Copy and Paste works better if you start highlighting from the end instead of the start.</p>
