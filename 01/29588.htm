<h2>            BSOD after Fresh Install of Win 7, page fault in nonpaged area. Win 7 will not install</h2>
                    <p>One day while starting a program on my computer that I have used for years without incident, the computer suddenly crashed, rebooted, and I got the System Repair infinite loop. No changes to HW/SW, not sure if a recent Windows update was installed. Again,
 CPU, mobo, Vid, RAM have been the same for the past 4 years. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After much frustration, I decided to simply reinstall Win 7. So I deleted my partition, recreated a new partition, and installed Win 7<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>At the last step of the Win 7 installation process, it says setup can not complete. It is then stuck in a loop of reboots with a BSOD page fault in nonpaged area.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried F8 upon booting and selecting safe mode, but then it says Setup can not start in Safe Mode because the Win 7 installation did not finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling Win7 by deleting the drive again, but I get the same results.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do? </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Blue Screen with Lines</h2>
                    <p>My Surface Pro 3 is a little over a year.&nbsp; It's been doing well until recently my keyboard is acting up.&nbsp; At times the numbers will not work at all.&nbsp; When it's working the letters "L" and "K" and the period and comma are not working.&nbsp; I tried everything
 they suggested on the internet but it's still not working all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, all of a sudden I have this blue screen with vertical white lines.&nbsp; There was like a flat line sound.&nbsp; So I press the On/Off and Volume buttons together to reboot it.&nbsp; It worked but then after a couple&nbsp;hours it happened again.&nbsp; I rebooted it again
 and in less than half an hour it happened again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what is going on.&nbsp; I loved this computer and it would devastating to find out I wasted money&nbsp;on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I will have to go to the store and have them check it out.</p>

    <title>Xbox one takes long to boot up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjasauce4000  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one takes long to boot up.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everyone. Since the start of this week my xbox has been taking long to boot while in power saving mode. It goes to green normally but once it goes to black it sits there for almost two full minutes then loads the dash. I have a 2 TB external</p>
<p>&nbsp;drive attached so i thought maybe thats what caused it. Nope. I unplugged everything, did a power cycle, hard boot, cleared the cache but the issue persists. Instant on works fine but i prefer energy saving mode. Games and apps work normally once it boots
 but it taking so long to start is really bothersome.</p>
<p>Anyone else with this problem? Any solutions?</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;ninjasauce4000!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the issue! When your console is set to energy-saving power mode, it will take quite a bit longer to load to the Dashboard then when your console is set to Instant-on mode. When your console is set to instant-on mode, your console will automatically download updates. When your console is set to energy-saving mode, your console will not download and install updates until your console is powered on, meaning that you console will take time loading initially to check for updates. For more information regarding the different power modes on the Xbox One console, check out our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/system/learn-about-power-modes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">about energy-saving and instant-on power modes</a>&nbsp;page. If you feel that your console is taking longer to load then normal, I recommend trying trying a few troubleshooting steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 10 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console is powered off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes and then plug in your console.</li>
<li>Power on your console and check to see how long it takes for your console to start up.</li>
</ul>
<p>Give the suggested steps a try and be sure to let us know the results. In the future, please only create one thread instead of bumping multiple threads. This way you can receive individual support specifically tailored to you. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hello. As i said in my first post, i tried all the various boot methods. I contacted support and they assured me that a 2 minute boot time was indeed normal in energy saving mode.</p>
<p>As for bumping other threads i was actually just trying to let my fellow gamers know that there are others going through the same type of issues. Also, i was hoping maybe someone had a solid answer/fix.</p>
<p>Thanks for the response mister quimby! :) While i still don't feel as though 2 minutes is normal, i'll just stay in instant on seeing as that mode doesn't seem to be suffering any ill effects.</p>

            This just started on my xbox this morning too. Takes about 15 min to start.&nbsp; Then another 10 or so for the dashboard top finish loading everything.&nbsp; I also have a 2TB external HD. Not the problem. Ive hard booted. Not the problem.&nbsp; Unplugging for 30 sec
 then starting over.&nbsp; Not the problem.&nbsp; When in my dashboard everything i click on takes FORVER to load. Can't even play games like this. Im about to factory reset the damn thing.&nbsp; Other than that,&nbsp; i have no clue why this$300 piece of equipment can't load
 right. Microsoft.... you got issues.

<h2>            Other Side Cannot Hear ME</h2>
                    <p>I can hear the other person in a Skype call with perfect clarity.&nbsp; The other person could not hear me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had no other programs running.&nbsp; I tried all the Sound settings - mute all other sounds, reduce volume of other sounds by 80%, reduce volume of other sounds by 50%, do nothing.&nbsp; The problem continued at all of these settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My microphone produced fine results on the Echo Sound test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This worked fine for a year... and then after forcible updates, it just stopped working.&nbsp;

    <title>Xbox one auto scrolling downwards - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samlloyd98  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one auto scrolling downwards</h2>
                    <p>I turned on my Xbox one and the homepage was scrolled all the way down. Anything that is opened is immediately scrolled downward. I have used various controllers both wired and wireless and the problem persists. I have tried loading up games and apps, but
 it hasn't worked. It is impossible to do anything on the Xbox, and the only way it can be stopped is by pushing the left analogue upwards, which just pauses the inevitable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may be noted that turning the controller off does stop it, however doesn't solve it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi samlloyd98,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate this issue so that we could figure out what's causing your Xbox One from automatically scrolling downward. Kindly provide us the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>May I know when did you notice this issue?</li><li>Can you tell us if you recently updated your Xbox One?</li><li>Does the issue occur even if the controllers are not connected to your Xbox One?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you power cycle your Xbox One console by performing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Xbox</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button<span>
</span>on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds.
<p><strong>Important</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.</p>
</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in.</li><li>Press the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Xbox</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>buttonon your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

                    So I just subscribed to a Skype Number. I need to make sure it wont cost my friends anything to call me on it. I live in Asia and they're in Denmark. If they have free unlimited calls from their phonecompany and they call my skypenumber, will it cost them
 anything extra to call my skypenumber when I'm abroad?&nbsp;

            It depends upon following factors -
<br />
<br />1. The Skype number is bought for a particular country irrespective of country you live in. You living in Asia doesn't matter. What matters whether you have bought a Denmark Skype number or not.
<br />
<br />2. Hence, if you have Denmark Skype number, it will cost nothing to them.
<br />
<br />3. Otherwise, they will have to use international dialling and it depends upon their plans whether their plans allow free international dialling or not.

<h2>            My Halo MCC not working </h2>
                    
<p>I did the digital pre order, I downloaded the game and waited until the release date ... ok. On launch day (11/11/2014), I started the game ... but I had an unfortunate surprise when I was hit start to start the game .... the game
 crashed and went back to the Xbox dashboard. I thought it was nothing and entered the game again ... but again the error happened, the game crashed and went back to the dashboard. Then I reinstalled the game to see if it solved the problem ... but no, the
 game continued with the problem. And now what do I do? I stare at the wall?</p>

                    The Skype Chrome extension is supposed to create a Skype button in Google Calendar, but it doesn't do it for me, and from what I can tell in the forums, it's not doing it for many people. I see a bunch of places where Microsoft says it will look into it,
 and, well, they never come back to explain or offer a fix. Has anyone figure this out yet? Thanks!

                    <p>My husband works and uses Skype for Win 10.&nbsp; He has no problems messaging others within his office. He is on the most recent version for Win 10.</p>
<p>I use Skype for Win 7, also most recent version.&nbsp; Some days I will send him messages and only get one or no responses.&nbsp; (I also have Skype for an older android phone.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, I received a message that made no sense and when I questioned him I got no response.&nbsp; When he called me he said he'd sent me messages all day and thought I was just not getting them or was ignoring the messages.&nbsp; The next day, same thing.&nbsp; I was
 messaging and getting no responses and as it turns out he had messaged me but I neither got them on PC nor my phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again this morning, no messages so he sent me a text message saying I must not be getting messages or ignoring him.&nbsp; Eventually, he resent them and I received them. I've not had a problem since this morning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He suggested I should turn off SYNC in my settings.&nbsp; Even sent me a screenshot of his settings where I would turn it off.&nbsp; Win 7 does not have that.&nbsp; In fact, the comparison of Win10 to Win7 settings is ridiculous.&nbsp; As I told my husband it's like Win10 people
 being given art pencils and Win7 people being given homemade crayons.&nbsp; I logged off of Skype on my phone to see if it helps that I'm only logged in to one device.&nbsp; I also went to Report A Problem on Skype (within the messenger) only to find out after submitting
 my problem that you are only submitting feedback.&nbsp; They offer for you to contact them. I clicked it and it opened a full browser page chat message.&nbsp; I spoke with "John Christian C" where I stated my problem and asked if anyone else had reported the issue.&nbsp;
 What I got was 20 minutes of broken English (no offense to non-natives, I get it, ya'll need to work too) wherein he didn't really seem like he understood, never answered if anyone else had reported it and told me that he would like to add me to a test message
 to see if they could duplicate the problem but in order to do that they had to request permission to gain remote access to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point in our chat I had enough.&nbsp; My response was, "That's adorable, but NO.&nbsp; I do not trust Microsoft or Skype to send my messages and I do not trust them to remote access to my computer.&nbsp; If this is the only option to fix the problem I will deal
 with it on my own or I will delete Skype."&nbsp; I then thanked him, told him to have a fantastic day and closed chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that ANYONE would need ANY sort of remote access to anyones computer to tell me whether or not others have reported a problem with Skype to Skype chats not going through is a disgustingly huge violation of privacy.&nbsp; I'll be emailing a few people
 today about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I want to do with this post is :</p>
<p>1) Ask if ANYONE has had a Skype to Skype message problem wherein the messages are sent but do not arrive to who you sent it to</p>
<p>2) Warn anyone NOT to just give up remote access to your computer.</p>
<p>Good grief.&nbsp; You'd think I'd not have to type that out.&nbsp; </p>

<p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/be332b95-61e9-4d8d-b4b4-5dbe5e6a6254" title="KeishaJL1">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>First off, thank you for reaching out to us. Regarding the messaging issue, this could be due to the usage of different Skype versions. However, to isolate the case, kindly provide the following:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this <strong>happen to all </strong>or <strong>just a particular contact</strong>?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What <strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10659/what-version-of-skype-am-i-using-on-my-computer?q=skype+version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">exact Skype version</a></strong> do you have installed on your devices?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I understand your concern regarding the remote access. It is actually part of Skype's real-time assistance for customers. I believe the agent asked for your permission and you were given an option to decline or to close the chat window&nbsp;should you
 feel uncomfortable with it. Please be assured that we at Skype take security and privacy a top priority and will not use remote access to destroy that trust.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We will wait for your reply. </p>

<p>I apologize for my delayed response. I could not find a response or my question and my son graduated High School so I was too busy to look for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have many contacts but most of them use Facebook now.&nbsp; Of the two I have still in my list, it only happens to one of them. I do not know the version of Skype or Windows of the other but with my husband, as stated, he has Win 10 and the most current version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too have the current version at all times.&nbsp; I have Skype version 8.22.0.2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The chat assistant did ask politely for remote access and I did decline, and will.&nbsp; I can't imagine there's no other way for Skype to figure out what is wrong without accessing my computer via remote access.&nbsp; I appreciate your assurance but please understand
 that I do not at all find it assuring.&nbsp; We are in a place and time when no person or corporation can be "trusted" with secure information.&nbsp; A person can't go out to eat without the risk of the restaurant database losing their information and their identity
 stolen. Microsoft admits that Win 8 and 10 (and now 7 thanks to an update) can turn on any microphone and listen to your conversations but swears it's only for search purposes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I told your chat assistant, if the only way you can figure out why a message is not going from one Skype to another Skype is by gaining remote access then I'll find another program. Are there no other options?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Congratulations on your son's graduation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you try checking if the messages went through when logged in to <a href="https://web.skype.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Web</a>? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that <strong>you are signed in to the correct account</strong> and that
<strong>your contacts are sending messages to the same account that you are using</strong>. Provide them the specific Skype name / account that you are using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly&nbsp;try <strong>uninstalling</strong> and <strong>reinstalling your Skype application</strong>.
<strong>Logging out </strong>and <strong>signing back in </strong>to check if the messages will update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We currently do not have reports about issues with messages not being received. Of course, it is your option to decline remote access and we respect your decision. However, if the issue is unresolved by our probing and troubleshooting done here in Skype
 Community, the next step is to <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10656/what-is-live-chat-support?q=live+chat" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I tried the Skype for Web and all of the messages are there, both mine and my husbands. When I compare the web version with my logs, his aren't there on my end because I never got them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I only have one Skype account so he could not be messaging me elsewhere.&nbsp; He's receiving mine, I wasn't receiving his.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled several times.&nbsp; I uninstalled all old instances and removed it from .appdata as well as anything in the registry that may have remained.&nbsp; I uninstalled it from my phone after logging off from both of them. I removed it
 from everywhere I could think of and instead I installed the Classic version.&nbsp; So far I have not had a problem with missing messages.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have trouble with the newer versions of skype until somewhere around May 18.&nbsp; I don't think it happened before that. If it did it either wasn't often or I didn't know about it (as I wouldn't have seen the messages I was missing anyway).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for assisting me.&nbsp; I really do appreciate it, though I'm sure I don't always sound that way.&nbsp; If I'm the only one who has reported it then I can't imagine there will be any sort of fix for me.&nbsp; As I said, with Classic, I do not seem to be having
 the same issues now so if you like we can call this one completed.&nbsp; If I have a problem with it again I can start another post but thank you for your help.</p>

<h2>            Dell studio 1558 win 7 64 BSOD with Atikmpag.sys, dxgkrnl.sys and dxgmms1.sys</h2>
                    <div>I have dell studio 1558 laptop. It has ATI radeon 5470 graphics card. I am updating windows on regular basis. It was working fine till last month i.e May 2013 but but then display driver started to crash &amp; showing message 'Display driver has stopped working
 and has been recovered'. A few times, the screen goes completely blank (sometimes blue screen error comes up) and when I reboot, nothing appears on display (Not even BIOS), but other hardwares such as fan, cd-drive are started. After trying rebooting many
 times, it randomly starts. I tried installing different versions of display driver. It works fine for some days and again same problem starts.<br />
</div>
<br />
OS Version : win 6.1 (Build7601, Service Pack 1)<br />
<br />
Installed <u>ATI Mobility Radeon HD 5470 v.8.742.0.0000, A23</u> from DELL website but problem not solved and also tried installing latest driver from AMD but problem remain same.
<br />
<br />
so now uninstalled all ATI drivers and using laptop with awkward display settings.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What programs are you trying to install?</div>
<div>2. What is the exact/complete error message you get when you try to install start menu shortcuts of programs?<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may want to follow these steps and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In addition to Linney's suggestion, I'd suggest you temporarily disable all security software and try.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.&nbsp; In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable
 it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
You could install these programs after creating a <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/Windows-vista/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
new user account</a> . If the issue is fixed in a new user account, then, most probably you had a corrupted user profile and may want to&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fix it</a> .<br />

<p>Neither running as an administrator with anti-virus disabled nor installing it on a new user account worked.</p>
<p>I've tried installing BootSkin and Unreal Tournament III. Both give the same error with different directories:</p>

<p>Can you clarify that you appreciate the difference between being an Admin user, and the "Elevated" option of right-clicking on an .exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator", as these are two different things and we may be talking at cross purposes?</p>
<p>Another thing that you can try is to browse to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs, and see if you can create a New Text Document in there.&nbsp; If successful remember to Delete it (if you can).&nbsp; This will check out your user's access permissions
 to that location.</p>

            Yes, I am able to create a text document as there doesn't seem to be any permissions problems. I am an Admin user AND I clicked the "Run as Administrator" option, so that's surely not a problem.

<p>What happens to the installs if you pre-empt the error and create the Directories, BootSkin&nbsp;and Unreal Tournament III, in the appropriate location?</p>
<p>Are there any logging created by these installs that allow you to see where it might be falling down?&nbsp; A program like this might show you some behind the scenes details too.</p>

            Even when I preemptively create the folders, it still fails to create a shortcut. I don't believe there are any logs for their installers and Process Monitor doesn't seem to be showing anything about them. I am running Vista, and they're both compatible
 with Vista. Bootskin is the only program not compatible with Windows 7.

<p>To me, the error does not seem to be the physical creation of the shortcuts in the Start Menu but perhaps more to do with Registry locations that may be referring to them, but I am not really that sure.</p>
<p>Did you check the permissions in the Registry are correct&nbsp;by looking at either of these articles?</p>

<p>Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it
 does, restart&nbsp; it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried cleaning out your Temp folder, you can do it by typing %temp% in the Start Menu RUN box.&nbsp; This will open your Temp folder, there you can delete everything that Windows will allow you to do so.</p>
<p>It may be necessary to show Both Hidden and System Files, and also to uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ Folder Options/ View, to navigate to the mentioned Temp location.</p>
<p><br />
This example might or might not work for you with your program?</p>
<p><br />
"It seems that the "Run as administrator" command only gives you some administrative privileges, and they're not enough to install Java (and OpenOffice, by association). In order to get around this, you need to actually log into an administrator. Open a command
 prompt with admin rights by clicking start, typing cmd into the search/run box, and hitting CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER. At the prompt, type:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:yes</p>
<p>Then log out of your regular account and back in as the administrator, where you should be able to install the program. When you're done, log back into your regular account and, for security purposes, disable the administrator account using:</p>
<p>net user administrator /active:no "</p>

<p>None of your suggestions managed to fix the problem. I don't know why, as it should have overridden any security constraints. As to Process Monitor, I cannot find anything related to the attempted writing of a start menu shortcut. Event Viewer will not work
 for a very strange reason. The service required to run it won't start and gives me an error message as follows:</p>
<p>Windows could not start the Windows Event Log service on Local Computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Error 4201: The instance name passed was not recognized as valid by a WMI data provider.</p>
<p>Are there any reasons this could occur?</p>

<p>Just reading a few of these again indicates a permissions type of problem, we seem to be going around in circles.&nbsp; I wonder if it is not time to save your valuable data and consider a clean install?&nbsp; Sometimes when an operating system gets itself into such
 a perceived mess this really is the only solution and there is a lot to be said for a new fresh clean start.&nbsp;</p>

<div>Hi <strong>JKTang</strong>,<br />
<br />
1. Any recent software/hardware changes on your computer which led to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Cause of the issue:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This error comes up with Intel GUI Graphics interface. You need to reinstall your Intel drivers. Some of the users have also stated that it could be an issue with the .NET Framework.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer to the link below about this error on Intel forums.<br />
</strong><a href="http://communities.intel.com/message/94385;jsessionid=CCDC232665E038CDADA1FC1732A00D8D.node7COM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://communities.intel.com/message/94385;jsessionid=CCDC232665E038CDADA1FC1732A00D8D.node7COM</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>In the meantime, follow this and check.</strong></div>
<div><strong>Download and install the drivers manually from the website.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Is the audio skipping problem fixed in Windows 8.1&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stanleycatt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is the audio skipping problem fixed in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    I migrated to Windows Pro 8.0 a week ago from Windows Ultimate 7.0.&nbsp; I was disappointed when I heard intermittent skipping in my music.&nbsp; I like to play music while I work but its annoying to hear the skipping.&nbsp; It's like listening to my old scratchy albums
 on a phonograph.&nbsp; I didn't have this problem on Windows 7.&nbsp; I have a Dell Studio XPS 9100 desktop PC with an Intel Core i7 3.46 GHz processor and 12 GB RAM so I should have no performance issues running Window 8.&nbsp; I have Bose speakers connected to it via a
 USB 2.0 port.&nbsp; Does anyone know if this audio problem will be fixed in Windows 8.1?&nbsp; If so I'll wait it out with this problem until Windows 8.1 is released in mid-October.&nbsp; If it's not fixed I'm going back to Windows 7.

            <p>Hi Stanley,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have not seen any audio skipping problem in Windows 8.1. However, as you are facing issues with audio in Windows 8 operating system, I would suggest you to follow these methods to troubleshoot:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the <b>
Playing Audio</b> troubleshooter:</p>
<p>a. Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Control panel</b></a>.</p>
<p>b. Click on <b>Troubleshooting</b>.</p>
<p>c. Click <b>View all</b> on the left pane of the screen.</p>
<p>d. In the list of options, click on <b>Playing Audio</b>.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Next</b> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>Follow these steps to disable speaker audio enhancements:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/where-is-control-panel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Control panel</b></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click <b>Hardware and Sound</b> and then Click on
<b>Sounds</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under<b> Playback</b> tab, click <b>Speakers</b>, and then click
<b>Properties</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the <b>Enhancements</b> tab, and then select the
<b>Disable all enhancements</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you don't see an <b>Enhancements</b> tab in the
<b>Speakers Properties </b>dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated. If disabling audio enhancements does not solve the problem, contact your
 computer manufacturer for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b>Method 3</b><span>:</span></p>
<p>I would suggest you to update the drivers for the audio on the computer and check if the issue persists:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + R</b> and then type “<b>devmgmt.msc</b>” without quotes and press
<b>ENTER.</b></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on the device and click <b>Update driver software</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try downloading the drivers from the manufacturer’s website manually and then try to install it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is no drivers for Windows 8 operating system, you may try to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

            I am having a similar problem with windows 8.1<br />
I recently upgraded from windows 8 to 8.1<br />
Previously I hade ZERO problems running videos. Now programs like HULU and YOUTUBE are having video lag problems. Please note, this is NOT a buffer issue, the videos can be buffered 100% and this will occur.&nbsp;This computer is not even a year old and is fairly
 high performance. I have no problems running modern, high graphics, games on my laptop but I am having random video skipping and lagging issues playing videos online. Also I have noticed that since the update GIF images wont play anymore. The only way to get
 them to run is through internet explorer. Previously I was able to run it through 'Photos' and it worked flawlessly.

 to ever get back on windows 10..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also if i want a clean install of windows before the upgrade to remove old regkeys and such should i do it before July or will windows be like a clean install? Like will it remove old unused keys upon upgrade? And will there be a option to keep programs
 installed on 8.1 or remove them and do clean install?</p>

            <p>A clean install does exactly what it says, it erases the drive and removes the previous version of Windows along with previously installed programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade using Windows Update or the .ISO media, your recovery partition will become inoperable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have to make up your mind, you want a clean install, but you want to keep your programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to preserve your programs, you must do an in place upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly advise you upgrade and if you want to, do a clean install after.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also initiate a clean install by doing the following:</p>
<p>You can do a clean install a couple ways.</p>
<p>Press Windows key + i</p>
<p>Click Update and Security</p>
<p>Click Recovery</p>
<p>Under Remove everything and reinstall Windows, click Get started</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>At the Sign in screen</p>
<p>Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power icon on the screen</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Click Troubleshoot</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Click Reset</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I reinstall Windows using the recovery partition? </strong>
</p>
<p>Windows 10 will be reinstalled.</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</em></p>

</p><p><strong>Will ISO media be provided for the final release? </strong></p>
<p>Yes, you will be able to download ISO media for Windows 10 RTM. </p>
<p><em>Please note, you might have to download the appropriate edition of&nbsp;Windows 10 for the version/edition of Windows you are upgrading. If you upgrade to the wrong edition, ie. Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Pro, you will have to purchase a license

<h2>            Skype</h2>
                    I'm using my new Skype username provided by Microsoft, but when I go to contacts I can't find a way of manually entering a new contact. Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<h2>            my computer is running ridiculously slow, and that blue circle comes up all the time</h2>
                    A few weeks ago a colleague sent me a video file to open.&nbsp; When I clicked on it, I was asked if I wanted to open it with Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I clicked yes.&nbsp; It took 51 minutes to download, then came up with sound only -- no picture.&nbsp; That's not the
 problem, though.&nbsp; The problem is that now my computer is running ridiculously slow, and that blue circle of doom comes up all the time, making it hard to open programs like Picasa or Firefox (everything, really).&nbsp; And it often leads to something saying "program
 not responding" and my computer freezing up.&nbsp; How can I get back to the way things were (which was quick response times for programs to open) before I tried to download this stupid video?&nbsp; (by the way, I'm running Windows 7, I think)....
