    <title>Entire computer freezes when playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 &#40;blue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coasterfreak220  say:</h3>
<h2>            Entire computer freezes when playing Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 &#40;blue screen without seeing blue&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>When playing <strong>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2</strong> , my <strong>Toshiba Satellite A215-4757 laptop</strong> freezes (sometimes after about a half hour, or sometimes less than 5 minutes).&nbsp; The game worked fine until I upgraded to
<strong>Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit</strong> (previous windows version: <strong>
Vista Home Premium 32 bit</strong> .)&nbsp; As far as I can tell, all my drivers are up to date, and regular programs, such as Firefox and Outlook run fine.&nbsp; I'm not sure about my other full-screen games, as I haven't tried to play them yet.</p>
<p>I have the game set in compatibility mode for XP service pack 2, but before I did that, the same error occured.</p>
<p>The error when I finally force shut down and turn the computer back on is named
<strong>Blue Screen</strong> (though when the computer froze, there was no blue screen, just the frozen game image, and the sound was still running like nothing happened.)&nbsp; I can't remember the other information in the error.</p>
<p>Error timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>I open the game, and it loads fine. </li><li>I go through the menus and select the park I want to play, and it loads fine.
</li><li>I'll be working or looking around/whatever else I'd do to the park, when suddenly it freezes.
</li><li>I turn off the computer, and turn it back on. </li><li>Start-up takes a tad longer than normal. </li><li>Windows opens the error message (for which I do not remember the details.) </li></ul>
<p>Specifically what I mean by freeze (obvious, maybe, but just trying to be specific as possible): &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>No mouse. </li><li>No ctrl alt del capability. </li><li>No alt tab capability. </li><li>No windows button capability. </li><li>Required to force shutdown with the button on the computer. </li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?&nbsp; Also, I'm not sure what other information that you would need to know, so if there's more detail needed, just ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello coasterfreak220,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 is not compatible with Windows 7. You would need to have Windows xp mode in order to install and run it.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Anyone else play Onigiri? It's a F2P JRPGMMO found in the Marketplace. It's a little on the dated or ugly side (Graphic wise) but it has something that many, many, many AAA Games as of recent lack entirely, it has a soul. It's
 fun to play has great Characters (sometimes really funny) and plenty of addicting things to do.<br />
<br />
Also expect a lot of Death from nothing more then Latency aka lag death but it doesn't impact the fun in the slightest. Fair warning, you'll either love it or hate it. And it may stick many Achievement obsessive people with two 1 Point Achievements.</span></p>

<p>Hello everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>I tried Onigiri for 2 1/2 hours and then I promptly deleted it.</p>
<p>........</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun playing Onigiri &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>.........</p>
<p>The reason that I got rid of it was because before I got my Xbox One, the only game that I played was Diablo 3 vanilla (grinding).</p>
<p>Then, when I got my Xbox One, the only game that I played is Destiny (grinding)</p>
<p>Long story short, I am going to stay away from " Grinding Games " for a while LOL &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Also, I didn't like the fact that there was a lot of the women in the game seem to have problems with wearing clothing &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>This lack of apparel really turned me off on an otherwise very fun and enjoyable game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>............</p>
<p>I could totally see myself playing this game for quite a while if I hadn't already been " Grinded Out " by Diablo 3 vanilla /&nbsp;Destiny and if the women in this game had more dignity for themselves.</p>
<p>..........</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>........</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Just to say a few things. <br />
<br />
First, it's not really "pay2win". There is nothing in the Game that cannot be earned by simply playing the Game. Even the exotic clothing from the Shopping Plaza can be obtained via Gotcha Tickets. The GT's can be earned like any other Item In-Game by simply
 playing the Game.<br />
<br />
As for for the Player Bazaars, as a Player you have no option to sell Weapons/ Magatamas or other Items via Credits (Gold/ In-Game Currency). The Bazaar only allows Players to sell things via cash. I would suspect this is to cut down on endless farming and
 "sharing" top tier Weapons and such.<br />
<br />
It does have a "grind-wall" but that goes pretty much hand in hand with most all RPG's. It's kinda like saying, "I wish 3rd Person Actions Games didn't have so many things to fight".<br />

<p>I liked Neverwinter but eventually got annoyed of the Capital City being a giant shop who's purpose was to make you aware that there were shops and that there were shops to buy shops and did we mention there's a shop?</p>

<br />
There are Channels to play in. The Game will assign Channels based on variables but you can switch it at almost any time (provided your not in Party). Channel 1 in the main hub is the "crowd" of High Level Shop owners and such (sometimes too much). Channel
 8 seems to where the new Players are dumped.<br />
<br />
The Game itself never really forces any shop on you. It's there if you want it but again most of the Items you get via playing the Game give you free access to shop items.<br />
<br />
As for DL. I don't know if there are any plans for a UK release. I do know that some Players DL'd the Japanese Version well prior to the US Released Version by switching their Region. The legitimacy of that, that's up to those who use it.<br />
<br />
I never played NW so I can't comment/ compare on the two.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the replay.</p>
<p>"The Elder Scrolls Online" has a shop. &nbsp;At least it lives in the Menu so its not really in your face as you play the game.</p>
<p>Yeah, its a little dodgy switching your region since the Terms and Conditions of LIVE forbid you from mis-representing yourself in such a fashion with the possible penalty of being banned or losing your account.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">In Onigiri, the Games Store is nothing more then part of the Menu called "Shopping Plaza". A Player can literally go through the entire Game without ever once having to visit it. You will look through it but that's only when you
 want to.<br />
<br />
The Player created Bazaars are not so subtle as they are In-Game. But even those are kinda fun seeing what people have for sale at different Levels. It gives you a good idea of good and bad Weapons that will be well ahead of your current Level.</span></p>

    <title>Alarms and Clock app not working on my desktop on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomasrimestad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alarms and Clock app not working on my desktop on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>For maybe one or two weeks ago, the Alarms and Clock app that came with the Windows 10 upgrade stopped working. Everything works as normal except that the alarms just turn off automatically when it's supposed to go off instead. So up until about a week or
 two the alarms rang as they should and an interface showing what alarm it was appeared on the right side of the screen as it should. But now it doesn't happen anything anytime. I also tried to delete and re-add the alarms, but it didn't fix anything. I tried
 to uninstall the app, but I simply couldn't click the "Uninstall" button. I could see it, but not click it.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
What do I do? Any help is much appreciated!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you posting on Microsoft Community. </p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Some PCs might automatically switch from sleep to hibernate after a period of time to save power. This can keep your alarms from sounding. To prevent this happening, keep your PC plugged into AC power.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Alarm App comes preinstalled with Windows 10, it will not give option to Uninstall it.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Let's try the below Steps and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: If installed from the Windows store try to run a <strong>
Windows app troubleshooter </strong>and check.<br />
<strong>Refer:</strong> <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><div><strong>Step 2</strong>:&nbsp; Try the<strong> PowerShell Steps for Fixing Store App
</strong>from link given below.</div>

            <p>I found out that the actual problem was that the "action centre" or whatever it is called in english (I'm norwegian) was put on "silent mode" or whatever it is called. So when I put off the silent mode, everything was back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But how did it get on silent mode? I did nothing on purpose to turn it on silent mode :P</p>

<h3> kcurry7  say:</h3>
<h2>            VCRuntime Error</h2>
                    <p>My HP computer was acting poorly, giving me an error as soon as I logged into Windows 10 Home and acting poorly in general, so I did a factory reset that wiped the drive and reinstalled Windows, but, it did no good as I am suddenly getting a VCRuntime error
 upon logging in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coincidentally, I also just reinstalled Windows 10 Pro not once, but twice on my Surface Book because it would not let me install my drivers and was acting poorly between the two reinstalls, and since the second reinstall, has suffered a BSoD - happened
 almost immediately after the reinstall with some sort of header pool error. I've barely had the Surface Book for six months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both are running the Creators Update and the problems started upon the Creator's Update being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any advice? It's been too long since the update to roll back, and the one time I tried rolling back to wait out the bugs, it just reinstalled the update I'd rolled back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP I could go back to original Windows 10, BUT, my Surface I cannot because the drive I had the backup recovery image on went bad.</p>

    <title>Dedicated Video Memory. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> terry shivachi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dedicated Video Memory.</h2>
                    Hello again fellow members. Windows 10 with the latest upgrade is a further much better OS, for both beginners and expert users, right? As for my issue, the Dedicated Video Memory on my device, HP Notebook 15, is at a really low value (128MB only). Need
 For Speed Most Wanted by Criterion lags when I run it hence forcing me to plug in my charger to experience a smooth run. I have a feeling this is not a good thing to do on my device as the laptop fan really heats up. A laptop technician advised me to downgrade
 my Windows version to Windows 7 Ultimate so as to have the system memory shared much evenly, something which I hesitated to do because I believe there is a way to solve the issue. Anyone who can help me out there? I will appreciate much.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If an application that you are using lags or have performance issues, it could be that components of the app are damaged or corrupted, or that your PC does not meet the requirements of the application, etc. For us to isolate the issue in running an application
 on your computer, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you tell us if the performance issue is observed when running a different application?</li><li>Did the issue in using the application occur recently? If so, have you made any changes to your computer or to the application before the issue started to occur?</li><li>Have you checked if your computer meets the system requirements for the application?</li><li>Regarding to your computer heating up when plugged in, have you checked the fans are free from dust and if the exhaust port is not blocked by dust or dirt? With dust and dirt, the heat from your laptop may not dissipate thoroughly.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            Hello there David Haz. Thank you for your response. Well, those are a bunch of questions you've asked me but I'll try my best to answer them. Firstly, my app components are all well but my Notebook PC doesn't sort of meet all the requirements but it can
 support the game, that's a sure bet. In regard to <strong>question 1</strong>, all other apps are running well, no lags and no need to plug in my charger to experience a smooth run, but I have not tried to run another game with such an advanced enhancement,
 in terms of graphics and that other kind of stuff. As for <strong>question 2</strong>, whenever I open the app the same occurrence comes up and am now avoiding running it since it causes a heat build up. I have however not made any changes to it but just downloaded
 the latest drivers for support of the latest Windows 10 version. In regards to <strong>
question</strong> <strong>3</strong>, I have been thoroughly checked my PC and I noticed that, yes, it does not meet all the requirements, but they are minor (those that my PC does not meet).
<strong>Lastly</strong>, I am so paranoid of my PC that I don't handle it carelessly, but this fan noise is really disturbing. I have however not made any attempt to opening it up because I fear risking, as I am not a technical expert.&nbsp; Anyway, wherever I use
 it I always ensure the place is dust-free.&nbsp;

<p>In most cases, your computer manufacturer has already configured your computer to use the maximum amount of graphics memory possible. We recommend that you check with your computer manufacturer for the actual maximum memory supported by your device. Also,

            Hey there, 
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 10 will not boot, then the best thing to do is to re-install Windows 10 again. This time, I would install it from an ISO available on Microsoft site. 
<br />
<br />Please look at this article for more information: 
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a> 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps, and hope this fixes your problem. If this happens again, then we can look into how and why this is happening. 
<br />
<br />Regards,       
        </p>

<br />
<br />
When files are deleted from the computer it is sometimes, but not always, possible to recover deleted files with special software.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;You mention Outlook and the Recycle Bin.&nbsp; However deleted emails do not go in the Recycle bin, they go in the Deleted Items folder.&nbsp; Either you meant to say you emptied the deleted items folder or you didn't, it's impossible to tell from your post.&nbsp; If
 you didn't empty the deleted items folder, your deleted emails will still be there.&nbsp; If you did empty it, sorry buy they're gone forever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the game. </p>

<p>Are you able to run other games without any issues? <br />
Have you tried installing the game in compatibility mode and checked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check with the manufacturers website if the updated drivers are available for the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the required information and the results, we are happy to help you further.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the version of your Sticky Notes, I think you should be using Windows 10 Anniversary Update. If you use the Store app, you should be able to get version 1.8 which fixes a majority of the issues in version 1.0.136. Alternatively, if you upgrade to
 Creators Update or Fall Creators Update of Windows 10, you should be able to use our latest release, version 2.1 which is even more stable.</p>
<p>

Happy note taking,</p>

<h2>            Laptop fails to connect to wifi even when correct password is used</h2>
                    <p>before I went on vacation I was connected to the wifi with no problems, but while I was away, I had a problem and had to reinstall windows<br />
now im back 10 days later and when I input the correct password it does not connect, "cannot connect to this network"</p>
<p>here is a list of things I have already tried</p>
<ul>
<li>restart the router</li><li>restart computer</li><li>reset network settings</li></ul>
<p>I don't know too much about computers so please answer in a noob friendly way</p>
<p>thanks in advance,</p>

            Hi Lucas.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's a PITA and I'm sorry you're going through it, but I'll give you everything possible to do so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using whatever method given here that works:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode by one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options for Command Prompt.  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> shalvea  say:</h3>
<h2>            accidently two xbox accounts</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>for some reason my usual MS account was not linked properly to my former existing xbox accout. thats why I cannot choose my usual gamertag because its already used.</p>
<p>there is an account with my name (as you see here) but i habe no idea how to reactivate it, because i checked all the mailadresses i ever used and there is only one registered and thats the "wrong one" i am able to use now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried to reach out to MS Support but only got linked here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i tried the "get your mail adress" video but it says that there is no possibility to find your adress by using your gamertag (which is quite a mess if you ask me)</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any hope to get my original account back?</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards</p>

<p>Hi Shalvea,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft account receives a gamertag and an Xbox Profile linked to it whenever you add that Microsoft account to any Xbox or if you use your Microsoft Account on Xbox.com. Once the Xbox profile is created using the email associated with the Microsoft
 account used to set it up, that email address can no longer be used to create another Xbox profile.The email you want to use to sign in may have been used to create an Xbox profile at some point unintentionally. The gamertag you are trying to sign into may
 have an email you created during set up as that is an option given during Xbox initial set up. Microsoft emails include Hotmail, MSN, Live, or Outlook domains so it could be possible the email associated with your gamertag may be with one of these.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only Xbox Support can potentially help you recover your account if all you have is your gamertag, but they won't be able to help you if you can't verify the account with either an alternate email or phone number that may be on the account for security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you can recover your account.</p>

            Hi Brian, my name is Martin and I'm an Independent Advisor. I'll try to help you here.
<br />Unfortunately there is no Bitlocker app for Android or IOS devices that Microsoft provides. I recommend that you try to find some third-party applications for this purpose.

            Hello, BrianWarren2,
<br />
<br />Microsoft does not provide a Bitlocker application for Android or IOS devices.
<br />
<br />There are alternative softwares for Android
<br /><a href="https://alternativeto.net/software/windows-bitlocker/?platform=android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://alternativeto.net/software/windows-bitl...</a>
<br />
<br />dislocker is a tool to decrypt Microsoft’s BitLocker encrypted volumes from Linux or OSX. 
<br /><a href="http://tuxdiary.com/2015/03/20/dislocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://tuxdiary.com/2015/03/20/dislocker/</a>
<br />
<br />Perform a search for ios - Bitlocker app

<h2>            Windows 10 and Super Live Pro</h2>
                    To begin, my father is 98 and lives alone. I installed survelance cameras from CCTV, and for me to see the live streaming videos, I must have the app, Super Live Pro. Of course, Windows 10 will not let me install it because it is not in the Windows store.
 I must be able to see my father. I guess that means I have to get rid of Windows 10 on my computer and buy a new cell phone, but it came&nbsp;already installed in&nbsp;my computer and on my cell phone is an Alcatel&nbsp;with Windows 10.&nbsp;I have no disk. Help!

            <p>What do you mean "because it's not in the Windows store"? &nbsp;You are absolutely free to install anything you want, even if it's not in the app store. &nbsp;Just put in your CD disc that came with the camera and install it.</p>

<p>It's a software, not a cellular app (although Superlive Pro is that too). Just download it/insert the CD and install it.</p>

<p>Am a little unclear if this is a phone or PC problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If its a PC/Laptop then nothing to stop you installing the software from CD or downloadable media.&nbsp; There is no restriction of only using the store (unless you're running Windows 10S).&nbsp; Only restriction is if the software doesn't work on Windows 10 (ie:
 the manufacturer hasn't supported Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we're talking about the problem of installing the app onto a Windows 10 phone then you are slightly more stuck.&nbsp; Modern phones run from their respective stores (be it Android, IOS or Windows).&nbsp; If an app is not available in the store then generally its
 not available on that platform.&nbsp; There is sideloading and jailbreaking but that's probably left to people who really know about playing with the core phone O/S and I wouldn't recommend for general user activities.&nbsp; Does the software supplier list Windows 10
 phone as supported?&nbsp; If not then not a lot you can do other than get an Android or IOS based phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final note on the phone front, I loved Windows 10 on my Lumia, but it was the lack of wider app support that caused me to end with it.&nbsp; I am now on an Android phone and love it, I have the full Microsoft suit as well as the Android app store, win win!</p>

    <title>Folders being created in drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travisireland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folders being created in drives</h2>
                    <p>So on all the machines I've updated to Windows 10 it appears that random folders are being created. &nbsp;An example of names would be 0b1341cfb9f5930421c01431. &nbsp;Now I know that these can be created when Windows Updates are installing a package, however, there
 generally ends up being about 200,000 created and in each drive before it stops creating them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/eaf95a36-0238-4bad-9608-ea9f02ab4aa4" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now these are created quickly and usually contain a single folder called Sandbox which I do not have access too. &nbsp;It does require elevated permissions regardless of UAC being on or off to access the top level folder. &nbsp;You can delete the folders as they are
 created but it is persistent and will keep creating these folders. &nbsp;I have 3 drives on one machine and it happened to all three of them. &nbsp;Currently it is doing it on my root drive. &nbsp;I have run Antivirus and Antimalware scans. &nbsp;I've done drive repair scans.
 &nbsp;Looked for services and event reporting. &nbsp;Removed SYSTEM write and modify permissions to my two secondary drives and still these folders were created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea where these folders are coming from or how to stop them? &nbsp;Again this has happened on my personal desktop running Windows 10 Pro. &nbsp;And my two work computers running Windows 10 Enterprise. &nbsp;On my personal I had Windows 10 Home which
 is where it started and finished. &nbsp;When I upgraded to Pro it did it again.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing with the randomly created folders&nbsp;on Windows 10, we will help you with this this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that these folders might have created by some viruses in the operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However you have ran the anti-virus software and issue still persists, I suggest you to perform the below.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Log-in with administrator account and delete all these empty folders. Restart the computer and check if folders still exists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists then try the below:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot in Safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Start computer in safe </span></strong><span>mode.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>Settings</strong> in the search box on the desktop, select
<strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Here select <strong>Change pc settings</strong> and then
<strong>General</strong>.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>Restart</strong>, select <strong>Safe mode</strong> and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Perform <strong>Clean boot</strong> to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Putting your system in <strong>
Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>

            <p>Still no updates on this? These solutions doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're currently testing Windows 10 Enterprise and have the same behaviour but the user is not part of the Administrators group so he can't delete these folders. Also, I don't see why users should delete temporary folders created by Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, after 2 weeks, I have around 20 random folders. </p>

            I'd say that would be the root cause however I've removed SCCM from my Windows 10 Enterprise machine a while ago and it is still happening. &nbsp;Also I had the exact same issue on my personal Windows 10 Pro machine which isn't connected to a domain. &nbsp;So yes
 I think it's just a coincidence.

<h2>            can&#39;t install Win10 update &#40;0x80070426&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Starting on June 15th, my father's PC (Dell XPS 8910, came with Win10) started getting this error when checking for Windows or Office updates. There was a hardware change around this time -- adding memory, and during that he left one of the internal drives
 disconnected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help: (0x80070426)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read that this can be related to activation, but it shows it is (<em>Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account</em>) tied to his Microsoft account, which he logs in with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's even more bizarre, it's like the entire PC has lost its connection to MS, which is why I think it's failing. If I pull up Edge, log into https://account.live.com and check his devices, this particular PC is listed but supposedly hasn't been seen since
 June 15th, even though I'm logged in from it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what I see:</p>
<p><em>Last seen at ‎6‎/‎15‎/‎2017‎ ‎3‎:‎22‎:‎27‎ ‎PM in City, ST</em><br />
<em>See previous location on map</em><br />
<em>We can’t reach your device right now. It might be offline.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>It shows it's running the version it was on June 15th, and it shows that missing drive, too. I have been manually installing the updates since then. This is driving me nuts. I've tried all the DISM stuff, sfc /scannow, etc. I'm completely stumped and would
 like to get this resolved. Resetting the entire PC is an absolute last resort.</p>

<p>I just wanted to follow up with the solution in case others are having this issue and finding nothing outlined online works. I've only tried fixing it periodically since he lives in another state and I didn't want to risk TeamViewer throwing up a 'suspected
 commercial use' for staying connected several hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What ultimately fixed it:</p>
<p>1) delete the computer from his account.live.com 'devices'</p>
<p>2) download the Windows 10 Upgrade Assistant and download the full version of Win10 to do a complete 'upgrade,' even though it took me back to an earlier build of 15063. Patching then worked again.</p>
<p>3) change the login from Microsoft account to local, reboot, then switch back to Microsoft account</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything's now working normally again.</p>

</p><p>I have exactly the same problem. In my case there is however no 3rd party software. I just made an upgrade of a clean win 7 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>GUI is very unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start menu takes 10-30 seconds to show.</p>
<p>Ctrl+Alt+Delete takes about 30 seconds to show the screen.</p>

Notification center takes about 10 seconds to show after clicking the tray icon... And so on.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to resolve my issues by uninstalling my wireless KB and mouse drivers. This returned the performance back to what I expected from my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you ensure that all of your drivers are W10 compatible and update where required, it will be a trial and error process but I think that this will resolve the issues for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Brad</p>

            <p>Hm, do you have by chance a Wireless adapter with Ralink chip? This might really be a problem. I have a one more BIG problem with my Win10 installation. It wouldn't connect to my Wi-Fi network (although it sees the networks), it just says that it couldn't
 connect. With win 7/8, there was no problem with my Wireless card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing is I tried USB wireless card as well. It wouldn't connect as well, but maybe I need to uninstall my internal Ralink card first (u just disabled the connection).</p>

            <p>OK, now I installed Steam on my C drive (fast SSD disk). That is the only 3rd party software at this point but&nbsp;I don't think that matters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway looking at my resource monitor and task manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/03d3f709-e944-4b7b-9b46-c27919e5241d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>It show 35 % utilization although the disks aren't really doing anything (the processes are sorted by disk usage).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ce6e7dd3-4808-4bb7-a143-56bdfd1ed165" /></p>
<p>Looking at performance tab, it shows that disk D: is under a full load (it is a HDD, if that is of any relevance).&nbsp;I don't see why because it contains only the Steam library (not the Steam itself). There's nothing else on the disk.
</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76ef034a-54b1-451e-a30a-753a1cf1c26a" /></p>
<p>It seems the System process is doing all this heavy load. But why? What does it do with the disk?</p>

            <p>Check what directory it's trying to write or scan. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found after a recent patch it had changed to temp variable to another user account and all the high disk activity was it trying to write to directory in which it didn't have access.</p>
<p>

            <p>Sorry, but from what you wrote&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't really understand what exactly I should write to the command prompt. However, %temp% and %tmp% points to the C:\Users\APrin\AppData\Local\Temp Which is OK I guess...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway running chkdsk on the drive showed some serious issues. I'll try to solve that first. chkdsk complains about not having enough free space...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It reads like this:</p>
<p>"the disk does not have enough space to replace bad clusters detected in file 15636 of name
<em>somefile</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is about 161 GB free space on the drive, which is 70% of the drive, so mathematically, there should be no problem. It is also possible that by free space it&nbsp;means some unallocated space the disk uses as a replacement for bad sectors. I was not able
 to google what exactly does&nbsp;it mean by&nbsp;"free space" though&nbsp;(there were some answers but not consistent enough to make my opinion).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try o move the data out and do&nbsp;a full format of the bad drive.</p>

            The disk is probably damaged. But it has nothing to do with my Win10 issues. However uninstalling the Ralink RT61 Turbo Wireless LAN Card driver seems to have done the trick. I will do some more testing though.

    <title>Additional objects for Hologram app within the Mixed Reality Portal - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Additional objects for Hologram app within the Mixed Reality Portal</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just bough the HP Mixed Reality goggles for my Asus GL502VS (i7 7700HP, 16GB RAM, GTX1070), running Win10 Pro (64 Bit,&nbsp;OS 10.0.16299.192). Having played around with it I quite liked the Mixed Reality Portal and the growing possibilities of Apps being added
 to the "building". I wouldn't mind it getting bigger and maybe a little more complex over time, but for the time being there is still a lot to play around with. As I was tinkering around with the Hologram app where you can select objects to add to your building,
 I was wondering wether is a possibility to add additional objects to that app and where they would actually bee stored within Windows. I have a few .obj files I'd love to add into the Mixed Reality portal, first of all some awesome Mechwarrior Battlemechs
 that I would let tower over my building. These .obj files are already easily usable in other 3d apps within Windows at that point (e.g. Paint 3d, Mixed Reality Viewer etc.), so I reckon the Hologram app shouldn't be too far off for that matter. On the other
 hand I could conver 3d files into a specific file type, if I would know what filetype, how to set the parameters within the filetype and of course, where to put it in the end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can point me in the right direction and thanks in advance for any input. If this question has already been asked and answered I apologize for any redundancy. I was digging around the net and this forum but didn't find anything even remotely
 going into that direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an additional feedback to Microsoft perhaps this:</p>
<p>Since Mixed Reality is becoming a big feature within Windows I would recommend to add the Term Mixed Reality as a possible theme/topic to the Forum theme/topic list or even a category.</p>
