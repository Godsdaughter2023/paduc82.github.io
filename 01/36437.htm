<h2>            Error code &#34;WindowsUpdate_00000643&#34; &#34;WindowsUpdate_dt000&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I recently ran "AlienRespawn" on my M17x to restore my computer to it's factory condition (it shipped with 64-bit Windows 7). After moving over all files I could think of and making sure the computer seemed ot be running alright, I went to update windows.
 I installed about 130mb worth of various security updates and the like, however, I am now unable to install the following 5 updates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Update for Microsoft Silverlight (KB2416427) </li><li>Security Update for Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Service Pack 1 Redistributable (KB973923)</li><li>Security Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack 2 for x64-Based Systems (KB954430)</li><li>Update for Microsoft XML Core Services 4.0 Service Pack for x64-based systems (KB973688)</li><li>Security update for Micrisoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (KB973924)</li></ul>
<p>Any time I try to install them individually, or install them all together, I get "Error Code 643 - Windows Update encountered an unknown error". I searched around and found that the 2 fixes that were most commonly used reffered to fixing MSI (something),
 easily done using a microsoft fixit script, and/or reinstalling/repairing .NET Framework on the system. Any time I try to run the MSI fixit script, I get an error code 2203 about 5 seconds in. I have run the .NET framework cleanup tool, however whenever I
 try to reinstall any of the .NET frameworks, it says that the file requested was not found (or something along those lines) and closes.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it's related, however when trying to delete the "Backup" (which was basically my hard drive prior to the AlienRespawn), I am able to delete<em>everything</em>&nbsp; exept for "C:\BACKUP\10-12-21 1053AM\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed\Flash" containing
 "Flash10I.ocx". Whenever I try, it says that I need to obtain permission from "&lt;My computer\My current user&gt;", which I think I already have, since it's me.&nbsp; There are no other users on the computer.</p>
<p>I really can't think of anything else to do (and can't find anything else to do) other than wiping my computer again, which I really don't want to do, especially for the next 2 weeks (which are supposed to be enjoyable), please help :(.</p>
<p>Edit: In addition, whenever I try to install something like iTunes/Quicktime, it crashes with an error telling me to make sure that a file (C:\Users\Sean\Temp\&lt;stuff) (or something along those lines) exists and to make sure I can access it (which I can).</p>
<p>Thanks ahead of time,</p>
<p>Sean</p>

<p>1. ESET Smart Security 4 (Subscription is current), Spybot Search and Destroy (though I checked and made sure this wasn't doing funky things), (?) Malwarbytes Anti-Malware ('Free' Version), as well as the 'firewalls' in my d-link router (although that was
 extremely uselss information, most likely)</p>
<p>2. A McAfee trial 30-day version was installed in the factory on this computer, it was delete originally but when I ran alienrespawn this program did reappear (-First thing I did upon logging in was uninstall it via add/remove programs, however)</p>
<p>3. See ^</p>
<p>Thanks for the quick response, by the way.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>For MSXML updates....</p>
<p>Try the following.</p>
<p>Go go <strong>c:\windows\system32</strong> folder</p>
<p>search for msxml4.dll and msxml4r.dll and rename to msxml4.old and msxml4r.old respectively.</p>
<p>Go to windows and select only the 2 updates KB954430 and KB973688. Install. Let us know the results.</p>
<p>In regards to flash file in you backup folder, may be permissions are not available (remember.. the backup files are from you old OS and the new OS may not have access to all files)</p>
<p>So try this. (give full permission to all the folders under backup)</p>
<p>Open <strong>cmd</strong> with elevated privelages.</p>
<p>type the following exactly</p>
<p><strong>Cacls "C:\BACKUP\10-12-21 1053AM\Windows\SysWOW64\Macromed" /T /G Everyone:F</strong></p>
<p>Follow the prompt "Y" and then enter</p>
<p>you can also copy and paste the command.</p>
<p>Try to delete the file..</p>
        </p>

<p>McAfee (and Norton) applications are notorious for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly.</p>
<p>1. Download the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp;<a href="http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.mcafee.com/products/licensed/cust_support_patches/MCPR.exe</a></p>
<p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select Run as Administrator to run the utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>4. Reset IE8 Advanced settings per <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>5. Open IE8 32-bit&nbsp;(only) to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> [ignore APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes. [1]</p>
<p>6. Reboot one last time &amp; test.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of Installed Updates.</p>

<p>Yes I did, without success.</p>
<p>With regards to the running as administrator, I did this, however the program crashes just after I hit the first "next" button, at the point where it says "The mcirosoft fix is being processed.", see picture:<a href="http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/7270/fixbroked.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img593.imageshack.us/img593/7270/fixbroked.png</a></p>
<p>(And yes, I saved it to my computer (I had actually done this before) and made sure that everything I could possibly to do make it run as administrator was done(I also tried 'resaving' mthe fix multiple times))</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Ram,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried both of those fixes (since I really don't want to have to clean install again), the update one resulted in windows updater again saying that the updates were unsuccessfully installed (However, and this may be important, the two files were "msxml3.dll
 and msxml3r.dll" (instead of ...4.dll). When I tried to delete after that CMD line, I was told that the folders were no longer located on on the C drive, meaning I could not tamper with them or something.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway,</p>
<p>Sean</p>

            <p>If your printer is the Epson Stylus Photo R300 then this page:</p>

<p>indicates that you have to install your printer using Windows Update. These drivers are often basic and do not have the full-functionality that will come with dedicated drivers from the manufacturer's website. This may explain why you no longer have ink
 level monitoring.</p>

            The HP offers more performance, especially if you will be studying engineering and working compilers. 
<br />
<br />Also, you could always upgrade the RAM if you need to keep a VM for testing and other scenarios. 
<br />
<br />The Lenovo is more robust though and it will likely last longer and has a nicer design.

            Hi Dylan, honestly either system will be more than good enough for a Computer Science degree. Both would happily run Visual Studio or whatever Programming IDE the college prefers to use
<br />
<br />But, the HP Envy x350 15-bp101na is by far the superior system, the specs are streets ahead of the Lenovo
<br />
<br />I am a software developer and compiling code  . . .etc. will be much faster on the HP
<br />
<br />Both systems have a quad core processor, but the i7 processor has quad core with 8 threads - definitely the HP over the Lenovo . . .

            Hi HermanPena 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with Windows 10 hanging.
<br />
<br />Do you mean your Windows is hanging on the circling dots?  If so,
<br />
<br />If your computer/laptop does not start up, start your computer/laptop in Windows Recovery Mode.  
<br />
<br />1.)	Turn on your computer/laptop, as soon as you see Windows starting to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button until it shuts down.  (Do this two times)
<br />2.)	On the third time to power up, Windows should start up in Recovery Mode
<br />3.)	You will see several options System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt… select Safe Mode
<br />4.)	If are able to go in Safe Mode, go to Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Option-&gt; Startup Repair
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t work, keep going through the same process selecting a different option each time. . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand you want to split files in Windows or DOS without using an additional software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no software inbuilt in Windows which does this. You might need to have<span>&nbsp;
</span>an additional software which does this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance, we will be happy to help you.</p>

            <p>As our software is dependent on .NET Framework 3.5, it is possible that the error you are experiencing is in relation to this. I would advise you to try the following solution:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Download the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

2. Allow the tool to apply its recommended settings.<br />
</p>
<p>3. Once the repair is finished, reboot the computer.</p>

            <p>Hi bo_6,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand, thank you for the information.</p>
<p>In this case what I would like for you to try is to do what is known as a complete reinstall through the steps below.</p>
<p>This reinstall removes everything that has to do with Dymo and lets the computer start fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would also like to ask if you upgraded to Windows 10 or if it was a clean installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling Dymo:</p>
<p>Step 1 - Removing Dymo Drivers<br />
The LWSupport utility is provided by DYMO to uninstall DYMO printer drivers in Windows.&nbsp; To run the LWSupport utility, follow the steps listed below:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Disconnect the USB cable from the computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Open the Printers folder.<br />
* Start &gt; Devices and Printers<br />
* Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Devices and Printers</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Remove any Dymo printers present in here</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Close the Printers folder</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. When DYMO Label software was installed, a subfolder entitled Support Files was created in the DYMO Label Software folder, which is located in: C:\Program Files\DYMO\DYMO Label Software. In the Support Files folder is the file LWSupport.exe.<br />
<br />
6. Double-click on the LWSupport.exe file. A DYMO Label Support Tool window will appear. Select Remove DYMO Printer Drivers and click OK.<br />
<br />
7. Click Remove. This will remove any DYMO printers from the Installed Drivers field. &nbsp;<br />
Afterwards, click Close. When prompted, select Yes to restart your computer. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
* If you see an error message after clicking Remove, restart your computer and re-run the LWSupport utility.
<br />
<br />
7.1. Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Add/Remove Program or Programs &amp; Features &gt; Then remove the DYMO programs in the list of installed programs. When done restart the computer and delete the following folders:<br />
<br />

<h2>            Your hardware settings have changed</h2>
                    Almost every-time Microsoft updates windows 10 this happens.&nbsp; I get the message "your hardware settings have changed.&nbsp; please reboot your computer "&nbsp; OK my hardware did not change and I can reboot my computer 100 times and still get the same message.&nbsp;
 I know this has something to do with my AMD driver and video card, but the driver is fine and up to date.&nbsp; This is a Windows problem.&nbsp; Sometimes it will go away after a while.&nbsp; Sometimes it will stay until the next windows update.&nbsp; Windows needs to fix this
 or at least post a proper way to deal with it.&nbsp; All I can find is that I need to update the driver on my AMD card.&nbsp; No .....the driver is the latest one.&nbsp; Oh. I can uninstall it and re-install it and that will make the notice go away.&nbsp; But the driver is fine.&nbsp;
 The card is fine.&nbsp; This is just a notice that needs to go away.&nbsp; So Windows.....PLEASE fix this.

            <p>Hi Benny, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 operating system automatically downloads drivers that are important on your computer's system. Since you have a dedicated graphics card, Windows will download and install the driver software. After doing so, it will prompt you to restart your
 computer. If&nbsp; your driver doesn't work, Windows 10 will reverse the update and the message will pop up saying: "Your hardware settings have changed" and will ask you to reboot your computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can suggest is to download the updated driver from your video card's manufacturer's website. Also, try to uninstall the device driver from the
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. Kindly follow the steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right click the Start menu and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>. </li><li>Click the drop down button of <strong>Network Adapters</strong>. </li><li>Select and right click on the AMD driver and click on <strong>properties</strong>.
</li><li>Click the Driver tab and click Uninstall. </li></ol>
<p>Once all methods are done, kindly restart your computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>
<p />

            <p>Hi snowbunny23,</p>
<p>Im sorry to hear about the troubles you are facing with the CD drive. </p>
<p>You mentioned that "the cd isn't showing up in windows explorer", are you referring to<br />
the compact disc or the drive itself?</p>
<p>Are you getting any error messages?</p>
<p>Lets try these methods to check if the issue gets resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run the hardware troubleshooter<br />
a)Press the ‘Windows + C’ to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom
<br />
right corner of the screen and you will get the charms menu.<br />
b)Click on ‘search’ and select ‘settings’ and type ‘Troubleshooting’ and select ‘troubleshooting’.<br />
c)Click on ‘Hardware and Sound’ and select ‘Hardware and Devices’ and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Check the device status in Device Manager</p>
<p>a)Press "Windows key +x" and click "Device Manager"<br />
b)Expand "DVD/CD Rom drives" and check to see if the drive is showing</p>
<p>c)Right click on the drive and click "Properties"</p>
<p>d) Check the device status here and let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> Update drivers from device manager<br />
a)Press "Windows key +x" and click "Device Manager"<br />
b)Expand "DVD/CD Rom drives" and check to see if the drive is showing<br />
c)If the drive shows, right click and click "update driver software"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4:</strong> Install the latest CD drive drivers from the Toshiba website<br />
If Method 2 does not work</p>
<p>a)Press "Windows key +x" and click "Device Manager"<br />
b)If the drive shows, right click and click "uninstall"<br />
c) Follow the link to get the CD drive drivers from Toshiba</p>

<p>If no Windows 8 drivers are available, download the Windows 7 drivers and<br />
follow these steps to install them in compatibility mode<br />
a)Download the drivers for Windows 7 from the manufacturer’s website.<br />
b)Right-click on the driver and click on "Properties".<br />
c)Click on the ‘compatibility’ tab and check the box "Run this program in <br />
compatibility mode for” and select Windows 7 operating system from the drop down.<br />
d)Click on ‘Apply’ and click ‘OK’ and run the file to install it.</p>

    <title>High Definition Audio Controller Driver Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sunil manohar  say:</h3>
<h2>            High Definition Audio Controller Driver Error</h2>
                    <p>My laptop crashed recently and when it restarted, there was no sound available. The sound icon in the taskbar says: "No speakers or headphones are plugged in".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what I have done so far:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Opened Device Manager to find the faulty driver. The driver in question is the "High Definition Audio Controller" driver under the "System Devices" tab. I have tried to update it online with no luck (the latest drivers are already installed), update it
 via list of drivers already present on my system (Code 10 error: The device cannot start), uninstalled it and tried to reinstall it via Windows Update and also automatic reinstall after restarting the system. The issue has persisted. I cannot rollback to the
 previous driver version as that option is greyed out.</li><li>Run Memory Diagnostic checks, SFC checks and DISM checks and tried to repair the system via those. No system integrity violations found.</li><li>Updated all device drivers either manually via Device Manager or Driver Updater software like IOBit Driver Booster 6/DriverPack Solutions.</li><li>Updated GPU drivers to the latest version.</li><li>Performed a Safe Boot to check if issue persists (it does) and also performed a clean boot to check for issue. The issue persisted when all third party services along with startup items were disabled. So the issue is most definitely related to Microsoft.</li><li>Restarted Windows Audio Service from the Services window.</li><li>Updated Windows to the latest version. I am currently running on Windows 10 Home Single Language v1903 with OS Build 18362.175. On a side note, I was facing the same problems in the last version (v1809) as well without any solutions, but it went away for
 a while after I updated my system. So rolling back to my previous build will not help.</li><li>&nbsp;Selectively uninstalled Windows Updates from the past few days to check if the issue was update related.</li><li>Run a system scan to check for malware via both Windows Security and Bitdefender Total Security. Both turned up negative.</li><li>Checked registry in H_KEY for any errors.</li><li>Tried to find alternative driver without any success (The problematic driver is hdaudbus.inf, located in C:\Windows\INF)</li><li>Checked my laptop's manufacturer website for latest drivers.</li><li>I shouldn't need to clarify this, but I obviously ran the Windows Troubleshooter for sound problems without any success.</li></ul>
<p>I am currently on MSI GV 62 - 8RE, if it helps.</p>
<p>I would also appreciate if you would not suggest a clean reinstall of Windows. Given that this is primarily a WIndows OS issue, the problem will only reappear later down the line and I can't be reinstalling Windows every few weeks when this pops up again.
 But apart from this I am open to other suggestions. Please let me know if you need any other information.</p>

            Hi Sunil.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems. If you've tried them already I'd do them over in sequence shown.   If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1)  Update the sound driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />It is NOT enough to update drivers from Windows Update or Device Manager "Update Driver" button which only queries Windows Update.  The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is how to keep the latest manufacturer's drivers current:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Next try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br />

</p><blockquote>Hi Sunil. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems. If you've tried them already I'd do them over in sequence shown. If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />
1) Update the sound driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. While there compare to make sure you also
 have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers. <br />
<br />
It is NOT enough to update drivers from Windows Update or Device Manager "Update Driver" button which only queries Windows Update. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is how to keep the latest manufacturer's drivers current:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> <br />
<br />
3) Next try this checklist: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a> <br />
<br />
4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps. If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby.
<br />
<br />
5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />
6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.
<br />
<br />
7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />
8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver
 tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. <br />
<br />
9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick response. I appreciate you taking the time for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the steps mentioned, I have already come across your posts in other queries and been through your checklist to no avail. If you read my post, you will notice that I have already mentioned that I have taken many of the steps you have suggested. I am
 not open to do a clean reinstall because I believe that it does not solve the problem; rather it just pushes it down the road further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other suggestions, I will gladly try them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Sunil -
<br />
<br />I addressed the need to repeat steps you might have already tried in the first paragraph. I didn't even address a Clean install.  
<br />
<br />But when was the last Clean Install?  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My apologies for the miscommunication. I misread your last suggestion for a Repair Install as a Clean Install, and was merely reiterating my point that it is not the road I would like to go down. With regards to your query about a clean install, I am afraid
 I haven't done that on this system yet. I am still running the OS that came with the system and haven't really seen a reason to start over given that I update my system regularly and keep it free from malware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, I would still like to reiterate that I have done that you have already suggested, having come across your posts in other requests before, and following through the checklist you have outlined above and elsewhere. I still have no sound on
 my system yet. I understand that you want me to do my due diligence, as is proper and expected of me, but asking me to check if the issue is being caused by the 1809 update when I have clearly stated that I am on the 1903 version makes no sense to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have said before, if you have any other suggestions apart from a reinstall, I am all ears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for taking the time to do this. I appreciate it.<br />

            Hi again Sunil -
<br />
<br />Are you running the Realtek driver from MSI downloads here:
<br /><a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/support/GV62-8RE#down-driver&amp;Win10%2064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.msi.com/Laptop/support/GV62-8RE#dow...</a> ?
<br />
<br />The reason I ask is that you can get in trouble using driver updaters which no expert recommends.  Because the manufacturer for a gaming rig like yours usually modifies the drivers you want to stick with their drivers unless otherwise indicated.  
<br />
<br />So compare the chipset, display, audio, BIOS and all other downloads available on that page with what you presently have installed in Device Manager and change them out if necessary.  
<br />
<br />Also, how soon after the 1903 update did this crashing start?  Did you try rolling back as shown in the steps I gave earlier?  If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:   
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>.
<br />
<br />After 10 days you can reinstall the older version using downloads available from Microsoft TechBench here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD using WIndows Image Burner or create bootable flash using one of the options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As suggested, i uninstalled all the driver updates and used the MSI driver Updater app to update my drivers. My current driver version matches with the latest versions in the MSI site now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The loss of sound happened about a month after i updated to 1903. I'm sorry that i can't provide a more precise date: it happened over the course of a routine update and i noticed the change only after a few days of usage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like rolling back to 1809 is not a useful strategy as i had the same problem when i was on it too. I updated Windows after going through your answer in a different post about a month ago, and that seemed to rectify the problem for a while. I hope
 you understand my reluctance in rolling back my Windows OS back to 1809 now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'm just making sure we are on the same page on this: the problematic driver is the High Definition Controller Driver, which is released by Microsoft and not by any other third parties. Can you suggest some steps to rectify that, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate your continued support</p>

It is possible that the app installer could be corrupted. To properly isolate this issue, kindly verify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tried installing the app to other computers?</li><li>Does the issue happen while installing other apps?</li><li>Have you tried performing a Windows update to check for .NET Framework update?<br />

We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update 80072F8F Error</h2>
                    
<p>I'm fighting with my Vista Home Premium computer to get windows updates installed.&nbsp; Whenever I do that, it gives me a 80072F8F error.&nbsp; When I look around for solutions, they typically involve checking the date/time(done and this is correct), registering
 some dlls like softpub.dll, initpki.dll, wintrust.dll, and mssip32.dll, and running the program at this site -<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/system_maintenance_for_windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/gp/system_maintenance_for_windows</span></a>.</p>
<p>I don't have initpki.dll on my computer, but the other three are there and registered.&nbsp; When I run the program, it says that no errors are found.&nbsp; Yet, I still get this error.</p>
<p>Does anybody have any ideas about what to do next?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            Thank you for the reply. The time and date are definitely correct. I have verified this manually and with the program that I linked to in my original post. One of the checks is for the date/time and it says that they are fine.

<h2>            Unable to change display resolution</h2>
                    <div>Hi all, need help here, any kind reply is appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Recently, I just upgraded Windows version from 8 to 8.1. Everything seems working fine except that there is an issue with my display. I cannot change the display resolution to the original&nbsp;<font color="#000000"><span>1360×768, which works fine on Windows
 8&nbsp;previously. Instead, it just locked to 1024x768 (Recommended). &nbsp;I have the latest driver installed, which is the Intel(R) HD Graphics (8.15.10.2900) and the display looks crappy and blur. I tried to change the settings in the advanced settings but to no
 avail. The weird part is I notice it is using Microsoft Basic Display Driver, instead of the Intel driver. I can't replace this driver either. So I suspect there is a compatibility issue.</span></font></div>

            After trying every possible ways of changing the drivers, I found the solution for this. What I did was,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>1. Roll back the driver back to Microsoft Basic Display Driver.</div>
<div>2. Restart PC.</div>
<div>3. Update to the latest version of Intel Graphic Card Driver.</div>
<div>4. Restart PC again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything is working fine now. Thanks :)</div>

<h2>            Scanner install</h2>
                    <p>Hello everybody and thank you for taking the time to answer my question, my name is Bodhivata and I am from Brooklyn NY</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Epson Perfection 2400 Photo scanner which i have been using for a while. It happened in the past, from time to time, that I had to re-install the scanner to make it work and then everything was fine. Suddenly yesterday I tried to use it and it
 wouldn't start (connect to the PC so I tried re-installing it again - no luck. After trying several times I came to think it may get blocked by something that came in one of the lastest WIN10 updates which i know are troublesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: "Does anyone know the work around this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that I have no interest in starting or participating in a war of words between who is responsible OS-Epson-PC etc so please don't provide answers along those lines. I AM SIMPLY INTERESTED IN THE SOLUTION if anyone has it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you kindly, you can also email me directly at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>

            Hi Claudio.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use the same steps as for printers that work for most everyone:
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the printer software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next copy and paste in Start search box:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash).
<br />
<br /> 4) Right click result to Run as Administrator.   
<br />
<br />5) Open the Print Server properties, Remove the printer’s drivers for this printer and for any other printers you don't use presently.  If you get a message about access denied or the printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the printer again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the printer to delete the Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the printer model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.

    <title>Why would a cellphone interfere with a 3.5mm headset&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why would a cellphone interfere with a 3.5mm headset&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Evening!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been banging my head against a wall for weeks trying to figure out why, with my new One S, my headset cuts out for ~10 seconds at a time.&nbsp; Happens upwards of a dozen times in a ten minute match, which is infuriating given that I need to be able to hear
 people coming up behind me.&nbsp; At this point I'm running my controller wired to eliminate WiFi interference and even that didn't remotely fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in a last-ditch effort, I turned off my cellphone and played a few matches.&nbsp; No cutouts.&nbsp; Consistent sound all the way through.&nbsp; Why would this be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>That is kind of a strange issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree with&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1236dce6-16e1-4896-9a31-2ce8e6dbf3e5" title="MarsNeedsTacos">MarsNeedsTacos</a><span>
 try turning of Bluetooth. It does sound like you have localized it down to the phone causing the interference.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If Turning of BT does not help then I would recommend turning off Wi-Fi and see if that helps. You might also turn of cell service, put in airplane mode to see if that helps. if you figure out which one is the issue Wifi or BT or cell then
 you might have some options when playing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Otherwise as&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/c30a1c99-1f10-465d-bfb9-86678e067232" title="At the Nozzle">At the Nozzle</a><span>
 Suggested just place the phone at a distance away where it does not cause the interference.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Good luck.</span></span></p>

            Hi Tony, 
<br />
<br />I’d uninstall and reinstall VLC. 
<br />
<br />Click start - settings - apps - find VLC, click it, and uninstall. Reboot, and then download and install again. 
<br />
<br />If still the same issue, let’s try to update your video driver. 
<br />
<br />Click start and type “Device Manager” - and select it from the list of results.
<br />
<br />Expand Display Adapters, then right-click on your video driver and select Update Driver. 
<br />
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software.
<br />
<br />Give this a shot and let me know!
<br />- C

            Hi there Tony, thanks to (Greg Carmack, Microsoft Community/directly) I have a possible solution.
<br />"Please uninstall VLC in Settings&gt;Apps, restart PC and then reinstall it from this link only: <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html</a> 
<br />
<br />After install set it as default Media Player if you want at Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Default Apps. Or you can open it to run it for the file types you want, although it should pick up during install most file types that WMP or Windows TV and Movies won't run. "

            Hello,
<br />Try updating display drivers.
<br />Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

<h2>            window can&#39;t open add printer.  access denied..</h2>
                    
<p>Running a win7 HP Pavillion dv 6000.&nbsp; Have downloaded all the lastest updates. the printer is installed on a wireless network.&nbsp; I can print to it, and scan from it, and ping from the cmd line and see the printer.&nbsp; yet it does not show up in devices and printers.
 And when I do try and add&nbsp;the printer,&nbsp;I get the window "can't open add printer. access denied."&nbsp;&nbsp;When I tried it from the cmd line it wants me to install it on the network.&nbsp; its already installed and working on the network. The printer and scanners both appear
 in the device manager, altho I have to open "view hidden devices" to see them, but they tell me the drivers are not installed but they are.</p>
<p>I am logged in as administrator.&nbsp;BTW I have also just installed the same printer on a new hp win7 desktop and&nbsp;and it worked fine. i can also access it from another laptop running xp. all on the same network.</p>
<p>Don't think it would bother me as much if it DIDN'T work, but it does work.&nbsp; The machine just won't tell me its there!!!</p>
<p>Many thanks to any who might lend a hand.&nbsp; And I know "if it ain't broke don't fix it."</p>

<p><span>Hi Worktel,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Do you have any third party security software installed on the computer?</span></li></ul>
Step 1</span></span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>
<span>I would suggest you to access the link below and follow the
 steps in the article to </span><span>run a printing troubleshooter</span><span>.&nbsp;</span>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Why-cant-I-print</a></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the printer troubleshooter does not help you fix the issue and if you are still unable to open add printer,</span><span>You
 may also try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and try to check if can install the printer and print. If gets detected and if you can print, you may contact the security software Manufacturer and check if you need to change any settings.
 Later re-enable the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not help, you may try to create a new administrator account on your computer and check if you can install it.</span></p>
<p><span>To create a new user account, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button Picture of the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety (or clicking
 User Accounts, if you are connected to a network domain), and then clicking User Accounts.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Manage another account. Administrator permission required. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click Create a new account.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type as Administrator, and then click Create Account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it works fine in the new user account, you may access the link and follow the steps to&nbsp;<span>Fix corrupt user
 profile<strong>:</strong></span><br />

<h2>            Malware in Windows 10</h2>
                    &nbsp;Over the last few days I have been getting a lot of malware, mainly Trojan:win32. I ever received a phone call from a woman who claimed to be from Microsoft and that they were receiving a large number of malware alerts from my IP address. I went to my
 laptop and turned off the Microsoft account and went Local accounts. Hey, no more malware!!! So what is going on! It appears that the malware is coming from Microsoft!

            if I were you, I would invest in a great software program called Malwarebytes, I have been using it for coming on 3yrs now and its detected quite a bit over the yrs and if your at a link that's unsafe it will tell you instantly and quarantine whatever

            &nbsp;I have loaded and used Malwarebytes. It has cured the Trojan:win32 problem I was having. I knew the Microsoft call was a scam and hung up immediately. Thank you for your help. Paul.

<p>Microsoft will not call you in that manner so that will be a scammer - hang up and do not let them connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you changed accounts its possible that the malware is running under one profile not another which has given a misleading result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned by others in the thread, install some good A/V and run full scans.</p>
