<h2>            I want to change the size of the Start Menu Bar at the bottom of my screen.</h2>
                    I need to change the&nbsp;height of the Start Menu Bar at the bottom of my computer screen.&nbsp; It is 3/4 " tall now.<br />
<br />
It used to be a narrow band.&nbsp; I was zooming around with my mouse on the computer one night.&nbsp; After that the Start Menu Toolbar took up 1/3 of the&nbsp;right side of my computer monitor.&nbsp; My daughter moved it to the bottom of the monitor as a band at the bottom.&nbsp;
 It is twice as thick as it used to be.&nbsp; It is 3/4" tall, all the way across now.&nbsp; It's cutting the view of the working screen.

            To change the size of the bar, just put your mouse at the top of it where it becomes a double arrow.&nbsp; Then just hold down the left mouse button and move the mouse to resize to the desired height and then release the mouse button.

The start menu area does not become a double arrow.<br />
<br />
I think I am having a similar problem.<br />
<br />
My Start Menu in XP Service Pack 3, automatically resized to a smaller size whilst I was using the task bar at a much deeper&nbsp; thickness than the normal thin strip - The Search Menu Area resized itself to fit in the remaining height between the top of the Task
 Bar and the top of the screen area but did not revert to the original size when I reduced the Task Bar down to the normal depth.<br />

            Tried this suggestion but it seems my task bar height choices are limited to 1.25 inches high or a thin blue band about 0.1 inches tall.

            Ok I played with the TaskBars "margin" bars - to no avail.
<div>I shuffled them around half a dozen times, plus tried to ensure toolbars, icons etc were not vertically stacked - where ever possible.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I still have a "multi-tier" height. I cannot shrink the taskbar back down to a single tier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It sure would be nice, if I could right click on an object (e.g. "margin") and its official Micro Soft Sanctioned name would pop up. Then we could have a more meaning-full dialog, instead of manipulating and describing objects on my screen that might be
 named somewhere in MS's thousands of pages of documentation...</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would also be useful if, when I right clicked on the taskbar, a menu item would allow me to return the taskbar configuration to XP's installation default (which is what I would expect most users leave it at).</div>
<div><br />
<div>Normally, when I make suggestions to 'improve' a tool, I don't expect them to be taken seriously. Most of the time the person who receives them is too busy to even bother forwarding them to someone who might be able to make improvements (or in some cases
 - fixes) to a product's&nbsp;behavior. In other cases, I expect the developers have moved on to the next great version of the product (like Windows 8) and would rather the user just quietly upgraded - shelling out more money to cover their salary.</div>

<p>Was having same issue and found my answer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Between my Google icon and the Task View icon (looks like a window with shutters) are 2 feint vertical lines (at the bottom of the desk top screen).</p>
<p>Click on it and see the arrows.</p>
<p>Put you cursor/pointer on the top of the vertical arrow and click.</p>
<p>My bar went right back to normal.</p>

    <title>User folder is now my Videos folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunterjup  say:</h3>
<h2>            User folder is now my Videos folder</h2>
                    <p>Bit of a complicated one, but anyway I'll get to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I accidentally set my video folder to my user folder (was trying to move it to a different drive) and now my user folder is called "Videos" and even has the icon... I cant change the location again cause I get the "cant redirect a parent into a child" error
 and all that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://imgur.com/a/2ghlQ</p>
<p>
</p><p>^^screenshots</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to move it back into a folder I created called "Videos", but it would give me the parent into a child message, or If I do it elsewhere, I get "Cant move the folder because there is a folder in the same location that cant be redirected. Access is
 denied." Message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR; My user folder is now my Videos folder, and all convential methods of moving it back can't work for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can live with it, but its really frustrating and got me quite upset. I also got on a live chat with microsoft support and they couldn't figure it out either :(((&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cant system restore cause Windows 10 doesn't make restore points on it's own, and no one ever goes in there BEFORE they actually get an issue like this. How ironic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, some tips to get in the right direction would be great. I would prefer not to install windows again as I dont want to lose my game saves and mods and all that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to some responses,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hunter.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That would require a 3rd party program as the Weather App does not have that ability (at the present time). You could request such a feature by using the Feedback App.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>ASUS Touchpad not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davew11  say:</h3>
<h2>            ASUS Touchpad not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My touchpad seems to be disabled (FN + F9 does nothing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a device listed as 'I2C HID Device' showing the error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This device cannot start. (Code 10) &nbsp;A request for the HID descriptor failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried uninstalling/reinstalling the drivers via the device manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the most recent drivers from the ASUS website but when I run the exe file it says there is already a version of that file and won't let me go any further.</p>
<p>I am new to Windows 10 and having trouble navigating around - is there a way I can remove the driver and re-install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or any other fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop is ASUS ROG STRIX GL502VT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver updates for Windows 10 and many devices are automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reinstall driver, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Device Manager; then, right-click the name of the device.</li><li>Select Uninstall.</li><li>Restart your computer and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.</p>

<p>Hi Cyril,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a possibility that you're getting this concern due to an out-dated driver. For us to better assist you, we'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any recent changes prior to the issue?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we suggest that you check if ASUS Touchpad is enabled on your device. To do that, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>Settings</strong>on the search bar and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Devices</strong>. </li><li>Click <strong>Mouse &amp; touchpad</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Additional mouse options</strong> on the right pane.</li><li>Choose <strong>Device Settings </strong>(some called ELAN) pane, check Yes/No of Touchpad. If
<strong>No</strong>, click <strong>Enable </strong>and select <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            In my devices it's not listed as Mouse &amp; touchpad. Instead, only mouse is listed. I tried checking if I'll find it in hardware but it's also not listed. my device manager is also showing the same "This device cannot start. (Code 10) &nbsp;A request for the
 HID descriptor failed." message and when I uninstall it it just comes back again. I am using a different ASUS ROG model but nonetheless I am still experiencing the same problem as Davew11.

<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code 10 is a common driver error. It indicates that the driver for the specific device is failing to load. To resolve your issue, we suggest you follow the troubleshooting steps found in the&nbsp;<em>Code 10 "This device cannot start. (Code 10)"

<p>I have the same issue with my touch pad although I'm running on a Asus ROG STRIX GL553V.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried literally everything:</p>
<p>-updating the driver</p>
<p>-installing the driver manually bu downloading it from the manufacturer site (the setup always fails)</p>
<p>-disabling, enabling the driver</p>
<p>-uninstalling it to have Windows install it again</p>
<p>-disabling the touch pad in BIOS and enabling it again</p>
<p>-even updating my BIOS to the latest version</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still having the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Could it be a faulty hardware problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answer would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thank you for this information, Francisco. I've seen that you're currently 4 updates behind the latest one. I highly recommend updating to the latest build as these can resolve several issues such as the one you're experiencing with touch pad.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;To check for updates now, select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>button,&nbsp;and then go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update &amp; security</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows
 Update</strong>, and select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Check for updates</strong>. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update me if there are improvements.</p>

<p>Hi Lernard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you're encountering might be due to corrupted system file after resetting your computer. To help you resolve the issue, we suggest that you perform a repair upgrade using the ISO file. To do that, refer to the article below and follow the instructions
 given.</p>

<h2>            System Restore</h2>
                    <p>I tried to do a system restore but got an error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"System Restore failed to extract the file (C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\root\client\AppvIsvStream32.dll) from the restore point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070289)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some Googling, I saw that&nbsp;AppvIsvStream32.dll is associated with Microsoft Office. I've uninstalled Microsoft Office and tried to do a system restore but I would get the same error message. How can I successfully do a system restore? I don't care about
 having Microsoft Office, I just want LabVIEW and ActiveX to work properly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Laura. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Make sure the Office Program File got deleted in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not there then check C:\Program Files to delete any Microsoft Office folders remaining. Use Take Ownership if necessary:
<a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a><br />
<br />
Then restart PC, try SysRestore again: <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a><br />
<br />
If the same error appears there is a leftover file elsewhere. Try running Disk Cleanup to include System Files:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/d...</a><br />
<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg, thanks for your reply! I'm not too familiar with Windows 10 as it is not my personal computer, but I did go to Settings-&gt;Apps (I don't see Program Files but I assume Apps is the same thing). I don't see any Microsoft Office programs (there's Microsoft
 OneDrive, some SQL Server programs, and Visual C++ programs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also went on Disk Cleanup but I don't see any options to clean up System Files (there's check boxes for Setup Log Files, Windows Update Cleanup, Downloaded Program Files, Device Driver packages, etc). Since this is not my personal computer, for now I opted
 not to clean up anything other than System Files if I could find the option. I also tried MoreOptions tab for Disk Cleanup and tried to clean up Programs and Features, which lead me to the&nbsp;Programs and Features on the Control Panel. I don't see any Microsoft
 Office programs on there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there other programs could be related to AppvIsvStream32.dll? Or a way I could make it ignore trying to extract this dll when trying to restore? On the very bottom part of the error message, it says that I can try to pick a different restore point or
 trying an advanced recovery method, which I am not familiar with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time!</p>

<p><span>Under Apps &amp; Features, there's no Office program shown. I did delete an empty Microsoft Office folder under&nbsp;</span><span>C:\Program Files (x86) and tried the Disk Cleanup -&gt; Clean up
 system files (sorry I completely missed that for some reason!) and led to the check box for "Setup System Files", "Windows Update Cleanup", etc. with some boxes auto-checked. I just went with the ones that were already checked (Downloaded Program Files, which
 is empty, Temporary Internet Files, Device driver packages (also empty), and Thumbnails). I'm not sure if the current ones I've checked would clean up the appropriate program.</span></p>
<p>I've been trying to do a system restore for two dates (they're around more than a month apart), but I would get the same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was this LabVIEW VI that was working for a long time but one day there was an error 1172 message on it. I tried to fix it from a few suggestions on Google but none of them worked. My coworker and I thought maybe a system restore may fix the issue.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to place your system in a Clean Boot state and try to uninstall scanner driver and see if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Perform Clean Boot</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. Check this issue in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p>

<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>. </span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>. </span></li><li><span>Close Task Manager.</span></li><li><span>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer. </span></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span></strong>".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Uninstall Scanner driver</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow these steps:<br />
<strong>1.</strong>&nbsp;Press <strong>“Windows Key + X”</strong> from the keyboard.<br />
<strong>2.</strong>&nbsp;Type<strong> “device Manager”</strong> without quotes in the search box and hit enter.<br />

<h2>            Acrobat 8 Pro&#39;s &#34;Check for Updates&#34; not working &#40;Windows 7, 64-bit&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have Acrobat 8 Pro installed on my Windows 7 (64 bit) system; specifically v8.1.3. When attempting to use the application's 'Check for Updates' feature, Adobe Updater displays the following message:&nbsp; "No Internet connection was found.&nbsp; Please check your
 Internet settings or firewall."</p>
<p>I do not encounter this error when using the 'Update' feature with other Adobe applications such as Photoshop Elements &amp; Reader.&nbsp; I have an internet connection.</p>
<p>I have Acrobat 8 Pro installed on my Vista laptop and the 'Check for Updates' feature works as expected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any words of wisdom on why I'm encountering this problem on my Windows 7 system and/or how to resolve it?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Problem has been solved (found the solution in a forum post of Adobe's website):</p>
<p>CONTROL PANEL &gt; NETWORK CONNECTIONS &gt;</p>
<p>Windows "provided" me a "Wireless Network Connection 3" that was identified as a "Microsoft Virtual WiFi Miniport Adapter"</p>
<p>I right-clicked it and chose "Disable"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the "virtual" adapter was disabled, my Adobe Acrobat launch of the Update Manager worked fine.&nbsp; I've only seen this problem on Windows 7; never experienced it with my XP or Vista systems.</p>

    <title>Searching inside a folder tree for a string within a file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul kinzelman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Searching inside a folder tree for a string within a file</h2>
                    OK, I give up...<br />
<br />
I'm trying to search for a particular string like "xyz" in a bunch of *.txt files located in various locations in a tree - all the folders and files I want to search in are rooted under a particular folder.<br />
<br />
It used to be that Windows Explorer had a feature 'Search files and folders' that&nbsp; had a check-box for "search subfolders" was intuitive and just worked great.<br />
<br />
However, with the new improved search facility, I can't get it to search for a string in a tree of files. And the help does not help.<br />
<br />
I even went into advanced search, typed in "*.txt" for Name, and in the search string, I get "xyz name:*.txt" and the string is not found even though I know it's located in at least one of the files in the tree of files under the "Location" which is like C:\apk<br />
<br />
Could somebody please point me at a description of how to do this, or else maybe a quick pointer as to what I'm doing wrong?<br />
Thanks!

<p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>The syntax for Windows Search is quite different now.&nbsp; For one thing, wild cards work differently and are rarely needed for common searches.&nbsp; Try using the ext property instead:</p>
<p><strong>xyz ext:txt</strong></p>
<p>However, keep in mind that Windows Search is now word-based, not character-based.&nbsp; When searching file contents, if the string "xyz" is in the middle of a word, it may not be found unless it is preceded by a&nbsp;space, an upper-case letter, or a punctuation
 character.&nbsp; So, you may need to search on a part of word that precedes the "xyz" string.</p>
<p>There is good information on the new search syntax here:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/advquery.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/advquery.mspx</a></p>
<p>As for searching sub folders by default, on Vista that option is set in the Search tab of the Windows "Folder Options" dialog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A couple of other tips:</p>
<p>Be sure that the parent folder is set to be indexed in the Indexing Options dialogs.</p>
<p>Be aware that the type of search you are doing is best done from Windows Explorer or the main search dialog, not from the Start menu.&nbsp; The latter has its own options, which are often more restrictive than the other methods.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> go24ba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Account</h2>
                    <p>So I have recently bought a new laptop, and set up a windows account (the one I am currently using) to be connected to my computer as the initial administrator account. The problem is, that I do not want to use this account, since I have a different Microsoft
 account being used for all my other Microsoft apps (like Xbox and Skype). So I would like to replace the account that I initially set up my computer with ,when I first opened it, and replace with the other Microsoft account so I can have it connected to my
 computer. I have done some other research and have not found a suitable solution to this problem. An idea I had, was to factory restart my computer to original settings (before I opened it) and go through the process again of connecting my account to the computer.
 But, I am afraid that might delete any programs that cam pre-installed. The computer I have is a Lenovo, so it came with Lenovo Companion and McAfee LifeSafe, and potentially other programs I have not been made aware of. Please let me know if doing this will
 be fine, or if I need to go through another series of steps to change the main account, thanks.</p>

<h2>            Cannot save data for ultimate word games</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Hope someone can help. I have windows 10 and play Microsoft's ultimate word games pretty regularly. The last every time I try to play it takes ages to load then I get a message saying 'an error has occurred and your date cannot be synchronized with the cloud
 at this time.' I can play without saving but then if I go back later I end up right back at the beginning. and nothing has saved. It's driving me crazy. Does anyone have a solution please?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just found a fix for this problem on the Community site, hopefully it will work for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0">
<span>"The issue is that your Xbox data on your local machine is corrupted. You would think that Microsoft would be interested in helping but forget that.
</span></p>
<p><span>To reset your Xbox data, go to Settings, APPs, Apps &amp; Features, scroll to Xbox icons. You will see two or three Xbox icons each one will need to be reset. Click on the first one, select advanced options, click Reset
 button, I did it twice to make sure. I should show app: 0 bytes and data is 8.0 KB.&nbsp;
</span><span>Once you have reset all three, reboot your system.&nbsp; Restart the game."</span></p>
<p>In addition to resetting the three xbox apps, I also reset the Ultimate Word Games App and the Microsoft Store App before restarting (I read on another post that this can help as well).</p>
<p><span>Once I restarted the game the Sync Data screen popped up and began to sync again.&nbsp; Once the sync was done I did get the error message about being unable to sync, I clicked "Try Again" and then the game finally opened
 with my saved progress.</span></p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to try to solve my problem. </p>
<p>I did everything you said. I reset all the Xbox apps and Ultimate Word Games and Microsoft Store apps.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it doesn't appear to have fixed the problem. I tried clicking on 'Try Again' 3 times&nbsp; but still my data is not being saved. If I want to
 play Wordament I just get taken to the very first game. No matter how many times I play that game, the next time I come back my stats show as zero. No data is being saved at all.</p>
<p>It's vey annoying, but I'll keep trying.</p>

<p>Hi Linda,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify did you restart your computer after resetting all of the Apps?&nbsp; Did you get the Sync Data progression bar to come up when you first restarted Ultimate Word Games (rectangle with the Xbox icon and I believe the progression bar is purple)?</p>

<p>Hi Kevin,</p>
<p>Sorry, I should have said that I did restart my computer after I reset all the apps. No, the Sync Data progression bar did not come up so I was pretty sure that resetting everything hadn't worked. Turned out I was right!</p>

<p>I tried the process again on my computer this morning to see if it would resync with the cloud and it did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset the Apps in this order (shouldn't matter but you never know):</p>
<p>Xbox</p>
<p>Xbox Game Speech Window</p>
<p>Xbox Live</p>
<p>Microsoft Store</p>
<p>Microsoft Ultimate Word Games</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resetting Word Games I immediately restarted the computer.&nbsp; Once rebooted I started Ultimate Word Games and the Sync Window came up and synced the data with the cloud.&nbsp; When the sync was done I got the Error Message saying it couldn't sync, I pressed
 Try Again and the Game started with all of my data intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some more searching for other solutions but couldn't find any.&nbsp; I wish I could give you some other alternatives.&nbsp; I would suggest trying the reset again in the order I did it and see if you have any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck,</p>

<p>Kevin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My name is Michael and I'm chiming in here because I'm having the same issue as Linda.&nbsp; I've reproduced the problem on both of my tower PCs and my notebook.&nbsp; All three machines were originally Windows 7 systems that were upgraded to 10 when the 'free' upgrade
 was available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent hours on the phone with Xbox support.&nbsp; Uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times.&nbsp; At the suggestion of the latest support person, I took my notebook to my local Microsoft store.&nbsp; The first person there said that I need to wipe my machine and
 do a 'clean' reinstall of Windows 10 (not gonna happen).&nbsp; The second person there said that the maker of my notebook doesn't offer Windows 10 on this model, therefore there must be some sort or hardware/driver issue and I should buy a new machine to resolve
 the issue (not in the budget).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I expressed my real opinion of the staff people at the store, I would be booted off of this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that three different machines have no problem at all with any other Windows 10 applications but MUWG is having a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, if I log in to Windows as an unprivileged user and run MUWG as 'guest', it works fine.&nbsp; It just doesn't save my history to the cloud.&nbsp; Is there some way to reset whatever is out in the cloud?&nbsp; At this point, I'm inclined to believe that the
 problem is with something 'out there' and not something on my machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing of possible interest, MUWG was working fine until Microsoft pushed out an update around the beginning of March.&nbsp; It's get close to 2 months that I've been trying to find a solution that works for this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in advance, for any suggestions.</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>I'm sorry but I can't help you. I found a few days ago after an update&nbsp;my Microsoft Word games came back on and starting synchronising. I've not had any problems since,</p>

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides the information I gave Linda to try, Microsoft updated the MUWG APP this month.&nbsp; It updated for me on 4/14/18 version 3.5.3272.0.&nbsp; This update changed the monthly puzzles for each game type from "Months" to "Worlds".&nbsp; It also added an annoying delay
 to when it checks words in Jumble. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I got the sync error.&nbsp; I clicked the "Try Again" button and the second time when it failed it gave me the option to turn off cloud saves for this game.&nbsp; Now the only save is on my Surface.&nbsp; This is fine for me as I don't play the game on any other
 machine.&nbsp; There is an option in the menu now to turn cloud saves on if you want to try and move your game save to another device (PC, Laptop, Tablet).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My suggestion is to make sure your game is updated to the latest version.&nbsp; Then if you get the sync error you should be able to turn the cloud saves off after hitting the "Try Again" button.&nbsp; You could also try uninstalling the old app and reinstalling the
 new app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not a Windows Guru, but in my experience as a retail manager in a store with a well know computer repair department, your machines are not the problem.&nbsp; It's a cloud-sync issue and that information is handled by the XBOX-Live support people.&nbsp; However,
 when I tried to talk to someone about it at XBOX-Live as soon as I said Microsoft Ultimate Word Games App for Windows 10 they transferred me to someone else. &nbsp; That someone else doesn't know how to fix cloud sync issues so you get pushed back to XBOX Live.&nbsp;
 The ultimate Catch-22!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this will help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kevin</p>

<p>Yesterday I tried something that, in retrospect, I should have tried much sooner.&nbsp; I created a new Xbox account using a different email address.&nbsp; My original account uses an email address that I've had for many years and was my login for MSDN and then MS
 Live and now Xbox.&nbsp; The new account uses a GMail address.&nbsp; It doesn't have my history but it saves to the cloud without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I also have 3.5.3272.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my machines at home with a high-speed Internet connection, I usually don't get any error messages.&nbsp; When I took my notebook to the MS store and connected to their (slow) WiFi network, I got my first cloud sync error message.&nbsp; At home, I just get the four
 letter tiles swapping places endlessly (one time I left it running for 2 hours while I worked on another machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have proven that the game runs and saves to the cloud on my machine when I sign in with my gmail account but not with my MSDN account, I have the ammunition I need to go back and give the support people one more shot at resolving the problem.</p>

                    <p>-- only 1607 is currently supported. I can install 1607 easily enough, but then Microsoft pushes an update to 1709 that debilitates the Windows - bad drivers, hardware failures and hung apps. external monitor problems, you name it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I stop the foced update to 1709, yet retain the patching on 1607?</p>

<p>This is a total cop out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that MICROSOFT is pushing an Windows 10 operating system that I do not want... and cannot use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The simple solution is to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 (Pro - enterprise) has a defer updates option to stop updates for 35 days.. and MS support has informed me that this can be extended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why did you direct me to Apple?</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have no capabilities to address Microsoft's heavy-handed update methodology.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That link - and subsequent download options - present only the 1709 download - which&nbsp;<br />
Apple does not (yet?) support.. known issues are driver mis-matches, partial installs, omission of Cirrus audio driver installations and frequent failure of external monitor operations. There is comment and chat all over the internet about it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found with Windows 10 pro, if you catch it early you can postpone feature upgrades for up to a year.. which might buy enough time for Apple to accomodate version 1709 or
<br />
Creator's Update&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Home hub 5 MTU problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> super p man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Home hub 5 MTU problem</h2>
                    
<p>Recently I upgraded from home hub 4 (no issues with NAT or MTU) to the home hub 5. Since installing I have encountered a low MTU problem. I have tried port forwarding, UPnP settings and DMZ all to no avail. The NAT type will only stay open if I port forward
 but the MTU doesn't change no matter what settings I try. Any one with a home hub 5 experienced anything similar?? I don't think the solution can be too difficult seeing as the hub 4 worked fine with some tweaks to the settings. I have taken off the smart
 set up also.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a similar problem. Thankfully, I was able to find the solution. It is a specific driver. If you are having the same problems please follow these steps:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) Go to Device Manager (Windows Key+X, select it)&nbsp;<br />
2) Under the "Mice and other pointing devices" list find "USB Touchscreen controller", or the driver that's not your mouse/touchpad.&nbsp;<br />
3) Right click to select "Properties", click the "Driver" tab, and click "Roll back".&nbsp;<br />
4) After confirming, this will remove the driver from that list but bring up a bunch of new ones under "Human Interface Devices", where the touchscreen stuff logically should live.&nbsp;<br />
5) Make sure that all the other drivers are updated EXCEPT "USB input device". This is the one that moves it all to the mouse drivers.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>After a restart the driver didn't automatically reinstall like they usually do. If it does, run the "Show or hide updates troubleshooter"&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">found here.&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to think this is an issue from eGalax Touch, which is responsible for the driver, but if you do a search for "egalax touch acts like mouse" this is an issue dating back to Windows 7. Either a) Microsoft should stop doing business with
 them, b) Microsoft should provide a fix for how the driver interacts with the OS, or c) let the consumer know that there is an issue and how to fix it. Because it's the SAME ISSUE.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>JDRC&nbsp;</p>
