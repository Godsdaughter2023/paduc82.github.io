<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Upgrade to Version 14393 &#34;Anniversary Edition&#34; failing to complete the Upgrade at 85&#37; - 4 times in a row with the same Error Code</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;My problem is that I have&nbsp;just installed Windows 10 Pro as Upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro [installation from the&nbsp;Official DVD ISO] and all went well &gt; resulting in Windows 10 Pro Version 10240.</p>
<p>But... After&nbsp;2 hours of testing and checking the new features, I decided to proceed with the "Anniversary Upgrade" to version 14393 which was available from Microsoft [Windows10Upgrade28084.exe].</p>
<p>All went well, until the process reached 85% of Updating.</p>
<p>Then the installer displayed a message that "Something went wrong" with Error Code: 0x80070057.</p>
<p>I tried to apply the update again, and again - but the same thing happened 4 times in a row &gt; Error at 85%.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;checked the Windows&nbsp;Registry for errors and corrected some issues, also I&nbsp;performed a Disk Cleaning and restarted the PC but the same thing happened again.</p>
<p>Considering that the whole process from start until the Error appears takes about 1 Hour, trying to do the Upgrade 4 times with no result was a total waste of time.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;want&nbsp;to mention that one day before I did the same Upgrade to version 14393 on the Laptop of a friend, and everything went good without any&nbsp;problems.</p>
<p>This problem appeared on my Desktop PC, which is powerful enough to support Windows 10 latest version.</p>
<p>If anyone can find a solution to this I would be very grateful.</p>

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Thustmaster Firestorm Wireless Gampad &#40;Windows 7 64bit&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 64bit says it is installed and working properly, yet the program (<a href="http://ts.thrustmaster.com/download/accessories/pc/Thrustmapper/Thrustmapper_4.02c.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ts.thrustmaster.com/download/accessories/pc/Thrustmapper/Thrustmapper_4.02c.exe</a>)
 says it is not connected even though I can check the information on the device and calibrate the device there, I am unable to get the program which is vital to reconize it, and everytime I reboot or start up my computer again it always gives me the following
 popup window titled:<br />
Thustmapper Device Manager</p>
<p>With the following text:<br />
You do not have sufficient security privileges to change device properties or device drivers.<br />
Please contact your site administrator or logout and log in again as an administrator&nbsp; and try and again.</p>
<p>button at the bottom:<br />
OK</p>
<p>I am not an idiot, I have grown up with computers and am a Computer Engineer major in my senior year and have done a fair share of programing, I am the only user on the computer and I am the system administrator and the only login possible as I have disable
 the other logins, and it will not let me install the drivers from the Trustmaster page, and without them the gamepad/device doesn't seam to function as it should as I am unable to use it in games unless they have a build in gamepad option for them, which many
 games I use this for do not.&nbsp; Any help in this matter would be most appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hi SerpWAR,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the methods listed below:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
<br />
<br />
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Open the
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</span></a><span>
 to run the automated troubleshooting services and see if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try installing the program in administrator mode and see if that fixes the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Locate the program icon, right-click and select
</span><b><span>Run as administrator</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. When the UAC message is displayed, do one of the following:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are logged on as a standard user, or if UAC is configured to always require credentials, enter the appropriate administrative credentials, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>ii.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you are logged on as an administrator and UAC is not configured to always require credentials, click “Yes” to start the application.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the installation and check if the issue gets fixed.

<p>When you tried the command prompt, did you ‘elevate’ it? If not try this:</p>
<p>1. Open an elevated Command Prompt by clicking the Windows Orb (Start) &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories and right-click Command Prompt, then ‘Run as Administrator’. From the prompt type CD %userprofile%\Desktop and press Enter, now type del name (where name
 is the file to be removed, e.g. abc.def) and press Enter. This should remove the file. If it does not, then keep the Command Prompt open and<br />
2. Hit Ctrl+Shift+Esc to open Task Manager. On the Processes Tab, select the explorer.exe process and end it to halt the desktop. Switch to the Command Prompt window and retry the del command.<br />
3. Now restart explorer by going to the Application Tab of Task Manager &gt; File &gt; New Task. Enter explorer.exe and click OK to restart the desktop.</p>
<p>If you still haven’t deleted it, try deleting it in safe Mode (tap F8 when you switch on the computer).</p>

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<br />Digital license is stored on Microsoft servers, so no matter how many time you reinstall Windows, you'll stay activated.

            Hi Melanie, rest assured, your Windows 10 Digital licence and activation will be unaffected by resetting Windows.
<br />
<br />Activation is not stored on your PC, it is stored remotely on the Microsoft Activation servers, you have nothing to worry about . ..

            When trying to start the Workstation Service you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
Windows could not start the Workstation on Local Computer.&nbsp; For more information, review your System Event Log.&nbsp; If this is a non-Micorosft service, contact the service vendor, and refer to the service-specific error code 2550.<br />
<br />
Then if you look in the Event Viewer System log you may find thing like this:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7024<br />
Description:<br />
The Workstation service terminated with service-specific error 2250 (0x8CA).<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Workstation<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5727<br />
Description:<br />
Could not load Rdbss device driver.<br />
<br />
The problem is most likely a missing or corrupt rdbss.sys file.&nbsp; The rdbss.sys file should be in this folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
We know that XP keeps backup copies of critical system files in this folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache<br />
<br />
So you can just copy the rdbss.sys file from c:\windows\system32\dllcache and paste it into this folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32\drivers<br />
<br />
Respond in the affirmative if asked to overwrite the current file.<br />
<br />
If you can't find a copy of the file in the c:\windows\system32\dllcache folder, depending on your installation there may be a copy of the file in this folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\ServicePackFiles\i386<br />
<br />
Somehow or another, you need to replace the rdbss.sys file.<br />
<br />
See if you can start the Workstation Service after replacing the rdbss.sys file.<br />
<br />
If you still can't find it, you can download one from my SkyDrive, but see how those other ideas work first.

    <title>Sound distortion. Video streaming problems on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound distortion. Video streaming problems on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before writing this I just want to say that I've read mostly everything on here that sounds similar to my problem but there was no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer (Dell Inspiron 5200) has been acting weird since I updated to Windows 10. From Wireless Adapter disabling on its own, to Bluetooth problems. Recently, my audio started causing problems. Within 5 seconds of the song it will start buzzing, then
 it will be completely distorted, chunky, and ultimately it will stop and send an error message. This will happen with music that I have on my computer, as well as, with Spotify. At the same time, &nbsp;online video streaming (Netflix, YouTube) will also be distorted,
 then it will freeze, and it will stop. Camera does not work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I updated all possible drivers, updated Windows 10, looked through the settings to see if something doesn't look right, but nothing. &nbsp;I am a film college student - you can imagine how hard life is without being able to see and work on videos, watch Netflix
 and YouTube, and listen to Spotify, right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will really appreciate your help! Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Christian</p>

            <p><span>Hi </span>Christian<span>,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts,
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to incompatible or outdated driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I see that you have tried updating the driver. However if you have not tried uninstalling and re-installing latest driver from the computer manufacturer website, try the same and check if
 it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Uninstall audio driver:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> and type
<strong><span>device manager</span></strong> in Start Search.</span></p>

 Audio Device </span></strong>and select <strong><span>‘uninstall’</span></strong>.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>Follow the prompt and
<strong><span>restart</span></strong> the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Now re-install latest audio driver from the computer manufacturer website.&nbsp;</span><span>If Windows&nbsp;10 drivers are not available, I would suggest
 you to install driver in compatibility mode.</span></p>

</span></strong><strong><span>driver
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a.
<strong>Download </strong>the latest </span><span>audio driver&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.
<br />
b. <strong>Right-click </strong>on the setup file of the driver and select “<strong>Properties</strong>”.<br />
c. Select “<strong>Compatibility</strong>” Tab. <br />
d. Place a <strong>check mark </strong>next to “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>” and
<strong>select latest Windows version</strong>&nbsp;from the drop down list. <br />
e. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Note</strong>: You may try the same steps for other device drivers that are not working properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps. Reply to the post with an updated status of the issue so that we can assist you further.</span></p>

    <title>Flight Simulator X not showing photoreal scenery addons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bcross16  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flight Simulator X not showing photoreal scenery addons</h2>
                    I haven't really seen this problem on any other posts. After installing 3rd party photoreal scenery to Flight Simulator X, there is ABSOLUTELY no change in the appearance of the scenery after a flight is loaded. I simply get the default FSX scenery and
 textures. <br />
The addons seem to be installed correctly and they show up on top of the FSX scenery library.<br />
I have a high end graphics card (Ati Radeon HD 7750) Drivers are up to date. Windows 7. All scenery/texture settings in FSX are on very high.<br />
Has anyone heard of or encountered this problem?<br />
<br />

    <title>How do I turn off automatic birthday reminders in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leucoephalus  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I turn off automatic birthday reminders in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How do I turn off automatic birthday reminders in Windows 10? Ever since I upgraded from Window 8.1 to Windows 10 I get a bunch of annoying birthday reminders every morning that pop up in th the lower right hand corner of my screen and each one makes a sound
 when it pops up so after I click dismiss a new sound plays when the next one pops up. I go through 5 or 6 or these stupid ones each morning that I have to dismiss.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years I have acquired too many contacts for business and personal alike there is no possible way to turn off individual birthday reminders, besides that, I have no idea how they got these people's birthdays in the first place, I never put anyone's
 birthdays in my contact information. I am not even sure what application this pop-up is coming from, it looks like a new Windows 10 feature. It could very well be connected to my Facebook contact list contact list or my Google calendar or both). It is driving
 me crazy.</p>

            <p>Hi Abhinav,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: <span>&nbsp;</span>Boot the Computer in Safe Mode by following the steps in the link provided (applied for Windows 10) and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Perform A Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install
 a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>* Place the computer in a Clean Boot and check if the issue is occurring due to any third party programs.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the link to view the steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>

    <title>blocking followers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            blocking followers</h2>
                    
<p>I have been blocking followers since the xbox one console came out I have several xbox one consoles that all respond the same way when someone adds me as a friend it shows up saying that person is a follower,now at this point they are not my friend unless
 I physically add them as a friend and they would remain in my followers list as a follower, on their end however&nbsp;it would show up that im their friend even though I have not added them as a friend and they are still showing up as a follower in my followers
 list,now If wanted to clear up my followers list all I would have to do was to click on that followers profile and click block follower this would cause that follower to be removed from from my followers list and you can not see them there any more,even when
 someone else was to view my profile it would show up that my friends list is zero and my followers list was zero assuming I had no friends to start with,now for some reason some&nbsp;xbox live support representives&nbsp;seems to think that you cant remove a follower
 from your followers list on your console&nbsp;while others do ,so there seems to be some level of confusion amongst themselves on this issue same goes for Microsoft support,finding someone who actually knows that you can remove a follower&nbsp;from your followers list
 can be difficult.my problems arose when I tried to remove a follower who added me but remained in my followers list, after trying every way I knew on how to solve this myself&nbsp;I was forced to seek help from xbox live customer support,thinking that a simple
 phone call would solve the issue but just finding someone who knew that you can remove a follower let alone trying to remove a follower that you cant remove took about 6 months,and finally was directed here,after&nbsp; finding a mr Beep who was very helpful thanks
 buy the way was able to have the escalation team remove the followers,but&nbsp;as soon they were removed they just added themselves again with different&nbsp; gamertags,now after asking them to leave which I knew was pointless because its not but accident that they
 are&nbsp;there and they have no intention of leaving,so asking for a new set of followers to be removed this time buy a Microsoft rep who informed me 75 hours and they would be gone 75 hours came and went and in the mean time im getting more followers who cant
 be removed,having no reply from xbox support,i threw some rather colourful language at these&nbsp;followers only to find my self with a communications ban,after&nbsp;explaining to the escalation team why I swore at these followers,my explanation had nothing to do with
 wanting their decision reversed I was amazed at after viewing their&nbsp;decision to uphold my ban I noticed that they had failed to grasp the fact that I was not just being abusive to someone who randomly added me and shocked&nbsp;buy my language left and then reported
 me but the follower who reported me are still on my followers list,and their being allowed to stay, does xbl have a different set of privacy&nbsp;laws for certain followers,also&nbsp; does any body know if a&nbsp;communications ban can be extended to include other people
 from communicating you&nbsp;because even with every privacy setting set to block and that's not just from my console but from every where&nbsp;&nbsp;,people can still add me send messages chat and game invites even after their blocked,i want a communications ban that swings
 both ways,then it might stop these people from monitoring this site and coming up with new ways to remain as human malware</p>

<p>OMG!!! I just got done chatting with a support person who knows nothing about his job. For over an hour I tried to explain that yes this follower is BLOCKED and no he is not and has never been on my friends list. I told this moron that if he is showing as
 a follower to me that means I'm on his friends list. &nbsp;You are right getting to talk to somebody that can fix this is almost impossible. I tried to get Hervin to turn this problem into the geeks so they could fix it and this jerk off said they couldn't fix
 it and that I would have to do it myself by blocking the follower. So I guess that I will start making phone calls and start working my way up their miserable food chain. Starting at the bottom and working my way up the brown tube until they just won't pass
 me on up any further. Hopefully by the end of the day I hope that at least I feel better. Because at the end of it all we all know that XBL just doesn't care.</p>

                    <p>First of all, I have a 1440p Deep Color (10bit)&nbsp;monitor, along with a GeForce GTX 780, an Intel&nbsp;Core i5 4440 @ 3.10GHz (quad-core), in addition to 16 GBs of DDR3 Ram. I also have the latest drivers and firmware for all of its components and the latest Windows
 10 updates. What is so strange is that I am POSITIVE that not only my professional monitor supports 10bit color but so does my GTX 780...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone has any idea why this might be the case can you please let me know? I'd really appreciate it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;That's unfortunate... well in your opinion is High Dynamic Range color amazing? I am assuming that I won't simply be able to buy an i7 CPU... I'll&nbsp; probably have to get a new motherboard also but if it's neat enough who knows. (This seems like the best
 type of picture we will get before OLEDs come out.)</p>

<p>High Dynamic Range can show a wider range of colors compared to a standard dynamic range (SDR) display. You will get a brighter, more vibrant, and more detailed picture.

    <title>App Help arrow will not disappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robertseamster  say:</h3>
<h2>            App Help arrow will not disappear</h2>
                    If I go to start page and tab right a info help box saying slide screen to right to go to next app with an arrow. This is a large help box and once it appears it will not go away no matter what i am doing, Word, Internet, apps. it blocks out 25% of the
 left side of the screen making it difficult to read articles, type word documents or play games. can only get rid of it by restarting PC. But if I go to the start page and slide to anything it comes back. Have to go straight to Desktop and work from there.
 but if I have to access something from the Start Page, the box fixates again.

<h2>            Windows Live Mail with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm considering Microsoft's free upgrade to Windows 10 from my current Windows 7. &nbsp;However, I may wait a while to see if any major issues arise for others by reading various forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have discovered possibly one major issue: &nbsp;MS has made no provisions in the Win10 to upgrade or convert Windows Live Mail (Windows Live Essentials) which I have been using for many, many years. &nbsp;I do understand there are some many-step procedures trying
 to solve this; however, I do not want to loose all the existing folders and e-mails I have saved that are important to me. &nbsp;Now I'm getting nervous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why didn't MS include an automatic conversion for Windows Live Mail? &nbsp;It's their program?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Sobre o cabo HDMI e a nota fiscal &#91;About the HDMI cable and the invoice&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Bom dia, gostaria de tirar algumas dúvidas. Comprei um Xbox One S recentemente de uma pessoa e o console não veio com o cabo HDMI original do console. Fui em várias lojas de eletrônicos e não tinha o cabo original. Então um vendedor me ofereceu um cabo HDMI
 2.1 e disse funcionaria, mesmo não sendo original. Então a minha primeira pergunta é essa, posso usar esse cabo tranquilamente?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; E a segunda pergunta é, que o console também veio sem nota fiscal, isso me causaria problemas no futuro, caso precise de um suporte de assistência via telefone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Desde já, agradeço.</p>

<p>As the console is used I'm pretty sure you will not have access to the warranty although I would still recommend registering the console at https://devicesupport.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the HDMI cable you can use any cable with the console.&nbsp; If you want to save money head to your local dollar store if you have one nearby and buy an HDMI cable there.&nbsp; that's what I've done in the past.</p>

            <p>Ok, so which exact Samsung Galaxy phone model do you have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect it to the PC via USB cable, depending on the version of Android it will show a menu similar to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c4865c0-ef1a-4a3f-a92c-63abc5a1caa9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c4865c0-ef1a-4a3f-a92c-63abc5a1caa9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>To see the menu you might need to pull down the notification drawer from the top of the screen. Once you see it you need to select the option marked as
<em>USB Mass Storage Mode</em> or <em>File Transfers</em> or <em>MTP</em>. After that when you open File Explorer on the PC there should be a new drive letter for the phone's internal storage, and another one for any microSD card inserted in the phone. So something
 like a new drive F: for example. When you browse through F: it should show you everything stored on the phone. You'll need to navigate to the folder where the video is stored and simply copy it over to a folder on your PC.</p>

    <title>Win10 CPU Throttling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mhp0011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 CPU Throttling</h2>
                    <p>Win10 appears to throttle the CPU down when it gets too hot.&nbsp; This is probably a good thing (I figure it prevents the CPU from melting down).&nbsp; It seems, though, that Win10 doesn't seem to recognize when the CPU has cooled back down, so the CPU remains in
 a throttled-down mode indefinitely.&nbsp; I haven't figured out a way to reliably get Win10 to reset the throttling.&nbsp; As a work around, I have downloaded ThrottleStop which allows me to override Win10's behavior.&nbsp; Of course, I now have to manually watch the temperature
 to ensure that the CPU doesn't overhead, but it's better than having an unusable CPU.&nbsp; Is anyone aware of a solution to reset Win10 throttling so that I don't have to use a third-party product to do it?&nbsp; Better yet, has Microsoft acknowledged the issue and
 provided any guidance on when this issue might be corrected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case it matters, I am using a Dell Laptop E6410 with an Intel Core i7 M 640 CPU.</p>

            <p>This is not a Windows 10 problem. &nbsp;It is a problem with the Dell Latitude series. &nbsp;My Lenovo Y510P runs Windows 10 and it does not start thermal throttling until it reaches 99°C. &nbsp;If you want to read about a very similar throttling issue in the Dell Latitude
 E6500, check out ThrottleGate.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That paper details some serious throttling problems that are probably very similar to what you are seeing. &nbsp;If you are using the most recent bios and you are still having problems then your only option is to run ThrottleStop. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The whole reason ThrottleStop was developed was to fix throttling problems like this. &nbsp;Lucky there is a third party solution for this or a lot of laptops would have ended up in the dump.</p>

            Hello!
<br />
<br />I recommend that you close the session of your Skype account where you have it started on all devices you are connected to. If you use Windows 10, be sure to close the default Skype application and also the one you installed.
<br />
<br />After being sure that you are not connected anywhere, just log in on one side, with the correct account and try to send a message.

            <p>Hi Armycyrus,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on the system?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>If iTunes is installed on the system, you may try to uninstall and reinstall the same and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>For further information, refer the article:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Removing and Reinstalling iTunes, QuickTime, and other software components for Windows XP</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>It seems resetting Winsock has resolved the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>For further information refer the Apple support links:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3961493?start=0&amp;tstart=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">HT3204 Apple Device Support hogging CPU, unable to download podcasts</a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.apple.com/kb/TS4123?viewlocale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Apple software on Windows: May see performance issues and blank iTunes Store</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try resetting Winsock and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to determine and to recover from Winsock2 corruption in Windows Server 2003, in Windows XP, and in Windows
 Vista</a> </span></p>
<p>
<span>Important: The above contains steps to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps

<h2>            errors in execution of&#39; exe&#39; files</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello everyone</span></p>
<p><span>I’m Guruprasad from India. I have some issues with execution of
<strong><span style="color: rgba(31, 78, 121, 1)">“.exe”</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(31, 78, 121, 1)">
</span>files. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>ISSUE-1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I was written a code for ‘restart the computer’ in “note pad” &amp; saved that in “.bat” &amp; “.exe” extension. The “.bat” file executed successfully, but the “.exe”
 did not. Windows shown the following error message in a ribbon.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(31, 78, 121, 1)">This app can’t run on your PC.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(31, 78, 121, 1)">To find a version for your, check the software publisher.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am here informing that, “I am using windows – 8.1 64 bit professional version O.S.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>ISSUE-2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When I execute any ‘c’ or ‘C++’
<strong>“.exe” </strong>file getting same error.</span></p>
<p><span>I am here informing that, “the above ‘c++’ “.exe” files had executed on the same pc with windows – 7, 32 bit O.S”.</span><span>So
 I tried those with windows – 7 compatibility mode but that didn’t work.”</span><span> Please replay I’m waiting here.</span></p>
