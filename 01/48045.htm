    <title>Windows 10 reboots after shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n7zm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reboots after shutdown</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded yesterday from windows 7 to windows 10. I have a dirty shutdown I guess. Upon clicking shutdown the computer starts its shutdown and completes, everything is down but after 5 seconds the computer starts to reboot again. This cycle repeats on the
 only way to completely shut down is to turn the power switch in back off on power supply. Why is the shutdown button corrupt this way and what is the fix?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect power settings or due to some corrupt or incompatible driver. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run the power troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p>The power troubleshooter can automatically detect and fix any incorrect power settings. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type Troubleshooting in search bar and click it</p>
<p>Click System &amp; Security</p>
<p>Click Power and run the troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If the power troubleshooter doesn’t detect any incorrect settings, then it is possible that the issue is caused by an incompatible
 or corrupt driver. When the computer goes to sleep mode, Windows sends a request to all hardware parts asking to enter sleep mode. But if the driver for a particular hardware part (like a network adapter or graphic card) is corrupt, it might not respond to
 these requests and may prevent the computer from entering sleep mode. To resolve this, I would suggest you to run Windows update to make sure that you have installed the latest drivers for all the devices. Refer to the section ‘To check for updates’ in this
 article:</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Thanks for the reply. I tried method one and it did not help. Also after 3 hours on MSFT tech help 800 number I was disconnected, so much for win 10 help from MSFT.

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried all the methods sent by others and none worked. But today I solved the problem and after 3 weeks of hell I am glad its over. Here is what I did to resolve the Windows 10 boot reboot problem on shutdown&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I switched back to Windows 7,
 the nightmare is over. Thank you Microsoft for releasing a program when its not ready for prime time. Also have been playing with Linus Mint on my spare drive.....it also works fine just like Windows 7 but windows 10 needs some serious attention from Microsoft.</p>

            <strong>&nbsp;Windows 10 update: I got bored today so after several weeks off windows 10 &nbsp; I decided to try again. I went into boot setup and made my windows 10 drive first boot as C: drive from drive E:
</strong>&nbsp;<strong>( My problem is rebooting right after shutdown )</strong>
<div><strong>It booted up ok on windows 10. I went to update and it searched for updates and found 4. It then downloaded and installed them.
</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw a message to reboot to start the new updates, I did, but when it started I saw a message saying, PC warning unable to restart. I started over again and a screen came up PC unable to restart run repair. I ran repair and it did a diagnosis.
 After finishing diagnosis it said unable to fix. So I ran advance options. It ran adbvanced diagnosis and then said unable to repair.
</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I put in the upgrade DVD and try to run it, it went through its thing then said unable to repair and I saw a message......</strong></div>
<div><strong>Critical Process died in big blue letters.</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I went back to windows 7 and my windows 10 disk is dead! Tomorrow I will reformat it and clone Windows 7 to it and start all over. Microsoft is really screwed when they introduce an operating system that is a piece of garbage.</strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My opinion now is stay away from this windows 10 unless you want headaches or have a spare drive to try it on. I have lost all faith in Microsoft.

            <p>&nbsp;My motherboard an Intel DH67CL works fine in XP, Windows 7 and Windos 8. I only have the shut down problem in Windows 10. I wrote Intel about this and this is their reply to me which is hard to believe that MSFT would overlook this in their software devlopment.</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are having issues with your motherboard when installing Microsoft* Windows* 10.</span></p>
<p><span>Please keep in mind that this motherboard was not designed to support Microsoft* Windows* 10, you can find a list of fully supported operating systems for this motherboard at:
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://www.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/cs-008326.htm</span></p>
<p><span>Yes, the latest BIOS version for this motherboard is 0160 located here:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/25269/BIOS-Update-FCBYT10H-86A-</span></p>
<p><span>Due to the fact that your motherboard was not designed to support Microsoft* Windows* 10, I would suggest installing a fully supports operating system like Microsoft* Windows*
 7.</span></p>
<p><span>Important note: Should you need further assistance from us regarding your inquiry, we would highly appreciate if you could simply reply to this email of ours, instead of sending

<h2>            PCI Serial Port doesn&#39;t have a driver</h2>
                    <p>I have a new computer and run Windows 8 Professional. &nbsp;Two days ago Printer HP Officejet 6700 Premium was working fine. &nbsp;Tried to print today and pop said "Unable to communicate with printer". &nbsp;Everything checks out with the printer. &nbsp;When into devices and
 found a problem with the desk top, 'PCI Serial Port doesn't have a driver'. Clicked fix but it was not fixed. &nbsp;My computer was custom built for me so it's not 'go to customer support'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, found this while searching:&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you are facing the issue on printer.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will certainly help you with this.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>PCI Serial port seems to indicate that you have a separate "serial port" that is based on a separate "card" which uses a PCI motherboard slot.&nbsp; You may need to open the computer's case and find the manufacturer's name.&nbsp; Then, access their web site so as
 to look for the available drivers.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-8&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1</span></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><div>Try to update the chipset drivers from the motherboard manufacturer support and check if it helps.

<h2>            Screen will not turn on, Surface Pro 2</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 2 and when I attempt to turn it on nothing happens, the screen does not come on. What does happen though is that the home button located under the screen vibrates when touched as if the computer is running. I have tried the two step,
 or two button I forget the exact name, reset and it does nothing. The computer has never been dropped or mishandled in any way.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p><p>Also, do you have a second screen you could attach?&nbsp; A wireless display could do it too but be very difficult to get working without seeing what you are doing.&nbsp; Even when I can see what I am doing getting that done is a pain.&nbsp; I have always wondered why
 it could not be automated or at least made more usable.&nbsp; So, on the RT it looks like the sequence would be&nbsp; Win-k, End, Enter.&nbsp; That gets into the Project dialog with the
<em>Connect to a different display</em> button at the bottom.&nbsp; But it's not that easy getting to the bottom.&nbsp; Pressing End only takes us to the
<em>Second screen only</em> button.&nbsp; From there you would need to press Tab (but depending on where you are starting from just pressing Tab once may not get you there).&nbsp; Then you would be given a Project dialog which had a
<em>Add a wireless display</em> link (at the bottom, of course).&nbsp; Pressing End and Enter (or Spacebar) works straightforwardly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then I had to get Narrator's help to figure out that apparently the available wireless display is already given keyboard focus
 (who knew?) so you could then just press Spacebar to get it going.</p>

<p>Hi Tine,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The spell-check function in Skype is based on your device's native language. So if your computer's default language is Danish, spell check will only be available on that language.</p>

    <title>Cannot customize colors in windows 10 and bad update setting. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ri-g  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot customize colors in windows 10 and bad update setting.</h2>
                    <p>Am, dissapointed about windows 10, upgraded from windows 7. But windows 8.1 is better then windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Also the way windows update is configured</strong> and be done is not correct, microsoft forced met to&nbsp; change that. but still you cannot select what update you want to install and wich one not. unl;ess you download some tool. why did the not keeped
 it the old way ? No your forced (and i never do that) to skip windows updates for a while until that is fix, or i reverse back to windows 7 or move to linux with windows in VM.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>the other problem,</strong> there's almost no options to customize the colors. Only a static wrong set of colors that's to light. So how can i customize the colors, examples on internet seems not to work, you already need a tool to make the windows
 header visible so you see what's selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why micosoft removed important options from 10 and 8 is still not clear. the never really put it back.</p>
<p>And the bug with window header text color is still p;resent, make a dark background. but you cannot change the text. Or not found how.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is more made as mobile os, really not suitable for desktop ! Not going to recommend windows 10 to people. I where really excited about 10. But the made it worse then 8.1. you mabye need to install classic shell back too. but that's something you
 need to give a change.</p>

            <p>As regards window header text color: that's actually specified in the theme file that you're using.&nbsp; The 'colorize the title bar' step that people have been using uses a theme with the text color set to black.&nbsp; Thus while it looks bad, that's by design:
 you're using that theme in a fashion which looks bad for it.&nbsp; Using a theme with a light text color would be a better starting point for a dark theme.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As regards the other aspects: yes, the team is aware of the feedback here.&nbsp; I'll +1 the feedback via the Insider program. :)</p>

            <p>Theme, i just want like you do in windows 7 and 8 change the background color and colors in my own custom color. and also would be nice to get the option back to adjust header text colors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nothing of above seems possible. you can change colors. but only to the ones microsoft have selected. in the past you could use this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It's gone, or so terrible hidden tht it's far from user friendly. And like i sayed before. make sure the windows text header color can be changed in windows 10 too. microsoft already broke it in 8.</p>

            Can't figure out for the life of me why Microsoft would deliberately downgrade an operating system and compatible applications to remove color customization and replace with washed out greys and whites that provide poor contrast and eye-straining bright
 white.&nbsp; For god's sake please tell me how to get color back into the programs I have to use every day.&nbsp; And I am not just talking about washed out dark grey or black - I mean soothing colors that relieve eye strain caused by looking at a bright screen all
 day.&nbsp; I wish I could meet the genius who decided that one.

            <p>We're merging two color schemes together: the scoping you see in that colors control panel (not the settings page) pretty much exactly reflects the compromises made to make that happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's interesting things that can be done here, but they take time.&nbsp; In the interim, that control panel is the most powerful tool on the system.&nbsp; If that's not enough, you can walk off into the weeds with custom theme editing and whatnot.</p>

            <p>Just using the normal release build 10586.218. And need to admit that i forgot how i changed the menu header. i used some tool for it. also to fix the missing contrast around the window edge. Lot's of that are wrong in the normal windows 10 pro I use this
 settings for months. that is why i have not noticed any change until the next reinstall.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if silders get a difefrent contract color. darklight grey on light grey is very hard to see sometimes. dpeneds on the software too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But windows 10 reqeures a bunch of more special adjustments you could do in windows 7 and not easy any more in windows 10. replacing the start menu is one, the default is terrible.</p>

            <p>since we had a windows update end of last week I am working on this problem computer right now</p>
<p>
</p><p>once the defender scan ends and windows is updated I will see what the disk number is
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did put that WPR on the computer and the disk number is very high most of the time I have looked at it</p>

            also the nvida driver keeps wanting to update - I have noticed that each time I have turned on this backup computer since I put on Windows 10 - device manager says it is up to date

            <p>I am not sure about using onedrive </p>
<p>
</p><p>I put a file called REALLYMINE.12-12-2016.11-58-48&nbsp; in a public folder on one drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>the disk was running high then went down by the time&nbsp; I finished the recording
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the disk runs high when I am doing either defender or zone alarm scans but runs high at other times too
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if this is not enough information to find the file, please be more explicit in directions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>right now the disk usage is 0 % -&nbsp; and I plan to turn off this&nbsp; PC and go back to my usual one until I either hear on what do next or there is a new windows 10 update or break down and be forced to use this one.&nbsp;

            <p>I have 3 computers - </p>
<p>
</p><p>this issue is on a back up computer - lets call is computer 3&nbsp; - I will update it tonight or tomorrow and see - it had problems starting with anniversary edition update - (and I use Kelly 466 for that computer)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer 2 has no issues and is a clone of computer 3 - both bought at same time with same components except that the hard drive had to be replaced early on I think on computer 2 but might have been 3 - we had to get a tech to reinstall OS on one of them
 too at one time as I could not get to the right spot and he had trouble doing it too but got it on about 5th try&nbsp; - windows 10 updates were not put on at same time however since computer 3 is rarely on
</p>
<p>
</p><p>now about computer 1 - I have seen it also running at 100 % - it was a windows 7 ultimate machine (now on 10) and I noticed after an update late last month, I would run at 16 % (C at 100, other 5 drives at 0) -&nbsp; I found directions for a clean boot and did
 it - stopped many un-needed things from startup but I had found that<span><span><span><span><span>Unistack Services&nbsp; constantly at 100% disk usage, starving out other apps
</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>however, when I run an antivirus on this pc (computer 1)&nbsp; I will max out at 16 % disk usage and see C at 100 % in performance and other disks are at 0 %&nbsp; (100 /6 is
 showing at 16 basically) while C is scanned and I see higher than 16 when E is being scanned</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>something is fishy - </p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I will when I get a chance - we don't like running 3 pcs on our home network at once.&nbsp; Our data usage is capped and I haven't gotten to it yet.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer 1 is running okay now with these start up items curtailed except when running an antivirus.&nbsp; I use Zone Alarm but have seen it with Defender too.&nbsp; It also appears that the 100 % for drive C is "phony" as I sure don't see that many MB's being used.&nbsp;

</p><p>I saw higher % disks at times with a higher and also lower sum of usage - for example 99 % with a total of 0.6 GB - there were also whole screens of 100 %&nbsp; usage so more than 30 sec at 100 %

<p>
</p><p>now that the scan is over the disk is at 2 % usage but I must admit I am not doing much on this PC.

    <title>Gamertag autochanged because my real name was banned&#59; customer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fluffyfoal77882  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag autochanged because my real name was banned&#59; customer service refuses to waive fee for choosing a new gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>My gamertag was automatically changed because my real first name was added to a list of offensive terms. I'd like to choose a new gamertag for myself, but I don't want to pay ten dollars to comply with Microsoft's policy change towards my name. Customer
 service tells me that there is nothing that I can do; I just have to pay.<br />
&nbsp;I find this to be unacceptable.</p>
<p>In my case, the documentation shows the following things to be true:</p>
<p>(1) My choice of gamertag was made in good faith, with no intent to offend. Microsoft's records show that the term which has been deemed to be offensive is, in fact, my real name.</p>
<p>(2) I never violated the policy on gamertag designation. Rather, the policy changed to include my good-faith activity. I registered the gamertag in December 2006 and used it without incident, ever. My gamertag was not changed due to other users registering
 complaints. Rather, my gamertag was changed due to my name being added to the offensive terms list. My inquiries with the enforcement division have confirmed this.</p>
<p>(3) Microsoft has made exceptions to the need to pay for a gamertag change in cases like mine. See:
<a href="http://kotaku.com/5887730/gamers-last-name-deemed-obscene-by-xbox-live-cops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://kotaku.com/5887730/gamers-last-name-deemed-obscene-by-xbox-live-cops</a> However, XBox customer service has told me that it is not possible to waive the fee. The enforcement division refuses to respond to my inquiries concerning a waiver of the gamertag
 change fee.</p>
<p>It annoys me that the gamertage name policies acknowledge the problem of real names being added to the offensive term list, but the automatic gamertag change logic doesn't check to see whether the offensive term is in fact the user's real name and then issue
 a complimentary name change instead.</p>
<p>As both customer service and enforcement have refused to provide me with service, where else can I go? Customer service told me that I can write a physical letter and mail it to Microsoft headquarters, but that's all that I can do. Surely, in the 21st century,
 there must be a more expeditious alternative.</p>

<p>Yes keep your name rated e for everyone</p>
<p>And no there is no appeal or waiver you nust abide by the terms of use and yes the fee is actually mentioned in the terms of use</p>
<p>Fyi you should feel fortunate to even have the option to change</p>
<p>Name rules violations will only result in a perm ban on any other service on first violation</p>
<p>And yes the rules are the same and if you look at that case it was subjective it doesnt apply to everyone</p>

<p>@ngocphi</p>
<p>On some counts, I think you didn't read my post:</p>
<p>1. There is no sense in which that case was "subjective" that differentiates it from my case. I challenge you to specify such reasons.</p>
<p>2. I don't challenge my name's placement on the banned terms list in any way.</p>
<p>3. There was never any report against my name, ever.</p>
<p>Your final point is a fallacious argument: I won't consider myself lucky and see how I am being treated as acceptable because somewhere someone else is being treated worse. Saying that one act is worse than another does not establish the latter as acceptable.
 It is worse to be robbed of life and limb than of property; we don't tell people who have been robbed that they have no grounds for complaint because other people who are robbed are also killed. In the future, you should try to respond to what is at issue
 in what a person is saying rather than attempting to change what is at issue.</p>

<p>I'm just trying to collect documentation of everything about my situation that I find so appalling. Here's a post entitled "Applying XBLPET's Values" from XBox Live, Policy and Enforcement, Trending news, April 2015 (see:
<a href="http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/WhatsHappening?id=news" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://enforcement.xbox.com/Home/WhatsHappening?id=news</a>).</p>
<p>Reads the post:</p>
<p>"One of the most popular expressions amongst enforcement agents is “context is king”. It’s not just a nice sound bite, but a fundamental philosophy that applies to everything we do. For instance, when we review a potentially-offensive
 Gamertag we always examine the full context. Is the Gamertag immediately offensive? What else can it potentially refer to? Does the player have a history of offensive content? Critical thinking is important, and content doesn’t always fall cleanly into “good”
 or “bad” categories. Real life comes in shades of grey."</p>
<p>(1) XBox Enforcement claims that it considers "what else can [a potentially-offensive Gamertag] potentially refer to." Here is my inquiry to Xbox Enforcement:
http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/41/t/2001509.aspx. I specifically inform them of what they should have already known: My gamertag makes reference
 to a my real name. XBox Live Enforcement's response completely ignores this.</p>
<p>(2) XBox Live Enforcement claims that is specifically considers the question, "Does the player have a history of offensive content?" To date, my record shows no complaints filed against me for anything, ever.</p>

<p>That second part doesnt apply unless repeat offences or for perm ban.</p>
<p>Hate speach ia actually banned in most countries and inxlude jailtime</p>
<p>Mahbe you should consider others sensitiblities</p>
<p>And note in your article it was never updared as the policy is actually pretty clear</p>
<p>You do not want part2 if you do not follow the rules and have repeat offences of the naming rules a forced name change will be the least of your worries</p>
<p>Multiple violations of the naming rulea cna incur a perm ban of the said account</p>

<p>Just for your info its not just about context hate speech is zero tolerance and a severve violation of the terma of use</p>

<p>Please don't offer further comments on this topic; your comments aren't contributing anything.</p>
<p>I've never engaged in hate speech. I've never been accused of engaging in hate speech. That you mention this shows that you're not attending to the facts of this case. To claim that using your culturally and legally legitimate name is hate speech is specious,
 period.</p>
<p>I've been saying all along that I'm happy to comply with the gamertag policy. That you claim I should do this shows that you're not attending to the facts of this case.</p>
<p>That you think that "context" in the sense invoked by XBoxlive policy isn't at issue shows that you aren't attending to the facts of this case. My name is documented as a culturally-legitimate name with an inoffensive meaning; any web search will show this.
 My name is in no way offensive in its language of origin. It is only offensive in a radically different context (another language, another culture, and another part of the world).</p>
<p>That you mention that hate words offend more than one person shows that you're not attending to the facts of this case. No one has ever complained about my gamertag.</p>
<p>All I've been saying is that I shouldn't have to pay for the privilege of complying with a policy that has been enforced (1) without consideration for what I've actually done (documented fact: I wasn't trying to, nor have I ever, offend anyone) and (2) when
 there is a history of accommodating users when the policy makes judgements about culturally legitimate names.</p>

<p><span>Hi DennisonDD,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may enable the default administrator account and check if the photos open fine without any error message.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows®&nbsp;7, the built-in administrator account is disabled by default. In previous versions of Windows, an Administrator account was automatically
 created during Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) with a blank password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To enable the default administrator account, you would have to login to an account having administrative privileges and follow the steps mentioned
 below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>Start, </strong>and select <strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the
<strong>View by</strong> drop down menu, and select <strong>Large items</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select
<strong>Administrative Tools.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. Open
<strong>Computer Management</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. In the left-pane of Computer Management, double-click
<strong>Local Users and Groups</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click the
<strong>Users </strong>folder.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Right-click
<strong>Administrator</strong> account and select <strong>Properties</strong>. <br />
<br />
The <strong>Administrator Properties</strong> window appears.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, clear the <strong>Account is Disabled</strong> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Exit the
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more information:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Enable and Disable the Built-in Administrator Account</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744293(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd744293%28WS.10%29.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re able to view the photos in the default administrator account, you may have to create a new user account with administrative privileges and disable the default
 administrator account. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This should fix the issue.
</span></p>

<h2>            Can I extract pages from pdf reader app on Windows RT Surface&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am using the reader app that came with my Surface tablet and I would like to know if there is a way to extract pages from documents and save as a separate file. The files I download are often hundreds of pages long and only 20 or 30 apply me. The finder
 function works great to locate the pages I need but I need a way to save these pages without saving the entire document. This way I can email venders only information they need.</p>

            <p>Figured it out. Under the devices charm send the pages you want to One Note. Open One Note and then save the file. Go to the file menu and export the file to PDF. Seems like a lot of work when all they have to do is be able to list the Reader app under devices
 the same as One Note. Looks like they also have plenty of room on the commands bar to add this function. It's probably not a big deal for most people but I use this process all the time.</p>

</p><p>If you think it may have been a non-driver update from Windows that caused your problem, all you can do is set the Windows Update settings away from Automatic and install the updates one at a time until you can find out which update may be a problem.&nbsp; You
 then hide the troublesome update.&nbsp; If you switch off Automatic Updates and set them up to not download and only notify you then it is possible to hide a troublesome update.&nbsp; After doing such a thing you may return to your normal Automatic Update settings.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. Let's try the following methods and check.</p>
<p>
<strong>Method 1: Update USB Controllers.</strong>
</p><div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To update the USB Controllers from Device Manager follow these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Go to Device manager in control panel.<br />
2. Select Device manager and a Device Manager window will pop-up.<br />
3. Double Click on USB Controllers to expand.<br />
4. Right click on the USB Controllers that is listed and select Update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: Reset your computer (keep my files).</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We would ask you to reset your computer and see if the issue resolved. Please note that here in this reset we would keep your files and only the programs and applications will be uninstalled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Open start menu and select the settings button.</div>
<div>2. In the settings windows, select “Update &amp; security”.</div>
<div>3. In the “Update &amp; security” windows, select “Recovery”.</div>
<div>4. In “Recovery”, please select “Reset this PC” and click “Get started”.</div>
<div>5. A blue screen will follow giving you two options, Click either "Keep my files" or "Remove everything," depending on whether you want to keep your data files intact. Either way, all of your settings will return to their defaults and apps will be uninstalled.
 We would suggest you to select “keep my files” options.</div>
<div>6. Here, Select "Just remove my files" or "Remove files and clean the drive" if you chose to "remove everything" in the prior step. Cleaning the drive takes a lot longer but will make sure that, if you are giving the computer away, the next person will
 have a hard time recovering your erased files. If you are keeping the computer, choose "Just remove my files."
<div>7. Click next if windows warns you that you won’t be able to roll back to a prior version of the windows operating system.</div>
<div>8. Click reset when prompted. Windows will restart and take several minutes to reset itself.</div>
<div>9. Click Continue when prompted.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can also follow the below link for further troubleshooting:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>DISCLAIMER: </strong></div>
<div>
<p>When you use System Reset to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>

<h2>            File created by Windows 7 Backup is 0 bytes</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My question concerns the Backup and Restore program in Windows 7. I use an external hard drive to save the backup of my sysem files (using the recommended Windows settings in the program). While the backup seems to be successful -- I get no error message, more
 disk space is taken up on my external drive,&nbsp;and the program says the backup is complete -- I notice that the file created (that I'd be restoring my system from) is shown as being&nbsp;0 bytes.&nbsp; My hunch is that this file is not a properly created backup, or else
 it would show a real file size. What could be causing this problem?&nbsp;If it's relevant, I'm using an HP G60 laptop. Any info about this would be appreciated. I just want to make sure I have a properly created backup of my files.

            While it is a good idea to check your backup operation, your method is likely to lead you astray. The Windows 7 backup process creates a number of files and folders on your backup medium that are largely hidden from view. To confirm that your backup worked
 you should restore a few sample files to a different location than where they used to reside. This will really tell you if you could restore the files in a crisis.<br />

<h2>            How to change the Username when signed in with a MS account</h2>
                    <p>I'm using windows 10 and 8.1 with the same microsoft account (so not a local profile) wich was created on windows 8.1 earlier. I'd like to change my username but I can't find any ways to do it. In settings/accounts I don't see any options to change my username
 and on microsoft's website I already changed something called "name" but it seems like it has nothing to do with my username at, it's still the same as it was. Is it even possible to do it?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Here is a good place to help figure things out about Windows Services:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.blackviper.com/</a><br />
<br />
Looking there, if you are running 32bit XP Service Pack 3 for example and then click on the link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.blackviper.com/2008/05/19/black-vipers-windows-xp-x86-32-bit-service-pack-3-service-configurations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows XP x86 (32-bit) Service Pack 3 Service Configurations</a><br />
<br />
You will see all the XP Services names and a lot more information about them and you can drill down even further to find out more about each individual Service, if it needs to be running or not, can you do without it, etc.<br />
<br />
If you are running the XP Indexing Service, it is probably slowing your system down quite a bit and I will usually disable it, but we don't know anything about your system or what your issue is or if you are just curious.<br />
<br />
If you need to share your Events or ask questions about them, here is what I usually say:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
%SystemRoot%\system32\eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
The most interesting logs are usually the Application and System logs.<br />
<br />
Some logs such as Security and Internet Explorer may be completely empty or have only a few items.&nbsp; The default settings for XP is not to log all that activity unless you need to troubleshoot some issue in those areas.&nbsp; If you enable the logging for them the
 logs fill up quickly and could negatively effect your system performance with all the extra (usually unnecessary) activity.<br />
<br />
If you have Microsoft Office installed, it has its own logs and they may be empty or occasional boring activity or very little activity if there is no problem with your Office applications.&nbsp; This is normal.<br />
<br />
Not every event is a problem, some are informational messages that things are working okay and some are warnings.<br />
<br />
However, no event should defy reasonable explanation.<br />
<br />
Each event is sorted by Date and Time.&nbsp; Errors will have red Xs, Warnings will have yellow !s.<br />
<br />
Information messages have white is.&nbsp; Not every Error or Warning event means there is a serious issue.<br />
<br />
Some are excusable at startup time when Windows is booting.&nbsp; Try to find just the events at the date and time around your problem.<br />
<br />
If you double click an event, it will open a Properties window with more information.&nbsp; On the right are black up and down arrow buttons to scroll through the open events. The third button that looks like two pages on top of each other is used to copy the event
 details to your Windows clipboard.<br />
<br />
When you find an interesting event that occurred around the time of your issue, click the third button under the up and down arrows to copy the details and then you can paste the details (right click, Paste or CTRL-V) the detail text back here for analysis.&nbsp;
 Remove any personal information from your information after pasting if you are compelled to do so.<br />
<br />
If you paste an Event, it will look something like this boring system startup event:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7035<br />
Date:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7/14/2010<br />
Time:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5:54:18 PM<br />
User:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jose<br />
Computer:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
The Remote Access Connection Manager service was successfully sent a start control.<br />
<br />
<br />
To get a fresh start on any Event Viewer log, you can choose to clear the log (backing up the log is offered), then reproduce your issue, then look at just the events around the time of your issue and troubleshoot the events that are happening when you have
 your issue.<br />

<p>noticed this on hotdeals.</p>
<p>do they charge for the elite cards to stick the 35 on ?</p>
<p>and also 2000xp is worth over a £5 ...</p>
<p>so in theory you get £40+ on a gift card? </p>

<p>I'm very tempted to trade mine in after completion but keep the dlc codes and buy the game when its cheaper in a few months time. Seems like a very good deal to me</p>

<p>Seems like a good deal. At first I loved it but now its meeeeh. Its decent just not that exiting for me. Going to try and complete it and trade it in. Buy Duke Nukem or Red Faction or Infamous with the credit. I will also keep my DLC code. Then in a few
 months when it can be had for £15 I will buy it again.</p>

<p>@ingoish456 in your replys and even own topic, if you looked at the bit I say after "elite points" "(FREE TO JOIN) you'd of had your answer ;P lol Also 35 will go on a gift card and xp on your elite (reward) card.</p>
<p>Anyways yeah to me seems too good to miss and like lewis says, look how cheap RDR is now and also the RDR dlc collection all dlc has been 800 points only twice!</p>

<p>I just want to thank the original poster. Without this thread, I would probably have missed out on this offer. I've now traded my copy in for £35+ £5.88 in points. I only paid £25 for it too...

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
If your Java is uptodate and tests ok then the issue is either Pogo or something<br />
else causing an issue on your computer.<br />
<br />
Check with Pogo Support.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced tab - check BOTH boxes -&gt; Disable Script<br />
Debugging - APPLY / OK&nbsp; - close and restart IE.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
It that did not help try these :<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessories - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore then click Reset - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;-&nbsp; click reset all zones to default - Apply / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
any better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java<br />
still installs it and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for<br />
other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look<br />
right. Permitted are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program<br />
ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - SpyBHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download -<br />
unzip&nbsp;and run - not all are bad however some can cause your issue (Toolbars are BHO's).<br />

<h2>            Xbox Live won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t let me download Resident Evil&#58; Code Veronica X</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I bought Resident Evil: Code Veronica X in the day it came out. Downloaded it, and played it fine. But, sadly, I had to delete it from my Hard Drive, and when I tried to download it again, Xbox Live wouldn't let me. The download went fine until 99%, which
 is where it gave me an error, saying that the download could not be completed. When I go to System Options, it says the game is damaged. I tried to download it on another Xbox, but I got the same error. What should I do? I just want to play the game I paid
 for!!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rodrigo</p>

<p>Hello, I'm sorry to hear that you are having some issues with downloading your game.</p>
<p>I am going to try my best to help you out on this.</p>
<p>First thing I would do is fully delete the game from your harddrive. Next clear your cache, to do so please visit this article:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a></p>
<p>Once your cache is cleared, go to account management and then download history and attempt to download it again. If problems are still persisting contact Microsoft Support:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../contact-us</a></p>
<p>If you have any further questions or need additional help please do not hesitate to ask, best of luck</p>

<p>Thank you for trying to help, but I already tried that. I even tried downloading on another console, another hard drive, but still nothing. What I think is that Microsoft changed the game to U.S. only, but after I bought the game, so I can't download it
 anymore.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezing at welcome screen</h2>
                    <p>I have updated my Toshiba laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 using the update, at the time of running the update I was logged on as an administrator through a local account.&nbsp; All seemed well except that when I got to the welcome screen my local account
 had disappeared and I was left with an account for which I didn't know the password.&nbsp; After a couple of unsuccessful attempts at logging in the laptop froze on a blue screen with the windows logo and user name and the circle of dots going round and round.&nbsp;
 I have tried rebooting by holding down the power button but on restart I am immediately returned to the same screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help please? I would ideally like to return to Windows 7 but don't know how to.</p>
<p />
