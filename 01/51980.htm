    <title>How to Install Windows 10 from ISO file on DVD&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to Install Windows 10 from ISO file on DVD&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have purchased Windows 8.1 PRO installed on a hard drive.&nbsp; The PC it was in died and has been replaced by a newer PC.&nbsp; I moved the hard drive to the new PC.&nbsp; The old PC had a 32 bit CPU.&nbsp; The new one has a 64 bit CPU and more RAM.&nbsp; I want/need to be able
 to access that RAM and want to "upgrade" from the 32 bit OS to the 64 bit OS.&nbsp; I am also willing to skip this step and go straight to Windows 10 64bit OS.&nbsp; I have "registered" for the Windows 10 upgrade but it is my understanding that the 32 bit version will
 install over the 32 bit Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IF I will be offered the 64 bit version, then please tell me so and you can ignore the rest of this question (unless you want to provide the answers for others who similarly do not know what to do with the ISO file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded the 64 bit Windows 10 OS and burned it as an ISO file onto a DVD rom using a different, 64 bit PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I insert the DVD rom, I see NO WAY to initiate the install process.&nbsp; When I "right click" on the file name, I do NOT see "MOUNT" as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have cruised your forums, FAQs and your SPARSE installation instructions and found NO answers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT do I do with the DVD-rom?&nbsp; What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,<br />
Arthur</p>

<p>Okay so somebody had the nerve to honestly sign a partition to bring back DRM. I swear if MS takes this seriously I am officially done with Microsoft.</p>

<p>they have different hardware, although they are "easier" to port than the 360 -&gt; PS3 was, and vise-versa it's still difficult, was reading that the other day with ElderScrolls Online so you'd need to have the PS4 operating system, and it'd have to boot the
 right partition, then there'd be many issues like game-saves how kinect would intefere, it having to connect the right controllers, how the PS4 OS would handle the XO controller.. and so on lol, and then the silicon is different, the clock speed (it might
 even fry the Xbox One components because it's at a lower clock speed, and the GPU isn't as good, so it'd probably destroy your Xbox One (when you try to overclock a PC and you don't know what you're doing or OC it too high you burn out the components, so the
 Xbox One thinking it has a better GPU or a higher clock speed (if PS4 differs from Xbox which it does it will burn out components) :P I wouldn't advise it!</p>

<p>Another family share jab from someone w/o reading comprehension skills. The plan was posted on their own Xbox Wire site before the policy changes. Point #4.
<a href="http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/license" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">news.xbox.com/.../license</a> Not hard to understand. But again, we'll ignore the KNOWN Microsoft employees who said it was full games, while believing an anonymous "employee" on a
 blog because it fits our argument. Because creating a demo feature to share with 10 people makes so much sense when said people have access to the marketplace which already houses demos. Waiting for a time when 1 of 10 others aren't playing a DEMO makes tons
 of sense over downloading your own demo &amp; playing it whenever you want. </p>

<p>Its not only about people having their own opinion. There are a lot of xbox supporters that dont want the DRM and think the xbox is doing way better without. The petition is basically a whole lot of sony fanboys acting as xbox supporters and signing it to
 get xbox to the original state. If this happens the xbox one is going to get the exact same backlash or worse when it was first revealed.

<h2>            Cannot use the play to feature in windows media player for Onkyo TX-NR609 Media Receiver</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Onkyo TX-NR609 Media Receiver</p>
<p>Hi all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the Onkyo TX-NR609 and it works fine except for streaming music from windows media player. When I click on the 'play to' it will highlight the amplifier name and model number which I click on and then it opens the player where it will then tell me
 that 'error occured on your device' and then it will tell me underneath the song that is trying to open that 'the device cannot be controlled'.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have no idea what could be causing this and to say that its a bit frustrating is an understatement, the onkyo iphone app works fine and i am able to listen to various different radio stations plus I have access to my windows media player library via dlna
 but find it to be somewhat tedious so I dont tend to use it as much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone had similar problems? If so I would appreciate any help you could offer, I was hoping it would be more straight forward then this and swapping the reciever for one with apple's airplay but then that brings the other problem of having to transfer
 music between laptop-itunes-iphone/ipad then reversing that to delete music and then doing the same back and bloody forth. Apple had to make things complicated didn't they.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using windows 7 32bit </p>

<p>I have a similar situation.</p>
<p>I have an older skype account with a username and one email address listed on that account. I have in the past accessed that account from my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently&nbsp;downloaded skype onto my laptop and then proceeded to sign in&nbsp;using my email address (same one as above) and not my username, and realized&nbsp;that I had inadvertently&nbsp;created a second skype account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.... I have one email address and two skype accounts. I&nbsp;can access my original skype account using the username and password and the second, newer skype account using the email address and password to sign in. I&nbsp;just want my original skype account and
 want to delete the second. </p>
<p>

<p><span>I to have same problem, and I have put money on both accounts.&nbsp; I can get to my 'primary' Skype account, but attempting to log on to the secondary Skype account is impossible.&nbsp; I went through the 'forgot password' MICROSOFT
 MAZE and it asked me for obsolete (abandoned) passwords, and how much I spent maybe years ago on some Skype account, and other incredibly obscure bits of data no human being could remember.&nbsp; This is yet another example why I LOATHE dealing with Microsoft.&nbsp;
 &nbsp;Every contact with Microsoft is painful, leads me to more interrogations, more 'change your password again and again' blind alleys, and more intrusive in my face Cortana irrelevant suggestions.&nbsp; There appears to be only one practical solution: abandon my
 'secondary' Skype Account, abandon the money I sent Microsoft, continue to use almost any other service other than a Microsoft service, and share my angst with you by this comment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

            OK.&nbsp; After Microsoft sent me a note I could 'reinstate' my credit I carefully followed directions, reinstated my SKYPE credit on the 'secondary' account.&nbsp; So I may have been overly grumpy in my post 2/18/18, sorry.&nbsp; I still think Microsoft's MAZE to get
 information / online services drives me nasty.&nbsp;

    <title>Repeatedly Corrupted Favourites in Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoff.sullivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Repeatedly Corrupted Favourites in Edge</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 PCs, two laptops and a desktop, all running Windows 10 with all&nbsp;the latest updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;On one of the laptops I'm enrolled in the Insider program to get the latest updates.&nbsp; I regularly log on to the different devices and different times of the day
 using the same Microsoft&nbsp;account on all 3 devices.&nbsp; OneDrive is configured on all three devices to keep my files in sync between them and my&nbsp;Edge browser favourites are also synchronised between the devices.&nbsp; However the favourites are&nbsp;repeatedly being corrupted.&nbsp;&nbsp;When
 the Favourites corruption occurs I end up with two or more identically named folders typically each with zero items in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I also have File History configured to&nbsp;automatically back up my&nbsp;files to a NAS drive&nbsp;on my home network I can usually use that to go back in time to a point before the favourites became too corrupted and restore from that point, however obviously
 doing that&nbsp;also causes me to lose some of my recent additions to Favourites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone&nbsp;help with what might be causing this and give me some ideas of what&nbsp;I might be able to change to prevent it occurring&nbsp;again in future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>

            <p>Pavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 with the November Update with subsequent cumulative updates on both the desktop and&nbsp;one of the laptops.&nbsp; The other laptop was&nbsp;running the latest release of the Insider Preview build on fast track, but following your advice I've decided
 to stop receiving preview builds on that machine and applied those changes tonight with a reboot.&nbsp; I believe it is still at least Windows 10 version 1511 or later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be honest I'm not exactly sure when the Favourites corruption occurred.&nbsp; This is because I use Edge with the Favourite Bar turned on and for all the web site links I access on a daily basis I&nbsp;use links on the Favourites Bar itself - these seem immune
 from the corruption.&nbsp; It is the rest of the Favourites (those that you access by first clicking on the Hub)&nbsp;where the corruption occurs and&nbsp;for me those are sites I only tend to access less frequently.&nbsp; As such it can be a few days or even a few weeks before
 I notice any corruption has occurred.&nbsp; I'm not sure whether the&nbsp;most recent corruption occurred before or after the upgrade to version 1511.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from normal daily usage I haven't made any significant changes to either computer recently with the obvious exception of applying the November update on all machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;occasionally use&nbsp;Chrome and Opera too (and very occasionally Internet Explorer as well. I haven't experienced the problem with any of those other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop is a Bigpockets machine with an AMD dual core CPU, a Crucial SSD for o/s and applications and a large Western Digital hard disc for users files and data.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the laptops is an Asus Zenbook UX32A with a Samsung 840 Pro SSD upgrade and the
 one that used to be set up for Insider builds is a Dell E6220 with an SSD upgrade too.&nbsp; The desktop and the Dell get shutdown and powered off when not in use.&nbsp; The Zenbook I just close the lid and&nbsp;it sleeps (I have it set to resume without requiring a log
 on when I open the lid again).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.&nbsp; I'll restore the&nbsp;Favourites on the desktop by using the File History and assuming Annaya Podder's article is correct this change ought to be replicated to the other machines as they are all running the Nov update.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll then keep tabs on
 it to see if the corruption recurs and post&nbsp;again if it does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hey Xbox Gamer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The error code you are seeing seems to be network related. If you haven't already, shut down the console, unplug it for 30 secs, and try setting it up again. If you still see the code, you might want to try a
 hard wired connection, or a different network altogether. Let us know how it goes!</p>

<h2>            Clean install Of Win 8.1 Creates ErrorCodes on Start up&#47;Fail to start&#47;Fail with driver</h2>
                    <p>so the other day i downloaded my new update for nividea graphics driver for my 740 in my HP Pavilion 15-n220TX which had windows 10 on it from the free upgrade. so i ran the installer to update the driver and then it says this version isnt compatible with
 your version of windows. so i ran it as admin rights and it installed did its thing. once it installed it flashed and then came to a blue screen saying video driver Fatal Error or something like that and i couldnt get past the system recovery. so i got to
 the point where i had overcome my fear of looseing all my important stuff to fix it after about 2 hours mucking around and no fix. It then ran through the recovery process and finished factory resetting and then restarted and came up with another error code
 with a problem under the lines of </p>
<p>
</p><p>X:windows\system32\drivers\"cant remember this one".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By now i was realy mad so i though bugger it ill go on my desktop and download the installer for installation media recovery on &nbsp;the microsoft website.Ithendownloaded windows 8.1 and put it on a usb. I then booted it and reinstalled windows yet again but
 formated my harddrives partion where windows is installed. (still keeping the recovery partion which is factory built in about 20 or so gigs.) i then installed this new version of windows onto the partion not once, not twice but at least 5 times by now trying
 to find some problem with it and fix it. The error code at start up now says&nbsp;<br />
The operating system couldnt be loaded because critical driver is missing or contains Errorrs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File:\windows\system32\drivers\ADP80XX.sys<br />
Error Code:0x0000185</p>
<p>
</p><p>Youll need to use a recovery disc blah blah to fix this .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its been such a big problem these last couple of days and i realy dont have the money to buy anew laptop. I do DJing as well and use this laptop, (thank god i store all my Music on &nbsp;a portable Harddrive) and its busy season having new years coming up and
 christmas.<br />
Could someone please give me some clues how to fix this ASAP. ill love you forever. Every other problem ive had i can fix because im pretty clued up on computers from learning them at school and self teaching with google etc etc but this one has seriously got
 me this time.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>thankyou for the reply :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i cant either of them because the the partion without the recovery (where windows is ment to be installed) no longer has an OS on it after formating that part to install it on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so instead i created a version of windows onto a disc. inserted it and booted from it. i then went:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Repair your computer / troubleshoot / refresh your pc:</strong> then the next thing it says is (the drive where windows isinstalled is locked. unlock the drive and try again )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Locked??? how on earth can it be locked. Anyway so i continued and this time went to:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">Repair your computer / troubleshoot / reset your &nbsp;pc:&nbsp;</span>( unable to reset your pc, a required drive partion is missing)</p>
<p>
</p><p>the third thing i tryed was to just fully install it straight from the disk going into install fromDVDDrive</p>
<p>
</p><p>i go through the process and then come to the partion selection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>theres all my allocated space (450GB) and theres my OEM Recovery partion (20GB)there as well. i then shift my allocated space to a new partion and it then creates all of these separate partions as well:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drive 0 partion 1 : recovery ( 450mb )</p>
<p>Drive 0 Partion 2 : System ( 100 mb)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Drive 0 Partion 3 : MSR Reserved &nbsp;( 16mb )</p>
<p>Drive 0 Partion 4 : Primary ( 450 GB )</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i install it onto primary ( 450GB ) and i get the message : This partion on the disk selected for installation are not in the recommended order. For additional information about installing to GPT disks go to the &nbsp;Microsoft website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installing it onto there or not by the end of the installation once its under finishing process it says : error the installation disk is corrupted your data wont be saved. I can insure you it is not corrupted because ive downloaded it 3 times now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can delete the partion 1,2,3 and install onto primary without that &nbsp;GPT disk message though but still comes up with the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p>You can make the font black, but it will continue to have a black shadow.&nbsp; Although the system visual effects menu has a "show desktop icon shadow" checkbox, turning it off does not work and is currently listed as a bug (it just hasn't received a patch yet
 because it's not a security issue like most of the bugs getting patched).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make the font color itself black, you can set the "fill color" (used behind the wallpaper if the wallpaper isn't big enough to fill the monitor).&nbsp; If the fill color is dark, a white font is used.&nbsp; If you make the fill color white, the font will switch
 to black.</p>
<p><br />
To change the fill color, open your wallpaper picture selection, and set the style to "centered", set your fill color, then change the style back the way you want.</p>

            That did not work. &nbsp;Instead, I changed the theme to the High Contrast White and played with the color options available there. &nbsp;Not perfect but I have the contrast I need for my aging eyes. &nbsp;Just wish the nerdpunks who create the software would remember
 that there are a lot of us out here who do not have 20/20 vision.

this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Firedog,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You helped with a different issue last week but in doing that activity I have another issue that has been bugging me regarding WLM. I assume this is also present in any version of WLM (2011 or 2012).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appears when a new account is set up for gmail (in my case) it generates a number of folders under the main email account heading:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail (account name)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Inbox</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Gmail]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drafts</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Important</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent Mail</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spam</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Starred</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trash</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drafts</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personal</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Receipts</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trash</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Travel</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Work</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the [Gmail] level there is a small icon that allows for the folders under [Gmail]&nbsp;to be hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is when an account is set up do all of these folders really need to be created and if not how do you NOT have them appear?&nbsp; If you can't avoid having them set up is there any issue with deleting them - Starred, Personal, Trash, Travel, Work,
 etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Along the same lines as this thread, I have noticed that the message count between the Inbox, All Mail and Important never seems to match. Is there something I can do to keep the message count the same? For example, my current Inbox message count is 461,
 the All Mail message count is 2802, and the Important message count is 2424. When I move email messages to my storage folders I typically move them from the Inbox folder. Should I be moving from a different source?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I try to keep the Inbox uncluttered and utilize the Storage Folders area to move those messages that I have dealt with. The All Mail and Important folders still hang onto these emails and at times even though the Inbox indication is that they have been read,
 they may or may not have been indicated as having been "Read" in the All Mail or Important folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By moving messages to the Storage Folders I'm assuming that they are being moved to my local disk drive and moved off of the gmail server - but I guess I am wrong. I guess that's one of "perks" of IMAP?</p>
<p>

            <p>Gmail has an idiosyncratic way of classifying messages. It applies labels, rather than assigning messages to folders. Any given message can have more than one label, so this becomes problematical when a mail client like Windows Live Mail tries to translate
 those labels into folders. You might want to&nbsp;review all your Gmail IMAP settings.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://mail.google.com</span>&nbsp;and log in. Click the settings cog&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fsbm6za.dm2303.livefilestore.com%2fy2pXyjrmtekAck0S-sgGLY6yZ3S2Eoe-o-4B1TsHw2W2Z_JuLzR_qU8rL0CdTMK3chkY7O_fylLrF3ktMmZBYlu_wbDKzU99O2-3H8d_iH6dEg%2fGmail-settings-cog-1.png%3fpsid%3d1" />&nbsp;and
 select <em>Settings</em>. </li><li>Under <em>Forwarding and POP/IMAP</em>, select <em>Auto-Expunge Off</em></li><li>Under <em>Labels</em>, select the labels you want to see in Windows Live Mail. These will become separate folders, so fewer is usually better to avoid duplication. In particular, you don't want
<em>All mail </em>(which is just that - all messages in all folders). I have&nbsp;opted to hide
<em>Starred </em>and <em>Important </em>also.&nbsp;</li><li>Make a note of the names of the special folders - I see <em>Sent mail</em>, <em>
Drafts</em>, <em>Spam</em> and <em>Bin</em>. </li><li>Back in Windows Live Mail, <br />
<strong>Reset the list of IMAP folders: </strong></li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click on the account name in the folder pane and then press Alt-S F to open the
<em>Show/hide IMAP folders</em> dialogue. Click <em>Reset List</em> to refresh the folder list, then use the buttons to show only the folders you want to see.</li></ul>
</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select <em>Properties</em>. On the IMAP tab, select
<em>Store special folders on IMAP server,&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;then enter the server's names for the special folders in the boxes. If the folder for sent messages in webmail is called
<em>Sent Mail</em>, then enter <em>Sent Mail </em>into the box alongside <em>Sent Items path
</em>and so on. It's important to be clinically accurate with folder names - <em>
Sent Mail</em> is not the same as <em>Sent mail</em>.</li></ul>
</strong></em><strong>folders work the same way for all accounts:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When viewing your message list, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the <em>Advanced</em> tab, select
<em>Use the 'Deleted Items' folder for IMAP accounts</em>.</li></ul>
<p>If this doesn't quite answer all your questions, please say so.</p>

            <p>Followed your instructions and was successful in deleting the display of the "All Mail" and "Important" folders. Basically all the other instructions were already set to your mentioned settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a Send/Receive to sync with the main server does not come up with any errors. Initially it did on one account since I forgot to "Reset List" on the WLM view pane (live and learn).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storage Folders - I have 5 email accounts set up in my main WLM 2011 account. From each of the respective Inbox's I move messages to a specific folder if I want to keep them. I noticed that when I logged into mail.google.com, there was a line item labeled
 Storage. Is this spread across all of my accounts as far as free amount of storage?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help with the All Mail and the Important folders.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had this problem a while ago but it went away. I thought MS had finally fixed this simple issue but sadly, no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the old reboot trick isn't working this time. &nbsp;Is five reboots enough MS?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>For us to further isolate the issue you are experiencing, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any software or hardware changes to your device prior to the issue?</li><li>Besides from rebooting the device, what other troubleshooting steps have you done so far?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 introduces some minor changes for customizing the system tray. You may do the following steps below and see if the volume icon appears:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start </strong>button &gt; <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Notification &amp; Icons</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Turn system icons on or off</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If there are other notifications you would like to customize, click the <strong>
Back</strong> button and click <strong>Turn on or off the icons you don't want to see</strong>.</p>

            <p><em>System &gt; Notifications &amp; Icons</em> ?&nbsp; Maybe that's on a different version of Win10 than Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Win10 1703 the volume is found in<em> Settings &gt; <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

<p>( Quicker way -&nbsp; R/click on the Taskbar and select Taskbar Settings )</p>
<p>- No promise this will make the icon appear in your Taskbar notification area, but it works for me.</p>
<p>

<li><span>I haven’t made any changes apart from a Java update.</span></li><li><span>Besides rebooting, I’ve tried a number of the “fixes” in the various forums. Eg 1) Trying to change the font size to 125% but my font size will only stay at 100%. 2) Going through the Settings options.</span></li><li><span>The suggested changes via Start – that does not work and this is the basis for most people’s complaint. When you get to the Volume icon – it is greyed out but you cannot change it.&nbsp; However, I have an additional
 problem with the suggestion vis – there is no Notifications and Icons. Mine says Notifications and Actions.&nbsp; However, if I right-click the System tray, Settings, I get Taskbar at the bottom of the menu. There it shows Turn system icons on or off. The Volume
 is greyed out. Another option is, Select which icons appear on the taskbar. Volume is shown as blue / On. So in one place it is on while in another it is off.</span></li></ol>

            <p>Hmm, Interesting... The option in <span><em>Turn system icons on or off </em>has to be enabled for the second</span></p>
<p><span>option in &nbsp;</span><span><em>Select which icons appear on the taskbar</em></span><span>&nbsp; to become available on my machine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp; <span><em>Select which icons appear on the taskbar</em> option disappears from the menu when I disable the volume</span><span> control</span></p>
<p><span>via </span><span><em>Turn system icons on or off&nbsp; </em>(I was unaware the second option even existed because I don't normally</span></p>
<p>use the Windows Notification area volume control)</p>
<p>- It also changes location in the <span><em>Select which icons appear on the taskbar
</em>menu if I disable it there, and switch out</span></p>
<p><span>from that menu and back in again&nbsp; </span><span>Still not in alphabetical order either. How non-intuitive is that !</span></p>
<p>(well the whole blinkin' menu is already out of order, so why not eh! )</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disabling volume in &nbsp; <span><em>Select which icons appear on the taskbar</em></span>&nbsp; of course disables the icon, even though it's&nbsp;</p>
<p>still set to On in&nbsp; <span><em>Turn system icons on or off.&nbsp; </em>But I have to toggle in off and on again in
</span><span><em>Turn system icons on or off</em></span></p>
<p><span>to make it work from</span><span> that location again. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>- Gee, MS's is really good at complicating things in their attempt to make things easy, what !</span></p>
<p><span>At this point... Never been happier to&nbsp; have a volume control on my keyboard.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>"When you get to the Volume icon – it is greyed out but you cannot change it."</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Maybe reinstalling your audio drivers will sort out the problem ?&nbsp; While common, it's obviously not universal.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or - There should be an icon in&nbsp; <span><em>Select which icons appear on the taskbar&nbsp;
</em>for your systems integrated audio</span></p>
<p><span>eg - Realtek HD Audio Manager. This option is not as good as you need to R/click and open a mini-Window</span></p>
<p><span>that has several volume options, but it does give you a volume control via the Notification area.</span></p>
<p>(Mine also pops up in the top left corner - Handy position... Not! )</p>
<p><span>.</span></p>

            I had this problem too. Aside from the obvious solution and going into Taskbar properties it still would not show. I tried to toggle it by turning it off/reboot/on. All the other icons would turn show and not show real time except for that one so I just
 went to Task Manger and restarted Windows Explorer and it worked fine. Hope it helps.

<p>darn it other games work, i just don't get it though i did not touch the disc or console, how can my disc just become unreadable. i don't get it.
</p>
<p>I could understand if i banged it or something cause i have heard don't leave games in a move your console but all i did was turn it off for a few hours then turn it back on. This stinks now i got to get a new game.</p>
<p>is there any other options you have for me so it does not happen to other games.as it is reading other games at the moment but do not want the same thing to happen to others</p>

    <title>No audio after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gyongyikatona  say:</h3>
<h2>            No audio after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I use Windows 10 on my laptop. Everything worked fine until Windows made its last update [Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4038788)]. Since that update my laptop has no voice at all. From any application. Even when
 I plug in, it makes no sound, though before it gave a sign...</p>
<p>If I use headset, there it works, but otherwise nothing.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally: </p>
<p>How can I do system restore, to restore the previous settings to see if really the update is the problem? (though I can't think on anything else, since just before the update I Skyped with my mother, after I closed my computer, it installed its updates and
 next day there was no more sound...)</p>
<p>How can I change the schedule of the updates, that it doesn't do it automatically but only when I decide it (when I am not just in the middle of something critical)?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
                </div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer. I have tried troubleshooter and can't find the problem.</p>
<p>After reading your answer I uninstalled the latest update, but nothing changed to better, on the contrary, now I have no sound on Skype on my headset either.... Headset works from VLC, but not with Skype, before it worked...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately really my Laptop is not listed among the types with what this update was tested (Lenovo T400)... But since uninstalling didn't solve the problem does it mean that nevertheless not the update caused the issue?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or it changed something that uninstalling doesn't solve...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked how can I set up the metered connection, but I don't use Wi-fi... I have Cellular network (Vodafone-USB-modem), and there I don't find this option... Is it possible somehow to do it? Because I have limited GB, I would like to set it if it were
 possible to make updates between 23-06, because then I have unlimited internet access...</p>

<p><span>Hi, thank you for your answer.</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime I started already to uninstall the update (see my other reply above)…</span></p>
<p><span>Troubleshooting doesn’t find the problem</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the link to System Restore, unfortunately I didn’t know it before and was not configured, so no it has no restore point. Now I configured it, at least it can help in the future.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What you said about Windows Creator Update is for the future isn’t it? Since now it isn’t working…</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have no “</span><span>Show Hidden Devices</span><span>” option only “Show Disabled/Disconnected Devices”, but anyway it lists my device but in vain I test all possibilities,
 only the headset works…</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Yes, System Restore and (next week likely) Fall Creators Update will be future solutions as needed.  

Often when Windows Update (Auto driver update) doesn't find a driver, there actually is one on the PC or Device model's Support Downloads webpage so I would check there also to install the latest.  It may help to uninstall and reinstall from a fresh download even if it's the same version that's posted there.  

If you need help finding the latest driver please provide the PC and Device full make and model number.  If it's Dell use the Service tag Number to zero in.  

Keep us posted.

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?
Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?

Your best course of action is to downgrade to version of Windows you were running prior to upgrading to the current version of Windows before this problem happened.

The T400 as you noted is not listed as supporting the Creators Update.

            This laptop likely came with Windows Vista installed since it came out in 2008. That means, this is a laptop is more likely to be compatible with Windows 7 than Windows 10.

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; When this happens try power cycling your console by holding the power button on it for 10 seconds till it shuts down.&nbsp; This solves most minor issues with the console.

            if you haven't already be sure to make sure your devices are all upto date. when you check for an update make sure your headset is connected. its possible its time for a new adapter....mine gave up over time, and now I use it via the jack alone

<h3> philipyk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Canon camera not recognized with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>We accepted our free copy of windows 10. Nice to have a start button. Unfortunately the USB 3.0 upgrade now stops us from uploading pictures from our Canon digital camera. Model SD940IS. I could not find any new drivers on the Internet. The one driver fix
 program that I downloaded wanted $24 for a chance to get it fixed. &nbsp;We are not willing or able to buy a new camera or pay for a fix.&nbsp;<br />
Can we somehow get the USB reconfigured to 2.0?<br />
Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

            You need to get updated Windows 10 compatible drivers/software from the Canon support site, if they are available. &nbsp;Most camera manufacturer's seem to have been slow to recognise the problem.

<p><strong>Hi I would like to know how I can disable ALL these popup messages of programs not responding and the such.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have already disabled the error reporting, but it did not stop these messages.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Im running Vista home premium 32bit edition.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It can't be disabled because it s a system message whenever a program doesn't respond - there's no command that controls that feature.&nbsp; I'd be much more interested in why you are getting so many of these messages?&nbsp; When did it start?&nbsp; Is it alll programs
 or only some of them and if only some, is it always the same ones (if so, which programs)?&nbsp; What version of Vista are you using?&nbsp; Does it occur when you try to open the program or does it occur once you are in and working on the program (or both)?</p>
<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troublehooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem (if you want to try to fix this rather than just remove the messages which still
 leaves you with programs that stop responding which is a fairly serious problem that could easily get worse in time).<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer
 – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt starting from C:\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System and the Application section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results from what you tried and copies of some of the scans and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned
 out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

 on my computer now, it gives me 2 choices to load an operating system. one willnot load it says it needs sumthin about a system 32, and the other which is the new copy of xp i loaded wont connect to the internet or ne&nbsp; thing now. i dont know if there is a
 difference&nbsp; between desktop disks' and laptop disks".... i dont have any disk that came with the computer either. how would i go about completley wiping this computer out and putting xp back on it, and actually make it connect to the internet?? it would be
 of great help if anyone could help me out with this ASAP. My wife needs this computer for school. Thanx in advance, David...

<p>hello</p>
<p>make sure you have all disks included with your computer <a href="http://support.gateway.com/s/software/medialess/faq/suppage01su44.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.gateway.com/s/software/medialess/faq/suppage01su44.shtml</a></p>
<p>contact gateway and get any missing&nbsp; os&nbsp;install disks for your computer <a href="http://support.gateway.com/support/ask_gateway.aspx?cmpid=topnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.gateway.com/support/ask_gateway.aspx?cmpid=topnav</a></p>
<p>you will need the drivers for your computer internet etc: <a href="http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/dlcenter.asp?Tab=My" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/dlcenter.asp?Tab=My</a>&nbsp;if you got another computer download before you start your reinstall (install on a cd disk)</p>
<p>after you have all the necessary information together</p>
<p>do a clean install as shown here ((READ FIRST BEFORE REINSTALL))&nbsp;this will give you an idea of what is to come while there are some differences this is still pretty close to what you are going to have to do&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/978788</a>&nbsp;

<p>David,</p>
<p>The two operating system choices are configured in your boot.ini file. When you are booting your computer, pay special attention to any differences in the names of the two Operating Systems and which one actually works. This is important for what you are
 going to do to get rid of the one that doesn't</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot your computer to the working operating system and then go to Start, right-click on My Computer, and choose Properties.
</li><li>Click on the Advanced Tab. </li><li>Under Start Up and Recovery section, click the Settings Button. </li><li>In the Start-up and Recovery section, click on Edit. </li><li>This is where you will see a text file open in Notepad. The configuration here is for the boot menu with the entry for the previous installation and your new installation. The next steps are important, so follow them carefully:
</li><li>Go to File, Save As... and save it somewhere you'll remember and be willing to type the whole path, character by character, in a Command Prompt window if disaster strikes. (Hint, save it as C:\oldboot.ini, it's easy to get to and easier to fix) You need
 to change the name! Do not overwrite the original! We want one good previous copy with a new name.
</li><li>Next, close the file and then in the Start-up and Recovery section, click on Edit. This should be where you were previously, but this time we're going to edit the boot.ini file.
</li><li>Look for the line that references the bad Windows installation. you want to delete that whole line, but nothing else. Expand the window so you can see each line with some blank space after each.
</li><li>Click on Save. Confirm that you want to replace the old boot.ini file. </li><li>Restart your machine. Cross your fingers, but if you followed the directions it should boot right up to the good Windows installation.
</li></ol>
<p>I can help you fix your Internet Connection. You need drivers for the hardware. Easy as long as you have a good Internet connection available to you from somewhere else.</p>

<p>Find the serial number on your machine and plug it into this website:</p>
<p>http://support.gateway.com/support/drivers/dlcenter.asp?cmpid=topnav</p>
<p>That's the Gateway support site. You'll probably need to download chipset drivers, network drivers and sound card drivers for your machine. I would start by downloading the chipset and network card drivers, then get the computer on the Internet and update
 the rest of the drivers then. Let me know if you have problems, or questions. I will keep an eye on this post.</p>

    <title>A pop up window appears for an instant. How do I find out what it is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tony debates  say:</h3>
<h2>            A pop up window appears for an instant.  How do I find out what it is or if it is a threat&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Please note:&nbsp; Today (21 Feb 2015) I added two notes to the bottom that I believe relate to the problem described below.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Spec Details: Acer laptop with Windows 8.1, operating off Comcast Cable wifi signal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue:&nbsp; A&nbsp;small information window pops up on my screen for an instant, then vanishes.&nbsp; This occurs&nbsp;shortly after&nbsp;starting Internet Explorer, perhaps 1-3 minutes.&nbsp; It appears and disappears too quickly to identify anything about the window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am concerned that maybe it is Adware or a virus.&nbsp; My Norton has detected no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things that I have done recently that may have caused this include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Allowing software for my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Phone to be downloaded, allowing me to plug in that phone to charge it or transfer information.</li><li>Allowing software for my Verizon Samsung Galaxy Tablet to be downloaded (same purpose).</li><li>Connecting to a Russian (.RU) website via Youtube to watch online videos.</li></ul>
<p>Other than that, I do not believe I have done anything new in recent days or weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is Adware, how do I find out what it is and get rid of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is a virus/worm, why hasn't my Norton detected and eliminated it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is connected to the software&nbsp;downloads mentioned above, how do I find out why this window pops up and then how do I make it stop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As always, any&nbsp;help is appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTES ADDED 21 FEB 2015:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>First,&nbsp;I recently&nbsp;"refreshed"&nbsp;my computer and simultaneously stopped visiting the websites from which I feared I got "infections". &nbsp;(One site was "PlayOK.com" where I played card games, and I believe that it was either Eastern European or Russian;&nbsp;and the
 other was a Youtube-like site where I watched "Big Bang Theory" and it definitely had a Russian (.RU) suffix on it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I removed "Pokki" from my computer, a program I've been led to believe I didn't need.&nbsp; When I removed it,&nbsp;a pop up window very like the one I described above appeared just long enough for me to notice it but not truly see it, then was followed by
 a second one in another location.&nbsp; I don't know if the problem above and this removal are connected, but it seems a bit more than coincidental.</p>

            <p>It's really hard to say.&nbsp; You'll have to use process of elimination to find out what is causing it to show up.&nbsp; It could be a program, the website you're visiting, or a number of other things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep in mind that no antivirus program is 100% effective. Until something is well known and studied by Norton, their engine may not be able to detect the threat. It's a lot like our immune system, it can't respond to totally new things until it's been trained.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this info window is your only symptom, it's unlikely that you have a virus.&nbsp; I'd start by pressing
<strong>Ctrl-Shift-Esc</strong>, then going to the Startup tab and disabling everything.&nbsp; Reboot and see if it occurs again.</p>

<p>If a separate monitor (not a laptop) it will have Physical Geometry Controls on it so you can
<br />
move the entire screen to the right and enlarge it if needed. Also Right Click a blank area of
<br />
the Desktop - Graphics Properties - look for Geometry settings (PC's and laptops).</p>
<p>If a Laptop Right Click a Blank area of Desktop - Graphics Properties - look to Horizontal
<br />
settings.</p>
<p>If needed contact your System maker's support and check their on-line documentation and
<br />
any forums. Do the same at the Monitor maker's if different from System maker.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft designer mouse not working after May 21st Update.</h2>
                    Hi! I am writing this on May 21st, 2017. A couple of hours ago there was a major update to my Windows 10 PC and after the stuff was finally done installing my MICROSOFT DESIGNER BLUETOOTH MOUSE did not work any more. Before you ask: I have already several
 times de- and re-installed it and also shut down the PC and started it again, I even changed the batteries of the mouse. PC says "connected to mouse" but still not working though. Now what shall I do?

<p>Have the same problem as the OP described. I fallowed all of the suggested fixes without any success.</p>
<p>Also, when I try to "forget" the mouse, I managed to re recognize the device and connect to it but it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The mouse did work with the PC before and do work with different operation system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully I'll find a fix, it's frustration, especially after buying a Microsoft mouse to avoid those kind of problems. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Kinda glad somehow to see that I am not the only one with this problem... Luckily the issue got solved by accident: While I was trying some things that were suggested to fix it my battery ran low and the PC shut down in the middle of what I was doing. After
 restart the computer magically found the mouse again and I stared in awe at this miracle of technology...</p>
<p>But seriously: Every now and then the problem still occurs, so I have turned to taking extreme care in always properly shutting down the PC instead of just closing the lid (I have a laptop) because when I do so the issue seems to occur more often.
</p>
<p>Hopefully MS soon finds out what causes the mess and fixes it with next update!</p>

<p>You are not alone.&nbsp; I have tried all the recommended steps to troubleshoot this issue.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 on an HP Laptop.&nbsp; And this mouse worked perfectly&nbsp; from day one.&nbsp; Then, after an update, it just stopped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It connects fine, I get 2 green checks in the connection box as it looks for updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This device is working...so the laptop thinks...but it doesn't.&nbsp; It shows up in my devices and printers screen.&nbsp; All fat and happy there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But move the mouse, connected or not, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to replace it, but I'm afraid that I will get the same results.</p>

            I have been dealing with the exact same issue, and tried everything the link above suggests. The big update on my windows 10 definitely did something to make the mouse not work, and Microsoft so far have come up with no real answer. Not only my designer
 mouse, but my bluetooth headphone have connectivity issues after the update! Seriously dissapointed at Microsoft.
