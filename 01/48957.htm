<p>Your camera drivers are creating a page fault which is causing your Windows 10 to bluescreen. I suggest you contact Logitech to see if they have Windows 10 compatible drivers that do not bluescreen the OS. You can also attempt to update the drivers to the
 generic USB Video Device drivers that come with the OS, to see if they will work.</p>

<p>This all began last week when I first started to get the code and I've been looking everywhere on the internet to learn how to fix it but no solutions worked. I even tried the xbox support error code lookup with no solution to the problem, only making it
 worse because now I can't even download my account..... Is there any way I can fix it?</p>


<p>P.S I can't use the "contact us". For some reason the page won't load all the way and i'm stuck on step 2 :\</p>

<h2>            administrator account log-on was disabled. how to enable it again&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using windowsXP. In control panel i have renamed administrator with my user's name but without password and disabled my account log-on. Now when i restart my computer, windows require user name and password. when i typed my user name,it says "Your
 account is disabled. Please contact your system administrator". My safe mode doesn't work either.<br />

            running as administrator does nothing for playing the game after it is installed I do not know what the answer is but this one is not it....it has nothing to do with admin rights it has all to do with how the game performs and there is a clitch in the
 configuration and that is the issue it very may well be in the registry editor or in the game itself....I have Mass Effect 2 and it purrs like a kitten in Windows 7&nbsp;

 two dics&nbsp;came with the set and can not get past the windows dialog box that says it is having a configuration issue. I have downloaded all patches from the developers site and that does not address the issue so if anyone again has any real input to save this
 please advise and it is not the key code either....thanks</p>

            I have had no problem with Mass Effect on Win7 64bit. It is installed with no compatibility settings.<br />
Is this a re-install or first ?<br />
Assuming it has actually installed -<br />
Do either the<span style="font-style: italic"> Mass Effect Launcher</span> in the games main install folder, or the&nbsp;
binaries</span>&nbsp; folder&nbsp; work ? If they do then the shortcut you were using needs replacing.<br />
If not&nbsp; try deleting&nbsp; the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">Config</span>&nbsp; folder in your User / Documents / Bioware folder.
<br />
(maybe the&nbsp; system information.XML as well ?)<br />
The game should make a new config folder when it launches, if not it's probably time to try &nbsp; uninstalling and reinstalling&nbsp; the game, re-boot between and after.
<br />
Delete any files leftover after the uninstall before reinstalling.<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>I do have a patch/fix that I downloaded&nbsp; that address the .exe file that is supposed to help the game launch&nbsp;but I can not seem to find&nbsp;the correct file&nbsp;in the C:/ drive files...and I have looked in all the C:/ DeusEx folders for anything with a .exe listing
 and no luck..the<u> binaries</u> folder you mentioned...&nbsp;if you would could you give me a step by step way to find it? I also have several other downloads that address the graphics and other things that bring the game up to modern standards...and I do have
 the GOTY dvd version...I have the 'complete' edition that has ME1 &amp; ME Invisible War and ME Invbl.&nbsp;War installed and plays with no big glitches. I did find Bioware in the&nbsp;MY USERS folder and deleted the Config and .XML and the error log that was generated
 each time I tried to install the game and lemme tell you it generated a full page of errors...any help you can throw this way would be appreciated as I would like to see how this thing plays and feel if I can get the .exe executable fix that it should launch
 the game in this OS....thanks....</p>

            I was talking about Mass Effect when I mentioned the binaries folder. Not all game
<br />
executables&nbsp; ( .exe ) are located in a folder called&nbsp; 'binaries' .<br />
I do have <span style="font-style: italic">DeusEx&nbsp;</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">
DeusEx invisible War</span> and the texture packs mods for both.<br />
I don't have <span style="font-style: italic">DeusEx Human Revolution</span> so can't comment on it except to say that&nbsp; If
came bundled with <span style="font-style: italic">Human Revoloution</span> it&nbsp; should have been updated and should not need any 'fix' to run on Win7 64bit.<br />
&nbsp;I installed the game recently, and have used the D3D,&nbsp; texture packs and updated .exe, but this is an original version (local pawnshop). While the mods do improve the game it is still well behind 'modern' standards, still lower than Invisible War, actually.<br />
The .exe for DeusEx is in the 'system' folder which is mentioned in the <span style="font-style: italic">
read me</span> that comes&nbsp; with the mod.<br />
<br />
I'm not clear what you are speaking about when you use 'ME' in context with DeusEx.<br />
<br />
What&nbsp; .exe&nbsp; fix are you talking about with Mass Effect ? When Mass Effect is installed and registered on line you no longer need to use the disk, so there is no need for a noCD fix with a legitimate copy of the game., and the game runs fine with no special
 settings.<br />
In any case the <span style="font-style: italic">MassEffectLauncher.exe</span>&nbsp; in the games install folder (directory) is the one that should launch the game, so if the desktop shortcut does not work then a new one can be made from the main
<br />
Regarding the C:\&nbsp; drive -&nbsp; When you install games to the default location they should&nbsp;
<br />
get installed&nbsp; to C:\ Program Files (x86). <br />
I never install games to the default location. If you have another partition or HDD installing games there will help avoid problems with some games. You can make a new folder in the C:\&nbsp; drive (partition) and name it what you like if you do not have another
 location to install them to. Then install your games to sub-folders in that folder.<br />
There are several issues that&nbsp; not installing to the default location helps with but the main one is 'permissions'.
<br />
<br />

            <p>First off thanks Bossdweebe for the reply...and yes I was working on both games and got them confused...gettin' old I reckon...I did manage to get MassEffect up and running and even with all the mods it still is not firing on all cylinders...all sorts of
 gameplay drop offs, like getting on a&nbsp;planet and no way off,&nbsp;E button not responding to name a few...&nbsp;so if you have any ideas on that don't hesitate to say so...I have two seperate&nbsp;&nbsp;fix/patches that I found from bioware but it did not address all the issues....it
 may be because I have dual processors (AMDPhenom II)...EA seems to think&nbsp;so. I got and played MassEffect2 first and was going back in time to catch up....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on to DeusEx and I suppose I shouldn't be hijacking a post but.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have DeusEx Complete and was hoping to see what it was like as I have DeusEx: Human Revolution ordered and was going to get an idea of what it was about and btw all of my games are DVDs and you are right about storing games seperately but when I do install
 the deus it creates its own (x86) folder seperate from all the other (x86es)&nbsp;for some reason and I have the mods saved so I will look further into them...and I do not have a seperate HHD or partition and that is another can of worms I haven't opened yet...that
 may be beyond my expertise but a vialble alternative because I have lots of older games that I would like to play on this rig and may have to install XP there to get em to run....</p>

Yes, frowned upon, but it looks like the OP&nbsp; is not coming back anyway.<br />
<br />
If it's literally two individual processors I can imagine that could cause problems. Can one be<br />
disabled or cut out using&nbsp; Affinity&nbsp; in Task Manager or possibly&nbsp; via software provided by the motherboard mfg ?<br />
I can't offer other suggestions as these games have not caused me problems, but I'll waffle on for a while anyway.<br />
<br />
There may be something in the&nbsp; - <a href="http://www.tweakguides.com/ME_1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mass Effect Tweak Guide</a> -&nbsp; that is helpful.<br />
I haven't used any mods with Mass Effect, but&nbsp; it needs to be running smoothly before trying any.
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;There are no DeusEx folders in my&nbsp; C:\&nbsp; drive&nbsp; (except the My Documents folder), but some games do make folders in the<span style="font-style: italic"> Program Data</span> folder.<br />
Choosing 'custom' ('browse' or similar term)&nbsp; when&nbsp; installing should allow you to choose whatever location you want to install to. As long as a new folder in the C:\&nbsp; drive&nbsp; is not in one of the three
<br />
I can't say which games benefit from not installing to the default location as I started using a
<br />
separate partition/HDD before&nbsp; UAC&nbsp; started causing permissions problems for many
<br />
when Vista came out. <br />
I made a lucky choice&nbsp; that&nbsp; verifies that there are other issues as well as permissions when I was&nbsp; responding to a thread about Doom 3 some time ago.
<br />
I had not reinstalled the game in years&nbsp; and tried using the default location, and if I remember correctly, it locked up the machine when the install started. The game installed to my game HDD&nbsp; without a hitch, not even using a compatibility mode.
<br />
<br />
Creating a partition is not&nbsp;&nbsp; tricky as long as the HDD still has plenty of GB's to spare,
<br />
and can be done in&nbsp; Computer Managment / Disk Manager.&nbsp; A tutorial should be easy to find.<br />
Re-sizing, or otherwise altering&nbsp; partitions is another matter. <br />
<br />
I have over 100 games installed on Win7 64bit and have only come across three in my collection that won't&nbsp; install or run - Beyond Good and Evil ( the recent re-release should work), Splinter Cell - Chaos Theory, and Diablo 2 (pixelates, but it should be fixable).
 The biggest problems are in relation to copy protections from mid 2000's, and most of these can be overcome with a noCD patch (except BG&amp;E, &amp; SC-CT ). Some games from earlier on have installers that don't work on 64bit OS's (XP too). Some of these have fixed&nbsp;
 installers that can be downloaded from fan sites, and other can be copied from a 32bit machine after installing to that. A few need&nbsp;&nbsp; Affinity&nbsp; set to one core to run well.<br />

            <p>Thanks and that Tweak Guide now&nbsp;that &nbsp;was a heck of a read... phew..lots of info..but I am still having keystroke issues and things like the map giving either unrelated or wrong info...which can leave me searching for a way out for hours til I just tire
 and exit out....and I have 1.01a and 1.02 patches installed so go figure....funny thing is it seemed to work better gamewise when I only did the 1.01a but I found some planets when landing that&nbsp;did not generate all the scenery and after 1.02 I did see the
 lava pits and that sort of thing....had to do the 1.01a just to get it to launch but after 1.02 there seemed to be a fall off of things I could unlock and or collect...any way I have followed the Tweakers info and it did enlighten me as to my ATI Catalyst
 settings and other things and some of the stuff does seem dated (2002 updates for refresh rates) but did it any way....what the hey....do you have the two disc&nbsp;UK&nbsp;set.? and if so what is the second disc for???? I could not get it to respond.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At present I have about 30 games installed and all in all haven't really had any issues with storing or playing&nbsp;them (just those older ones) but if you have any leads to creating a partition lemme know I do have 800GB of HHD and only use about 2-300 at present
 and would like to partition XP so I can play older games... Microsofts Combat Flight sim being one of my all time favorites...is there a way I can buy a seperate external&nbsp;HHD&nbsp;for the usb port and put it there or does it have to be on the onboard HHD? having
 a notebook and&nbsp;being limited on what 'cha can do to upgrade&nbsp; and boy it would be nice to be able to swap out graphic cards... I did see a laptop advertized that you could do with&nbsp;that but it was around three grand....for that I would go back to a desktop....</p>

<p>What is this Affinity thing you mentioned?</p>

            I should have asked your spec earlier.&nbsp; If it's a notebook&nbsp; and you hadn't already said it was running Mass Effect 2 well I would have suggested the machine may not be up to it.
<br />
laptops have some different issues from PC. The laptop keyboard assignment problem seems to come up in the forums a bit, but I've never paid them much attention.<br />
<br />
Is your processor a six core Phenom 2 ? This may be what EA is referring to.<br />
If so the Affinity setting may help.<br />
Start the game, and while paused tap the Start/Windows key on your keyboard to minimise the game .
<br />
R/click on the&nbsp; Task Bar and then select <span style="font-style: italic">Task Manager</span>. In the&nbsp;
Mass Effect.exe</span> process and R/click that. Go to <span style="font-style: italic">
Set Affinity</span> and un-tick two of the six cores. This will limit the game to running on four cores.<br />
<br />
The second&nbsp; ME disc has the other language packs, so if you were to install with French you would be asked to use that disc at some point.
<br />
<br />
Combat Flight Sim seems to work well on Win7 64bit. I didn't use any compatibility settings when I installed it. I haven't&nbsp; really played it (just a few minutes flying around) as my old Logitech Wingman Joystick has no&nbsp; updated software to make it compatible
 Win7. <br />
<br />
External USB port HDD's are probably too slow for games (e-SATA is OK), but you have a fair bit of room left&nbsp; on the internal drive.<br />

                    Okay.&nbsp; I am trying to get Windows 10 to allow my installed Realtek EP-1609 ac wireless external wifi network adapter to connect with my century link c1100z router and work together. &nbsp; The adapter installs just fine and everything is working, no conflicts
 in device manager, however, the adapter icon shows up with a red X.&nbsp; Troubleshooting says I have not chosen a preferred network.&nbsp; I read somewhere that a second network icon should be created in available networks but there is not one.&nbsp; I only have the Century
 Link icon that is controlled by my internal network adapter.&nbsp; It is not clear how you do this.&nbsp; Do you have any ideas?&nbsp; There should be a simple solution but I don't know where to go.

<p>Weird! I moved 12 folders (27 GB) from 'My Pictures' into a new folder ‘PicAlbum’ and another 5 folders (14 GB) from 'My Pictures' into another new folder ‘ScreenSavers’, See below, and it worked, FH now backing up everything I tell it to.</p>
<p>I have any idea why? If you do, even&nbsp; a guess, please let me know.</p>

            <p>UN_SOLVED!</p>
<p>Frustratingly, there is one sub-folder that FH refuses to backup. No other folders beneath it, just this one, but FH does nothing when files change or are added. Other folders at the same level are backed up.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be possible, but it is indeed happening.</p>
<p>HELP.</p>

            SOLVED again (hopefully)<br />
<div>
<p>Renaming those folders worked, except for that one sub folder. I kid you not. Out of the hundreds of folders this one was overlooked by FH. It was right at the bottom of the folder tree as were several other folders in the same parent folder. The others
 were backed up, this one was not. Grrrrr.<br />
It's parent folder was called xTempImport. I removed the 'Temp' part of that parent folder name and viola FH backed up the sub folder contents.<br />
But I am now extremely wary of File History - it seems very, very, very fragile. I will keep using it (I have invested in a 3 TB removable drive), but I will have to keep checking that it hasn't thrown another hissy fit.</p>
<p>I really expect more from Microsoft who haven't even had the politeness to respond to this post.</p>

<h2>            System is blocking pictures from being displayed in browswer</h2>
                    I am learning how to write HTML but my computer is blocking all of the pictures from displaying in my browser.&nbsp; It does not matter which browser I use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; When I go to the file I want to bring up in my browser, a yellow ribbon appears
 at the top and states: "Some pictures have been blocked to help prevent the sender from identifying your computer.&nbsp; Open this item to view the pictures (?)"<br />
<br />
Windows Defender is turned off.<br />
<br />
This is the same question as this fellow's:<br />

Some pictures have been blocked to help...actually all on my system are being blocked in any browser
<div>I'm creating images and web pages. Then I try to view with a browser. Pick a browser. Any browser: IE, Chrome, Safarie, Opera, SeaMonkey. All the same. I'm getting protected from myself. "Some pictures have been
 blocked to help prevent the sender from identifying your computer..." Too late. I know me. I turned off all the firewalls. All the answers I've found seem to be focused on IE or email. I'm having the same problem with any browser that wants to display an image
 from my windows 7 system. Any recommendations would be appreciated. In the file explorer this problem also shows up with a little message with the same wording at the top of the window and also indicating to click on the message to enable the displaying of
 the images. The system does not respond in any way clicking on this message. Any advice would be appreciated. thanks, james

<div>Well I think I've fixed it. &nbsp;In control panel&gt;windows defender&gt;options&gt;real-time protection then uncheck scan downloaded files and attachments. After I did this, I could see images on my system use while creating
 an html page.

            <p><strong>Can you really upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>In truth, Windows 8 does not support a direct upgrade from Windows XP. This means you will have do a custom install, which means, any applications or drivers you currently have installed will have to be reinstalled. You might likely need updated drivers
 for some hardware. Windows 8’s built in upgrade compatibility wizard should help you determine what is compatible and what needs to be removed before proceeding with the upgrade.
</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the hardware manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows XP is might not work with Windows 8. You
 might have to look into purchasing an upgraded version or alternative if there is no new version of an app or hardware device.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Backup your Data:</strong></p>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Windows XP’s backup options are quite archaic and limited. If you want to have the option of
 restoring your Windows XP installation in case Windows 8 installation fails, look into using a third party solution such as Acronis True Image which is available as a free trial you can use:</p>
<p>Check out the following article by Microsoft MVP JW Stuart about how to backup a Windows XP installation here using Acronis True Image
<strong><a href="http://www.pagestart.com/winxpnlhdatih05161101.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>Another solution you can use for backing up Windows XP is Easeus To Do Backup, JW Stuart also has an article about it
<strong><a href="http://www.pagestart.com/winxpnlhdtodo04051101.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>Other steps you can use to ensure your data is safe before upgrading is creating a Windows Easy Transfer backup. Learn more
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> This option is quite limited and should only be used if do not plan on returning to Windows XP since Easy Transfer backups can only be restored in Windows 8.</p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows XP to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. It is possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption utility you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Disable any RAID configurations you might have installed.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any non-essential external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Click Run, then type: CMD<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Click Run, type: MSCONFIG then click OK</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>32 or 64 bit</strong></p>
<p>If you are running Windows XP, definitely go with the 32 bit version of Windows 8. Only exceptions where you might have 4 GBs or more RAM, which is rare when running Windows XP, 64 bit is more suitable for computers with beefy configurations. Windows 8 32
 bit benefits from all the capabilities available to it such as running Metro applications, modern applications such as Office 2010 or 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Starting setup</strong></p>
<p>To start the installation, first boot to the Windows XP desktop. If you are installing Windows 8 from a physical DVD these instructions will apply to you. Insert the Windows 8 disc. Setup will automatically launch:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage_thumb.png%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d348" /></a></p>
<p>Setup will automatically launch. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image6.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage6_thumb.png%3fw%3d455%26amp%3bh%3d360" /></a></p>
<p>If prompted to get updates, I recommend you do so. If you are not connected to the Internet, select ‘No, thanks’.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image12.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage12_thumb.png%3fw%3d454%26amp%3bh%3d359" /></a></p>
<p>Enter your product key. If you purchased Windows 8 from the Microsoft Store and you are using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, the key will be embedded. If you download a .ISO file or purchased Windows 8 on DVD, check your email when you registered to purchase
 the upgrade or check your Windows 8 product packaging for the product key. After Entering the product key, click Next to continue with setup.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image18.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage18_thumb.png%3fw%3d447%26amp%3bh%3d354" /></a></p>

<p>Now this is an important part of setup. If you have any personal files on your computer, those will be preserved when you select ‘Keep personal files only’. As noted earlier, you will need to reinstall programs and drivers for your hardware devices. If you
 choose Nothing, Windows 8 will place your files in a folder called Windows.old. After making your decision, click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image29.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage29_thumb.png%3fw%3d450%26amp%3bh%3d360" /></a></p>
<p>Wait while Windows 8 does some last checks. </p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image35.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage35_thumb.png%3fw%3d448%26amp%3bh%3d355" /></a></p>
<p>At the summary screen, review the changes that will be made to your computer. If you are not sure, click Back and make any appropriate changes. As noted, you will not be able to use your computer during this period. The time it takes complete the upgrade
 will be dependent on your system specifications such as processor speed, memory and your data set. Click the Install button to begin.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image40.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage40_thumb.png%3fw%3d445%26amp%3bh%3d332" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Can you really upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>In truth, Windows 8 does not support a direct upgrade from Windows XP. This means you will have do a custom install, which means, any applications or drivers you currently have installed will have to be reinstalled. You might likely need updated drivers
 for some hardware. Windows 8’s built in upgrade compatibility wizard should help you determine what is compatible and what needs to be removed before proceeding with the upgrade.
</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the hardware manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows XP is might not work with Windows 8. You
 might have to look into purchasing an upgraded version or alternative if there is no new version of an app or hardware device.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Backup your Data:</strong></p>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Windows XP’s backup options are quite archaic and limited. If you want to have the option of
 restoring your Windows XP installation in case Windows 8 installation fails, look into using a third party solution such as Acronis True Image which is available as a free trial you can use:</p>
<p>Check out the following article by Microsoft MVP JW Stuart about how to backup a Windows XP installation here using Acronis True Image

<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows XP to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. It is possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption utility you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Disable any RAID configurations you might have installed.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any non-essential external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />

<p><strong>32 or 64 bit</strong></p>
<p>If you are running Windows XP, definitely go with the 32 bit version of Windows 8. Only exceptions where you might have 4 GBs or more RAM, which is rare when running Windows XP, 64 bit is more suitable for computers with beefy configurations. Windows 8 32
 bit benefits from all the capabilities available to it such as running Metro applications, modern applications such as Office 2010 or 2013.</p>
<p><strong>Starting setup</strong></p>
<p>To start the installation, first boot to the Windows XP desktop. If you are installing Windows 8 from a physical DVD these instructions will apply to you. Insert the Windows 8 disc. Setup will automatically launch:</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage_thumb.png%3fw%3d461%26amp%3bh%3d348" /></a></p>

<p>If prompted to get updates, I recommend you do so. If you are not connected to the Internet, select ‘No, thanks’.
</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/image12.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f08%2fimage12_thumb.png%3fw%3d454%26amp%3bh%3d359" /></a></p>
<p>Enter your product key. If you purchased Windows 8 from the Microsoft Store and you are using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, the key will be embedded. If you download a .ISO file or purchased Windows 8 on DVD, check your email when you registered to purchase
 the upgrade or check your Windows 8 product packaging for the product key. After Entering the product key, click Next to continue with setup.</p>

<p>Now this is an important part of setup. If you have any personal files on your computer, those will be preserved when you select ‘Keep personal files only’. As noted earlier, you will need to reinstall programs and drivers for your hardware devices. If you
 choose Nothing, Windows 8 will place your files in a folder called Windows.old. After making your decision, click Next.</p>

<p>At the summary screen, review the changes that will be made to your computer. If you are not sure, click Back and make any appropriate changes. As noted, you will not be able to use your computer during this period. The time it takes complete the upgrade
 will be dependent on your system specifications such as processor speed, memory and your data set. Click the Install button to begin.

<p>If prompted to get updates, I recommend you do so. If you are not connected to the Internet, select ‘No, thanks’.

<p>Enter your product key. If you purchased Windows 8 from the Microsoft Store and you are using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant, the key will be embedded. If you download a .ISO file or purchased Windows 8 on DVD, check your email when you registered to purchase
 the upgrade or check your Windows 8 product packaging for the product key. After Entering the product key, click Next to continue with setup.</p>

<p>Now this is an important part of setup. If you have any personal files on your computer, those will be preserved when you select ‘Keep personal files only’. As noted earlier, you will need to reinstall programs and drivers for your hardware devices. If you
 choose Nothing, Windows 8 will place your files in a folder called Windows.old. After making your decision, click Next.</p>

<p>At the summary screen, review the changes that will be made to your computer. If you are not sure, click Back and make any appropriate changes. As noted, you will not be able to use your computer during this period. The time it takes complete the upgrade
 will be dependent on your system specifications such as processor speed, memory and your data set. Click the Install button to begin.

    <title>Windows 7 Ultimate EULA - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian toft  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Ultimate EULA</h2>
                    I have just preordered Windows 7 Ultimate and I find it very odd that I can`t seem to find any EULA anywhere .<br />
My main question is whether it is a license for one PC only or it is for several PC`s , cause the price of the OS suggests that it might be for 3 PC`s , or what ? . I find it hard to see that it should be a great deal to buy it up front if You have to pay 320
 $ for only one license .<br />
With kind regards Brian Toft from Denmark

<h2>            Xbox ONE S refuses to work with my Philips 32PFL7762D</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p><p>sorry, but I need help and I could not find a similar post in the forum. My TV show severe display issues with the Xbox. It a 2008 Philips&nbsp;32PFL7762D. It frequently shows the xbox signal but then switches to blue screen stating "Video not supported". It has only 720p resolution, but that should not be a major issue, should it?&nbsp;Switching the Xbox to 720 manually did not do the trick. Switching off Auto HDMI on the TV did not work either. Any thoughts how to make this work?</p><p>I am afraid, if I cannot make it work, I need to return the xbox to the store... :-(</p><p>Best regards,</p><p>Eule</p>

            <p>Your TV&nbsp;is able to support 720p/1080p;&nbsp;it's actually one of those smaller TV&nbsp;models with a resolution of 1366x768 that upscales 720p or downscales 1080p. Technically, your Xbox should "think" it's being connected to a 1080p display.&nbsp;As far as resolutions are concerned, there should be no problem with that.</p><p><br /></p><p>Looking through your&nbsp;TV's specifications, your TV&nbsp;appears to have HDMI&nbsp;1.3 ports. With that in mind, it may only support an older version of HDCP (1.3). I believe the Xbox One S uses HDCP 2.2. I&nbsp;don't know if the latest version of HDCP is backward compatible with your TV, even while only outputting at 720/1080p, but I'm thinking that this is the complicating factor that's causing your video to go blank after some few moments.</p><p><br /></p><p>Are you able to plug your Xbox into another TV to test? Like a&nbsp;TV&nbsp;in another room?&nbsp;Or a&nbsp;friend/relative's TV? Let's check if the Xbox is not at fault.</p>

            Hello there. Im not exactly sure why this happens because i’ve found that Phillips and Magnavox both do not work with an xbox One console. I’ve found that Insignia, LG, Samsung, and Vizio are all good working brands to use. I have personal experience with
 this atrocity as I have gone through a good 4 televisions and trial and error mode on one too many occasions! It needs to stop quite frankly because if a TV has capability of USB/HDMI ports, they need to work on ALL Flat screen TV’s!&nbsp;

    <title>US &#40;Qwerty&#41; keyboard layout re-installs itself whenever I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimmyantrip  say:</h3>
<h2>            US &#40;Qwerty&#41; keyboard layout re-installs itself whenever I inspect Language settings &#40;via Control Panel or via Settings&#41;</h2>
                    <p>L.S.,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed a lot of threats on similar topics (and tried some of the suggested solutions). However, my issue is slightly different (and might shed a light on the related ones?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've managed to get the following configuration (<em>which is what I want</em>):</p>
<p>- <strong>W10 display language</strong> is <strong>English (US)</strong></p>
<p>- My <strong>Country/Region</strong> is set to <strong>The Netherlands</strong></p>
<p>- My <strong>Keyboard Layout</strong> (input method) is <strong>United Stated-International</strong> (which makes typing frequently needed accents in Dutch texts easy)</p>
<p>- I have <strong>no additional Keyboard Layouts</strong>, since United States-International always works for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed the following undesirable behavior:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Whenever I inspect (without making any changes!) the <strong>Settings/Time and Language/Region and Language</strong>, the Input Method icon (with caption: ENG) appears on my task bar, offering two keyboards: United States-International and US. There is
<strong>one language</strong> listed: English (United States), and in the Options for that language I see now
<strong>two keyboard layouts</strong>: United States-International (Qwerty) and US (Qwerty).</p>
<p>
</p><p>b) Whenever I inspect the settings using <strong>Control Panel/Language</strong> exactly the same is the case.
<strong>One language</strong>: English (United States), and <strong>two input methods</strong>: United States-International and US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any of the two cases I can delete the US keyboard layout, but it reappears whenever I inspect again as described above. However, if I delete the US keyboard and then reboot, the task bar no longer shows the Input Method icon and the United States-International
 (Qwerty) Input Method/keyboard layout is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short: US (Qwerty) keyboard layout re-installs itself whenever I inspect Language settings (via Control Panel or via Settings). My questions:
</p>
<p>1. Why does US keyboard/input method - or more generally: any keyboard/input method) automatically install itself upon inspection of the Langauge settings?</p>
<p>2. How can I prevent this from happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Paul</p>

<p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an update you probably weren't expecting ;-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been experimenting some more, and somewhere in the (more or less random) process of adding and removing keyboards via
<em>Settings/Time &amp; Language</em> as well as via <em>Control Panel/Language</em>, it turned out that the US Keyboard did not re-appear automatically anymore! So it seems that adding and removing keyboards deleted or overwrote corrupted system information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry that I cannot provide you with the <em>exact</em> details of what I did, but hopefully in the future more people can be helped with this information. (In my search for a solution I've noticed that quite a lot of people seem to have a similar problem
 with automatically re-installed keyboards).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards and thanks for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

    <title>Unable to download Spotify for Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ninjawi2ard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to download Spotify for Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hello all. When I heard that Spotify would be coming to the Xbox one I&nbsp;was very excited. However, I am sadly unable to download the app. When I&nbsp;go to the xbox store and select the "Spotify Music - for Xbox One"&nbsp;app there is no option to install. Instead, just below the star ratings there is text that says "This product needs to be installed on your internal hard drive. Coming soon." However, as I&nbsp;understand it, the app is already out. I live in the US and my xbox is set to United states. I have checked for updates in the system settings but it says that my console&nbsp;is up to date. I have tried using the xbox web browser to download the app, but that hasn't worked either.&nbsp;I have also tried reseting and even unplugging my xbox, but no success. I would love to fix this as I love Spotify and being able to play it through my xbox would be excellent.</p>

            <p>Hi Ninja,</p><p><br /></p><p>Okay, this is seems like&nbsp;an odd one.</p><p><br /></p><p>First of all, can you confirm this is still happening? Maybe in the two weeks since you posted it's sorted itself out, but if not we'll think of something.</p><p><br /></p><p>Typically I would suggest that a complete power cycle would likely fix this, but you mentioned you've tried that already.</p><p><br /></p><p>I don't really know why there would be no install button, provided you are currently in the US and that is your account's region too.</p><p>One way to circumvent the lack of an install button is certainly a bit awkward, but should work if you either have a second Xbox One or can use a friend's, and have an external hard drive. In that instance, download the Spotify app on the second console, transfer it to the hard drive, then use that hard drive to move the app onto your own console. The app should now be installed and you can launch it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Let us know how you get on.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 November update broke my PC - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 November update broke my PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop PC started downloading the November Windows 10 update. It seemed to load ok then my PC crashed.Now it will power on but my screen, keyboard and mouse do not work so the power is on but I have a blank screen. I tried to intervene with the boot
 but I can't be sure my keyboard is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to Microsoft who suggested a clean Windows 10 start from a usb. I downloaded this on a laptop and inserted the usb but nothing. I cannot now get my PC to do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What recourse do I have? It seems the update has rendered my desktop PC completely useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any advice? As it stands I seems to be facing replacing my expensive desktop, which just seems wrong. It could of course be a hardware failure but the coincidence with the Windows 10 update seems too much to be unconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dr David Willcox</p>

<p>

            Thanks. i had a call with Microsoft support yesterday and they said the same thing. I downloaded that onto a USB but when I insert it into the PC nothing different happens on startup. Still just a blank screen. Unless i am doing something wrong.

            <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the replies and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PCis connected to the monitor by a blue VGA cable. I checked the monitor and it works with a laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sometimes connect the PC via HDMI to the TV. That works with the lap top but not with the PC now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it was the Windows update that caused the issue then presumably the other hard drive would have worked. Which now makes me think it could be the graphics card. But it is quite a coincidence that the Windows update ran then it stopped working.</p>

            <p>Unplug all but the basics. Leave monitor &amp; keyboard connected and disconnect the hard drive. When it boots the bios should show no boot device. (or words to that effect)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then draw your own conclusions as to what might be faulty. Do you have built in graphics or a card.</p>

            <p>Ok. I probably need to withdraw the title of my post! Thanks for the help. I went out and bought a cheap graphics card to test and that has fixed the issue. I am back working on the PC. So it must have been the graphics card and the Windows 10 update was
 just a coincidence.</p>

    <title>Question about Express Zip - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nicolasbellord  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about Express Zip</h2>
                    Have just upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have tried to do a backup but I keep being asked whether I am a commercial user or not for express zip.&nbsp; When I say that I am not it says it cannot copy a .zip file to Windows/System32 even though I am the administrator.&nbsp;
 I copy it elsewhere but am then told that it cannot access the archive.&nbsp; This question about Express Zip keeps coming up when I use other applications.&nbsp; Effectively it makes the system unusable.&nbsp; What should I do?

            <p>I can't answer your question about Express Zip and the archives it makes, I personally use 7Zip (Free) which does more than everything I need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding putting a file into the System32 folder, I guess you'd need to run the application with administrative privileges for it to work.</p>

            I think the problem was that Express Zip had lost its administrator permission.&nbsp; However I have deleted Express Zip and this has solved the problem.

    <title>How to print multiple different photos on one sheet of paper - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom young99  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to print multiple different photos on one sheet of paper</h2>
                    <p>Actually, this question has been answered, in multiple places, along the following lines:</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><span><span>Windows Photo Viewer offers a list of templates that correspond to the most common print sizes.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Suppose you want to print four different 3" x 5" pictures on a single sheet of photo paper.
<br />
<br />
Follow these steps to print all the four pictures in one page. <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select all the four pictures, right-click and select&nbsp; Print.&nbsp; You should get the option “How do you want to print your pictures?”.
<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the right-panel, there are various layouts available.&nbsp; Choose 3.5 * 5 in . (4).<br />
<br />
This fits all the four images in one page. You can choose other layouts available as per your requirement.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only thing is, it doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; At my first attempt I selected 4 pictures, right-clicked and selected print, scrolled down the right column on the Print Pictures window and selected "3.5 x 5 in (4)".&nbsp; Only one of the four selected pictures appeared
 in the preview pane even though letter sized paper was selected and 4 pictures of the selected size should fit.&nbsp; The one selected picture did occupy a "correct" spot representing about 1/4th of the page; the other 3 spots on the page were blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that the 4 pictures actually needed to be re-sized to 3.5" x 5" I did exactly that with the 4 pictures previously selected, then tried the "select 4 pictures" &gt; right click &gt; select Print &gt; select 3.5 x 5 in (4).&nbsp; Once again, only one of the pictures
 showed up and there were 3 blank spots where the other pictures should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I select only one of the pictures and select the 3.5 x 5 in (4) option for printing, only one instance of that picture appears on the page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, How do you print 4 different 3.5 x 5 in. pictures on a letter sized page?</p>
<p>

 in the answers or if something particular to my system makes that necessary.&nbsp; </p>
