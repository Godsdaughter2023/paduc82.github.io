<h2>            Some builtin shortcuts not working with &#34;Left Shift&#34; key</h2>
                    <p>Some shortcuts with "shift" key do not work at all with the "left shift" but <strong>
work only with "right shift"</strong></p>
<p>I checked other shortcuts that whether the shift is Lshift or Rshift does not matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the shortcuts I've found so far... :</p>
<p><strong>Ctrl-Shift-Enter (run as administrator)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Ctrl-Shift-P (Launch InPrivate window in Edge Browser)</strong></p>

<h2>            Skype doesn&#39;t work - bug in update</h2>
                    upon start on ipad it says skype must be updated, but after following the links it announces that supports only ios since 10.0 while my ipad has 9.3.5. Few days ago there were no problem to run skype on this ios. Does microsoft want just to kill skype
 or some special version of skype exists as a workaround to this bug?

            Hi Lyuba
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor.
<br />
<br />I'm sorry for not having good news here. Skype (version 8) on iPhone and iPad requires iOS 10 or later: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-are-the-system-requirements-for-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/fa10328/what-a...</a>
<br />
<br />I know this is not the answer you want, but I hope you will at least clarify it. 
<br />If you have other questions, please let me know. 
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<div>As a workaround, Skype for iPhone can be used on an iPad with iOS 9.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Install older iTunes 12.6.5 supporting AppStore:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT208079&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. 'Purchase' the Skype for iPhone by downloading it in iTunes. Make sure to login in iTunes with the same Apple ID as on iPad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Open Skype for iPhone in AppStore on iPad via this link:&nbsp;</div>
<div>https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skype-for-iphone/id304878510</div>
<div><br />
<div>4. Select 'cloud' icon to install Skype for iPhone. AppStore will prompt that iOS 10 is required and will offer to download an older version.</div>

<p>Margarida,</p>
<p>I have the same problem. My I Pad is 9.3.5. In chat with Apple they suggested I contact Microsoft to see if you could upload an older version of Skype into the App Store so us owners of older generation I pads could still download Skype.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>

    <title>SDBUS_INTERNAL_ERROR after May 2015 Windows 8.1 updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrs&#42;t  say:</h3>
<h2>            SDBUS_INTERNAL_ERROR  after May 2015 Windows 8.1 updates</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an HP Envy X2 Convertible tablet/laptop. It was working on Windows 8.1 with no problems until this month (May 12, 2015) were some windows updates. The first problem was that it started to freeze, unresponsive and having to power off holding on the
 power button.&nbsp;Within the next couple days I had this message: "ATTEMPTED_WRITE_TO_READONLY_MEMORY". On May 15, 2015 were new win8.1 updates (which I thought that might&nbsp;fix the problem), only to make it worse. It will freeze and when I would leave it, it will
 go to sleep mode and never respond.</p>
<p>I had to restore to factory settings and get all the updates all the way to windows8.1, and then get the 8.1 updates. Now, I still have unresponsiveness after the sleep mode and two days with this new message: "SDBUS_INTERNAL_ERROR".</p>
<p>I will really appreciate&nbsp;your help!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers and providing us with the detailed description about the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per the description, I understand that you have HP envy X2 Convertible tablet/laptop and you are experiencing issue with system becomes unresponsive after the sleep

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would like to provide you with the information that “SDBUS_INTERNAL_ERROR” is a known bug relating to the operation of the embedded Multi Media Controller (eMMC)
 that holds Flash memory and the controller.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>There can be various scenarios for this issue to occur. For example</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 8 is installed on a computer that uses an eMMC embedded storage device.</span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This problem occurs because the eMMC embedded storage device does not handle two concurrent abort commands when the device is busy because of internal NAND management.
 The storage device does not send a response to the abort command that is issued by the controller. This triggers the SDBUS.sys error recovery flow again, and the device never recovers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to try the
<strong>Hotfix</strong> in the link given below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows 8 may stop responding (hang) when multiple abort commands are sent to an embedded storage device</span></span></strong></p>

<h3> brettstahlman  say:</h3>
<h2>            BCD error&#58; &#34;missing or contains errors&#34; yet the same BCD boots successfully from a USB stick</h2>
                    <p>I've copied the EFI boot partition for my Windows 10 installation to another disk. If I try to boot from that other disk (by running EFI\Microsoft\Boot\bootmgfw.efi in the EFI shell), I get error code 0xc0000225 with a message similar to the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows failed to start...</em><br />
</p>
<p><em>The Boot Configuration Data for your PC is missing or contains errors.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But...</strong>&nbsp;If I recursively copy the EFI folder from that same disk (the one I couldn't boot from) to a usb stick, I can boot from the usb stick with no error (once again, running bootmgfw.efi in the EFI shell). This tells me that the BCD exists

<p>Jamshed,</p>
<p>Thanks, but I don't see how the BCD can be the problem. As I mentioned in my original post, I can copy the entire boot partition (including the BCD) to a usb stick and it boots perfectly. The video mentioned that in addition to BCD corruption, disk hardware
 issues could also cause that error code. Could you elaborate on this? The disk I'm using is a bit exotic, so I might suspect something like that, but I'm able to copy its entire contents in the EFI shell using UEFI FAT drivers, so I don't see how it could
 be hardware issues - unless Windows loader is using its own drivers and having an issue that UEFI doesn't have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be sure what I'm doing is absolutely clear...</p>
<p>fs0 = usb</p>
<p>fs4 = special disk</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In EFI Shell...</strong></p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Error 0xC0000225 &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">copy -r fs4:\EFI fs0:\</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;&lt; Boot Success!!! &gt;&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can get more information on what Windows loader doesn't like about the disk/file system? I saw that bcdedit provides an option for setting some sort of debug flag. If the Windows boot process weren't so opaque - i.e., if I knew what sort
 of things it was checking - it would be much easier to root cause the failure...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brett S.</p>

 How can Windows 7 Ultimate OS be LOWER than or even Vista, can anyone assist? I have written 4 emails to *** Email address is removed for privacy *** but not one reply, and their advertisement said compatible with all windows OS! I have tried everything even trying to open
 in XP mode with service pact 2 and 3, Vista SP 1&amp;2 and I am at a loss as to what I can do next, hate these companies that take the money immediately from your bank account but cannot even be bothered to respond to an SOS email</p>

    <title>Halo 5&#58; Guardians Disc Swap, why would collectors want a code&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Halo 5&#58; Guardians Disc Swap, why would collectors want a code&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I today spent $750 on Halo 5 Guardians Xbox One and Halo 5:guardians collectors edition, However the only reason I did this is because I knew I could swap out the digital codes for&nbsp; physical copies. After 3 hours of sitting on my computer talking to customer
 service, it seemed that this was a terrible idea. Who in MS decided collectors want a digital code? We don't and stop this immediately.</p>
<p>We are collectors, meaning we like to collect physical products, not come home and sit on the computer for hours on end. This was being extremely cheap and treating collectors as if we are not worth the extra cost of a physical game. MS this is why you lost
 so much market share, you tried to do DRM and people felt cheated, these ideas need to stop.</p>
<p>If you do this ever again I and many others will stop buying collectors editions, we want the physical game? The customer service was nice but the process was slow. I also had to give up all sorts of information, including my 2 Consoles Serial Numbers, Gamer
 tags, emails, phone numbers and the code to my Digital copy that I didn't want in the first place. Not only that I had to retrieve codes to repeat back, what a mess. Lucky my Fiance' has a Xbox One, a Gamer tag or I would have only been able to retrieve one
</p>
<p>So I hope MS learned some sort of lesson today, I'm sure many complained and contacted support for their physical copy. You charged an extra $100 for the Halo Xbox one bundle, when I can get a solid state drive with a terabyte and better controller for $499.
 So in the long run I feel cheated and not sure why it was above $450. </p>
<p>&nbsp;MS please don't pull this ever again or I will not be a collector of anything Xbox again .&nbsp; My gamer room is packed with collector edition products from the original Xbox, to Xbox 360 and now Xbox one to name a small few.
</p>

<p>I also paid for the console version. I was chatting with microsoft support, like the WEBSITE said to do. The person on the chat told me I could not trade in the digital code since it was not a collectors edition. Why? I paid $250 more for my version, got
 this crappy metal earth figure(by the way these metal earth figures are annoying as he**), and you wont let me trade in my code? SERIOUSLY!? This is a bad way to show their "customer appreciation".

<p>The Gamestop early release was bad enough...when I found out that I could swap my digital download code for a physical game I thought it would be a win...boy was I wrong. &nbsp;After an hour with Rusty A. whom I'm not even sure spoke English in a chat session,
 it wasn't as easy as their own instructions stated...not only did they want the 25 digit code...the gamertag...email address..and mailing addrss...they wanted your full name...a receipt of the limited edition purchase...and as icing on the cake your console's
 serial number...none of which is detailed in the swap instructions.</p>
<p>Now I waited to get my xbox one specifically for the Halo 5 release and pre-ordered the new xbox one version with the hybrid drive. &nbsp;However, they WILL NOT COMPLETE the disc swap without a console serial number registered to you and it must be an xbox one.
 &nbsp;Fine. &nbsp;But spell it out in the instructions before I waste an hour of my life....Another bait and switch. &nbsp;This digital download mess is ridiculous especially with the size of these games! &nbsp;who is going to pay if I bust data caps from my ISP...I have been
 with xbox since the beginning but now I feel like they are doing their best to screw folks over. &nbsp;I also buy the collectors stuff for the physical items...after today I may not be doing that again.</p>

<p>I submitted my request last night (10/20/15) and I was surprised with all the requested information. Then I thought about people that may try some fraud bs and figured they were crossing all their T's &amp; dotting all their I's. The only thing that killed me
 was the console serial number. Lol. Which you can just go to your settings to view it instead of moving the console to see it.
</p>
<p>Tonight I chatted again just to confirm everything. Hey guys, these reps in the chat are only doing as they are trained and instructed to do. Be mad at MS Xbox division, not the reps doing there job. I thought both people were pleasant and respectful the
 entire chat. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, this was a vastly poor decision to include a download code in a collectors edition knowing *** well collectors want the physical game disc. I know this is them trying to avoid trade ins, but all of us don't trade it our games. Some
 of us... Wait for it.... Actually collect or games. </p>
<p>Anyways, can't wait to play the game next week. The rep said it would come in a retail game box and some lame sleeve. Let's hope that's the case or I'll be P'd off. :)</p>

<p>I'm pretty sure collectors don't keep the game cases open on their shelves so as the disks are exposed. Just saying.</p>
<p>By the way I think the point is to have the game in your Xbox (disc or digital) with you playing it, while the statue and case sit on the shelves. I don't think games are designed just so people can put disc in cases on their bookshelves.</p>
<p>I'm going to play the game at launch as soon as possible because I am a gamer. I got the LCE and console because I am a fan and collector. I got an extra game code among other codes I can give out to my friends. I'm a Halo fan and collector so don't bother
 saying that I could sell the game if it was physical, because I never have sold any of my Halo games and I don't plan on doing so.</p>
<p>I'm actually just going to buy most of my Games digitally from now on because it is far mor efficient and doesn't rely on having a physical disc that is liable to get damaged, scratched or lost. I can play games as soon as they go live, instead of having
 to drive to Gamestop at midnight, wait in line, drive home, install it, then play.</p>
<p>I think you are just turning this into a problem when it isn't one.</p>

<p>Ok, so I redeemed the code and found out after redeeming it, I could have got the discs if I swapped the code for the physical copy of the game. I contacted Microsoft Customer Support and they repeatedly told me they can't do anything because the code is
 no longer active and can't be deactivated. This is BS! I paid $250 for a bundle pack that should have had the discs inside. They would have been great to display next to my other Halo games. Miscrosoft, fix this please and try to get the discs to the ones
 that actually want them and have brought their concern to you.</p>

    <title>At random the screen goes blank when charger is connected&#59; usually - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cs2468  say:</h3>
<h2>            At random the screen goes blank when charger is connected&#59; usually fine when running on battery</h2>
                    We have an Dell Inspiron 6400 laptop.&nbsp; When the charger is connected the screen will suddenly go black and you are unable to get the screen going again.&nbsp; It doesn't appear to shut down completely because when I press the power button twice (or more?) it
 takes me back to the password screen.<br />
<br />
This doesn't happen when running off the battery, ie. charger not connected.&nbsp; I bought a new charger thinking this was the problem but the same thing happens with the new charger.<br />
<br />
My only thought is that it could be the battery but not keen to spend £60 on a new one if it doesn't solve the problem.&nbsp; And also the battery charges up OK when the laptop is not turned on.<br />
<br />
Help needed please!&nbsp; Thanks very much.

            SOLUTION!<br />
<br />
I thought that I would finally go back in to this thread and write what solved the problem in the end.<br />
<br />
I took it to a local repair shop who I have used before and they fitted a new LCD Inverter to it (cost about 30 UK pounds).&nbsp; It did the trick and has been working perfectly ever since.<br />
<br />
I hope this might help someone else as it was hugely cheaper than the only real option which Dell's helpline suggested which was a new motherboard which was going to cost a fortune.<br />
<br />
Thanks again Tiffany for your help.

            Hi Tiffany - sorry a very very delayed thank you for your help on this.<br />
<br />
I have been very busy and therefore have been putting off looking at this.&nbsp; We have been surviving off of battery use and when it runs out just shutting the system down / sleep mode and recharging it.&nbsp; This has become pretty frustrating and therefore I've decided
 I really have to get this fixed.<br />
<br />
As you advised, I've just gone through the safe mode and the problem occurred again so looking at your guidance it appears that it must be a hardware problem.&nbsp; I had initially bought a spare power jack and this didn't work so perhaps it is the battery.&nbsp; As
 you have suggested, perhaps a qualified support shop is the best solution now.<br />
<br />
Thank you once again!!!&nbsp; I am very grateful.<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try uninstalling and reinstalling sound card driver.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how you do it:</span></p>
<p><span>a.&nbsp;Click Start, type<strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>in the Start Search box,
 and then press ENTER.<br />
b.&nbsp;In the Device Manager dialog box, expand <strong><span>Sound, video, and game controllers</span></strong>.<br />
c.&nbsp;Locate the audio device that was included with the computer. <br />
d.&nbsp;Right-click the device, and then click <strong><span>Properties</span></strong>.<br />
e.&nbsp;Click the <strong><span>Driver</span></strong>tab, and then click<strong><span>Uninstall</span></strong>.<br />
f.&nbsp;Make sure that the<strong><span> Delete the Driver Software for this device</span></strong>check box is cleared, and then click<strong><span>OK</span></strong>.<br />
g.&nbsp;In the Device Manager dialog box, click the <strong><span>Action</span></strong>menu, and then click<strong><span>Scan for hardware changes</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You receive a message that states that a hardware device is being installed, and then the uninstalled audio device appears in Device
 Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>h.&nbsp;Close the Device Manager dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also try downloading the latest drivers from the<a href="http://www.csd.toshiba.com/cgi-bin/tais/support/jsp/home.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manufacturer’s
 website</a> and install it.</span></p>

<h2>            external drive not recognized after hibernation</h2>
                    I'm using a Win 7 SP1 64 bit system fully updated. I have an external drive connected by USB, a Maxtor OneTouch, which the computer recognises on boot. However, when waking up after hibernation, the computer gives an error message that the drive has malfunctioned
 and cannot be recognised. The only way to get the computer to recognise it is to reboot. This is becoming a pain.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I seem to remember not having this problem with the same hardware setup under Vista, my &nbsp;previous OS.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Given that there is no problem with the drive on booting up, I assume that I don't have a driver problem (Windows in fact says I have the correct driver) nor can there be a problem with the USB cable because I can use the drive without problems prior to
 hibernation. I have tried unplugging all my USB devices and plugging them back in, but the problem remains.</div>
                </div>

            I followed your advice above but I'm afraid it didn't work. Of the two documents you cite, the first doesn't pertain to me, the second I followed--this was basically to uninstall then reinstall the drive. The reinstall apparently went well, with the computer
 saying it had successfully installed the relevant software, but I still have my problem. It seems this problem is pretty widespread, from googling it on the web; why has there not been a fix before now?
<div><br />
<div>I have also noticed the following: I have two external drives, the Maxtor I'm having the problem with, and a Freecom drive. I can boot up with the Freecom turned off, and then turn it on and it will be recognized. If I boot up with the Maxtor unplugged,
 and then plug it in, I get the error message that a USB device has malfunctioned etc. The only way the Maxtor will work is when it is connected at boot and the computer has not yet entered hibernation. I hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Slow&#47;Buggy Startup and More</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to do as much research as I can and I've even tried a couple things to fix these issues, but I have yet to get this fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of my PC specs:</p>
<p>i7-3770k CPU</p>
<p>GTX 670 GPU (up-to-date driver)</p>
<p>Asrock Z77 Extreme9 MOBO</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a machine I built myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm at a loss. Windows 10 has me so frustrated right now, I don't understand what's going on and what's causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. I've had it for about a week now and suddenly Windows 10 freezes today about an hour after I first started my PC. Then it started doing it almost immediately after startup. I've tried this fix&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3083595
 and so far it seemed to have helped a little. We'll see if it occurs again today.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, now my startup is extremely slow and buggy. The startup can take as long as 2 minutes, sometimes even longer. Sometimes it doesn't seem to startup at all, I'm left with a black screen with the cursor. I have tried disabling the "Fast startup" option
 and enabling it again, no difference. I've disabled some apps from opening when the PC starts up. I have no idea why Windows 10 is acting this way, but it's so frustrating. I've tried Windows 10 six months ago and I went back to 7 because of these very same
 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on what I should do to try and fix this?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I checked for updates and found none. My graphics driver is up-to-date as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also set Windows 10 to bypass the login screen. It automatically logs me in.</p>

</p><p>I forgot to mention that when I manually restart the PC when the startup process hangs, I get a black screen that says something along the lines of "No boot device, insert boot media and press any key." I have to manually shutdown the computer and turn it
 on again. It managed to start Winodws 10 (I'm replying on the machine I'm having issues with), however the startup process was ridiculously long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if it's worth mentioning, but Windows 10 is installed on a 120GB SSD with 26.5GB of free space.</p>

            <p>This morning my PC seemed to have started up better. I wasn't waiting at the Windows 10 logo with the loading circle at all. However, once I get to the desktop it seems like Windows 10 is struggling to start up apps and such. Apps pinned on my task bar take
 a bit to appear and my cursor speed takes a minute to adjust. Other than that, the startup process improved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea why I'm left waiting at the desktop after startup for stuff to load for about a minute. Up until yesterday morning everything was loaded almost instantly and there were zero issues. The startup process before was maybe 10-15 seconds total
 if I had to guess.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you check that booting your PC into Safe Moe?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine in Safe Mode, then try to check this by taking your PC into Clean Boot state.&nbsp;
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a
 program or an update or when you run a program. Follow the below mentioned steps to perform Clean Boot:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press
<strong><span>Windows Key,</span></strong> t</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ype
<strong><span>msconfig</span></strong> in the search box, and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. On the
<strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>Open Task Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<strong><span>Disable</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">e. Close Task Manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">f. On the
<strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the
<strong><span>System Configuration</span></strong> dialog box, tap or click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer. Once you reboot your PC see if it makes any difference in performance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Now it indicates that some other services are causing the issues. I suggest you turn on 5 services at a time which are disabled before, reboot and
 then see if the problem reappears, keep repeating this until you find a group of 5 services, which are causing this issue, then check the one by one, till you find the one which is causing your issue. Perform the same divide and apply for
<strong><span>Startup's </span></strong>too.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Yesterday, I was able to startup fine. I didn't really have any issues other than a long startup process. Today Windows 10 doesn't seem to want to cooperate at all. The startup process time was 1:36, but eventually locked up and froze about a minute after
 startup. After 5 more attempts at starting up, I would either sit and wait at the windows logo/load circle screen for as long as 5 minutes and get nowhere or get to the desktop and freeze again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I booted up in Safe Mode and I got the same ridiculously long startup process. I waited at a black screen with only a cursor for about 2 minutes before it took me to the login screen. After reaching the desktop, I was able to setup for a clean boot process
 without having the OS freeze on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the clean boot and again, I'm faced with a ridiculously long startup process. I timed it at about 2:12. Now what do I do?</p>

            <p>I found and installed the latest Chipset drivers. I checked for the latest BIOS version and it is already installed. Even with the Chipset drivers updated, I'm still having really slow/buggy startups with Windows 10. Still don't understand why everything
 worked fine the first week and suddenly Windows 10 doesn't want to work properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try and do the Windows 10 ISO file repair. The first time I upgraded to Windows 10 a few months ago, I tried the repair feature and it failed, leaving my PC without an OS. That was the final Windows 10 screw up that made me go back to Windows 7 until
 about a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know when I've completed the repair process and if the issues were fixed.</p>

            <p>I just finished a repair upgrade of Windows 10 and it's running just fine again. The startup process is back down it's normal speed of 10-15 seconds and no system lock ups yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, just like the two previous attempts at upgrading to Windows 10, it's possible the OS will start acting up again in about a week. We'll see though, I'll keep an eye on things and let you know if these issues arise again in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p>A little update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since my last post, I've only had a couple lockups. The first time, my whole computer locked up, but after about 30 seconds it fixed itself and went back to normal. Just today I had a total system lockup, I couldn't open anything, but I was able to move
 my cursor. I forced my PC to shut down and it started up fine and it hasn't happened again yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a restore point I created almost immediately after I finished re-installing Windows 10 in case things get messed up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed some errors in the event viewer. I wasn't able to use the event view before re-installing Windows 10 as it was not working. The error is under Windows Logs&gt;System: "The device, \Device\Harddisk0\DR0, has a bad block."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 120GB SSD I have Windows 10 installed is as old as this machine I built, which is about 4 years now. I have other programs and all my games installed on a 500GB HD. I'm already in the process of buying a new 480GB SSD to replace the 120GB SSD. Although
 I'm not entirely sure if that error could be what's causing the issue. The error appears quite a few times, even when my computer hasn't locked up.</p>

            The download is said to resume where it has left off. Even if you shut down your computer and forcefully stop the download, your download will resume when you turn your computer back on. The download is completely transparent to you.

<br />
<br />4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Typethe following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                        net start wuauserv
<br />
<br />                        net start cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                        net start bits
<br />
<br />                        net start msiserver
<br />
<br />5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it and then restart the computer.

<h2>            How to disable&#47;configure volume OSD&#47;overlay that pops up when volume is adjusted&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am loving Windows 10 so far, however this is one of the first things I would very much like to change.
<br />
<br />
I have done probably close to an hour of researching it different search terms and reading forum posts to no avail, I do not believe there is a setting for it, and if not I believe it should be added.<br />
<br />
Does anyone here know of a registry modification or something similar I can do to disable it completely?
<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of what it looks like: <br />

    <title>how to find Xeon X5472 step code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lovelydady  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to find Xeon X5472 step code</h2>
                    HI,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a Xeon X5472 in a Dell T7400 and I am looking to add a second processor. I understand that I need to take care to match stepping numbers but I can't work out which of the many varieties of stepping numbers which seem to be out there need to be matched.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I run the setup utility the stepping is given under CPU info as 6, which is the same number i get when I run the Intel Processor Identification utility. However when I ask about stepping number from potential sellers I'm given various codes, C0&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;SLANR
 or E0 or &nbsp;SLBBH, which doesn't match in any way shape or form with 6. Nor does 6 match any of the info I've been able to get from Intel data sheets.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's driving me a little crazy and I'm wondering whether to just buy another processor and see what happens since there's plenty of debate about whether it really matters at all or just buy a pair of processors and sell the one I have. Neither of these
 appeal, the former seems risky and the latter expensive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Cheers.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows can&#39;t read the disc in drive D&#58;&#92;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>i have an Advent 9215 laptop and upgraded to Windows 10 after much consideration as to the pros and cons.</p>
<p>i can now no longer burn my photos to a CD.</p>
<p>i want to free up space and as well as having photos on my external hard drive ant them on CD as well.</p>
<p>when I insert a CD or indeed DVD the following message pops up</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Windows can't read the Disc in Drive D:\</p>
<p>&nbsp;Make sure the disc uses a format that Windows recognises. &nbsp;If the disk is unformatted you need to format it before using it&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am using exactly the same discs I used when the laptop ran on Vista and Windows 7 and never had this problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>i am not very computer technical so step by step guidance would be really appreciated&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, wondering if someone could give me some help here please. <br />
I still have the same problem.<br />
I have run the hardware troubleshooter and then uninstalled the software and installed/downloaded the updated software from Pioneer as suggested above.<br />
Then message still comes up when I click on the D drive I still get the notice below.<br />
<br />
<p>Windows can't read the Disc in Drive D:\</p>
<p>Make sure the disc uses a format that Windows recognises. &nbsp;If the disk is unformatted you need to format it before using it.<br />
<br />
I can't get passed this point. Where do I go to format the disc so that Windows can read it if I can't get passed this point.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Cheers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Help changing Gamertag. Trying to change but it wont let me</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;So Im trying to change my Gamertag to another one. And When I send a Friend Request to that Gamertag or Do anything to it it says the Gamertag does not exist. But when I try and change my Gamertag to it. It says that someone already has it. How can this
 be though? Please help. IT IS NOT ON ZUNE either!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I called Xbox Support and they say the Gamertag is available but have no idea why it wont let me change it to that gamertag</p>

<p>Then if one exists, you aren't going to be able to use the other version sadly. Blocking what is essentially the same tag but with/without a space is Microsoft's way of preventing people impersonating others.</p>

<p>LOL, well most of you are partly right, here it is... When you sign up for a profile if it becomes inactive for some time the WLID can become deleted, the GT is still floating out there. XBOX will go in and clean these old GT's off of their system after
 so many years. the reason that you can't send a friend request is because there is no WLID attached to it. So it's in Limbo. &nbsp;you will need to creat a variable of the Gt that you are wanting. &nbsp; IE: MONKEYPOO &nbsp;MONKIEPOO &nbsp;M0NK13P00 ETC... TIL YOU FIND SOMETHING
 THT IS AVAIL AND not in lombo or does not ahve a WLID attached to it. Good Luck</p>

    <title>Booting an SSD with Windows 7 in another computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Booting an SSD with Windows 7 in another computer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an old desktop computer with a SSD with Windows 7 as main disk and an old HDD for data.</p>
<p>Now I got a newer desktop and I want to move the SSD there, keeping my OS as is and use the HDD that came with it (larger and faster than my old one)&nbsp; as secondary disk for data.</p>
<p>The problem is that, as I installed Windows 7 on the SSD with both disks plugged, some files required for booting might have ended up in the old HDD and now the new PC cannot boot from the SSD unless the old HDD is there too.</p>
<p>To make things worse, the connections (don't know their names) of the of HDD are too old for the new computer, so I can't plug it there.</p>
<p>Things I've tried or thought about but can't do:</p>
<p>- as I already said, i can't plug the old HDD on the new computer, as the connections don't match</p>
<p>- cloning (using a disk hard cloning tool) the old hdd into the new one. Didn't work</p>
<p>- having a backup of the SSD and reinstall windows 7 on it in the new computer. Cannot do it as I can't find w7 keys and my student account has expired so I can't get new keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you suggest another solution?</p>

<p>Hi Marco,<br />
<br />
May we know if your Windows 7 has a full Retail license or has an OEM license? If the version of your Windows 7 is a retail Full or Upgrade license, you can transfer Windows 7 to a new computer. You can move it as long as it's only installed on one computer
 at a time (and if it's a Windows 7 Upgrade version the new computer must have it's own qualifying XP/Vista license). The previous Windows 7 installation on the old computer must be formatted/deleted. You might have to call Microsoft and explain what happened
 to complete the activation. Activating it on the second computer will automatically in effect "deactivate" the license for the first computer. The key will work with both 32 and 64 bit, but only one can be installed at a time.<br />
<br />
If the version of your Windows 7 an OEM license, you are not able to transfer Windows 7. OEM licenses, including pre-installed Windows on a computer before purchase and Windows bought separately, are tied to the first computer they are installed on and can
