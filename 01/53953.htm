    <title>Is it IMPOSSIBLE to move windows apps to another computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crwdzr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is it IMPOSSIBLE to move windows apps to another computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have slow internet, so I have to download large programs at other peoples houses on their connections. I've never had any issues doing this before. Steam, blizzard, U-play, oculus - literally any content delivery network. They all allow you to download
 software, and then transfer it to another source at your discretion. But not the Windows Store, apparently. It is absurd to me how difficult this has proven to be.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I downloaded it on another computer today. I located it in "Apps &amp; Features", selected it, and clicked "move" to transfer it to my usb drive. When I got home and plugged in the drive, windows acted like the game wasn't even on it. Okay, I figured, that's
 to be expected. Maybe its only visible by default to the computer it was installed on. I looked around the "Apps &amp; features" program for ANY sign of a button that would allow me to force it to discover an app from an external source - no go. Okay, well if
 it's that poor then maybe I can try the good old "start the download, pause it, copy over the completed game into the directory, then resume the download" trick. Well, now I'm being told that I don't have permission to put the files there. The exact verbage:
<strong>"your organization does not allow you to place this file here"</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Really? My organization? </p>
<p>The one I'm an administrator of?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, it's just typical windows permissions stuff, so I dig around online and see people saying "just transfer ownership to yourself". Well, I tried that and it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question:</p>
<p>HOW do I get this program that I own, off of the flash drive I own, onto the computer I own, and why is it this difficult?</p>
<p>Did I waste my time and money? </p>
<p>Should I avoid Microsoft Store delivered games like the plague from now on?&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a general rule, it is not possible to move&nbsp; a program from one computer to another. That's because most programs have references and needed components that are within \windows, in the registry and elsewhere. Without these, the program won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are some exceptions to this, but they are few and far between.</p>

<p>I was backing up on my external 2TB hard disk when the power failed halfway through. When connected to the computer, the hard disk was visible as a drive letter, but the volume label was not readable. The data itself were not accessible either.</p>
<p>I ran chkdsk /f and while it fixed a few errors, it failed while verifying Usn Journal with the message above.</p>
<p>The solution was to run chkdsk /f again and again and again, letting it run to the end each time (with the fail message).</p>
<p>It took about 6 times, each time taking *a long time*, before enough files were repaired for the Usn journal to be read. So, one day, after nearly two weeks, the hard disk was finally visible again, complete with volume label and intact data.</p>
<p>In short: keep running chkdsk and as long as it says it is fixing a few errors (albeit failing on many others), don't give up.</p>

<h2>            Skype 8.20.0.9 switches to discrete video card</h2>
                    The latest Skype version forces OSX to use discrete GPU instead of integrated one. Any ideas how to tell the app to not use discrete video card?

</p><p>
</p><p>The Skype application to do not have an option to assign or select&nbsp;what video card will be used. By default it's your system will assign it. With that,&nbsp;you can contact Mac to configure your prefer video card that Skype application will use.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Or, to isolate the case you can download the classic Skype to check if the same behavior will be observed. Go to this link:

<p>Good day Marites!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. You wrote that:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><span>By default it's your system will assign it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would disagree. OSX switches to high performance discrete GPU if there is an application, which requires it. A tool called gfxCardStatus can in real time show which GPU is used, so I have observed that:</p>
<p>1. Two days ago, when I was using a previous Skype version (I think it was the same 8.x branch), integrated video card was "used" by Skype.</p>
<p>2. According to OSX Activity Monitor (see pic) Skype requests discrete GPU</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b8fdf0e-918d-4f74-a934-ebbfb6ca0b2b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b8fdf0e-918d-4f74-a934-ebbfb6ca0b2b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>3. If I turn off this new Skype app, the system goes back to integrated GPU.</p>
<p>4. If I start old classic Skype v. 7.59, integrated GPU is used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in my opinion something is changed in the recent Skype update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Eugene</p>

<p>The new Skype should&nbsp;use the default video card installed on your machine. Can you confirm which is the default video card you set on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you also checked, if you can set the integrated video card as default and check if the new Skype will use it?</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<a href="https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134825/how-to-set-macbook-pro-to-use-integrated-video-card-during-initial-start-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/134825/how-to-set-macbook-pro-to-use-integrated-video-card-during-initial-start-up</a></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)"><em>You cannot force the OS X to use the integrated GPU if you have dual GPU (integrated + descrete). By default OS X will
 use descrete GPU when booting.</em></span>&nbsp;(well, actually it is possible to completely disable high performance GPU, which requires too much hacking).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If new Skype (unlike old one) uses the default GPU (which, I guess, is high performance GPU on mac book pro's), then imo it looks like not optimal way how Skype should work on mac laptops. Especially if older Skype (not even classic, just a bit older 8.x
 version) worked correctly.<br />
</p>
<p>I think in my case I can just switch to Skype classic and hope some day there be a fix for new Skype. Thank you for the clarification, Karen.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How the video files are transferred to the folder- was it downloaded from Internet or transferred using a flash drive?</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<span>Diagnose and repair Windows File and Folder Problems automatically:</span><span>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Open the folder
 in safe mode and see if it opens.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Refer:
</span></p>
<p><span>Start your computer in safe mode:</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If step 1 works try step 2</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></b><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application service or startup item is causing this issue.</span></p>

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished diagnosing, follow step 7 in the article to boot to
 normal startup.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> This strange
 behavior could also be because of virus, run virus scan.</span></p>

    <title>Window borders showing up after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahuli  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window borders showing up after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    I upgraded to the Windows 10 creator's update yesterday and ever since then I have really big window borders. The orange is my theme color. The start menu also has a transparent boarder around it. I also am not able to set a slideshow as my background.
 I have a HP Elitedesk 800 G1, using the Intel graphics, and a NVidia Quadro FX 370, and 380 LP. I tried upgrading, and uninstalling the graphics drivers, reinstalling windows from the setup.exe in the ISO, uninstalled antivirus, tried system restore (it was
 successful, but I still have this problem), I tried to Go back a build in the settings, and that didn't work, tried the SFC -scannow command, and that didn't find any problems. Tried "Diagnostic Start-up" from MSCONFIG, and then the computer failed to boot,
 that is when I did the System restore. I didn't find any other forums with this problem, so I'll start a question here. Any help would be appreciated. &nbsp;

    <title>Server Service error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faizaan ismail  say:</h3>
<h2>            Server Service error </h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>Whenever i try to start the server service, i receive this error:</p>
<p>"Windows could not start the Server service on Local Computer.</p>
<p>Error 1899: The endpoint mapper database entry could not be created."</p>
<p>This error occurred after a series of events. Firstly, I left my computer for about an hour and returning after an hour my computer's fan is really loud (indicating high cpu usage) and my task bar and window borders are back to the default windows aero style
 (light blue). I right click the desktop and go to personalize and the computer hangs. After this i get a BSOD which after 10seconds the computer restarted itself not giving me a chance to take details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then started my computer again and when the "Starting Windows" bar comes up after the bios is loaded - the 4 colored orbs do not appear (the logo does not appear). I wait a long time and then decide to restart my computer into the diagnostic sector (in
 search for a better name). It claims that windows could not start up properly but then when it was 'resolving problem' i get another BSOD this time a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA. I read up on this which stated that RAM was an issue, which I initially doubted
 as my RAM was pretty new. Each successive start up of windows resulted in a BSOD after logging on. In the end i removed a stick of RAM which stopped the BSODs but now a bunch of internal errors that were not there before this series of BSODS are appearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've searched quite a bit on the internet and have found no solution regarding this - was hoping someone would have a possible solution.</p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text and thanks in advance!</p>

<p><span>Hi Faizaan,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to</span><span>open event viewer and check if
 there are any other significant error messages/codes related to the issue and post it back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link below for more details:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-information-appears-in-event-logs-Event-Viewer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also post back the exact internal error message you receive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may try to put the computer in a clean boot state and check if any third party application or services is causing this issue
 and if you can resolve the internal errors and starting the server service. </span>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing clean boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following
 KB article to narrow down the exact source. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps
 under “Reset the computer to start as usual”.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You
 may also check if all the dependency services for Server service is started and try to start it and check if it helps.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.</span></p>

 found that Key Index should have been set to 1. I tried connecting again, and I was finally connected. Thanks for your effort to help!<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/616daf2f-eeb4-4051-9a32-dd73bcabedc4" />

<h2>            Windows 10 July update, completely black screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updated my dell xps 8700 few days ago, the PC stuck during restarting --- stayed on black screen for few hours (nothing on screen literally)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off PC by long pressing power button, and tried to turn it, but it stays the same. I could hear the noise of fan and hard drive after pressing power button, just nothing shows on screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to turn on the PC many times, but it stays the same. Please help! Due to the issue, I have to delay a very important task for days!</p>

            Hi rxishere,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with black screen after an update.
<br />
<br />Start your computer in Windows Recovery Mode.  
<br />
<br />1.)	Turn on your computer, as soon as you see Windows starting to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button until it shuts down.  (Do this two times)
<br />2.)	On the third time to power up, Windows should start up in Recovery Mode
<br />3.)	You will see several options System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt… select Safe Mode
<br />4.)	If are able to go in Safe Mode, go to Troubleshoot -&gt; Advanced Option-&gt; Startup Repair
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t work, keep going through the same process selecting a different option each time. . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not see a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            I think I'm in the same situation as you. I get nothing but black screen when I turn it off and on.&nbsp; To get to the Blue Recovery screen, I must unplug the computer, and with it unplugged, I press and hold the "on" button to discharge any power still in
 the system. Then I plug it back in and turn it on. Finally I get the blue recovery screen. Right now I'm trying to restart it in safe mode to see if I can fix the problems.

</p><p>I fixed the issue yesterday after unplugged everything and plug&nbsp; them back on both pc tower&nbsp; and monitor (I even opened&nbsp; the chassis to unplug the cable on gpu)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have the blue recovery screen though, it went well to the log in screen after power on. After I logged in, I did another update (the lastest one), and everything seems back to normal again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>it is really annoying, especially when you have an urgent work to do, and I am sure it was caused by Windows 10 updates, cos everything was just fine before the update.....</p>

<p>Often these problems are due to the Sent Items folder (which is actually a disk file) being too large. The message becomes stuck in Outbox (and doesn't send) because the Sent Items folder cannot accept it.</p>
<p>Note that just deleting -or moving stuff to another folder- on its own doesn't clear the problem, you must then compact the folder from the File.. menu option. This will take some time, and your computer will be very unresponsive till it completes.</p>
<p>To clear the print queue you need to stop the spooler service, delete the offending item, then restart the spooler.</p>
<p>"net stop spooler" at a commandprompt will do this. Or use services.msc.</p>

<div>You can go to File | Work Offline in OE and then go to the outbox and delete the message.&nbsp; Alternatively, you can close OE and delete the outbox.dbx file (hidden) and OE will create a new empty one.</div>

<h2>            NOT WORKING - DVD&#47;CD Device Sony Q58A ATA Device Location 0 &#40;Channel 1, Target 0, Lun 0&#41; </h2>
                    HERE IS THE ERROR MESSAGE I SEE IN DEVICE MANAGER -- "Windows cannot start this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19)"<br />
.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
This problem has been occuring for a week, so I've even reformated my hard drive, and completely reinstalled the OS, and driver/applicatiions disks that originally came with the notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;DVD/CD device then worked as my D drive, but then&nbsp;disappeared from&nbsp;MY
 COMPUTER and EXPLORER about 3 days later.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
NOTE:&nbsp; THE Device did work when I used a disk (CLEAN WIPE) to reformat the hard drive (I booted from disk to use this)... Then installed the OS (Boot from Disk), but the apps/driver disk ran fine since I now had a D drive from the fresh install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I've reinstalled the driver from Dell about 3 times now, with no luck.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greatly appreciated... t<br />
<br />
Thanks so much,<br />
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Go through all of those and it could be a bad drive. Check with Sony Support or System maker&nbsp;(if not Sony)&nbsp;to see<br />
if there is a specific driver - an update or the same driver to reinstall.<br />
<br />

            <p>Sure there is.&nbsp; What probably has happened is that he interrupted a file burning session at one time, leaving files ready to be burned to a DVD/CD.&nbsp; In previous versions of Windows, Windows Explorer would show a directory for the drive even if there were
 no files in it and no media in the drive.&nbsp; With Windows 7 for some reason it (usually) won't until you put a blank DVD/CD in the drive.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you put a blank DVD in the drive a pop-up will give you the choice of burning files to disk or burning a DVD video disk.&nbsp; A CD gives similar choices.&nbsp; A directory for the drive will open in Windows Explorer, and you can drag and drop files to it to
 be burned.&nbsp;As soon as there are files in it&nbsp;a button of sorts will appear in the tool bar of Windows Explorer that says "Burn to Disk."&nbsp; Click on that to complete the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The solution to his problem is easy.&nbsp; Put a blank DVD or CD in the drive and select "Burn files to disk" from the pop-up.&nbsp; When the directory opens for that drive in Windows Explorer, delete all the files from it.&nbsp; You can then remove the DVD/CD and save
 it for later use - it won't be written.&nbsp; You shouldn't get that baloon any more.</p>

<h2>            I have my sfc &#47;scannow cbs.log....now what&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I've been having massive issues with my laptop (Toshiba satellite, M645-S4070 running Win 7 64-bit, ). It started with my opening up my turned on laptop to everything being all locked up. I did a hard restart and got stuck at the Welcome screen. Same happened
 in safe mode. I tried restoring to a previous state, but had the same issues. I ran Advance Systemcare, and an Avast scan in safe mode. Per other forums I tried a winsock reset, but no change. I've also gone through all drivers in device manager one by one
 to see if updates were needed. I've ran sfc /scannow about three times now and continue to receive that the Windows&nbsp;Resource&nbsp;Protection found corrupt files. I see the "cannot repairs", my question is what is my next step? What do I do with this info?&nbsp;&nbsp;Below
 are the cannot repair sections of the cbs.log (the entire log was too long to post).

<h2>            AC4 saved game disappeared and replaced -- help please&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>My son's&nbsp;Assassin's Creed 4&nbsp;saved game disappeared and was replaced with my other son's saved game.&nbsp; We've tried shutting down/unplugging/restarting.&nbsp; Also making sure that only one&nbsp;profile (the one with the "lost" game) is signed in.&nbsp; My saved game and
 my other son's saved game are both intact.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how to fix this?&nbsp; How could this even happen?&nbsp; We don't have the flexibilty to move saved games/profiles around on Xbox One (like we could with 360), correct?</p>
<p>Could we recover it from the Cloud?&nbsp; If so, how?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hey there Ourkman! I'm sorry to hear about the save game issues.<br /><br />I'm sincerely sorry to say that if the saved game is gone and it's been replaced with a different save, then the save is probably not recoverable.<br /><br /><strong>When the game save was overwritten, was that game save's profile logged in at the time?</strong> It's possible that the profile that the game save belonged to was the one that was being used at the time, and that's where the mix-up happened.<br /><br />Again, I'm truly sorry to say that there's not much that can be done if a save is overwritten like that.<br /><br />Let us know if you have any other questions for us.</p>

<p>I have also had this problem - my gf was playing and then I tried to sign on (we didn't shut the console off in the middle of anything) and found that my profile only showed her saved game. Tried rebooting, making sure not to sign on as her, and found her
 saved game still there. Mine is just gone. Extremely disappointing.</p>

<p>I have also experienced this problem. When profile A is signed in save file A is loaded. Then profile B signs in and instead of loading save file B it overwrites save file B with save file A. Huge problem. With no way to back up our save files to fix this
 issue when it happens we are essentially restricted to one profile per console. </p>

<p>I contacted Ubisoft and they told me that the problem was created by 1) Ubisoft quickly releasing a game without understanding who the Xbox profile caching system works and 2) the fact that you can't really turn off a game to make sure there is no intereference.
 The Ubisoft customer service rep (who was very nice) told me that the Ubisoft dev team is aware of things and is working on a fix, and in the meantime to just turn the console all the way off when changing players. This got me a bit nervous so I disabled Kinect
 login, just in case! I hope the Xbox devs are also hard at work at fixing the Xbox One's in-general atrocious interface.</p>

<p>I just wanted to post in here again. Its even worse then you might think. My brother's game progress was replaced with my own. My brother was farther ahead in the story then me so we decided to see if he could just replay some of the missions a catch back
 up to where he was before. </p>
<p>We made some progress in the game and triggered a new save event. At this point we quit the game and he logged off. Then he logged back in and started the game again. While the game was not really shut down it did take him back to the main menu and he had
 to select the game save to load again. </p>
<p>He loaded the game and the tiny amount of progress was still there. We then repeated the quit and log off steps and I logged into my account and started the game. Again I was taken back to the main menu and had to select the game save. After the game loaded
 this time the progress, as we expected, was not there. </p>
<p>We did the quit and log off part one more time and he logged in and started the game. Again he was taken back to the main menu and again he had to select a game save to play. When it finished loading this time the tiny bit of progress he had made was gone.
 It was in the same state I had left it before I had logged off. </p>
<p>Its almost like his game save is a reference of my own, he can make changes to it and those changes remain until the original is loaded and then the reference syncs back to the original. The game is unplayable in this condition and a Microsoft representative
 needs do more then say they are sorry. </p>

<p>Thanks for all the replies. &nbsp;My son has pretty much accepted that his game is lost. &nbsp;He is pretty disappointed about it though. &nbsp;We are being pretty careful with my game and my other son's though to prevent it from happening again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We have disabled Kinect auto sign-in and deleted Kinect saved data just to be sure (too bad we can't take advantage of that Xbox One "feature"). &nbsp;</p>
<p>When playing we make sure that only one profile is signed in, and when switching games we quit our AC4 game as far as possible, go back to the home screen, log off the active profile and log onto the new profile and restart AC4. &nbsp;So far so good. &nbsp;Hopefully
 that continues to work for us.</p>

<p>I will also add, go into the power settings for the console and put it in energy saving mode. This will ensure the console and the game are 'off' when you turn the console off. It will also cause longer boot time so its more of a stop gap then a real solution.

<p>I never heard from Microsoft. &nbsp;I also submitted a ticket to Ubisoft and they never responded either. &nbsp;One of my son's games was lost, but luckily my other son's was OK and mine was OK so we were able to keep playing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you not able to delete all saves from all profiles and just start over? &nbsp;I guess I don't understand how your game is truly unplayable.</p>

    <title>Xbox One S &#47; Slight Fan Ticking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> btalley0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One S &#47; Slight Fan Ticking </h2>
                    
<p>Not sure if I should be worried about it. So just wanting a little advise. My new Xbox One S has a slight ticking sound. It is definetly the fan, and not the hard drive. It is very very faint though. In order to hear it, I have to put my ear like 2-3 inches
 away. So for normal use, it is obviously no big deal at all. And even when I put my ear up close, it is still pretty faint, but apparent. And does get a little faster as the fan ramps up a little bit under heavy load. But does not get any louder. Would you
 consider this normal? I just don't want the fan failing a few months from now. Since I could do a simple retail swap if it is a concern at this moment. Or is it something I really shouldn't worry about at all? And keep enjoying the new machine. :) Thanks for
 your help fam!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a XBox One S, and I do not hear the sound you're referring to. I would definitely recommend swapping it out. It may be nothing, but it's better to play it safe than deal with issues down the road.</p>

<h2>            PC Crashes unexpectedly, how can I fix it&#63;</h2>
                    Here's a list of fixes I Tried for my PC that keeps Randomly crashing:<br />
<br />
- I have had a look at logs yet nothing was written or logged, (it was set on automatically restart in case of error, I disabled that and all it did was freeze)<br />
<br />
- I did a reset without wiping personal files and it still didn't work (After all the NVIDIA driver was wiped),<br />
<br />
- Then I did a full wipe of my PC and it crashed while I was on the setup screen.<br />
<br />
- I checked power settings, and hardware, all are normal.<br />
<br />
- Did an sfc check, and nothing came up wrong.<br />
<br />
- Ran some built in diagnostics, such as Windows Troubleshooter, and I did a driver stress test running Driver Verifier in Windows&nbsp; (I got a BSOD that gave a graphics error, but I don't remember which one and I looked online but to no avail got no useful fix)<br />
<br />
- Fixed the CPU frequency/speed to what it should've originally been<br />
<br />
<br />
- I did a CD wipe using the CD that I got with my PC<br />
<br />
- Left it on the login screen and nothing happened so I don't think its the graphics driver i think it' most likely Windows doing it on boot, but im not sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
- I also booted it into safe mode and it was fine, and Booted Kali Linux off of a usb and nothing wrong happened for a couple of days.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just can't for the life of me figure out what is wrong. I would really appreciate the help.&nbsp; think it's Windows software but I don't know what to do... Please, I really would like some help.<br />
<br />

            Hi Vinay.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />Run the Blue Screen Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Prepare the BSOD crash report for analysis following these steps:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />------------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Here are a list of things I recommend you do. 
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults.
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<h2>            gears of war 4 crimson omen controller home button not working.</h2>
                    <p>I just got my xbox one s GoW 4 limited edition console. I immediately noticed that the home button on the controller does nothing, i know that it should bring the home screen up everytime i press it, among others. Sometimes it responds, mostly it doesn't. I already tried the hard reset, i unplugged the power cord, update the controller, used a usb cable, etc, but none of them worked. It is disappointing because the device is basically brand new. I don't know how to fix the problem.</p>

Double check and make sure the controller is <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">fully up to date</a>. If you're still having the issue you may want to try a <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a> of the console. If you recently got the console and are still within the return policy the best option would be to take it back to the retailer for an exchange. Thanks!</p>

                    I purchased a laptop today. HP Pavilion g7-1365dx. Was supposed to have Windows 7 installed already.<br />
<br />
Brought it home, charged it and started it. Won't start because ntoskrnl.exe is missing or corrupt. Here is the message I receive.<br />
<br />
File: \Windows/system32/ntoskrnl.exe<br />
<br />
Status 0xc0000221<br />
<br />
Info: Windows failed to load because the kernel is missing, or corrupt.<br />
<br />
To fix this, I'm told to insert the Windows installation disc and use that to repair my computer. However, the laptop did not come with a disc.<br />
<br />
What should I do?<br />
