    <title>Prevent display from switching when laptop lid is closed&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Prevent display from switching when laptop lid is closed&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm looking for a way to prevent display switching when I close the lid of my laptop. On my old laptop, under Windows XP, I could open the lid while watching a&nbsp;movie on a secondary display (TV) e.g. to check something on the web on laptop's monitor - displays
 remained as they were. But under Vista, every time I close or open the lid, display switches to TV and laptop accordingly and the whole process takes quite some time. This behavior&nbsp;remains the same&nbsp;even after disabling TMM in Vista.<br />
Is there any solution to this issue?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.

<p><strong>VERY EASY SOLUTION:</strong></p>
<p>1. open device manager<br />
2. in "System devices" find "ACPI lid"<br />
3. Open "ACPI lid" properties, and go to "Driver" tab.<br />
4. Select "Update driver"<br />
5. Choose "Browse my computer for driver software" and "Let me pick.."<br />
uncheck "Show compatible hardware"<br />
6. And now...in "Manufacturer" select "(Standard system devices)" and model:<br />
"Volume manager" (yes, "Volume manager")<br />
7. next, next, restart the system and it works!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the issue description, I understand you want to format your DOS Operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could answer a few questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Is your DOS system connected to any work environment or domain?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Are you trying to install any Windows Operating System on DOS?</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Do you have bootable CD for your DOS system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Free DOS created its own partition and System, Builder OEI (OEM) will only install on "unallocated" disk space.&nbsp; You would possibly "lose" your Free DOS<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the steps below which will let you know how to format a Computer via DOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Formatting or reformatting a computer's hard drive can be necessary if you're setting up a new PC, reviving a corrupt hard disk or installing a new operating system. The process is fairly simple, but there are a few things you should know before you begin.
 DOS is a generic acronym for "Disk Operating System" and can be associated with several operating systems, including Windows, Linux and Macintosh. On older systems, it can also be MS-DOS. Make sure you're formatting your hard drive with the DOS specified for
 the operating system you plan on installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step1: How to format a computer via DOS</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)">Make sure you have a bootable floppy disk or CD.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)">Insert the disk into the computer, and turn it on. The computer will boot to a black screen showing only an "A:&gt;" prompt or a prompt indicating the letter of the drive you booted from. You can also accomplish
 this by rebooting your computer with the disk in the drive.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>3.</strong> Type "format c: /s" and hit "Enter." The formatting process will begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>4. </strong>Hit "Y" on the keyboard for "Yes" when asked "Are you sure you want to erase everything on drive c:," and then press "Enter."</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>5.</strong> Remove the disk, and reboot your computer. It will boot to the "C:&gt;" prompt from the hard disk.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't have a bootable CD, create it by inserting a blank disk into your computer and typing "format a: /s" from the C:// prompt on your computer before beginning the process. "A:" can be replaced by the letter for whatever drive
 you are using to begin the reformatting process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step2: How to format a hard drive in DOS.</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)">Formatting a hard drive in DOS removes all data and restores the disk to its original factory state. It is important to make sure everything on the hard drive is copied to an external drive or storage device before formatting
 is done. Once a hard drive is formatted, all information is erased. After hard drive formatting is completed, the operating system is no longer available because formatting removes all software and is not reversible. Before you begin, make sure you are ready
 to start over again and that this is what you want to do.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)">Copy all of your hard drive important data to an external storage device.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>2.</strong> Click &amp;ldquo;Start,&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Accessories&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Command Prompt&amp;rdquo; to enter the DOS prompt environment.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>3.</strong> Enter the format command at the DOS command prompt. To format the C: drive using quick formatting, for example, type the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>FORMAT C: /Q</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)">If your hard drive is not drive C:, replace "C:" with the appropriate letter or your hard drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(68, 75, 81, 1)"><strong>4. </strong>Press the &amp;ldquo;Enter&amp;rdquo; key and the drive is formatted section by section. When the formatting is complete, the drive is ready to be used again.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the status of the issue.</p>

                    <p>I have bin having trouble with my computer for a while and there is a constantly random lag spikes during surf on the internet or browsing music in Spotify and sometimes while i'm playing games (like cs:go, dota.. etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This spike can be up to 30 seconds. And that is a long time to wait specially in games. Taskbar often freezes first but the browser can work for maybe 10 seconds then everything starts to freeze for 30 seconds. &nbsp;I have tried to surf for the problem and even
 go after this guide&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot access desktop and recovery options does not work</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 attempted an auto update on our Lenovo laptop and the computer got stuck in a loop of attempting to reboot and failing. &nbsp;The computer was unusable so we downloaded the Windows 10 recovery software to a flash drive and attempted to recover. &nbsp;We
 were able to power cycle the computer and press F12 to get to the boot menu and can select the flash drive with the recovery software. &nbsp;We have tried all options, with the last one being to allow deletion of files, apps, etc. &nbsp;All attempts to recover Windows
 10 have failed and all of our files have been deleted. &nbsp;How can we recover our computer, even if it means reverting to Windows 7?</p>

<h2>            Windows Search Indexing is disabled but the Search itself still uses high CPU and network &#40;Win10 Home Single Lang 64&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Since long, i've been struggling with "uncontrolled" network usage of Win10. I've disabled many essentials, disabled almost every single setting, disabled search indexing but still Microsoft Search and Microsoft Edge use CPU and Network, though I "never
 ever" use them. This causes ping peaks during games. Using Dell XPS Convertible laptop. Thanks in advance for any help and sorry in advance if I duplicated a question and/or asked this in an unappropriate category.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's possible that your Windows Search Index and Microsoft Edge are corrupted, that's why you're experiencing performance issues because of them. First, we recommend that you rebuild your search indexing through
<strong>Indexing Options</strong> in the Control Panel. To do so, kindly follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong><em>control panel</em></strong> on the search bar.</li><li>Click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click the drop-down list beside <strong>View by</strong>, then select <strong>
Small icons</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Indexing Options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Index Settings</strong> tab, click on <strong>Rebuild</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> to confirm the action.</li><li>Once the indexing is done, click on <strong>Close</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After that, we suggest that you follow the steps in this article to fix any issues with Microsoft Edge:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023560/windows-10-what-to-do-when-microsoft-edge-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What to do if Microsoft Edge isn't working</a>. Once done, check if the issue persists.</p>

            Hi Joshua; i guess you misunderstood my issue. The solution you suggested is what I "intentionally" did for the Search "not to work". I "disabled" indexing myself.&nbsp; I don't have any performance issues "at all". I have "network usage" problems. Why and
 how "Search" uses my network without my permission both as upload and download? I don't want it to use my data. Do you have any solution for this?<br />
Thanks.

<p>Just like what we've mentioned in our previous reply, it's possible that your Windows Search Index is corrupted since it keeps on using your CPU and network even when it's disabled. Because of that, we need you to try rebuilding your search indexing before
 disabling it again. If the issue still persists after trying the steps that we have provided in our previous reply, we suggest that you create a new user account. To do so, follow the appropriate steps in this article:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</a>. If the issue does not persist on the new user account, it's probable that your current user profile is corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll patiently wait for the results of the troubleshooting steps that we have provided.</p>

<p>Hi back Joshua,<br />
<br />
I've tried the things you suggested but didn't work.<br />
* enabled then disabled again search<br />
* created a new "local" user<br />
nothing changed. " Windows Search" still uses CPU, RAM and Network.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94118e8a-ca3e-4433-9ad0-ca892ef05075?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/94118e8a-ca3e-4433-9ad0-ca892ef05075?upload=true" /></a><br />

I can not restore windows at all, when it starts it goes through startup diagnostics and then fails to futher options, i can get a dos prompt and see all my files but can't find how to restore the files from the recycle bin as i can not find it<br />

                    <p>Almost all apps will have their tile colors set to the theme accent except for a select few. There are 3rd party programs that can edit most of them to a different color. However, when it comes to

            Hi  terriblepun, this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

This function is by design and cannot be changed. You might have to use a third party personalization utility as you mentioned. 

Best,
Andre

 install it.&nbsp; I get the same error when I removed the memory card and installed it directly into the PC.&nbsp; It is like the OS doesn't know what to do with the driver.&nbsp; I also tried going through the Photo App but the camera doesn't come up in the import menu.&nbsp;
 The camera when plugged in is listed in device manager.&nbsp; It is not a camera problem.

<br />
When you connect the camera or put in the SD card, do you get a new DRIVE LETTER under "Computer"?&nbsp; Copy/move the pictures from it onto your computer.&nbsp; Like most you'll probably find them under som DCIM (Digital Camera IMages) directory.

======================================<br />
Just wondering...if you insert your memory card in it's<br />
slot on the PC...and go to...Computer...can you find <br />
Devices With Removable Storage?&nbsp; Each slot on the<br />
Media Reader should be recognized with a drive letter...<br />
<br />
Examples:<br />
<br />
Removable Disk (E:)<br />
Removable Disk (F:)<br />
Removable Disk (G:)<br />
<br />
One of those drive letters should represent the slot the <br />
memory card is in. If you find it...you should be able to<br />
copy the photos from there.<br />

Have you checked for Windows 8 drivers for your hardware (from the manufacturer's web page, not using anything built into Windows...)?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Was this an upgrade on a machine or did this machine come with Windows 8?

=============================================<br />
I could be wrong and it certainly would not be the first time but <br />
I'm thinking you may have a hardware issue. <br />
<br />
Maybe the retailer that sold the computer or the support division <br />
of the computer manufacturer could help you.<br />

            The camera is a Canon Elph 310 and the memory card is SanDisk.&nbsp; I tried another camera and it wouldn't read that either.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did call Asus and talked to their technical help.&nbsp; Not much help there.&nbsp; It seemed like the rep was reading from a script and just
 wanted me to reinstall Windows 8.&nbsp; I can do that but it seems like an extreme step.&nbsp; It would take me hours to reload all the programs.&nbsp; I also had a problem with my automatic back up with Windows 8.&nbsp; I had to buy a separate program called Acronis to get that
 to work.

<h2>            Windows 10 blue screen issue</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1(worked fine), now I'm faced with the issue of Multiple blue screens a day and a collection of pictures of my blue screens. I've gone to far lengths to fix it nothing has worked. Every blue screen is a new
 error. Before upgrading it said my PC was compatible. Reformatting twice and still facing the issue. All drivers that I can find are up to date.</p>
<p>Looking at the minidumps through Blue screen view the programs causing the issues are NETIO.SYS, ntoskrnl.exe, nvlddmkm.sys, tcpip.sys, lltdido.sys, dxgmms2.sys, and mfewfpk.sys. This is after reformatting.</p>

            Searched online, and found the answer! Removed my wife's name from my contacts list, and my name from her contacts list. When they were both removed, I reinstalled them both, and we both came up as online. Sent her a request, which she accepted, so everything's

            What I did, was to remove her name from my contact list, then remove my name from her contact list, When they were both removed, I did a skype search for her on my computer, and added her to my contact list again, then searched for me on her computer,
 and added it to her contact list. Then I sent her a request, which she accepted, and it seems ok now. Hope this works for you.<br />

The only options I have are the slide transitions, which are displayed in the left top hand corner when the slide show is playing.</p>
<p>How can I adjust the order and transition time between photos? Right clicking during the slide show doesn't do anything either!<br />

<h2>            Windows update on new Windows 7 install not working.</h2>
                    <p>I have multiple hard drives in a custom built PC and installed Windows 7 on my smaller SSD mainly so I can play Fallout 3 (cannot get it to work in Windows 10@#$%). Everything works fine but Windows Update just runs and runs. I try downloading standalone
 updates, and they just run and run with the message 'Looking for updates on this PC." My Win7 Home Premium install package had SP1 on it. I even tried the KB3125574 combined update and it said it was not applicable to my PC. From what I gather, MS does not
 pay much attention to their Win7 update servers anymore, but I would appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Here are a couple of things to try:</p>
<p>1. Go to Control Panel &gt; All Control Panel Items &gt; Autoplay and you will be able to change your preferences.</p>
<p>2. Click the Windows Orb (Start), type regedit, press Enter and in the left pane navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Cdrom. In the right pane there will be a value called Autorun, double-click it and change the value to 1. To
 be safe, create a system restore point first.</p>

<h2>            Getting Windows 10 to recognize programs previously installed on another hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I moved a hard drive (containing programs and data) to a new computer with Windows 10, already installed.&nbsp;The computer boots from the new hard drive (C:), but I would like to run the applications from the older (D:) drive. Is there any way to get Windows
 10 to run the files on&nbsp;D:?&nbsp; When I try it says I am missing the .dll files. Can I just copy these files to the corresponding system folder on drive C:?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way...the older hard drive was running Windows 10, but was having intermittent boot failures (grrr...) . My computer tech said the only way to correct the problem was to do a clean install of Windows 10 (including reformatting the disk - thereby losing
 all the data and programs). After discussing the options it was cheaper to move the hard drive to the new computer. The good news is that the data and programs on the old drive were intact.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the query, please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>1. When you say "files", are you referring to programs/applications?</p>
<p>2. When you say boot failures, do you receive any error message?</p>
<p>3. Are you trying to directly copy the program/application files to C: drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, I would suggest you to first uninstall all the programs/applications from the current driver and then re-install and choose the drive you would like to save the file in or run from. Copying the files directly to a new drive could cause issue with
 the file and may not work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance. </p>

 down and then restart on its own. Instead, the computer would hang indefinitely (hours).&nbsp;I had to shut the computer down and&nbsp;restart it manually. The computer eventually made it through a rather maddening installation process.&nbsp;All the application programs
 worked fine. I keep my computer on at all times - though it drops into sleep mode automatically.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>The problem comes when power is lost, or a program installation requires a reboot, e.g. Norton Utilities. Nine times out of ten, the boot process failed, leading to a black screen. No combination of key strokes seemed to make a difference (including those
 that were supposed to start the computer in safe mode). I would have to shut the computer down and restart MANY times. This seemed to get me by until last week when, after a power failure (not storm related), the computer refused to boot. I did all kinds of
 hardware checks to see if a component had gone bad - cables, monitor, CMOS, CMOS battery, RAM, hard drive, etc. All components checked out just fine.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>When I took it to a computer repair place, the technician said that he had encountered this problem many times before, and that the only thing that seemed to help was to do a "clean install" of Windows 10, which required reformatting the hard drive. I told
 him that I had important data on the hard drive that I could not afford to lose. He removed the hard drive from the old computer and put it in a new computer with Windows 10 already installed. I was able to move all my data to the new hard drive, but all my
 applications are on the older drive. </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstalling the applications is easier said than done. For example, Microsoft Office was preinstalled on my first computer (no disks for reinstallation). Most of the rest of my programs were downloaded (again no installation disks). And no...I did not write
 down the product keys for all of those programs.&nbsp; So now I am left with a computer with two hard drives. A working version of Windows 10 on one hard drive, and a corrupted version of Windows 10 on the second drive. I have copied all my data files to the new
 hard drive,&nbsp;but all my programs are on the drive with the failed Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>What I would really like to do is to reinstall Windows 10 on the first hard drive where my programs are, and put the hard drive back into my original computer. Can you help?</p>

            <p>Here is my situation and how I am handling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer (self build)</p>
<p>C: SSD 128 GB (Windows 10 OS)</p>
<p>D: 500 GB (Program Files, Program Files (86)</p>
<p>E: DVD R</p>
<p>F: 500 GB (User (Documents, Downloads, Pictures, Video, ETC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded the SSD from 128 GB to 480</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed Windows 10 fresh and then Mapped the users files to F: (right clicking the Icons and changing the c:\user\Kevin\Documents to f:\user\Kevin\Documents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the Program Files - I was also unsure how to do this and so I just copied the both the Program Files folders (Program Files, Program Files (86)) to the D: Drive. I then opened each folder and opened the application and launched the application and
 reinstalled to the directory it was in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then copied from the old drive the pasted over the new installation. Some went well others not so much. I just reinstalled the ones that failed and then moved only some of the files and folders (checked the programs website, support and forums to find
 the right files and folders to move).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is the best solution I found so far.</p>

            <p>Programs should always be installed on C since they write registry keys that integrate themselves into the OS until they are properly uninstalled, hence should remain a part of the System Image.&nbsp; There are endless consequences with failing to do so which
 have come up regularly over the past seven years during which time I've helped over a hundred thousand in forums.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The proper way to remedy this is to reinstall the programs to C where they belong.&nbsp; Moving Program Files or Data should never a solution because it brings with it a whole new set of unintended consequences.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If space is an issue (which you seem to have remedied by upping the SSD size) then you can move files off since they do not benefit as much from the speed and necessity of having the Programs on C.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand you feel you've found a solution to your problem but others need to know the Best Practice so they don't go awry.&nbsp;

            <p>With all due respect if your drivers exist on your computer then you are not having the same problem I am. As you can see my issue has not been resolved yet. I suggest starting a fresh thread for your own issue as it differs from mine and any answer to your

            <p>Thanks, but it doesn't really help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to settings I haven't got a home group because my connection is set to public. I have tried to correct using various 'fixes' but so far no luck. I also find Networks settings says I am not connected to a Network. Here again I have looked at various
 methods of resolving this to no effect. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The grey pane on the bottom left hand of the screen in Windows 10 'Search the web and Windows' has consistently said 'we can't connect to the web right now'. Currently I am using Chrome which works as does Explorer. I checked using the 'scannow' command
 and it reported that no corrupt files were found but the Windows start panel has also started playing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm considering reverting to windows 7. I really don't have time for this. Microsoft should be on top of issues with their free upgrade. Without Cortana (deliberately left out) and Edge (which doesn't work now) Windows 10 is just a restrictive straitjacket.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you face this issue randomly or while running some specific application?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you receive any error message when the computer shuts down?</p>
<p><b>Disable automatic restart and check for the error message.

<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Navigate to the Control Panel in Windows XP by left-clicking on Start, followed by Settings and then choosing Control Panel.</p>

            If you are seeing messages that XP is logging you off and saving your settings, etc.,&nbsp; your system is not crashing, nor are you getting a BSOD, nor is your system overheating.&nbsp; Those conditions are not that polite.<br />
<br />
Do try those Microsoft Support Engineer ideas, but that doesn't sound like it will help you based on your description.<br />
