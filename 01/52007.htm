<h2>            Can I have the Windows 7 start button for Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>- I am operating windows 8 on a desktop machine.</p>
<p>- the new start button may be ok for a tablet but just sucks for a desktop and my laptop.</p>
<p>- Is anyone at Microsoft listening to their customers? Can I have my windows 7 start button back?</p>
<p>- Is there a way to modify the new start button in any settings to make it the same as windows 7</p>
<p>- I am ready to pay to UPGRADE to windows 7 for efficiency reasons</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>any assistance would be greatly appreciated.</p>

    <title>can&#39;t open app store on local kids account &#40;family safety - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            can&#39;t open app store on local kids account &#40;family safety monitored&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I set up a couple of kids accounts (monitored by family safety). I wanted to keep the accounts out of the cloud, which is why I set them up without a Windows Live ID. Now I'm facing the following challenges, and I'm not sure what they are related to:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>When accessing the app store, it quickly opens up to the green background, but immediately closes again. My intention was to log in with my credentials so I can get them the apps needed, but then log out again. (Don't want them to download from the app
 store generally)<br />
</li><li>Tried to open computer settings from the charms bar when in the kids account, and the same thing happens. Quickly opens, just to immediately close again.
<br />
</li></ul>
<p>Btw, under family safety I allowed the kids access to all programs on the computer, so that really shouldn't be the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.<br />
</p>

From your issue description I understand that you are not able to access windows apps on windows 8 computer.</p>
</span>&nbsp;
<p><span>In order to help you better please provide us the following information:<br />
1) Do you get any error message when you try to access Windows store?</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like you have limited the access level on the apps and windows store using family and safety option on the kids account. I would request you to login to administrator
 account and then try to open Windows store and check, it should work.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Reset Store Cache.</span></p>
<p><span>A. Press the “Win Logo” + “R”</span></p>

            Sorry for the late reply - I have been traveling.<br />
<br />
So I figured out that the problem is broader. I deleted the kids account and created them new - this time logging them in with a Windows Live ID. Now, some programs work (for example Music or Bing), while others open, just to immediately close again (e.g. Travel,
 Weather, Photos).<br />
<br />
I double checked that I allowed access to all these programs under Family Safety.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />

<br />
I tried both of these methods, but still doesn't work. I don't get an error message when opening the apps. Instead, they swivel open to full screen, just to immediately close again. Very frustrating.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Home Edition - Change User Account Name - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home Edition - Change User Account Name</h2>
                    <p>During the initial setup of Windows I chose a user account name, Fred. Of course this account was administrator. I then thought that I should use a non Admin account for everyday stuff and perhaps be more resistant to malicious attacks that might make major
 changes to my pc.</p>
<p>My first move was to change the admin user name from Fred to 'Admin' via control panel - no problem so far. My next step was to go to Settings/Accounts/Family &amp; other users/Add someone else to this PC/I don't have this person's sign in information/Add a
 user withiut a Microsoft account/</p>
<p>In the usernname box I typed 'Fred' then got a red message "Please type a different username". I rebooted the pc but got the same result after trying again. This simple looking task is not so simple after all. Any advice will be appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;urge you to create 2 new password-protected Admin-level <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
local</span> user accounts that are additional to the user accounts you intend to use for day-to-day computer tasks&nbsp;[poss called TechAdmin, ReserveAdmin] &amp; write their passwords down somewhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any account can suffer from user profile corruption.&nbsp; This can ultimately stop you being able to log in to an account.&nbsp; If that happens to your only Admin-level account on the computer then you are completely locked out of the computer.&nbsp; You cannot even
 run Dell's factory restore procedure as that insists on an Admin account login.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea of creating two additional accounts is to </p>
<ul>
<li>use one of them for authorising installations etc &amp; for fixing problems on the computer but otherwise not using it [and thereby protecting it from user profile corruption]</li><li>keep the other in reserve unused so that you know for certain that its profile cannot get corrupted &amp; that you will therefore always have an Admin account you can fall back on to rescue the computer from problems.</li></ul>

    <title>power surge on usb hub port windows 7 pc - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            power surge on usb hub port  windows 7 pc</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
A couple of days ago I reinstalled my windows 7 on my PC and then I installed my soft wares, games and such. So I was playing a game and my mouse and keyboard freezed and were malfunctioned. So I got out of the game somehow and I saw a notification which said
 ''power surge on hub port'' and when I moved my mouse I could hear a Bip and when I clicked on the notification a window was opened and asked me to reinstall the USB ports. This issue is really annoying and I can't get anything right anymore. Is this problem
 connected to my hardware or my software? I think you should know this too that my iPod weren't recognized by itunes either and I did some of the things which were told on apple.com and I thought maybe it's connected to the problem.

<h3> dogememes  say:</h3>
<h2>            blue screen of death &#40;the one with the sad face&#41;</h2>
                    <p>so ever since i upgraded from windows 7 to windows 10 i have been having a big problem with the bsod error. whenever i get a bsod it is always when i am playing my games, anything else is fine. each time i get a bsod i take a picture so i have the error
 that went wrong. whenever i search it up they all seem to lead to a driver issue. when i go into device manager it says all the drivers are working fine. so i sitting here not knowing what the **** is going on. i also recently reformatted my hard driver hoping
 it would fix this issue but it did not which i knew it wouldn't fix it but i got a new ssd so i kinda had to(not really). people have told me to post a dump file here so you guys can see what is going on but i dont know how to get a dump file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i am asked for the message(s) that i get from the bsod i will gladly give it to you but it would be a long list. what i want to know is if a component of my computer (hardware) is causing this i thought maybe it could be my RAM because i would get page
 errors with the bsod but every time its different. i think, from what i know that it couldn't be a hardware issue because if i reformatted my hard drive then whatever was causing it would be gone unless i downloaded whatever it was the caused it (bsod). at
 the same time it could be a software issue because if i never had a problem with this when i was on windows 7 and my computer ran . i am leaning more towards software issue just because that seems like the more logical answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if any of you are woundering i have an AMD cpu and AMD graphics card. i dont know why but i feel like its an AMD driver that is causing this issue but its a computer so it could be anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so to recap i have a very seorus issue with these bsod errors thats needs to be fixed becaue i paided good money for this computer and i want to play my games on it not look at a blue screen with a sad face on it telling me my computer is garbage and that
 these things called a "dump file" can help figure out the cause of this. so if you now how to fix it or find out how to fix it then please tell me because i want to play my games that i paid money for and i dont want the money to go to waste. i am sorry that
 this is a &nbsp;very long post its just this damn blue screen of death error thing is getting out of control.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you are facing in Windows regarding the Bluescreen issue. We will help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I suggest you to answer the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Which driver did you trying to update or install recently?</li></ol>
<p>A blue screen error (also called a stop error) can occur if a problem causes your PC to shut down or restart unexpectedly or due to incorrect installation of the drivers. When you experience this type of error, you won’t be able to see things like the Start
 menu or the taskbar on the screen when your PC is turned on. Instead you might see a blue screen with a message that your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to refer the below link and <strong>check if it helps resolving the issue regarding the Blue screen error.</strong></p>

<strong><span>chipset drivers </span></strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>This issue could also be caused due to outdated Basic Input Output system (BIOS) or chipset drivers.</span></span></p>

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Visit the manufacturer's website and look for the<strong> BIOS

<p>I have a program which allows me to use the mouse and arrow keys in the screen saver. However, if I try to do the same, Windows immediately goes back to the login screen. Is there any way to use the arrow keys and mouse in a screen saver without exiting
 the screen saver? Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hello umangs94,<br />
<br />
Then I would suggest posting to the <a href="http://www.boinc-wiki.info/Special:AWCforum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
forums there</a> and discuss why the software that they have provided for you is not functioning properly. I can only go by what they have stated on there website for the screen saver.
<br />
<br />
Hope this helps

            Try upgrading your display driver.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

            Hi  Walter,
<br />
<br />You should either roll back or update your Intel HD Graphics device driver to resolve these crashes . .. 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

            If disabling works, probably your inbuilt graphics device has burnt/developed defects. I suggest you to take it to a repair shop.

            Hello Rhino,<br />
<br />
I checked for drivers for your device and found that&nbsp;support was discontinued (mostly because of a law suit).&nbsp; You will be hard pressed to get the controller to work on the newer Windows without paying for some 3rd party software.&nbsp; This would be a good time
 to upgrade your controller if for no order reason than to have a controller that will work with current and newer Windows.
<hr />
I hold to a simple philosophy: just assume everyone's a piece of ____ and then be pleasantly surprised if you find anyone who ain't.

<p>Hiya Khang,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Forum support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When redeeming content always make sure you're signed into the correct account on all devices.</p>
<p>(make sure it didn't get redeemed to the wrong account)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try checking your <a href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Order History</a> on your account (the one on the console) and make sure it was redeemed to that account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the content was redeemed to the wrong account, then try to set your other account as the
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Home Console</a>.</p>
<p>(unfortunately, codes cannot be removed from one account to another) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            windows update troubleshooter finds same issues twice in 24 hours</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I was running various troubleshooters to try to maintain my PC at optimum performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Update troubleshooter was one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I had never received error messages when updating, and didn't have any other issues, the troubleshooter found many errors and fixes, and completed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I ran it again, and it found the same issues again, and fixed them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What gives?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>I have come to the conclusion that the find and fix tool is working correctly, and that it simply goes through the same steps because it is working from the implied understanding that the windows update service is having problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have no problem if you want to mark this thread as resolved.</p>

<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/c675b7b8-795f-474d-a1c4-6b77b3fcd990</span></a><br />
<br />
=============================================================<br />
<br />
The most common cause of this Bug_Check is lack of System Memory. Possibly some of the system<br />
memory is not being recognized - such as 4 GB showing as 3 GB as 2 GB or 2 GB as 1 GB and other<br />
possible combinations. Added there could be memory controller and other hardware issues which<br />
are affecting the memory pool. If you just do not have much memory then you will need to add more<br />
or replace some as a test.<br />
<br />
<strong>Bug Check 0x34: CACHE_MANAGER<br />
</strong><br />
The CACHE_MANAGER bug check has a value of 0x00000034. This indicates that a problem occurred in the file system's cache manager.</p>
<p><strong>Important Information If You Have Received a STOP Code<br />
<br />
</strong>If you have received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact information for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Contact
 Support</span></a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article&nbsp;<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Resolving STOP (Blue
 Screen) Errors in Windows</span></a>.</p>
<p>The following actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<p>1.Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.<br />
2.Scan your computer for computer viruses.<br />
3.Check your hard disk for errors.<br />
<br />
<strong>CACHE_MANAGER Parameters<br />
<br />
</strong>The following parameters are displayed on the blue screen.</p>
<p>Parameter Description <br />
<br />
1&nbsp; Specifies source file and line number information. The high 16 bits (the first four hexadecimal digits after the "0x") identify the source file by its identifier number. The low 16 bits identify the source line in the file where the bug check occurred.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2, 3, &amp; 4&nbsp; Reserved</p>
<p><strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>One possible cause of this bug check is depletion of nonpaged pool memory. If the nonpaged pool memory is completely depleted, this error can stop the system. However, during the indexing process, if the amount of available nonpaged pool memory is very low,
 another kernel-mode driver requiring nonpaged pool memory can also trigger this error.</p>
<p><strong>Resolution</strong></p>
<p>To resolve a nonpaged pool memory depletion problem: Add new physical memory to the computer. This will increase the quantity of nonpaged pool memory available to the kernel.<br />
<br />

    <title>Office 2007 limited functionality and printer disabled under new - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike &#40;roborant survivor&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Office 2007 limited functionality and printer disabled under new Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Microsoft Community.&nbsp; Events in order of occurrence; questions below that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>I installed the Office2007 updates offered through the Microsoft site onto my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; I had some trouble entering my product key, and couldn't seem to&nbsp;eliminate the 'invalid product key' message from&nbsp;Microsoft.&nbsp;
</li><li>After the update, Word2007 now asks if I will allow 'changes to the hard drive on this computer' each time it starts, and functionality seems limited.</li><li>Weeks later, I responded to the Microsoft offer of 'free Windows 10' and installed the operating system.</li><li>During install, Microsoft offered Office365 2013&nbsp;free to students.&nbsp; I am a student, so I&nbsp;installed this also, thinking that it might solve my problems with Word 2007.</li><li>Windows 10 worked well, as did Office Word 2013.&nbsp; I edited and printed school assignments easily.</li><li>After 3 days of use, however,&nbsp;Windows 10 disabled my Lexmark P707 printer driver and announced that it could no longer find my printer.</li><li>I contacted Microsoft support, and they told me I was not eligible for Office365.</li><li>I uninstalled Office365 even though the IT tech at my school said I was eligible.</li><li>I attempted to&nbsp;re-install the Lexmark printer&nbsp;driver, but&nbsp;found it to be 'not supported' under Win
 the dealership come to my home and steal the car's engine.</li><li>I contacted Microsoft support again, they established a LogMeIn session and told me the problem with Office 2007 was fixed, but Word2007 continues with only&nbsp;limited function and still asks to 'change hard drive' on startup, and my operating system refuses
 to identify my printer even though said operating system used it for several days.</li></ol>
<p>My questions to the Microsoft Community are as follows:&nbsp; </p>
<ul>
<li>Is Microsoft in the business of cluttering landfills to boost printer sales?</li><li>Is Windows 10 coded to identify and eliminate specific&nbsp;printers as it did in my case?</li><li>If Windows 10 selectively eliminates drivers and disables consumer equipment, how is this action different from having a thief break into my house and steal my printer?</li><li>If retroactive compatibility is now 'coded out' of the MS operating system in the interest of competitive advantage, has Microsoft simply ignored the impact on end consumers so that it can kick Lexmark to the curb?</li></ul>
<p>My "free Windows 10" upgrade seems to work well - I like it.&nbsp; My "free Office365 2013" is uninstalled per Microsoft's orders.&nbsp; My Lexmark P707 printer sits idle, little green 'ready' light glowing - useless.&nbsp; I cannot seem to identify the printer thief,
 Microsoft.</p>

            <p>Thanks, but I discovered that Windows 10 simply refuses to use any driver for my printer.&nbsp; It begins to look as if Win10 is doing what it thinks is best for Microsoft and methodically reversing changes I makes as a user.</p>
<p>A change as simple as attaching msn.com to my favorites bar disappeared overnight.&nbsp; I installed an old game from my original disk, played it a few times, and the next day, my installation was simply&nbsp;gone as if it had never been installed.</p>
<p>I have considered trying to roll the operating system back to Win7, but I'll need to get a memory stick and back up&nbsp;before I do that.</p>
<p>Word 2007 remains as it was prior to the Microsoft fix that didn't work.&nbsp; It still asks me to approve changes to my computer when it starts, and I assume it has limited functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I begin to wonder if the Windows 10 operating system has routines that dedicate themselves to screwing up a computer once it has identified what it sees as a "software thief."&nbsp; Currently, with disappearing changes, limited Word functionality, and a printer
 that has literally been stolen from me by Microsoft Corporation, I am&nbsp;displeased with your "free upgrade to Windows 10."&nbsp; I may consider a move to an Apple computer, but only after your company steps up and resolves this issue in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return my held-hostage printer to me.&nbsp; It is clear Win10 can use it but chooses not to do so.</li><li>Restore Word2007 functionality.&nbsp; I've been punished enough for&nbsp;a 25-character keystroke mistake.</li><li>Either have Win10 stop reversing&nbsp;changes I make to the computer and un-installing&nbsp;software&nbsp;I own, or contact me and let's&nbsp;restore Win7.</li></ul>
<p>If your Windows 10 development team thinks it has successfully programmed "justice" into this new operating system, you might want to have&nbsp;them run a test and see what happens if they miss a product key.&nbsp; I'm still emailing my Word documents to another computer
 for&nbsp;printing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This problem occurs because Windows Vista does not support the installation of kernel mode printer drivers. Windows Vista only supports the installation
 of user mode printer drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the instructions below which might help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if your printer is compatible with Vista.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Error message when you try to connect to a shared printer in Windows Vista: "The printer driver is not compatible with a policy enabled on your computer
 that blocks NT 4.0 drivers"</span></p>

 however, i dont seem to be able to find KODAK ESP9 on the compatibility link you've given to me (though ESP3,5,and 7 are all there) im not sure why this is the case..
<br />
<br />
when I called kodak (three times), they have always told me that this printer is compatible with my computer (after giving them the details)...<br />
<br />
my CPU is 32bit.. i dont' know if this makes a difference or not as when i called Sony, they said it did...<br />
<br />
as for method two.. i do not understand what it means by trying to install a user mode printer driver on the Windows NT 4.0-based computer....<br />

    <title>Brand new xbox one makes loud noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maatzy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brand new xbox one makes loud noise</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.<br />
<br />
I got myself a brand new xbox one on friday, which was the scandinavian release date.<br />
I preordered the one without kinect, which came with forza 5 and fifa 15.<br />
When I came home and turned it on, it started making a weird noise.<br />
<br />
The problem occurs all the time, except when playing games.&nbsp;<br />
So I need to listen to this annoying sound whenever I want to watch netflix, youtube or just stay at dashboard talking to friends in a party f.example.<br />
<br />
And the worst part about this?<br />
I ran over this topic today, and read trough all the 30 pages (and counting) of people having exactly the same problem as me.<br />
The saddest part about this is that its obviously been going on for a very long time now, and microsoft seems to not give an answer to the problem and what causes it. They simply just tell people to send their console in for a fix, but I don't want to send
 back a brand new console that I just got when I don't even know the problem.<br />
<br />
Here's link to the topic about this, I suggest you to read it:<br />
http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/t/1805665.aspx?pi7962=32<br />
There's also some links to youtube videos showing the sound, and how loud it is.<br />
<br />
So I decided to make a new topic, as the other one got marked "answered" and will most likely not get a response anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Im asking you Microsoft/Xbox team, please make a solution for this or at least give us information so we know what causes this and if it will damage our xbox somehow in the future like the red ring of death on the 360.<br />
<br />
I do NOT want to switch to PS4 (which I feel forced to do right now, if there's no solution for this) when I've been playing on xbox since the 360 came out.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>This is hardly consolation, but I'm also in sweden and got mine on friday. I immediately noticed the sound and went back with it on saturday. They told me they couldn't process a return (some temp guys or summat there on a saturday, I guess), and asked me
 to come back on monday. I still intend to do so, but after playing a ton of Killer instinct for maybe five hours or something on saturday, the noise has actually subsided even when I'm in the dashboard/in standby. It's gone from being a constant crackling/hard
 drive-esque noise, to sporadic, feint ticking. Like a clock, but irregular and faster.</p>
<p>I dunno if the problem disappears entirely with use. I'm still set to swap it for a replacement on monday, and if that isn't dead silent at the outset, I may just keep it around for Horizon 2's release at the end of october, and see if the noise problem
 irons itself out completely. If it doesn't, I'll just follow the suggestion by the MS lady in the other thread and send it in for repairs.</p>
<p>I, too, am extremely curious to know what this is about, though. Coil whine, some say, but it really doesn't sound like any coil whine I've heard. It's way too easy on the whine, for one.</p>
<p>Either way; sucks to hear you're having the problem. I hope it all gets resolved and laid bare sooner rather than later. In the meantime I'm trying to get Microsoft's attention about the fact that tier 2 countries can't access the full Killer Instinct game,
 nor a number of other games and pieces of DLC. This launch isn't exactly sunshine and bouncy castles in any regard. Except maybe if the sun is shining and you happen to have a bouncy castle.</p>

<p>I have to turn the volume so high when watching netflix to avoid the noise.</p>
<p>@SimonM7 I'll probably send it back for a fix too, but I didn't expect this to happen to a next gen console so long after launch date and it had to happen now that so many good games coming out right..?</p>

<p>I have the same problem here. Got my Xbone on saturday. The scandinavian version with no Kinect and bundled with Forza5 and Fifa15.</p>
<p>Crackling noize in stand-by and dashboard.</p>
<p>I have played some Forza5, aka trying to reproduce the solution from SimonM7 but I have noticed any changes.
</p>
<p>I will swap mine trough my retailer (Elkjøp in Norway) but I will try and get them to hook it up in the store and test the new one(s) before I accept the exchange</p>

<p>@Thorgrak I saw the topic, it's frustrating that they wont give an answer.</p>
<p>@Krefal Yes, I got the noise while in stand-by mode too.</p>
<p>It's sad since I really wanted that feature, instead of using power saving mode or whatever it's called.</p>
<p>I got mine from Gamestop in Norway, and I called them on saturday.</p>
<p>The answer I got was that I had to deliver it to microsoft, I couldn't get an exchange from them.</p>
<p>Which I should, or? Well, it probably just waste of time as most of them got the noise anyway.</p>

<p>Because I called them, the guy at Gamestop said that he couldn't help me and I don't understand why.</p>

    <title>PC Settings in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            PC Settings in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Well, I've moved to an SSD a couple days ago, and installed Windows 8 so I could upgrade to Windows 10. I've noticed that I can't change my PC Settings using the app, or even run it, as a window pops up for a second and then closes without displaying any
 information. </p>
<p>There seem to be several different threads with the same topic, but none that have a solution, and quite a few with posters asking for clarification on the topic and not returning with a solution. I assume that there's no official fix out for it yet, and
 that Microsoft may eventually issue an update to fix the problem, but if not, I'd like to not start installing programs if I'll have to switch back to Windows 7 or 8 until it's fixed.
</p>
<p>I've tried many different possible solutions from different threads, including sifting through a huge list of .dlls in command prompt, using the fix it programs, and restarting services to no avail. I have noticed that there are a few errors in the CBS logs,
 and researching the codes leads me to believe that there's a problem with Windows Update, perhaps if it was corrupted or missing.</p>
<p>I am running a fresh install of Windows 10, with only the compatible Windows 10 drivers off Lenovo's website, as well as a handful of programs. I'm not really attached to the files, so I could potentially just reinstall, but the time it takes to create installation
 media, install drivers, and reinstall programs is actually pretty sizable, so I'm really hoping that I can avoid that.</p>
<p>I've attached the logs for clarity, and if anyone can offer some insight into this problem, I'd appreciate it.

            <p>Hello, and thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I am using the sole account on the computer, but made sure to restart anyway to see if&nbsp; that would be any help.</p>
<p>I have indeed tried running a system file check in command prompt, which spat out a log that I have included in my original post. I've sifted through it and noticed that there were several errors detailed in it, but the repair function was unable to resolve
 them.</p>
<p>I've resorted to doing a clean install of Win 10, and sure enough, that did fix the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks for the support along the way.</p>
