<h2>            Dolby Atmos on Xbox and Samsung TV</h2>
                    I have an xbox one s, Samsung un65mu800D, and an LG SK9Y soundbar.&nbsp; The xbox is connected to the tv over hdmi. The tv is then connected to the sound bar through hdmi arc.&nbsp; When I try to enable Dolby Atmos on the xbox, it gives me an error.&nbsp; When I set
 the video to hdmi hdmi instead of auto detect and activate Dolby Atmos, it works, but when I go into the tv sound settings, dolby digital + is grayed out.

<p>If you backed up all your data before you installed Windows XP, or you do not have any data that you must keep, you can reformat the hard disks in the computer and reinstall Windows 95, Windows 98 or Windows Millennium Edition. For more information, see
 the "Removing NTFS" section.</p>

            <p>Secure boot is a feature of the UEFI install only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did this occur after Anniversary Update? Something must have set your UEFI settings to boot incorrectly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type MSINFO in Start Search, in System Information what is BIOS type?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the SATA controller driver installed in Device Manager? There are reports that install of MSAHCI SATA driver can toggle UEFI settings which is being investigated now.

<p>Hi Ken, thanks for the reply- I am using the software that came with the system... Windows XP Home addition.&nbsp; It is the the CD writing/burning wizard that comes standard with this operating system.&nbsp; The interesting thing is when I right click the drive and
 look at the disk space... it's indicating no space available which cannot be since the disk is blank and recordable.&nbsp; Can you help?</p>
<p>Thanks Joe</p>

<p>Ken,</p>
<p>I have a similar problem - Windows XP Home Ed. - gives me a message "Cannot Complete the CD writing Wizard"..."There is an error in the writing process..."&nbsp; I can make CD's using Photoshop and used to be able to make CDs of Word documents but no more.&nbsp; I
 checked Disc Cleanup and Defrag to make sure there was enough room, went out and bought new Sony CDs.&nbsp; I can't figure this out.&nbsp; Many times Real Player opens when I'm trying to copy to a CD so I've uninstalled it, but it didn't help.</p>
<p>Please help -surely it's a simple fix?&nbsp; If it can copy using Photoshop then the hardward must work?</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have found two articles that may tweak your attention, Read these and try the steps listed in here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/324129</a></p>

<p>The article above ^^ points out something interesting. In order to burn a cd, windows will make a mirror image of that list and you will need 1 Gigabyte plus of space availible on your hardrive. Does your hardrive have about&nbsp;2 gigs of space left?</p>

<p>You <strong>may </strong>consider the following freeware program for Microsoft XP:<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a>
<br />
<br />
I originally started using it because I needed to burn ISO Images like Open SusE 11.2 or Fedora Core to CD prior to installation and have found that ImgBurn has worked wonderfully for me ever since. I must warn you, however, that this program is FreeWare so
 it is hard to tell what the risks are. My computer <strong>"seems"</strong> to be okay...</p>

HAHA, I know what you mean XD. If you get to thinking about though the entire UNIX language is a bit funny in itself though. Although, I find Unix to be an easier edit than most of the other languages out there... &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p>But I'm a rare breed, so it may just be me.</p>

<p>It makes me nervous to use freware that you don't feel absolutely sure of --I've got enough problems just trying to burn a CD.&nbsp; Adding other problems because I've downloaded something with "kinks" makes me very nervous.</p>
<p>Isn't there something else I could use to fix this problem.</p>
<p>I've deleted some programs that I haven't used in a long time hoping to create enough open space for the CD process to work, but still it's not cooperating.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

<p>Give me the EXACT name of the program and I will see if I can find a patch, or place you can redownload it, and as for trusting, freeware. If you are worried about security use these THREE FREE. Virus, spyware and Malware, detectors. ONE is from microsoft,
 so you cannot go wrong with these.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></p>
<p>This will check for malware, AND registry key errors, or so most of the forums say. &gt;.&gt;</p>
<p><a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://superantispyware.com/</span></a></p>
<p>You can download the free version and it will check for spyware as well.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</span></a></p>
<p>This is a free all in one program, but I still reccomend the other two.</p>

<blockquote>If you get to thinking about though the entire UNIX language is a bit funny in itself though.<br />

<p>Chaos, you are a clever kid, but I wouldn't nececarilly refer to UNIX as a language.&nbsp; UNIX is a scientific/academic orientated Operating System designed for large scale multitasking that is typically implemented in the C Programming Language.&nbsp; I believe
 much of the technology that appeard in MS Windows, appears in UNIX first.&nbsp; Examples of technology in MS Windows that appeared in UNIX first are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Multitasking </li><li>Virtual Memory </li><li>Sockets </li><li>3D Acceleration (Open GL [A predecessor to DirectX] </li><li>GUI (X Windows) </li></ol>
<p>Some advantages of UNIX over MS Windows are:</p>
<ol>
<li>UNIX is REALLY hard to infect with a virus so most UNIX users don't even run Anti-Virus software</li><li>UNIX puts XP User Switching to shame.&nbsp; </li><li>Almost all UNIX OSes come with a FREE professional C Compiler (With Microsoft, you have to pay $800 to get Visual C++ Professional [1])</li><li>It is easy to get professional quality Version Control Software setup on UNIX, but with Microsoft, you often have to pay big bucks for these features.</li><li>Professional quality Open Source freeware is much more available for UNIX than it is for Microsoft.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Some disadvantages of UNIX compared to MS Windows are:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is often harder to find a driver for UNIX than it is to find one for MS Windows.</li><li>Professional Audio Support is much better in MS Windows than it is in UNIX.&nbsp; There is no ProLogic, Cakewalk or Cubase for Solaris or Linux; however, there is Cubase and LogicStudio for MacOS, but Macs are horribly expensive.&nbsp;</li></ol>
Given the immense advantages of Linux/UNIX over Microsoft, I sometimes wonder why I even think about using overpriced Microsoft software.&nbsp; I guess I'm restrained by religious reasons.&nbsp; I don't like the name that UNIX uses for background drivers and I prefer
 the name that Microsoft uses; however, there are rare occasions when Microsoft uses the same terminology that UNIX does for background drivers, so I guess my whole reason for staying with Microsoft is pointless...&nbsp; I just wish I could get Stallman to agree
 with me...
<p>[1] - This is a huge beef of mine especially since Microsoft won't be releasing a standard edition of Visual Studio 2010.</p>

<p>Why don't you try getting another HD and running Ubuntu, Redhat?&nbsp;or one of the MANY other linux programs out there?</p>
<p>____, just create a Live USB and install Puppy linux on there and boot from the USB.....</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Office files that won't open correctly using File Explorer could due to a recent update causing an app conflict or data files that got corrupted. For us to resolve your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any changes made or updates installed prior to the issue occurring?</li><li>Were there any error messages that showed up when you attempted to open the Office files using File Explorer?</li><li>Are other types of files also having the same issue when you open them using File Explorer?</li><li>When was the last time you were successfully able to open Office files using File Explorer?</li><li>Which version and build of Windows 10 is installed on your device?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response to our queries.</p>

<p>There were no changes made or updates installed prior to this issues other than regular updates to the system, at least, that I can remember.&nbsp; This problem has been occurring for as long as I can remember.&nbsp; My computer is a Dell Inspiron 5523 and it is about
 two years old.&nbsp; I do store files in the Google cloud and on the hard drive but the files location doesn't matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no error messages.&nbsp; If, for instance, I double click an Excel file, Excel will open properly but the file will not.&nbsp; After reading your message, I tested different files and realized that this only happens with Excel and not with Word, PowerPoint,
 Access or Visio.&nbsp; I don't know when the last time I was able to successfully open an Excel file from File Explorer; it probably has been a year or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Home, Version 10.0. 16299 Build 16299.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>Actually these days getting a compiler and build tools are quite accessible(for free), but the real starting point is to find good information on how to learn.&nbsp; So I'm actually going to point you at a web site that has information about learning C++.&nbsp; And
 this one actually uses the free one from Microsoft, which given that you are going to use it on Windows 10, should fit the best.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.learncpp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.learncpp.com/</a></p>

</p><p>Here is another site that talks about three sites to use to learn C++ (one of them is the above link):</p>

<h3> angra mainiiu  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does 7.1 soround sound works on xbox one&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>This particular matter has been on my mind for quite a while, actually ever since i got an xbox one i was thinking about getting a soround sound headset for it but i found out that unfortunately xbox one does not support usb headsets ( big bummer !! ) and
 the supportable number of headsets on xbox one are quite a few ! So i just ended up buying a sterio headset instead, actually i've been working with 7.1 headsets in the past and now i realize sterio ones are not nearly accurate as 7.1 headsets !&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically i've been thinking about buying a logitech g633 and it seems they only work with 3.5 mm on xbox one and as you may know the only way to use 7.1 capability on headsets is by usb or a seperate sound card( or processor or watnot). Now i've been thinking
 how exactlly can i use the 7.1 feathure of this headset on xbox one? Can i use an external sound card on xbox one and plug the headset to the sound card? Does xbox one even supports sound cards?&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do?</p>

<p>As far as utilizing the 7.1 sound goes, I went the route of getting an Astro A50 wireless headset. It comes the necessary connections to make the sounds as high quality as possible. You also have the ease of it being wireless for the kids or animals ripping
 through the house. I use it daily, I couldn't tell you if it's true 7.1, but there isn't a better sound on the market as far as a headset in my opinion.</p>

<p>I used a Razer Kraken Pro with Razer Surround Pro on my laptop for a long time and recently my laptop's become too old to play games, and with computer gaming hardware constantly changing as much as I love computer gaming I decided to sit back and wait to
 see how things go and take the opportunity to go back when I believe the time is right. Since then I started investing a lot of time into my Xbox One and been through 5 headsets Microsoft Stereo Headset, Turtle Beach XO ONE Stereo Headset, Turtle Beach XO
 FOUR Stealth Stereo Headset, Turtle Beach Stealth 500X DTS 7.1 Surround Sound, &amp; Astro A50 Limited Halo Edition Dolby Digital 7.1 Surround Sound. The Turtle Beaches are a complete joke they break easy and the sound quality especially at the first Surround
 Sound Headset Turtle Beach did for Xbox One being the Stealth 500x are a joke in themselves you almost feel like you are listening to a really badly made video game, but then you think wait a minute it's not the game it's the *** headset. &lt;(I don't watch movies
 or TV shows on my Xbox, I only play games or watch YouTube.) &nbsp;Within one month of buying them they started to crack a little on both headbands just above the ear piece. The Microsoft Stereo Headset was a lot better had good bass and you actually had to keep
 the volume down to at least 60% to avoid blowing your eardrums out, unlike the 2 other Turtle Beach headsets I tried being the XO FOUR Stealth &amp; XO ONE they were ok with the bass boost, but the volume was still very low at max. Finally after deciding I wasted
 too much time, energy, and money into Turtle Beach and Microsoft doesn't make a Surround Sound headset (yet anyway) I went with the Astro A50 Limited Halo Edition at the cost extreme cost of $300.00 plus $39.99 for extra protection and I never felt a better
 headset that sounded incredible, has great bass, treble, and feels like a pillow on my head in all my games even compared to my Razer Kraken Pro. Point of the story is if you really hate wasting money on Stereo headsets or Surround Sound headsets, but they
 sound bad or break easy just go with an Astro A50 and you won't find a better headset at least for the Xbox One, also here's the real deal breaker it's compatible with both PS4 &amp; PC as well as Xbox one, meaning one Astro A50 for all 3, the other versions are
 just for branding I think, you may have to Google instructions on how to set it up for the other two systems if you want to know more. I could be wrong, but it may work on PS3 &amp; Xbox 360 as well, You may need to buy extra adapters and what not for certain
 features to work.</p>

<p>That's my whole point ! You See the only good and reliable 7.1 ss headset on xbox one is basically just Astro a50 and that is wrong !! Avoiding the whole xbox one does not support usb headsets deal, i myself cannot get an Astro cause thay're too overpriced
 and expensive and they are not available where i live !! </p>
<p>I never tried an astro before but been working with a few razer and logitech headsets and i think logitech is alot better, they are more comfortable, have better build quality and more customisable. Now the &nbsp;logitech says the new g633 is compatible with
 xbox one but only sterio. Basically what my question is if i can make it to work soround sound on xbox one ?
</p>
<p>Have anyone ever tried using an external sound card on xbox one?</p>

<p>Well the only way that would work I can think of would be buying an Astro Mixamp Pro TR which functions as a &nbsp;external soundcard for Xbox One. Catch is you cant adjust bass &amp; treble, and can only adjust volume, chat, and an on/off for surround sound. However
 I don't use or have one so you'll have to research it, it costs $119.99 in the USA. If that won't work I don't think there is anything else you can do. You will either have to stick with Stereo or save money and maybe import an Astro if you have to.</p>

<p>Also I don't think PC external soundcards will work and since they are not licensed for Xbox One or official Xbox One hardware you could be banned as it may modify your console. Allthough I'm not sure on that last part.</p>

It also feels very nice on your ears/head and it does a great job at not letting you hear sound coming from the outside world. I recommend it.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>my Elite Pro's headband broke and I bought the Kraken Pro V2 and Arctis 3 yesterday to compare before sending Elites back for repair.&nbsp; After comparing sound (plugged into Xbox &amp; turtle beach adapter and straight into new style controller, also toying with sound settings on Xbox) I can tell you the clarity of Kraken is nowhere near Arctis 3 and far from the Elite Pro. &nbsp;Of course we're talking $75 headsets vs &nbsp;$150(on sale). Kraken are too heavy on bass and distorted when listening to exact same audio as other two. &nbsp;Arctis are just not quite as warm sounding at the Elites but clarity is good. You won't gain anything from their 5 or 7 series on Xbox. &nbsp;Arctis and Elite are way more comfy than Kraken which get hot bc of pleather ear cups which seal off tightly.</p><p><br /></p><p>Going to return Kraken and try Hyper Revolver and maybe Logitech 633's. &nbsp;Probably going to keep Arctis. &nbsp;Earcup&nbsp;on them is shallow and the top of my ear touches the speaker cov

Due to your exceptional participation in the Xbox Insider Program you've earned the ability to join Preview Alpha Skip-Ahead!

In Preview Alpha Skip-Ahead you'll be previewing advanced system updates very early — be sure to include detailed steps and information when reporting problems, and provide great feedback in the Xbox Insider Hub.

The message was sent on 6/22/2018 and I came home about a week ago. It would be a shame if I can no longer join.</p>

    <title>Copy and replace all selected files by default - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoff budd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Copy and replace all selected files by default</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I want to copy files to my backup drive, I always get prompted for either "Copy and Replace", "Don't Copy", or "Copy but keep both files".</p>
<p>This is fine as it's a good safety feaure.</p>
<p>However, if I want to copy a number of files at once, I also have to tick the box "Do this for the next x conflicts" (where x is one less than the number of files I am copying).</p>
<p>As I always want to copy and replace all the chosen files is there a way of setting the default to always copy and replace all the selected files - that is to effectively have the "Do this for the next x conflicts" box already ticked?&nbsp; It's just a nuisance
 having to keep ticking that box every time.</p>
<p>Many thanks to anyone who can help.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not possible to change any default settings. You may search for some third Party programs that could accomplish this however.

<h2>            My Documents, Music and Pictures are not appearing, although they are still in the folder</h2>
                    Hi here's my situation:<br />
<br />
I run a Dell XPS, Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I caught some stupid virus off youtube (I think it was the audiosrv or FakeAgent) and promptly reset back to a previous restore point.<br />
<br />
When I rebooted, the documents, music files and pictures I had in those folders no longer appeared.<br />
<br />
However, they ARE still in the folder.&nbsp; When I click on properties, the music folder for instance still has 13.5 GB in it, and when I open up iTunes the music still plays.&nbsp; Obviously they are being masked by something.&nbsp; Toggling the hidden folders option does
 nothing.<br />
<br />
When I ran Malwarebytes, absolutely nothing came up (in both normal mode and safe mode)<br />
<br />
I've also run Spyware Doctor and there is a rootkit that appears; I've deleted it, ran another scan on restarting and it appears again, so there's something else going on.<br />
<br />
Most programs seem to work fine (internet is a little slow of course loading)...but I have no idea how to find what else is going on.<br />
<br />
Any help out there?<br />

<h2>            How do I add a Signature to Windows Live Mail&#63;</h2>
                    I do see an Insert button, but it doesn't include any way to set up an automatic electronic signature. (In fact, when I click on it, it doesn't do anything.)<br />
<br />
I'd prefer having my signature (with email address) automatically added at the end of every outgoing message, but I can't find a way to set that up. Thanks in advance for any help.<br />

<h2>            Refund for Windows 10 Pro bought on the Microsoft Store for &#36;99</h2>
                    I'm not very happy with my purchase of upgrading my copy of Windows 10 Pro from Windows 10 Home I just purchased from the Microsoft Store for $99. I would like to request for a refund please. I can't get it to work since it's not genuine and I hope Microsoft
 removes this product from the store and replaces it with a real copy and nothing fake. I'm sure many people fell into this trap like me. Should had known better. :(

<h2>            Windows 10 laptop thinks headphones are microphone</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday when I plugged in my headphones into the 3.5mm jack and the menu popped up asking what they were I accidentally clicked microphone and now every time I plug in my headphones my laptop thinks that they are a microphone and doesn't play sound through
 them and continues to play sound through the speakers instead which is very inconvenient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've trawled through the Windows 10 settings but I can't get the menu to appear again so I that I can change it back and I'm not sure what else to do.</p>

<h3> sbekdave  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTLDR is Missing when I install Windows XP pro</h2>
                    
<p>I reformatted my computer and tried reinstalling windows xp pro to my hard drive but after the HD reformates, /the computer restarts and I get a message NTLDR is missing Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart.<br />
<br />
I was able to copy NTLDR and Netdetect back to the HD from the windows disk but now when i restart the computer i get an error message saying Boot.ini file is corrupt or missing.&nbsp; It was indeed deleted (missing).&nbsp; I can't rebuild because it says to run a scan
 disk.&nbsp; So after I run the scan disk (no errors come up), I try to rebuild again and get the same error message.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I ran a dir search and realized the only file on listed with a size next to it is the ntldr file I copied.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am at a loss.&nbsp; Is my Hard Drive fried?&nbsp; Is there a fix for this?<br />
<br />
I went ahead and tried to reformat and install Win xp pro again.&nbsp; After formating, windows starts copying files and after 2% complete, the computer restarts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This time, after it started up, I didn't get the same errors as before.&nbsp; It just wants me to reboot
 via the CD again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Seems like I am stuck in a viscous circle.<br />
<br />
I tried to run windows recovery and now it won't give me the windows promt only c:/<br />
<br />
I am stuck.&nbsp; Can anyone help me?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance</p>

            Failure to install an operating system is usually caused by (in order of probability):<br />
<br />
1. You are attempting to install with other devices connected to the computer. Disconnect them before trying to do an installation.<br />
<br />
2. Faulty installation media. Check the installation CD/DVD for scratches, smudges. Test in another machine.<br />
<br />
3. Faulty optical drive. Test with another bootable CD/DVD or swap it out for a known-working one.<br />
<br />
4. Faulty RAM. Test with Memtest86+ from <a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.memtest.org</a> . You will download the .iso to make a bootable cd. Burn the file with third-party burning software* - as an image, not as data. Then boot with the media you made
 (you may need to change the boot priority in your BIOS so that the optical drive is the first boot device). The test will run immediately. Let the test run for an hour or two - unless errors are seen immediately. If you get any errors, replace the RAM.<br />

*It is not necessary to have third-party burning software in Windows 7 since Win7 can natively burn an .iso. Other operating systems require it. A good free choice is ImgBurn from

<br />
5. Faulty hard drive. Test with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. Burn the file with third-party burning software (unless you have Windows 7, which can burn .isos natively)
 - as an image, not as data. Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.<br />
<br />
6. Other hardware components are faulty.

<p>okay so i got my xbox and along with it i ordered a small device to allow my xbox to connect to the wifi in my house. What I want to know is: Is there any way I could use the same device i use for my xbox, on my pc. its a desktop without wifi compatability.
 i tried using it already but i need the driver for it. if any one knows anything that would be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>here's a pic of the adapter</p>

<p>This might work, but there might be complications. (You may need an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Ethernet Cable</span>) Taken from eHow:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Turn your computer. Allow the computer to start up and then hook it to your router or modem with an Ethernet cable. You will need to have access to the Internet in order to download updated drivers to run the wireless adapter.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>Plug the USB wire on the wireless adapter into the USB port on your computer. Windows 7 will pick up the new hardware automatically and then attempt to search for drivers. Windows 7 will have generic wireless adapter drivers that it can use, but it is best
 to use driver specifically designed for the adapter.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Run Windows Update by clicking on "Start" and then "Windows Update" in your program directory. The updater program will come up as a pop-up menu, Click on the "Optional Update" tab and then click on the check box next to the updated drivers for the wireless
 adapter. Click on "Install updates" to install the updated drivers.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Restart the computer when done. Unplug the Ethernet cable once the computer has restarted.</p>

<h2>            Probably my problem comes from Intel P35&#47;ICH9R drivers</h2>
                    <p>I am suffering with the last Windows 10 Pro upgrade 1809 build 17763.316. I have a lot of blue screens which lead me to reinstall Windows many times. Result I can't work properly. I have a 32 bit Desktop with 4 hard disks. C=System, D, E, F, are data disks.
 If I try to dir or copy anything,&nbsp;the PC screen takes a mat white color and after a while the screen becomes black and at the end I get a blue screen, which is so fast, so I can't read any error code (if any).</p>
<p>What I have notice is the following: In Device Manager I have an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Unknown Device</span> on which with <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">mouse right click--&gt; Properties</span> gives that is the LPC motherboard controller (<strong>I never had this situation with the previous Windows 10 versions. All
</strong><strong>previous </strong><strong>Windows &nbsp;versions was run properly with no problems, and never had reported any Unknown Device before as now</strong>). The LPC controller according to my motherboard booklet is
<strong>Intel P35/ICH9R. </strong>I can't find the driver for this controller in Intel, not even in ASUS (M/B is ASUS P5K Premium with WiFi). Can anyone help? Thank you very much in advance.</p>

            Hi, ThanSiat 
<br />
<br />My name is Mays and I am an Independent Consultant. I would love to help you today.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps.
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem 
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump
<br />
<br />Let me know if the information has been useful to solve your Problem.

<h2>            Xbox Video App</h2>
                    <p>This app needs a major rewrite, no download management in both Xbox Music and Xbox Video is inexcusable, but the constant crashes of the Xbox Video app when downloading movies or trying to multitask&nbsp;is made even worse by having to restart the downloads from
 the beginning, as well as the painfully slow download speeds, even on my 80Mbps Fibre Broadband connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft, if you want Surface to be taken seriously as a media consumption device then the Xbox Music and Video Apps need to be way better than they are currently, if not, then scrap the apps and just give us an ARM version of the Zune software.</p>

            Has this problem still not been resolved?&nbsp; I want to rent a couple movies for an upcoming trip and don't have enough space on the C drive and I can find no way to have them save to an sd card.&nbsp;
