<h2>            Windows 10 - problems after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 days ago have decided to upgrade to win 10, which I did and ... I have to say that I did like it (and, except the problems I have, still do) except I then ran into couple of problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1).</p>
<p>The first thing I felt, and I keep feeling it is that: I can no longer decide how to manage my OS. It's windows who takes these decissions for me. Why?? I want to decide what to run, when to run, and so on. A good example is: Windows Update.
</p>
<p>Has anyone found how to bring back the option: Notify about updates but manually install them? Workaround I found: stop and disable the service</p>
<p>Another example: I was having everything set by default to: share my information, my location, etc. I have turnned everything off and rebooted. What happened next? Well ... 2-3 options were set back on (yes, to share my information). I don't want to share
 anything but it seems I can't control that. Awkward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2).</p>
<p>I've noticed my laptop was acting like I was playing a game (on full res), except I was running nothing apart from Task Manager. CPU was on 54% and ram 64% (at this point windows update was disabled). And that was how everything started:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- first problem was - Kaspersky (for which I have license) was uninstalled. any attempts to install it back resulted in a blue screen (Something about paging). I then noticed 2 services that were running:
</p>
<p>Antimalware Service Executable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Defender Service</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do you stop them? I want to run Kaspersky and that's it. I couldn't find an answer for this and couldn't stop/disable/uninstall them either. A chat with CS was no help as they failed to tell me how I can run ONLY: Windows Firewall and Kaspersky. No antimalware
 or win antivir.. Again, another decission that you cannot take (Awkwar again). Ohh, and yes, consumming resources</p>
<p>
</p><p>3).</p>
<p>Runtime broker - this one, literally, ruined my whole night. when it runs it uses from 20% of my cpu to as much as it can go. no idea what it does or how to stop it. I tried the workaround of editing the registry and stop it (disable it - setting the value
 from 3 to 4 for Start) but no luck. It's there and sometimes it starts running. Anyone found a fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4).</p>
<p>Again, about privacy and decissions: turned everything off, after reboot some of them turned back on. WHy and how?? again, are decissions I want to take, not you, Microsoft. I have also turned off all "apps that can run in background". after reboot, couple
 turned back on. I don't trust anymore whatever options I chose as I feel Windows controls and will send and hare any information the company wants, no matter what I choose.&nbsp; Any idea what can go wrong here? Any workaround to set everything to OFF (NO share
 of information, location, etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5).</p>
<p>Start button search menu: it's back, it worked ... once and that's it. When I press the start key, the menu opens but then, no matter what I type it can't find anything. For example: to open services I used to: Winkey -&gt; type services.msc -&gt; and Windows
 Services entry was shown there (which I could then click/hit enter) (I know I can use Winkey + R, but the point is I don 't know all the shortcuts). Same, for example, with Notepad: typing notepad there was showing me both win notepad and notepad++. now, nothing
 happens. Any idea why? Anyone got the same problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or remarks would be great (I got the suggestions from CS to: identify if there are any apps that my cause an odd behaviour of my system, and a solution would be a clean install - which, no offence, I won't do it. I prefer to roll back to
 win 8.1 and then try to find a way to downgrade back to win7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

            <p>Thanks mate</p>
<p>
</p><p>a quick update on my list: I have finally managed to install Kaspersky. the kit I was having from their website was telling me I was having the last version and it will perform a download for this. but I then got another blue screen (couldn't capture the
 error unfortunately). after 1 more reboot I went back to kaspersky and downloaded the last version. this time, no blue screen (no idea what conflict was between that one and win10 that was producing a blue screen) but got some errors during install (which
 I solved them with point 1 from this link - in case it helps for somebody:&nbsp;http://soft365.hubpages.com/hub/Fix-Kaspersky-error-27300-Error-installing-driver-klim6_sys)</p>
<p>As this fix was simply to start some services: it might be that some services in might case failed to start after the update? or the behaviour (automatic/manual/disabled/triggered) have changed maybe?</p>
<p>And I think by doing this I have managed to get rid of Windows Defender Service, but I have to reboot (Again) to confirm, as this service was always restarting after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>runtime broker no longer runs, my CPU is happy. no idea how exactly I did it: during 2-3 reboots I kept setting the registry value from 3 to 4. then after 1 reboot ... magic happened and it remained disable. or it might be also because I removed almost all
 the apps that were installed? hard to say. but still, it's a solution that it's a bit extreme to change a registry value to stop a process which I have no idea what it does but it ruins my resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my start search menu: it had a kind of a random behaviour. it happened to behave the same, but for the last 2 reboots or also it now finds "things" but only if I type the full name (I wonder if it is again a service that might not be started?). for example:
 typing note doesn't show anything. notepad shows me Notepad (win) but not Notepad++. Notepad++ shows me Notepad++</p>

            An issue I've run into with windows 10 is that it sets my entire user directory (except \downloads) to read-only. Which of course makes it impossible to play any game which saves data to the \my documents\my games directory. As soon as I unset read-only,
 windows 10 resets it immediately after closing the properties window.

            thanks for suggestion mate, but I will save this option in case things go really bad. I have quite a few things installed and it will take some time to have them all back together. I saved your links in case I will need them

            thanks for mentioning this mate, as I haven't had the chance yet to launch any game. did it now and luckily all seem good (phew) :). the overall problems I had seem to be related to services which were not started (quite odd to be honest)

            <p>I will mark this as "helpful" so far with a brief summary of my problems fixes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update - it's nice if you guys can give us back the old options. Meanwhile: I disabled the service. painful as I have to enable/disable every time I check for updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win Defender - this is now gone once I managed to install my Antivir (Kaspersky). Can read my previous post with the issues I had for this</p>
<p>
</p><p>Runtime broker - again, no idea what it does. The joy of my CPU continues since I have disabled the service. No impact on my run so far. I followed the workaround of setting this in registry from 3 to 4 (had to it, don't know why, over couple of reboots
 until it finally went away. might have been related also to the fact that I've removed most/almost all the apps installed by windows)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search start bar - as in my issues while installing Kaspersky, this seems to be also related to a service that was not started. I found (and set to automatic &amp; started also) the Windows Search service which was stopped (and set to Manual I think). now my
 StartSearch works fine</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Privacy issues - after setting things off (again) 2 or 3 times they finally seem to remained like that. It's odd though that, to be honest, I still have the feeling that they will go back on (especially on my next windows update). I'm now checking once
 in a while these settings (don't quite like it I have to do it but at least I'm happy they remembered the settings).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last: I guess Windows has finished making its last settings/adjustments as, for the last couple of days, I've noticed my laptop was becoming more and more responsive and the boot/load time was slowly decreasing. this morning I had quite a nice and fast boot.
 Reasons for that? No clue (but I like it and I hope will last :) ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all for help. Any other suggestions and help more thank welcome</p>

            <p>I see that you have the same problems. &nbsp; I have the Insiders Preview version of Windows 10 on a second desktop&nbsp;</p>
<p>and the free upgrade of Win 10 not even close to the Insiders preview version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like an HASH-Hybrid version of Win 7 and win 10 mix together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was under the impression that everyone would have access to the same download of the RTM version that we had under the insiders preview, but for the home edition of Win 10. &nbsp;a 3.5 gig install file that would backup windows 7 and install a clean version
 of Win 10 home ed. &nbsp;But using the win 7 or Win 8.1 licence key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The RTM version is a fully fonctionning version of Win 10, that what new users will get with OEM version of windows with a new computer and no traces of Win 7 or windows 8.1. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a long time user of Windows I sad and very disapointed of the FREE and very CHEAP upgrade of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the computer I already did the free upgrade, I may return to windows 7 since the option is available and for my main PC, &nbsp;I will wait and if they don't fix the problem, well If I still want Win 10, I'll buy the upgrad for a real clean install.</p>

            <p><strong>Hi catalin11,</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Click on the RED arrows and I think you will find the UPDATE setting you want. Update will download but notify you to restart (install). &nbsp;No picking and choosing updates&nbsp;it is all or nothing. But you do have control over when they are installed.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Windows 10 was designed for those children in the T.V. commercials. They will grow up never understanding advanced options and controlling your own computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I think you might find clicking on the GREEN arrow interesting. And the item below the green arrow.</strong></p>

            <p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could nothing but agree with your remark. I do believe as well that they tried a bit too hard to make win 10 very user friendly and they removed some of the advanced settings some users used a lot. Having a start menu full of apps that trigger more auto
 maintenance processes that make my laptop (probably not the fastest one and definitely not a gaming one) hearing like it's a drone it's not something that I am looking for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That option indeed gives you almost the old option that was before (I marked as helpful your reply as I do believe it might help other people in the same situation)&nbsp; - I do remember when I entered that menu searching for that option that I was a bit pissed
 off noticing that option for how updates are delivered being turned on and with the option for "local and over the internet". However, I was hoping for the option to control when and what of the updates to be download/installed. I think I read somewhere an
 article when somebody was asking the question: what will be if a patch/update/package that is known to cause problems will be installed anyway as you can't control it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess we'll wait and see what will happen next. After all, it's just the beginning. Things might get better ... or really worse :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, thanks for your reply.</p>

<h2>            External Hard Drive won&#39;t allow &#39;new folder&#39;</h2>
                    <p>I have an external hard drive that, when i plug it in, shows me everything (files, folders, etc.) but when I try to add a 'New Folder' it only shows me 'Burn'. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way this is resolved is when I click on the 'Scan (recommended)' option that pops up whenever I plug this drive into the Windows 7 PC.</p>
<p>The drive is a 1TB, Tauro, USB 3.0 which is exFAT formatted (I use on PC and Mac).</p>
<p>Any idea what's going on?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to take full ownership of the folder and then try adding the folder and see if it brings any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. <strong>Right-click</strong> the folder, and choose <strong>Properties</strong>

<p>I am NOT the administrator. &nbsp;When I right click on the Hard drive in Explorer ('E:') it doesn't give me the 'Security' tab. &nbsp;When I right click on the installed drive on the computer ('C:') it DOES give me 'Security' tab access.</p>

    <title>How to change to headset microphone&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angerediris  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change to headset microphone&#63;</h2>
                    I've recently got a headset, and I want to change from the built-in microphone, to said headset, since the built-in one isn't that good. I've tested the microphone on the phone, and it worked perfectly, but it just won't connect on my laptop. I've tried
 everything I can think of to change the microphone, but none of them are working. I've even tried to search for an answer, but all of those are for Windows 7. Now, I don't know exactly which type of Windows I have, since it won't tell me, but I would guess
 that it's the most recent one. Windows 10, I think. I need to switch mics because the built-in one doesn't pick up most noise. Please help.

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your headset
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level 
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing.

<p>I tried all of the options, and they don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the first one, it's not even saying it's plugged in, when it clearly is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the second one, I don't even have a rollback option.</p>
<p>And, it's fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, it won't let me use the headset as the default option.</p>
<p>The text for it is grayed and unclickable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it's an Acer laptop.</p>
<p>Though, I don't know the model.</p>
<p>And, if it helps, the headset is made by Supsoo, or I think it is. The font for the logo makes it hard to tell.</p>
<p>It's a gaming headset. The mic works fine for my phone, and Xbox One S, but not for my laptop, strangely.</p>

            <p>The only way I could find to resolve my Windows Live Mail 2012 problem was to stop using it.</p>
<p>I have switched to Microsoft Outlook 2013. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for error code 0x80070570 - it still comes up whenever I try to run "Troublehoot" for all of my Windows programs. &nbsp;I still can't use other software that runs off Windows either. &nbsp; I thought it had been fixed, but it had not. &nbsp;It was just wishful thinking
 on my part and the Window Tech seemed to know what he was doing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a a local computer tech helping me and he is baffled. &nbsp;We have done a system restore and it did not fix the problems. &nbsp;Next he is going to try uninstall Windows 8.1 and put my computer back to it's factory settings (Windows 8). &nbsp;At this point I don't
 know what else to try. &nbsp;My computer went out of warranty on Feb. 18, 2014 and I did not extend coverage. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&nbsp;encounter exactly the same problem! Does anybody have an answer? I was running WLM fine on my Windows 7. I suspect some automatic updates caused the problem?</p>

            <p>Same happened to me &nbsp;- Without going into &nbsp;a long ramble of what happened before - I have installed WLM 2009 on Windows 7 because it has the signatures and no jazzy presentation. It has worked flawlessly until a few days ago when I started to get failures
 to log-on and sync. The situation is more bizarre because this account is a paid for MSN account where as I have an Orange/Wanadoo email (now EE) and 2 other free &nbsp;hotmail accounts which work perfectly. So I am perplexed as to why the a 'paid for MSN account'
 has stopped connecting/working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Foolishly, I believed that by removing the account and re-inputting it, it would sort it out - it failed. I then uninstalled the WLM ( with exported data on mail and accounts) following past advice from Firedog (here on the &nbsp;Community) and &nbsp;re-installed - that
 too failed. I have tried to run WLM without running Firewall, Malwarebytes and Avast but that too has failed to resolve it. I have looked at the MTU setting (all packets delivered) and didn't change when adjusted AND if the other Hotmail accounts work then
 so should the MSN paid for account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
List of things covered:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
a) I have tried the connection to my router and all is good for internet being hard wired&nbsp;<br />
b) The MTU setting on Windows Live Mail has been checked and there is no fragmentation and seems to work ok at 1470 &nbsp; and I don't know what the MSN mail server requires.<br />
c) the &nbsp;Date and Time Settings on the computer are correct<br />
d) Firewall or security software may be blocking Windows Live Mail or may be blocking a required port to send or receive mail &nbsp;- cant see where Windows Defender or Avast &nbsp;settings would block this 'paid for MSN account'<br />
e) There is no 'blocking of access by my router (EE Livebox Router)&nbsp;<br />
f) I am sure it doesn't matter if I am using 2009 instead of 2011 version of Windows Live Mail<br />
g) &nbsp;There was no email is stuck in the Outbox folder of Windows Live Mail<br />
h) All my computer updates from Microsoft’s are ok&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Unsure List:&nbsp;<br />
1) I use Google Chrome and Firefox browsers and I dont use Internet Explorer &nbsp;so the settings shouldn't be causing connectivity problems. &nbsp;Do I need to check settings in my other browsers for SSL, Proxy<br />
2) I read &nbsp;" DNS may have incorrect cached data " but dont know how to check this ? All temp files have been cleaned via CCleaner and AFT.&nbsp;<br />
3) I am not sure how to check the &nbsp;"SL Security DLL libraries may not be properly registered"<br />
settings?&nbsp;<br />
4) I am unsure what or where to look for an ' Incorrect entry in the hosts file'<br />
5) &nbsp;I am now not sure what is the correct &nbsp;mail account configuration in Windows Live Mail -<br />
This is because I should never have change the settings that previously worked but now that they have been changed I have become confused as to what the correct input should be&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Currently the settings I have tried&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- POP3 Server: pop-mail.outlook.com (port 995)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;- SMTP Server: smtp-mail.outlook.com (port 25)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;AND&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;- POP3 Server: pop-mail.outlook.com (port 995)&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;- SMTP Server: smtp-mail.outlook.com (port 587)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
- full e-mail address Username<br />
- Password: for Microsoft Account&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Used Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) with the POP and SMTP connection and use SMTP authentication. Also used unsecured.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Below are some of the error warnings:&nbsp;<br />
<br />

<br />
Its a pity that the error codes don't mean much in the way of root cause and resolve and that they are not published. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
-oOo-<br />
<br />
I would be grateful if someone could shed light on why the 'paid for MSN account' no longer works and the unpaid ones do ..........AND what are the correct settings for this 'paid for MSN account' via EE broadband. Have they changed a port setting I wonder?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Obviously I can access the 'paid for MSN account' on-line without a problem but this is very unwieldy and would much prefer to have WLM working again.
</p>
<p>PS: I can even access this account using my MacBook Mail through the same Router so this should eliminate the Router.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help would be most grateful as I am sure there are others that are suffering this sudden failure too.&nbsp;<br />

            HI Firedog &amp; Julius Cesar_B<br />
<br />
Sorry for not getting back sooner. I have seem to have dug a bit of a hole for myself. It seems that this episode you speak of was the start of thinking I had a problem when I&nbsp;didn't! &nbsp;Quote:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
"You will by now have realized that there was a global problem with MSN accounts starting last Thursday and lasting till Tuesday, when an expired certificate was finally&nbsp;renewed. This fault caused Windows Live Mail to report error 0x800488EB for affected accounts.<br />
<br />
Its a pity MS didnt email everybody to say that this issue was happening. As a consequence I removed the account and re-input it. My mistake was not seeing a 2nd small tick box "This server requires a secure connection (for incoming mail (POP3)".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The paid for account is for 'no advertising' but I do have two other 'free' accounts and those too have been affected by DeltaSync-ing all folders<br />
<br />
When I finally got email account corrected, I found that it would not DeltaSync ALL my folders only the Inbox. Whilst I don't understand the mechanics of where Windows 7 keeps files to&nbsp;do with mail it is obvious that it does and they are not visible. What I
 mean by this is that after several attempts to remove WLM Essentials program and folders including of all registry traces via Ccleaner Registery tool, I would find that the same failure of DeltaSync would happen on re-installing it. For some reason I didn't
 even have to import the accounts as it found them somewhere automatically!<br />
<br />
In despair, I removed the WLM Essenttials program altogether and have had to use Mac Mail to do day to day emails. Not good as I don't have my MS outlook online folders for reference.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then a second disaster struck when my Office 97 Word Doc corrupted and the system became unstable so I have had to re-install Windows 7 - long slog - whilst doing the day job.&nbsp;No thanks to Dell computers failure to allow easy downloading of drivers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
All that said, I am now up and running and about to remove WLM Essenttials 2011 for 2009 in order to allow my text signatures to work. My worry is that there may be something&nbsp;hidden in Windows files carried through when re-installing Windows 7 which will still
 prevent DeltaSync working on ALL my folders.QUESTION: &nbsp;Is re-installing 2009 going to be a problem with this DeltaSync? ....as I have seen others reformat and re-install only to find the same issue&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hello Gtekser,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate your reply. You can still have signatures when you use the latest version of Windows Live Mail which is 2012. And also, have you checked Windows Live Mail 2012 interface? Upgrading to the latest version will fix errors in Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a signature in Windows Live Mail 2012, refer to the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open <strong>Windows Live Mai</strong>l.</p>
<p>2. On your keyboard, press <strong>Alt, F, O and M</strong>.</p>
<p>3. On the Options menu, click on the <strong>Signatures</strong> tab.</p>
<p>4. Click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
<p>5. Create your signature by choosing <strong>Text</strong> or <strong>File</strong>.</p>
<p>6. Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</p>
<p>7. Once done, check the <strong>Add signatures to all outgoing messages </strong>
checkbox.</p>
<p>8. Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your query, there's no way to&nbsp;install Windows Live Mail 2009 automatically. On the Windows Essentials: Other programs download site/link, it will automatically detect what operating system you are using and it will provide you the latest version of the
 program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, we request that you upgrade to the latest version and let us know if you will still encounter the error codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<h2>            Recovery image for surfacepro 4</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Windows won´t start on my SP4 and loops in UEFI. That is why I want to download a recovery image to create a recovery-drive (USB).</p>
<p>There are 2 versions: "<span>Windows 10 Version 1703" and "Windows 10 Version 1709"</span></p>
<p><span>Does it matter which one I will use or do I need to extract both on one USB? Or how can I find out
 which Windows version I had on my SP4 if I can´t turn it on?</span></p>
<p><span>By the way, the files need to be extracted right?</span></p>

            Tom,
<br />Get the 1709 version - it is the most up to date. Here are complete instructions:
<br />
<br />Go to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a>   (with a different computer if yours is not working properly)  and download a recovery image for your Surface. You will need a 16GB USB stick formatted FAT32. Unzip/extract the recovery zip to the formatted USB stick and then-
<br />
<br />To reset your Surface from a USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in (hold down the power button for 30 seconds).
<br />Step 2: 	Insert the USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5:	When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.
<br />Step 6: 	Select Troubleshoot &gt; Reset your PC.
<br />	If prompted for a recovery key, select Skip this drive at the bottom of the screen.
<br />Step 7: 	Select the target operating system you wish to reset. This refers to the current operating system installed on your Surface.
<br />Step 8:	Select Yes, repartition the drives, and on the next page, select Next.
<br />Step 9: 	Choose Just remove my files.
<br />Step 10:	Select Reset.
<br />	Surface restarts and the Surface logo displays while the reset process continues (this can take a while).
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

    <title>Can&#39;t right click in Windows Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernest lane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t right click in Windows Explorer</h2>
                    The last couple of days, I can no longer right-click in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; For example, if I right-click on a file name, wanting the context menu so I can delete or something, I get the popup window that "Windows Explorer has stopped working," then the
 second popup about closing the program.&nbsp; It happens even if I right-click on an icon on the desktop:&nbsp; same Windows Explorer messages, and then it clears the desktop (somewhat disconcerting) and then brings all the icons back.<br />
<br />
Something is obviously hosed up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, in the last year or so that I have had this computer, I have installed several of those little add-ons that modify the right-click menus -- but not recently, so that may not be the problem here.<br />
<br />
What has probably gone wrong, and what should I do about it?

<p><span>Hi Ernest:</span></p>
<p><span>It sounds like one of your utilities you loaded has died: OR.. The Right Click on your mouse has died.</span></p>
<p><span>I would check the “Programs” and look for the utilities you have loaded and start to remove them.. BUT.. First, try (you have one) a spare mouse, just to see
 if indeed it is software.</span></p>
<p><span>Check this and let us know what you find.</span></p>

<h3> jonkem  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to replace finger.exe</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to repair my daughter laptop. It's running vista and is a pretty new HP. She managed to pick up a virus some time ago which was cleared but has left some issues with performance.</p>
<p>I've managed to find out, after a lot of trying and using sfc/scannow, that finger.exe is corrupt but am now up against a brickwall trying to replace that file in system32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, is this possible without reinstalling vista? The laptop has HP recovery built in but that doesn't have an option to replace individual files just the complete operating system. Even after taking ownership and total rights over finger.exe and even system32
 it is impossible to delete the corrupt file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to avoid reinstallation because of deleting all her own files but it's looking more likely by the hour!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HELP!!</p>

 able to uninstall programs, then I did an update and now it get the error StLog.dll is no longer working and I cannot uninstall programs. And I cannot uninstall anything. Every program I click on under the control panel does not have the option to uninstall
 it under the uninstall page.<br />

            <p>Dell Data safe&nbsp;is online not on your computer.</p>
<p>You need to post a copy of the error report.</p>
<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding
 the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box
 before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the top.
</p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the Details tab and check the box before XML View. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now
 start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session.
 If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better
 results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

            I have done this several times. It's just a loop. It will only send the reset info to the incorrect email address (in other words, I never receive an email with the reset info). Is there a way to have the reset info sent to a different address?

            Please see above from Maribel P. These are the same steps. The correct email address will get the "Account Recovery Request", but when you go in to reset it, it will only sned the reset to the account ID which is the incorrect address. Again, this is where
 I end up:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<div>
<div>We'll send another password reset link to these email addresses.
<div><span><br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy *** </span></div>
<br />
<br />
There is no option to add another correct email address.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help you may be able to offer.

<h2>            How do I recover the bar at the bottom of the screen&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It had all my most common used icons.&nbsp; The AMD update was executed and the system went through reset. Now it shows useless options such as Desktop, One Drive, This PC, Libraries, and an unused USB Drive.&nbsp; After some aggravated discovery, it loos as if what
 I use all the time are now in a scroll menu with up/down arrows to navigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to recover from this "feature"&nbsp; but I cannot remove any of the icons taking up the entire width of the screen.</p>
<p>My screen icons got all messed up too.</p>

<p>Nope: The Unhide option was not shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt; Also on the Start&nbsp; screen right click on the big icon and you can unpin from Start.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>Nope: I get the feeling that what I listed are icons that cannot be removed from the task bar. Really, I will never use them but somehow are required to be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>&gt;&gt;&nbsp; If you hit More it will let you pin to the taskbar for those you want there.
</strong><br />
Interesting.&nbsp; This requires me to search for all the icons I had there scarcely hours ago.&nbsp; I wonder what caused them to be aborted in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another complications is that about 75% of all my icons that were on the second screen, got shoved over to the primary monitor. I realized this at the same time I lost the icons in the task bar.&nbsp; I had to drag them back and organize them again.&nbsp; Apparently
 MS doesn't allow use of icond to my benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find a &gt;&gt; icon in the task bar. It apparently gives a list of all icons on the desktop.&nbsp; This would have some semblance of usefulness if they were in any intelligible order. Maybe MS does not support more than 10 icons on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just love having to work for MS before I can do anything productive on my computer.</p>

            <p>Hi Gary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve the issue with the bar at the bottom of your screen, you can perform a system restore on your PC. This will revert your PC to the time when the bar was still there. Please check out this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17085/windows-8-restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> and go to the
<strong>Restore your PC to an earlier point in time</strong> section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            <p>Nothing will be lost except for the AMD update which caused the issue with the bar at the bottom of the screen. The system will just go back to the time when the AMD update was not yet installed, and the bar was still showing at your screen. Once you have
 successfully restored your system, you can try to apply the update again. If the bar will still be missing, it's most likely to be one of the changes brought by the AMD update.</p>

1. Click <strong>Start </strong>click <strong>Control Panel</strong>, and then click
<strong>Power Options</strong>.<br />
2. Click <strong>Adjust Display Brightness</strong>.<br />
3. Change the <strong>display brightness </strong>of the computer, and then click
<strong>Save changes</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>If the computer does not display the Adjust Display Brightness option, check with the computer manufacturer for updated BIOS to support this option.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>BIOS Disclaimer:</strong><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. </div>
<div>Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </div>
<div><br />
Check by changing the brightness settings, if the settings are available on your computer.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>Update the latest graphics card drivers from the manufacturer’s website, and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />

            <p>Hi xxspartan092xx,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, I would like to clarify that Movie Maker is free assuming that the $200 investment you're referring to is for the client. You can download the installer from the link below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-get-started" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-get-started</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the latest version of Movie Maker, you can save your project as movie in <strong>
MPEG-4/H.264&nbsp;</strong> video file and you can also use the same file type if you want to create a movie. Here are the detailed steps to save your project as movie in mp4/H.264 file type:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1. Launch Windows Movie Maker and open the project file.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></span><span>2. Click<strong><span> File</span></strong> (blue button in the upper left).</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select <strong><span>Save movie</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Choose <strong><span>Recommended for this project</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5. When the Save Movie window appears, choose <strong>MPEG-4/H.264 Video File</strong> in the
<strong>Save as type</strong> drop-down menu.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click <strong>Save</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you want to use an H.264 video file, you can simply add it to Movie Maker using the
<strong>Add videos and photos</strong> option in the <strong>Home</strong> tab. Wait for the client to finish preparing the video&nbsp;<span>improved playback performance. Hit
<strong>Spacebar</strong> to test the video.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span><span>
<p><span>If you have further questions, please let us know.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
</span></span>

            <p>Here's the official <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/movie-maker-file-types-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list of supported file types for Windows Movie Maker</a>.&nbsp; The AVCHD format is contains h.264 video and is supported as are the .mp4 video file types.&nbsp; If for some reason you find that the specific file does not work in Movie Maker, you can always use a video
 converter (e.g. Freemake Video Converter, or the like) to turn the video into a supported file type (e.g. .wmv).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are concerned, you might try to talk to a friend that has the same capture card and see if they have been able to edit using Movie Maker.&nbsp; Alternatively, if you have a sample clip that was captured via the card, you could do your own test.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Incidentally the latest version is Movie Maker 2012 and it no longer uses the "Live" moniker. It's the same program, but Microsoft has decided to drop the "Live" branding in the

<h2>            Windows 10 black screen for 3-4 minutes before login</h2>
                    <p>Hallo. Every time I start the computer, after the Windows 10 logo there is a 3-4 minute delay, i.e. black screen. I think it is due to my AMD graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two graphics cards:</p>
<p>1. AMD Radeon HD 7400M series</p>
<p>2. Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched the registry for ULPS. Yet, I did not find anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, share your suggestions. Thank you.<br />

            It does look like display driver related issue. Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />2. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer

<br />
<br />A. What is your computer's make and model? For example Lenovo T470
<br />
<br />B. What is the Windows version and build? To check this, type winver in Windows Start Search (Cortana) box and click winver.
<br />
<br />C. Did this problem start after any Windows update?   - When did the last Windows updates take place and what were the KB numbers? Was it feature update to 1803? (To check Windows updates, Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; View Installed update history)

                    Hell Everyone, For the past week I've been having trouble when a caller calls me she can't see me, but I can see her? I got on the Skype Chat line the other night and she took remote control of my computer and after an hour and fifteen minutes she told
 me everything was working. Now tonight I called her and she was able to see me for about ten minutes the screen where she sees me goes black. It's gotten extremely frustrating!! I even went on a website called "test my camera" and it said that they can't find
 my camera? I have a small laptop that uses Windows 10. Please can anyone help me? Thank you

            Hi Scorpio012,
<br />
<br />I'm Dan, an independent advisor, here to help the community with issues that may be experiencing
<br />
<br />I'd first try updating your camera drivers, and then by making sure your privacy settings on W10 are correct:-
<br />
<br />Updating Drivers 
<br />1. Search "Device Manager" in the search box, near the Windows Start Button, and select it. 
<br />2. Locate your camera, right click and select "Update Drivers". 
<br />3. Restart your PC. 
<br />
<br />Privacy Settings
<br />1. Right-Click your Windows Start Button and Select 'Settings'
<br />2. Select 'Privacy'
<br />3. Select 'Camera' in the sidebar
<br />4. Make sure 'Allows Apps to Access your Camera' is checked and below that make sure that Skype is checked as well.       
        </p>

            Hi Dan, I just did what you suggested, but the problem still exists? The other night when the chat line had remote control of my computer initially she said it was because of my anti-virus program(I have Norton), but I explained to her that everything
 was fine up until about a week ago and my anti-virus was turned on the whole time without any problems so I sort of doubted that it was my camera. Tonight, out of frustration, I turned off Norton and yet the problem still existed? I don't know what else to
 try? I'm not that computer literate so I can't just go around clicking on different things with the hoping I'll find the problem. I want to thank you for your earlier reply and if you have any other suggestions I'd be extremely glad to receive them. Thanks

            Same problem with my Surface Pro during the update from win 8 to win 8.1. After the error occurred the first time the device is unable to connect to my MS account and logs me to temporary account?! I cannot believe that on MS device the update does not
 work....
<div>
<div><br />
<div>I believe i had all win 8 updates installed...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks in advance for helpful ideas?</div>

            I've tried everything I can think of man, guess we are waiting on Microsoft to respond/fix this.

            I do not know if this will help or not, but I was getting error code 0x80070014, and found that it was connected to sql server.&nbsp; Used msconfig and under services turned off all sql server&nbsp;services Maybe will help? or if not turn off all non essential services,
 reboot and see if it will install, then reboot and start msconfig again to turn all the services back on that were on.
