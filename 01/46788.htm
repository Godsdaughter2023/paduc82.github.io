<p>Making money! I don't know what this "FuneralMirror98" pish is all about but I didn't make this account. Microsoft made it for me. I haven't had an xbox live account in over a year! My Xbox Live name was completely different and this is the first I've heard
 of this name.</p>
<p>I looked at my bank information this afternoon to see money was removed from my bank account. It was "Microsoft Luxembourg S.a.r.l" and they removed £5.99 from my account. If that wasn't bad enough, they even set up a recurring payment system! I had to go
 into details and cancel the transaction or they would have robbed me every once a month and at different amounts.</p>
<p>Be careful! Your precious Xbox company isn't all it seems. Especially when they brought out the X-One and expected everyone to pay extremely high rates for a console that wants your privacy to be extinct!</p>
<p>I once that the Xbox company was decent but like hell they are! They're lying, cheating, selfish bastards! Once they see this post, it'll probably be gone and I'll be banned. That's who they really are. Once someone exposes them, they'll do everything and
 anything to shut them up and protect their precious money. ***!</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Yep, so clearly you did your research quite thoroughly. /sarcasm.<br />
<br />
Let's debunk everything you've posted here one by one. Let's begin:<br />
[quote]Making money! I don't know what this "FuneralMirror98" pish is all about but I didn't make this account. Microsoft made it for me. I haven't had an xbox live account in over a year!
<strong>My Xbox Live name was completely different and this is the first I've heard of this name</strong>.[/quote]<br />
Well, "FuneralMirror98" is a randomly generated gamertag that was created for you when you logged in using a Microsoft Account e-mail that had never had a gamertag attached to it. This is what Microsoft does by standard practice. They make a randomly generated
 gamertag for you if you do not have one made for that account. You're allowed to change the name of the gamertag once for free within 30 days.<br />
<br />
The reason why your Xbox LIVE name was "completely different" was because you used a different e-mail when you created it. If you still have access to the console you had that gamertag on you can find out what the exact e-mail was by logging into it. Go to
 your Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; 3rd Tab (Account Information) &gt; Account Security. Look to the right to find out the e-mail you used for that gamertag. If you do not know the e-mail for that gamertag but know the gamertag itself then please
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact phone support</a></strong> to find out the e-mail associated with that gamertag.<br />
<br />
Let's continue:<br />
[quote]I looked at my bank information this afternoon to see money was removed from my bank account. It was "Microsoft Luxembourg S.a.r.l"
<strong>and they removed £5.99 from my account. If that wasn't bad enough, they even set up a recurring payment system!</strong> I had to go into details and cancel the transaction or they would have
<strong>robbed me every once a month and at different amounts</strong>.[/quote]<br />
Yes, that's because when you sign up for a Xbox LIVE Gold membership you were charged for a month which is... Can you guess the magic number? It's&nbsp;<strong>£5.99</strong>! Guess what? No one's robbing you because it's called automatic renewal. They wouldn't
 have "robbed you for different amounts each month". It's called a "subscription service" for a reason. You pay for the subscription plan you signed up for. If you signed up for the "free trial" there's something called a payment after the "free trial". If
 the free trial was for a month, you'd be charged the monthly price for a renewal after the trial was up. This is something you AGREED TO when you pressed that big shiny button to confirm your membership. Don't believe me? Here'e let's take a snippet from the
<strong><a href="http://www.xbox.com/legal/livetou" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox LIVE Terms and Conditions</a></strong>.<br />
[quote]<b>6.4.&nbsp;</b><b>Automatic renewal.&nbsp;</b>Provided that automatic renewals are allowed in your state, we will inform you by email before automatically renewing your Services. Once we have informed you that the Services will be automatically renewed, we may
 automatically renew your Services and charge you the then current price for the renewal term. We will also remind you that we will bill your chosen payment method for the Services renewal, whether it was on file on the renewal date or provided later. We will
 also provide you with instructions on how you may cancel the Services. You must cancel the Services before the renewal date to avoid being billed for the renewal.[/quote]<br />
Please, do your research before you get uppity with a company that's done absolutely nothing wrong to you at all in regards to this. You decided not to read the fine print that's right in front of you telling you that you're going to be charged a subscription
 fee for a subscription service every month, quarter or year (depending on which subscription renewal you chose).<br />

<p>When you signed up for the free month it asks for a payment method and warns you that auto-renewal will be turned on. So you would need to follow ngocphi's advice and turn off auto-renewal.</p>

<p>reporting is not helping. Microsoft needs to secure gamers accounts safety. hacking getting out of hand on all games. !!WARNING!! XBOX LIVE GAMERS ARE BEING SPAMMED TO BE HACKED BY THIS<strong> [mod removed]</strong> THRU CONSOLE MESSAGING FROM XBOX LIVE
 WEBSITE. CLAIMING YOU CAN WIN AN XBOX ONE CONSOLE SYSTEM. I RESEARCHED THE SITE AND DID NOT GO TO THE SITE. IT IS A FAST ACTING SPAM TO STEAL YOU BLIND. XBOX LIVE IS BECOMING INSECURE AND MOVING TO COMBINE PC WITH CONSOLES IS A BIG MISTAKE FOR MICROSOFT TO
 DO. WITH ALL THE HACKING IN GAMES AND THRU THEIR ONLINE SITE, XBOX LIVE IS BECOMING DANGEROUS. I ALSO NOTICED THAT IN TITANFALL THERE IS HEAVY HACKING NOW MODDING GAMES. MOSTLY OUT OF COUNTRY. MEXICO, AUSTRALIA,COLUMBIA, RUSSIA. ETC BUT ALSO HACKERS IN U.S.A.
 ALSO MORE AND MORE ARE COMING UP THAT YOU CANNOT SELECT TO AVOID OR PREFER THE GAMERS. IN TITANFALL EVEN IF YOU AVOID GAMERS IT PUTS YOU BACK IN THEIR LOBBIES. AVOIDING DOES NOT WORK FOR THIS GAME. WHY IS MS NOT SECURING THE SERVICE AND LETTING THESE HACKERS
 ALL OVER THE SERVICE? LIKE I SAID WHEN XBOX INTEGRATES WITH PC GAMING THEN THE HACKING WILL BE SO BAD NO ONE WILL BE SAFE AT ALL. MICROSOFT NEEDS TO ADDRESS THE SITUATION AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO DO THEIR JOBS! THE MAIN REASON I CONSOLE GAME IS
 BECAUSE OF SO MANY HACKERS ON PC GAMES. WE PAY FOR A SERVICE THAT HAS BECOME COMPLETELY INSECURE AND DANGEROUS. WHAT IS MS GOING TO DO? ADDRESS THE SITUATION NOW MS!</p>

    <title>Laptop turns off when idle, but only when plugged in&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mkieler3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop turns off when idle, but only when plugged in&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I updated to Windows 10 when it was first available. I haven't had any problems, turned off Cortana and it's been great. For some reason, only over the last couple weeks, my laptop turns off when it's idle
<em>while it's plugged in only. </em>I have checked the settings and when plugged in, it's set to never sleep or turn off. to be safe, I set it to never turn off when unplugged also. When unplugged, it'll sleep but that's it, but when plugged in, it'll turn
 off after 20 minutes to half an hour of being idle (about the time of eating dinner). It's not a normal shutdown, but hibernation. I really don't understand why something like this would ever happen, but it'd be pretty nice to figure it out.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I&nbsp;realize&nbsp;the inconvenience you are facing currently. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I suggest you to follow the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1: </strong></span></span><span><span>Disconnect all the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) Except mouse and the keyboard and then try to shut down.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: </span><span><span>I suggest you to <strong>run in-built Power troubleshooter
</strong>and check. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + X.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Control Panel.</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;Select <strong>Troubleshooting </strong>on the left pane, click on <strong>View All.</strong><br />
4.&nbsp;Click on <strong>Power to run the troubleshooter.</strong><br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3: </strong></span><span><span>If the above method doesn’t help, I suggest you to
<strong>reset and restore all </strong>of the default Power Plans back to their default settings. Follow the steps:<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + X.</strong><br />
2.&nbsp;Select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong><br />
3.&nbsp;At the <strong>command prompt</strong>, type <strong>powercfg -restoredefaultschemes</strong>, and then press
<strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;At the command prompt, type <strong>exit </strong>to exit the Command Prompt window.<br />
5.&nbsp;<strong>Restart </strong>the computer and check with the issue.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 4: </strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Clean boot</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot:<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</span></span></a>
<span>Note: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 5: </strong></span><span><span>I suggest you to update the BIOS, graphics driver and chipset drivers for your computer model from the manufacturer website and check if that helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></span></span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browser hijacking is a type of online fraud. Scammers use malicious software (malware) to take control of your computer's Internet browser and change how and what it displays when you're surfing the web.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is&nbsp;malicious site which is forcibly imposed to you when you get a Linkbucks Redirect virus. This virus is well designed to infect your web browser so that you can’t use your browser as usual.</p>

<p>Hi wealnier:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll ask one of the forum moderators to move your question to the Windows 7 board (you posted your question in the Vista board), but in the mean time could you please let us know if there's something specific you are doing that triggers this error (e.g.,
 copying either a single file or a large batch of files to an external USB thumb drive or SD card) and whether the problem first appeared after Windows Update updated your operating system during the July 2018 Patch Tuesday update of 10-Jul-2018?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support article <em><a href="http://www.fixyourerrors.com/dealing-with-0x80070052-stop-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Dealing With 0x80070052 Stop Error</a></em> I mentioned in my previous post might still have a relevant solution for your
 Win 7 SP1 OS if this error pops up during when you are trying to copy or backup files.<br />

<br />Close the Settings App

<br />On the View Tab, check the 'Hidden Items' Box

            Thanks DaveM 121. It took me a little longer than it should to work it out. I take awhile to process things but hopefully I've done it right. Nothing showed up in 'Hidden Items' but I went through Users/...Account Pictures and deleted what I wanted to
 delete so hopefully it's sorted. Thanks so much. I really appreciate your help.

                    <p>I`ve a problem to add the language option for Korean Language ( Basic Typing, Handwriting, Speech ). It starts the download, but does not finish.</p>
<p>I can`t type in Korean. It stay broken. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, to create a txt file "A4G;황OWA.txt".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already added the language and I had configured in "administrative language settings" &gt; "Langueguage for non-unicode programs" as well.</p>
<p>I did the language pack download through Microsoft store, however, no success too.</p>

<h2>            BITS constantly STOPS in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update constantly fails, because BITS service and Cryptographic service continually stop after my restarting them manually, although they are set on Automatic. Windows Troubleshooter fixes the problem, then it recurs as BITS etc Stops yet again.</p>
<p>This is a known problem since at least 2016.</p>
<p>I am still trying to install feature update to build 1709.</p>
<p>Massive amount of my wasted time trying to update my computer.</p>
<p>It's time Microsoft actually fixed this known problem with Windows Update.</p>

<p>Thank you to everyone for all the suggestions to install 1709.</p>
<p>After trying them all, and continually getting no further on, repeating the Windows Update Assistant finally got 1703 installed. Then 1709 at last is installed!</p>
<p>So I don't really know why all finally worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, does this mean twice a year there is going to be all this hassle to do the Windows Updates? It's taken me three months to get this installed!</p>

<h2>            Skype audio output not working - please help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi - I am using Skype (just downloaded the latest version for Mac) and no one can hear me/the output audio doesn't work. I can hear them. I have checked the audio settings and I have checked "built in microphone" and for the speakers "built in output" but
 if I swirtch to the only other options "default" nothing seems to change. I also don't see the bar that usually moves as you speak, though it wouldn't be moving. Any advice? I have a major Skype interview tomorrow and need to get this to work ASAP! Thank you!!!</p>

            Since, you have an interview tomorrow and I, generally, don't advise people to use Classic Skype as we all need to look ahead and use new version.
<br />
<br />To overcome this issue which is urgent for you, you should install and use Classic Skype which will co-exist with existing installation.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much for your quick reply. I think the issue may actually be with the laptop’s microphone not working and nothing that’s actually specific to Skype, as i tested the sound outside of Skype and the volume bar didn’t move when I spoke. Unless I
 can figure out how to fix that I think i eill have to borrow afriend’s laptop , which is not ideal. Any tips on the microphone issue? Thanks again!</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Made Computer Significantly Slower</h2>
                    <p>So I recently allowed my computer to perform some overdue updates. All the drivers and software are up to date according to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon completion my computer was significantly slower. It was lightning quick before the updates. I have 8gb ram, i7 processor, a SSD. I'm talking it takes 15-20 seconds for the File Explorer to open in Airplane Mode. I feel like I've tried everything but
 throwing the thing out the window to try and resolve this problem, the machine is basically useless as of right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I've done:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checked all backkground processes, stopped any that were not necessary</p>
<p>Disabled fast startup; disabled all startup processes that are not critical</p>
<p>Cleaned my SSD out from all the stuff I don't use (at about 20% of its capacity right now)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Used the disc optimization tool</p>
<p>Adjusted power settings for best performance</p>
<p><strong>Reset windows.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise is useful. None of the above in any sequence helped. </p>

            Hi Eric
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />You might need to update your BIOS and chipset drivers; or you might need to reset the BIOS defaults. 
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 battery
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 battery
<br />Plug it in again, power up

            Hi Eric
<br />
<br />Try upgrading to the newer Windows 10, 1903 to see if it resolves the problem.
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

                    Hello, I have a SONY VAIO PCG-61611L and Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium OA is installed on it. I lost the disc that came with the laptop, and I want to reformat. My buddy has a Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit OEM disc and I was wondering if I can use that
 disc to reinstall Windows on my computer. I'll be using the serial number on the sticker on my laptop. Thank you!

            Yes, if it's an OEM disk from Microsoft and both are Windows 7 Home Premium you can use the disk. If his OEM disk is from a different computer manufacturer like Gateway you likely will not be able to use it.<br />
<br />
You may need to use phone activation.<br />

<p>
<span><br />
</span><span>If online activation fails:</span></p>
<p>

To replace your Sony install disk:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span>Contact the OEM computer manufacturer and ask them to send you an install disk for your computer - they may or may not do it. If they agree to send you one they may charge a small fee.
</span><span>Contact information for the manufacturer of your computer can be found here:

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To reinstall Windows you can also use the restore partition if the computer has one:<br />
<br />
<div>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Reinstall Windows Preinstalled On Computer</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>OEM computer manufacturers are required to provide at least one way for you to reinstall Windows if you buy a computer with Windows preinstalled - your computer should have included either a restore partition
 on your hard drive, or Windows install/restore disks. ﻿Most computer manufacturers also have a feature to make your own install disks.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If the restore partition is still there and was not removed, it will reinstall Windows. There is usually a prompt when you first start the computer telling you what key to press to start the restore﻿ -
 check your manual if you're not sure how to. Or if you have install disks - insert them, restart and boot from them to start the reinstall process.
</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>If you restore it to factory condition, it will be like it was when you first bought it - all preinstalled programs will be installed. Anything you installed after buying it
 must be reinstalled. This will remove any personal files on the computer, back them up first.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please answer these questions to get more clarity on this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When exactly do you get these pop up messages?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did this issue occur after upgrading to Windows 8.1?</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you installed all pending Windows Updates and updated all device drivers accordingly?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Low memory problems occur when your computer runs out of RAM and becomes low on virtual memory. This can happen when you run more programs than the RAM installed on the computer is designed to support. Low memory problems can also occur when a program
 doesn't free up memory that it no longer needs.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When your computer doesn't have enough memory for all of the actions it's trying to perform, Windows and your programs can stop working. To help prevent information loss, Windows will notify you when your computer is low on memory.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us follow these methods and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p><span>Run the
<strong>System Maintenance </strong>troubleshooter and check if this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>1-Press
<strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2-Double click on
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and click on <strong>View all</strong>.</span></p>

<p>So I have two different accounts but i want to &nbsp;change the gamertag of my primary account to the Gamertag of my other account. The problem is that I have to pay to switch both gamertags and that is a waste of money and is a hassle. Is there a way i can somehow
 transfer/merge the gamertag over and only have to pay for one of them, or could I call xbox support and could they help me with this? &nbsp;Could I simply delete the other account and gamertag and then re-purchase the gamertag on my main??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice is much appreciated. (BTW I have never posted on these forums before so if my format is off or I did something improperly please tell me as well).</p>

<p>I think I have the same "problem". I created a (free) account on my mothers Xbox a few years ago. Now I have my own Xbox with another account. I want to use the name I created on my mothers Xbox (which I have on a memory unit now) for my current account
 on which I have purchased some stuff already. </p>
<p>Am I understanding correctly that renaming the old (free) account to something else will free the name to use on my new account? Even though I think it's kind of a rip-off considering the ridiculous amount of money it will take to change names twice, I would
 like to do that. Just want to be absolutely sure that renaming an account will free up the old name for re-use. I don't want to flush money through the Micro$oft toilet just to find out I can't re-use previously used names, like with hotmail, where names are
 always kept "reserved", even though it is an canceled account.</p>

                    <p>I<del>'m running on&nbsp;</del><strong><del>Windows 8.1 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue_r9.150322-1500), and my model is a&nbsp;HP 15 Notebook PC.</del></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>I have searched every single site in search for a solution to this problem I am encountering and they are all equivalent to one another. They all state you should, Uninstall, restart, and reinstall and it should work properly. But when i perfrom and
 Install the latest version from&nbsp;<strong><em>http://www8.hp.com/us/en/campaigns/hpsupportassistant/hpsupport.html#.VZ9WGvlVgSU</em></strong>&nbsp;it still doesn't work. Even after countless attempts. Whenever my Laptop starts up its says&nbsp;<strong><span>"HPSF.exe
 has stopped working - This application has encountered a serious problem and must close. Click "ok" to automatically restart this application"</span></strong>&nbsp;and every time I hit restart it does absolutely nothing. It is very frustrating. Is there a solution
 to this at all? will I now not be able to have HP Support Assistant because of the horrible technical support from the "Experts"?&nbsp;</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Yes i've even tried the&nbsp;<em><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall</a></em>&nbsp;solution. It doesn't even download throughly I used&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft
 Automated Troubleshooting Services Diagnostics</strong>&nbsp;to figure out why there is an error when i try to download&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft fix it</strong>, and it says I need to&nbsp;<strong>check for connections to URLs used in SDP Service</strong>&nbsp;but I do not know
 what that means.</del><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>&nbsp;The windows 10 update is coming soon and I might not get it because of this problem. I think more people have the problem i have, I want my HPSA to be back to normal and have my PC run better</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>&nbsp; To the one who answers my question and solves my issue i give full gratitude to you.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ATTENTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! UPDATE ON THE PROBLEM HERE!!!!!!!! THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM IS TO GO TO SETTINGS AND REFRESH YOUR PC. AFTER 2 DAYS OF FINDING ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO FIX HPSA THE ONLY WAY IS TO
 REFRESH YOUR PC. IF IT SAYS YOU CANT REFRESH YOUR PC JUST CLICK ON ADVANCED STARTUP IN THE RECOVERY OPTIONS AND WHEN YOU GET TO THE BLUE SCREEN HIT REFRESH AND SELECT YOUR PROFILE AND JUST WAIT FOR IT TO BE DONE!! YOU WILL NOT LOOSE ANY IMPORTANT FILES JUST
 STUFF YOU CAN EASILY RE DOWNLOAD AND IT KEEPS TRACK OF ALL THE THINGS IT UNINSTALLED SO YOU CAN RE INSTALL THEM. I EVEN HAD ALL MY GAME SAVES AFTER I REFRESHED. IF YOU REALLY WANT HPSA AND ITS HIGHLY&nbsp;RECOMMENDED&nbsp;DO THIS ITS THE ONLY WAY POSSIBLE</span></p>

<h3> ryanzoo06  say:</h3>
<h2>            Variation of the Windows Security HResults 0x80074003 error</h2>
                    <p>This is regarding the Windows Security HResult 0x80074003 - I have encountered repeatedly.&nbsp; I understand the&nbsp; recovery disc, restore process, and have used it.&nbsp; My question is why does it keep happening?&nbsp; It occurs upon restart everytime windows performs
 a restart as part of installing updates.&nbsp; Usually if I just restart 1, 2, 4? times it will eventually work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have an HP elitebook 8440p, Windows 7 professional x64-bit&nbsp; ver 6.1 no service pack 1.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>i5&nbsp;&nbsp; M520 @2.4 ghz&nbsp; 4GB RAM&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Infact that was one of the problems, tried to install sp1 and it wouldn't install.&nbsp; That may be for another discussion.&nbsp; However any update windows performs will cause this error on the next restart.&nbsp; I would like to know now how to get around it but how
 to prevent it.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Debo,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would like to have a better understanding before we start working on it. I appreciate if you could help me with more information.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>1. Have any other USB or external drives worked on your computer?<br />
2. What is the make and model of your computer?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>3. Did you try the device in another computer and see if it is working?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices except mouse and keyboard and then perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Click<strong> Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Click<strong> System and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System</strong>, and then click<strong> Device Manager</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click<strong> System</strong>, and then click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong> Allow</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
<strong>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp; Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below link
</span><span>for assistance–<br />

<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, I would recommend to follow the steps given in the below article for
<strong>Windows 7 user<span>:</span></strong></span></p>

            <p>Sangeeta Sarkar: The problem is with the device. It does not recognize my LG Bluetooth headset either. Other USB devices work with my machine:&nbsp; Model #: CQ5320F; Product #: AY030AAR-ABA; Serial #: MX80070BSR<br />
Software Build #: A1NAv6PrA3; Service ID #: 062-913; PCBRAND: Presario<br />
In Device Manager there are no exclamation marks nor under the <span>Universal Serial Bus controllers list&nbsp;</span><span>Host Controller is not listed.</span></p>
<p><span>The MP3 device has some problems with selecting folders/options. My current problem is that when playing the FM radio selection I cannot, without difficulty and much effort, return to playing music files. I searched the manual which is not extensive
 and that has no information. It, the manual, seems to be poorly written.</span></p>
<p><span>So I just put up with it.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>I've recently got this error after starting up my laptop on windows 10 (Hp Pavillion G6).
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I tried looking for help but nothing seems to help, even
</span>tried doing the DISM<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">/Scanhealth in the command prompt and also tried running powershell as well but both came up with no results/errors found. I've also tried out system refresh and updates but been having this error for almost
 over 2 weeks now. If you have any suggestions please help... </span></p>
<p>Also a little more info about my laptop, it was originally a Windows 7 laptop which then got upgraded to windows 8 then 8.1 when it came out for a free upgrade then finally in January this year I upgraded it again to windows 10.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This error is caused by the system being unable to load a needed file because of the file being corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better understand the issue please let us know </p>
<p>1. Did you make any changes to the&nbsp; computer prior to the start of the issue?</p>
<p>2. Did you install any Adobe program recently ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform a system restore and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. System Restore uses a feature called
<strong>system protection </strong>that regularly creates and saves information about your PC's drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer the link below to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your help and adivce. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I havent had any adobe programs installed before the errors nor made any changes to the computer. I've tried out the system restore but just as it was going through the process, I got another error status that went in the lines of 'it found some corrupted
 files' and that the safe option was to let my laptop to automatically reinstall windows 10 and remove all apps prior the upgrade. This I thought was fine but now the sad thing is that though my laptop is running well error-free (i think!) is that all my apps
 that I had installed were now all gone! (including ones that were already pre installed on my laptop when I first bought it as a win 7 laptop). Im not sure which apps or add ons like visual C++, etc are important to have but even though I'm on the hunt for
 the previously installed apps this will prob take a whiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your help-really appreciate it :)</p>
