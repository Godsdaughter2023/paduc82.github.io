<h2>            Microsoft .NET Framework</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to install&nbsp;Quickbooks Pro 2009&nbsp; and I keep being told I need Microsoft .NET Framework 1.1. Version 3.5 is installed on my PC but I am having no success and had to abort the installation on more than one occasion. I removed version 3.5 and installed
 1.1 with th the SP 1 update, but got the same result. The remedies suggested by Quickbooks have not helped.</p>
<p>How can I get around this. Will Version 4.0 help?</p>
<p>My operating system is Vista Home Premium Version 6.0 SP 2</p>

<p>The various .NET Framework versions can all exist simultaneously on the same system. If an application requires a particular version, having a later version will not help. So installing 4.0 will not help. You may need 1.1 rather than 1.1 SP1.</p>
<p>This article gives information about reinstalling&nbsp;.NET Framework after removing it&nbsp;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2010/12/22/10108400.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/astebner/archive/2010/12/22/10108400.aspx</a> . This may be your best option.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            I have Windows 7 Professional 32 bit. I used Google Earth for years with it. Recently it quit working on my computer. I have removed and re installed different versions from the earlier one to the latest one. I have done everything I have found recommended
 on the internet to fix it, still wont run Google Earth. Right now I am getting this message,&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f799e1d-108c-43f1-9242-b338dff6544a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1f799e1d-108c-43f1-9242-b338dff6544a?upload=true" /></a>&nbsp;I
 have went there and done that, yet nothing. I am sure it is some little thing that I am overlooking, but I can;t find it.

<p>The external user is using an icloud account to sign into the normal Skype app and when trying to video call into us (we use Skype for Business) the call fails.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post. For further help, please help us to confirm following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Did the external user has any error message when he can’t have a video call to you? Please send us the complete error message or some screenshots to us.</li><li>Did this external user is a contact on your Skype for Business? If no, please help to add this user as a contact, and send IM to him to see whether this external user can communicate with you.</li><li>Did you (your organization users) show in the contact list form this external user’ Skype?</li><li>Did this Skype user can’t have a video call with all Skype for Business users? Or he just can’t have a video call with you?</li></ol>
<p>

            Hello, I see that you are having trouble importing pictures to your PC. Let me try keeping this simple for you. First, you will need to download iTunes from Microsoft Store. This will install all the Apple Device Drivers in your computer, so that your iPhone will get recognized as soon as you plug it in. Once you plug in your iPhone in your PC, open Explorer, and navigate inside the DCIM in your iPhone Storage. From there, find the photo you wish to bring, and DRAG the photos into the PC directory. Note to DRAG the file. It would not let you copy and paste, so note that.
<br /> Hope this helps!

            I tried to run the trouble shooter. Kept freezing up. I haven't gotten an error message for updating the drivers. In Windows 10 I have no clue where to do that. Games for Big Fish and GameHouse are running like molasses in the wintertime 😊

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<span>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update
</span></li><li>
<span>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically</span></li><li>
<span>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</span></li><li>
<span>Your device is not running genuine Windows</span></li><li>
<span>Your device is running Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8/8.1 Enterprise, or Windows RT/RT 8.1, which are excluded from this reservation offer.</span></li><li>
<span>Your device is managed as part of a school or business network.&nbsp; (Check with your IT administrator.)</span></li><li>
<span>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows 10 will not see the
<em>Get Windows 10</em> app before July 29<sup>th</sup>.&nbsp; After July 29<sup>th</sup>, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray.&nbsp; This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you choose.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first 3 issues.</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t think any of these conditions apply to you, and you’re still not seeing the icon, you can also try running the solution below, which will verify your
 device meets all the prerequisites and then turn on the <em>Get Windows 10 </em>
app:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Open <strong>Notepad</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Copy the following text and paste it into Notepad:</span></li></ol>
<p><span>REG QUERY "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\AppCompatFlags\UpgradeExperienceIndicators" /v UpgEx | findstr UpgEx</span></p>

<li>
<span>Click <strong>File</strong>, and then
<strong>Save As</strong></span></li><li>
<span>In the <strong>
File name</strong> box, change the file name to <strong>ReserveWin10.cmd</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Then click the dropdown next to
<strong>Save as type</strong>, and select <strong>All files (*.*)</strong></span></li><li>
<span>Select the folder you would like to save the file to.&nbsp; For this example, let’s choose to save the file to the
<strong>C:/Temp</strong> folder.&nbsp; Then click <strong>Save</strong>.&nbsp; </span></li><li>
<span>Open an elevated command prompt.&nbsp; (From the Start screen or Start menu, type
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the search box, and then in the list of results, right-click
<strong>Command Prompt</strong>, and select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.)</span></li><li>
<span>Finally, run the file from the location you saved to in Step 6.&nbsp; In this example, you would type the following in the Command Prompt window and hit Enter:</span></li></ol>

 be patient.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the script is
<strong>failing</strong> in an infinite loop, then you don’t have the necessary prerequisite Windows Updates.&nbsp; Besides requiring Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update, you must also have installed:</span></p>

</p><p><span>KB3035583</span></p>
<p><span>KB2952664</span></p>

</p><p><span>For Windows 8.1 Update:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>KB3035583</span></p>
<p><span>KB2976978</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can manually check if you have these updates within your elevated command prompt by typing the command:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>dism /online /get-packages | findstr 3035583&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Replace the KB number with whichever update you are looking for.)&nbsp; If you have the update installed, this command will show the package identity.&nbsp; For example,
 Windows 8.1 users should see this:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>C:\&gt;dism /online /get-packages | findstr 3035583</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Package Identity : Package_for_KB3035583~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.29</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Instructions to run the tool:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.&nbsp; Go to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u0au9xgy6ss18p/win10fix_full.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><span>3. Right click the file and click run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Follow the screen instruction untill to come to main menu screen.</span></p>
<p><span>5. On main menu screen do step 1 first and check if you go the updates insalled and and then press any key it will take you back to main menu.</span></p>

<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community forum. From what I understand, when you set your screen resolution to 1920x1080 and you close Windows Live Mail, the settings will be changed. To isolate the issue, we would like to ask some information from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<li>What are the exact steps that you took in changing your screen resolution when you open an attachment?</li><li>What is the file type of the attachment?</li><li>What error do you receive when you open the attachment?</li></ul>

            <p>Hello Ian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur either due to corrupt Windows files or software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
<strong>To diagnose the issue, please start your computer in safe mode</strong> and check the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services. When you start your PC in safe mode, you can eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persist in safe mode, then perform clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Perform clean boot.</strong><br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, use method 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
<strong>Run system file checker(SFC)</strong> to fix missing or corrupt Windows files which may be causing the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: It may ask for Windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
        </p>

<h3> albannaz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen is stuck in zoomed mode and i have tried everything. Please Help&#33;&#33;&#33; Windows 10.</h2>
                    To start it off I use a TV as my desktop screen. My two year old son was button mashing on my keyboard and the screen somehow just entered this zoomed mode. My computer was in locked screen when this happened, was not logged in. So I proceeded to log in,
 and try and go to display settings and change resolution but none of the options worked on there. One thing seemed to work and that was system restore. I restored my computer to an earlier date prior to this incident happening, and it worked!!!. I was happy
 and patted my self on the back for figuring something out when I have very little knowledge on how to fix anything on computers. BUT, 2 days later I was watching youtube videos and the screen went back to the zoomed stage it was in before I did the restore.
 So I thought I would do the same thing again and restore it back to that point hoping tit would fix it again. When I go to the restore settings, it did not have any prior dates I could restore it to. Not even the date I first rest

            Hi Alban, your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />On the Driver Tab, click 'Roll back Driver' 
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager and restart your system
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the rollback option is greyed out:
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall'
<br />Restart the computer (myst be a restart, not a shut down) 
<br />Windows will then download the correct driver
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have an ATI AMD Video Card:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section 
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties 
<br />
<br />Right click on your display adapter, click 'Uninstall device' 
<br />Choose 'Delete the driver software for this device' then click 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />
<br />Select any device, and then click Action - Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />
<br />Windows should load a good driver for your ATI graphics card 
<br />
<br />Then, go to Start - Settings -&gt; Update &amp; Security, 
<br />
<br />Click Search for Updates, and install any available updates

    <title>Cannot create user password in administrator account - Vista SP2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eamonlaser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot create user password in administrator account - Vista SP2</h2>
                    
<p>My laptop (running Vista SP2) has no password on the user account. Guest account is switched off and my user account is administrator.<br />
<br />
I want to add a login password to secure my PC a little more by doing the following:<br />
Start button (Vista Orb) &gt; Control Panel &gt; User Accounts &gt; Create a password for your account<br />
I enter a password of 10 characters. I have tried more or fewer characters, a mixture of upper case and lower case and numbers etc, but whatever I try I get the following message:<br />
<br />
"The password you typed does not meet the password policy requirements. Check the minimum password length, password complexity and password history requirements"</p>
<p>Any ideas what to do here? I've tried searching on-line and through this forum but have been unable to find anyone who's had the same issue, let alone resolved it!</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Eamon</p>

<p>A little more information:</p>
<p>I'm running Vista Home Basic.</p>
<p>I've checked that Windows Updates are all up to date.</p>
<p>I've tried creating a new user account and creating a password for the new account (both from my main user account and from the new user account) and I get the same message.</p>
<p>I've also enabled the 'Administrator' account (cmd &gt; net user administrator /active:yes) and tried using this Administrator account to create a password and this doesn't work either!</p>

<p>Hi eamonlaser,</p>
<p>For your information, there wouldn’t be any password policy settings for the edition of Windows Vista that you’re running currently.</p>
<p>Even after trying different combination of passwords which wasn’t accepted by windows, I would suspect that it would be a malware/virus issue. If this is not true, then you might have a higher edition of windows vista and not windows vista home basic.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to run a virus scan on your computer by visiting the link below.</p>

<p>Hi, sorry for the delay in replying - I couldn't remember what Live ID I'd used to set up the eamonlaser account and have had to set up a new one, hence a slightly different username!</p>
<p>I've run the Microsoft Security Essentials software, choosing 'Full' scan. The software found no virus or malware on my computer, but did quarantine RealVNC (remote access software we occasionally use at work).</p>
<p>I've created screen shots of the system information (to show which OS I am using), the 'Create password for your account' dialogue (to show I am logged in as an administrator, and to check I am not doing the process incorrectly - always a possibility!),
 and the 'User Account Control Panel' error message.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beelzebozo.com/images/computerinfo.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Computer info here</a></p>
<p>I've also taken a screen shot of the one thing that MSE found after performing a full scan on my system.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.beelzebozo.com/images/security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Security Essentials info here</a></p>
<p>Re your links:</p>
<p>1. Microsoft Security Essentials - thanks, but when I tried it the only thing it found was a piece of legitimate software!</p>
<p>2. Searching for 'secpol.msc' returns 'No items match your search'</p>
<p>3. 'Tips for creating a strong password' I have already tried all these - see my first post.</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this week I am not able to use my Remote Desktop Client (mstsc.exe) on my Windows 8.1 (x64) machine. When I want to start the Remote Desktop application a message box pops up saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system cannot find the file specified. C:\WINDOWS\system32\&lt;LANG_NAME&gt;\mstsc.exe.MUI</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I know that changed on my&nbsp;PC this week is that I ran Microsoft Update (because of the famous IE bug fix).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I search for the file mstsc.exe.MUI on my PC it cannot be found (so also not in other Language folders en-US, en-GB, ja-JP etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get Remote Desktop running again? Reinstall?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope anyone can help, especially since my other pc has no keyboard/display/etc. and I only use it through RDP.</p>
<p>

            <p>Not really, the only option is a Refresh option that reinstalls the entire \Windows directory (contents of the \users folder is untouched).&nbsp; It's not exactly an immediate gratification option though: you'll have to go manually reinstall any non-Store apps
 like Chrome, Firefox, or Office.</p>

            Hi Angelo, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Uninstall any 3rd party Anti-virus - this is a known issue with 1803
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<p>The first game was fun but needed polish. Still, nothing beat karate kicking a helicoptor or elbow dropping a tank from a 50ft building. I've got this on pre-order and I think it looks great. There's 2 reviews out for it now, one rated it 9/10 and the toher

<p>Its in NYC again and seems to have very few changes. I just cant justify buying this at all when its pretty much the same exact game again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part that killed the first game was that it originally was annonced as a co-op. Then they dropped the co-op
 at the last minute. So many people including myself expected this one to be a co-op since its in the same exact city again.&nbsp; But they still didnt add co-op to the game?? I could see putting it in the same city&nbsp;again if it at least had co-op. But no co-op and
 back to the same city?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I might rent it but I predict that this game will not do well at all.</p>

 you are looking for. However don't follow this method if you are unsure about security or possible comprimisation of your computer, although i have used this site many times without any problems.</p>

                    My PC has been going bonkers the last couple of days, and I have no idea why. Every time I leave the PC for a few minutes, the processor fan starts going super fast. When I check resource monitor I find that dwm.exe has been running the processor at 100%
 capacity. I have a relatively fast PC, so believe me when I tell you that even sunning malware and anti-virus scans simultaneously doesn't get the processor running this hot. Nothing does...until now.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So what is dwm.exe? If it's legit has mine become infected with malware, because my PC never used to behave like this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Suggestions? Next steps? I can't leave my PC idle any more because it makes such a racket! This is a major pain in the behind.</div>

            I haven't done the clean start yet but I have run MSS - it found nothing. I'll try the clean boot tomorrow.
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the explanation re DWM.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Can you please explain why DWM should be running at &nbsp;high speed when the PC is idle? Why is it running at all if the screen is off and the PC has gone to the lock screen? What could it be doing? It can't be doing any graphics, because there are no graphics
 running at that time, are there? Does it have any other functions it could be performing while the PC is idle?</div>

            The only thing that worked was removing Avast antivirus. Problem went away.
<div><br />
<div>So installed AVG instead. And the problem returned.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8 or something in Outlook 2013 does not like 3rd party virus products.</div>

<div>I wouldn't mind so much except that Windows Defender is next to useless as an antivirus/malware product so I have to use a third party product of some sort...</div>

            This issue crops up with various software (Outlook, Logitech Setpoint are the most common I've seen). &nbsp;I believe it is a Windows 8 bug that requires serious attention from Microsoft. &nbsp;I also have this issue. &nbsp;See the following links to forums where it
 is discussed:

            Yes, I'd found these posts eventually but kind of hoped for some kind of fix. I have since uninstalled AVG and the problem has gone, so for my money it's something related to third-party security software that win8 objects to...i have no idea what though!

            Yeah it's not clear what's happening. &nbsp;dwm is related to display of windows, so I guess it's something related to programs that have notification windows. &nbsp;Strange though, I have AVG and the problem doesn't happen with it for me, only with Setpoint (or
 maybe it's the combination, I'll do more tests). &nbsp;From what I've seen though I don't think it's specific to security software. &nbsp;And since it happens when the monitor goes off, it's not something these 3rd party programs are doing "normally", if at all. &nbsp;We
 are pretty much stuck waiting for Microsoft to fix this. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Forum threads on this issue go back 6 months and I have yet to see any indication that Microsoft is looking into it. &nbsp;I'll do a live support chat with Microsoft this weekend. &nbsp;Please contact them too; only if many users complain will they make it a priority...
 &nbsp;I've also done a support incident with Logitech so they can put pressure on Microsoft on this issue. &nbsp;You could do the same with your specific software that "causes" this.</div>

            Was it still DWM using the CPU? &nbsp;Because I had a separate "issue" where Defender would use a lot of the CPU during idle time, running unnecessary scans. &nbsp;Since that couldn't be controlled I disabled it and moved to a 3rd party program (AVG). &nbsp;It was after
 that that I noticed the DWM problem on my computer.
<div><br />
<div>And yes I believe there are Microsoft people on this site (like the "support engineer" that replied earlier in this thread), but this is a community forum after all... &nbsp;Many threads don't receive a reply from them or a solution. &nbsp;I have not yet received
 a reply from Microsoft on my (admittedly few) posts. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I doubt serious problems like this are escalated. &nbsp;Which is why I recommend contacting support directly. &nbsp;This is a good start to find out if a solution already exists, but it doesn't appear
 so in this case, despite the issue having been known for months.</div>

            Howdy.
<div>Those of you with pro are in luck, those of you without...not so slick.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Here's how to make it behave.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've found that on some systems dwm also overpolls for touch. Not going into detail here, but this fixes that too. Also this is a problem for Intel gfx cards for some reason. AMD cards seem fine, I haven't tested NVIDIA because I don't own one right now.</div>
<div><br />
<div>OK, for both home and pro make a batch file.</div>
<div><br />
<div>dwmlow.bat</div>
<div>============</div>
<div>wmic process where name="dwm.exe" CALL setpriority 64</div>
<div>============</div>
<div>Home users right click and run as administrator, if you want to turn off UAC (I don't) then you can add this to your startup folder, otherwise home user, sorry, you'll have to launch manually after each reboot. Alternately create compatibility settings
 maybe?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Pro users and others, launch gpedit.msc</div>
<div><br />
<div>Place the .bat file into Windows Settings Scripts Startup</div>

                    Ok here is a tough one and I'll try and be as suscient as possible.&nbsp; I build a custom box with ASUS motherboard and Sony BluRay drive.&nbsp; It's a SATA internal drive and the model is BWU-100A ATA.&nbsp; After I put the computer together, I installed Vista 64bit
 Ultimate.&nbsp; I have always used PowerDVD to play my DVD/BluRay disks.&nbsp; Based on all that, for two years, I was able to put a BluRay disk in the drive, Windows would see the disk, PowerDVD would load, and play my movie.&nbsp; Great Picture!&nbsp; Great sound!&nbsp; Then I had
 a problem.&nbsp; Picked up a virus that was really a serious one.&nbsp; I ended up having to reinstall Vista Ultamate 64bit (full install).&nbsp; I lost all of my applications and had to reinstall Office, PowerDVD, etc.&nbsp; Everything.&nbsp; When I got all of that done, I put a
 BluRay disk into the Sony drive and no go!&nbsp; The disk would spin up and this sit there.&nbsp; When I double click on the icon in "my computer", the door opens and I get the message, "please insert a cd/dvd".&nbsp; I was on the phone with Microsoft Support for a total
 of 6 hours.&nbsp; I installed SP1, SP2, and as the support technician started to give up, he downloaded a codec off the net to see if that would fix the problem with no results.&nbsp; I don't know what to do?&nbsp; I paid almost $800 for this drive 2.5 years ago and it sits
 here being used as a plain old vanilla DVD drive.&nbsp; Oh yes, I forget to tell you, if I put a regular DVD movie in the drive, Vista reads it just fine.&nbsp; It's only with Blu-Ray media that Vista loses it's abiltiy to see the media in the drive.&nbsp; If the drive never
 worked from the time I put the computer together, I would have returned the drive or just used it as a nice DVD drive, but when you have used the drive as a Blu-Ray drive, played many blu-ray movies, and then to lose all recognition from Vista to the drive
 of it being a blu-ray drive boggles my mind.&nbsp; BTW, the BIOS sees the drive as being a blu-ray drive, the device manager sees the drive as a blu-ray drive, Vista tells me the drive is working properly, etc.&nbsp; Sony had me try a few things that didn't work and
 then told me the drive wasn't tested on a 64 bit OS.&nbsp; MS gave up.&nbsp; So you see, I'm pretty much stuck unless someone that knows what they are doing has seen this and fixed it or wants to try and understand how to fix it.&nbsp; Thanks to anyone that can help me get
 my Sony Blu-Ray drive reading Blu-Ray media again.<br />

<span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>This looks like an issue with the hardware device itself. However, you can check if the device is updated with the latest version of drivers and firmware from the
 manufacturer’s website.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If that does not help then, I would ask you to take it to the manufacturer and see if that the device can be replaced or repaired.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>Note: As the Driver/Firmware updates are not Microsoft authored, we cannot verify if they will leave the system stable, so please make updates to your devices using your own
 discretion.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>All the best!</span></span></p>

 it is a hardware/firmware problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Everything worked fine at their current levels until 2nd Beta of Windows 7. Is there a setting in the Windows 7 registery to disable Blurray support?<br />
Will the Storage Feature package fix this basic driver issue?<br />
<br />
I spent good money on valid options such as WINDVD and PowerDVD software with BluRay support.<br />
<br />
I also spent tons of money on my BluRay movie library.<br />
<br />
I am not copying any BluRay movie ilegally, yet I am penalized as a&nbsp;legimate buying customer.<br />
<br />
I am also willing to buy Windows 7 to get the latest features and functions.<br />
<br />
So can you provide an answer that will work?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Mike, you are right where I am on this.&nbsp; Microsoft punts to Sony and Sony punts to Microsoft.&nbsp; I have updated the firmware on my drive to the latest version.&nbsp; There is NO software or driver issues as the Sony Blu-ray drive is a plug and play piece of hardware.&nbsp;
 My Blu-ray drive will play regular DVD movies but will not recognize Blu-ray media.&nbsp; It is NOT an issue with PowerDVD as I have tried working with the latest version and I have rolled back via a patch to an eariler version that Cyberlink said would fix the
 problem.&nbsp; I have anyDVD on the desktop and it is unable to see media in the drive and Vista as the OS, while it sees the Blu-ray drive, puts an Icon on the screen, will let me view the contents, burn, etc. to a regular DVD, will not recognize Blu-ray blu-ray
 media so it doesn't make sense to view the Drive as bad.&nbsp; This is an OS issue.&nbsp; The drive worked with an eariler version of Vista 64 with SP2 and now with a reinstall, it doesn't.&nbsp; Sony tells me after I ran the BD advisor utility that tells me it sees the
 Blu-ray drive and that I have all of the necessary components to run and play a Blu-ray disk, that it doesn't and never will support Vista 64bit OS.&nbsp; Therefore, if I would like to "send in my drive" along with $500 they will confirm that the drive is working
 properly.&nbsp; That was so un-customer friendly, I can't deal with it.&nbsp; I paid over $800 for the drive over 3 years ago and they are still selling the same model for over $700.&nbsp; Why would I pay $500 to have them tell me the drive works?&nbsp; Why Microsoft doesn't
 want to solve this problem for it's customers, I don't know.&nbsp; If you're having the same problem with Windows 7, I will not waist my time upgrading from Vista 64.&nbsp; I feel like you.&nbsp; I paid a lot of money for this Blu-ray drive and can't even use it.&nbsp; I have
 a blank Blu-ray disk that I can't even burn a backup of my music or pictures too.<br />
<br />
I have upgraded my BIOS and Motherboard (ASUS) software.&nbsp; The BIOS sees the Blu-ray drive as it did before I upgraded to latest s/w.&nbsp; My Blu-ray drive is in the primary IDE slot on the motherboard.&nbsp; I've checked the connections both at the drive and at the
 slot.&nbsp; The only thing I haven't done is go and buy another IDE cable and try that to see if one or more of the pins/wires have been damaged but I believe it's unlikely since again, the drive will play and read/write a regular DVD disk.&nbsp; I have done as Sony
 suggested, uninstalled the Primary IDE references in Device manager in IDE/SATA (sp) and rebooted and they just come back after Windows sees the drive.&nbsp; Please keep pluging away at this and I'll do the same.&nbsp; Bottom line is that Microsoft has done something
 or added something in Vista/Windows 7 in either the service packs or updates that have shut down the support for this drive and it makes me terribly frustrated that no one will take ownership with the problem which leaves you and me (And many others) I assume
 that are having the same problem left with a very expensive Blu-ray drive that makes a great DVD/CD reader/writer.<br />
<br />
Please respond if you've made any progress.<br />
<br />

            Just spoke with a friend at MS and he told me that Sony wants $30/unit license fee for Blu-Ray support and Microsoft would not pay the license fee.&nbsp; So I guess anyone that can't read a Blu-Ray disk in thier drives, will just put a flower pot on top of
 them for the time being.<br />

            Gary&nbsp; -&nbsp; I understand what you said but I tried going back to my original Sony Vista base Recovery disc and Bluray support is not even there. It should be since that is the base system that delivered it.<br />
<br />
I am investigating a new area that may be have modifie the OS. The recovery disc failed on installing 2 software products that came from Sony. Roxio and Sonic.<br />
Both Roxio and Sonic display my blu ray drive as a blu ray drive while the rest of Vista sees it as a normal DVD (as you indicated). Both have a common module, the PX engine. The PX engine&nbsp;software adds another driver to the base DVD driver. So I am testing
 and researching PX engine to see if it can fix my missing blu ray support.<br />
<br />
I'll keep you posted if I am successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Gary&nbsp; -&nbsp; I have an update for you on the "cannot read Blu Ray media" issue we both experienced.<br />
<br />
I have fixed my problem and can recognize and playback Blu ray movies. <br />
Here is what I did to obtain these results.<br />
<br />
I reinstalled my base VISTA system from the SONY recovery disks, I slowly then reinstalled EACH SONY patch in "chronological" sequence. I rebooted many times to allow each patch to completely install. I ignored one patch that updated the VISTA registery for
 viewing CD/DVD problem caused by Roxio or iTunes.<br />
<br />
After applying approximately 50+ SONY patches I got Blu Ray playback working!!!<br />
NO BLU RAY FIRMWARE PATCHES WERE NEEDED.<br />
<br />
I kept creating "system checkpoints" so I can return to any point if needed.<br />
<br />
Then I applied all the Microsoft VISTA patches all the way to VISTA SP2. I am now current and very stable.<br />
<br />
So I came to the conclusion that you must be very careful in the sequence you apply all your patches and watch any changes software makes to the registery.<br />
<br />
I plan to upgrade (overlay) VISTA Home Premium with Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrade when it gets released later this month.<br />
<br />
I suggest you investigate your install sequence and I wish you good luck!<br />

            Mike, I could re-install Vista Ultamate that I originally purchased, as I have just done that and that is when I saw that the blu-ray support was gone.&nbsp; Where I am confused a bit is when you say you "continued to reinstall each SONY patch in chronological
 sequence".&nbsp; Would those be the same updates that I would be getting from Microsoft to upgrade Vista all the way through to SP2, which I have installed now?&nbsp; If so, are you saying to continue to update a MS patch one at a time, reboot and then check to see
 if I have blu-ray support?&nbsp; If not, then update the next patch, etc, etc,??&nbsp; I can see where this would be a huge time sink.&nbsp; Also, like I said eariler, Where MS chimed in and said I should have the Drive worked on by SONY, that would be a nice option except
 SONY wants $500 to look at the drive, that worked before I lost my original OS and had to re-install to get back to where I am now.&nbsp; I'm not going to pay Sony $500 to look at a drive that worked fine until I had to upgrade my OS and then stopped working.&nbsp;
 It would be cheaper for me to just go out and buy a new drive (It wouldn't be a SONY) and start all over again, but at this point, I have no confidence that any bly-ray drive will work as advertised or AT ALL.&nbsp; Let me know about the SONY patch thing?&nbsp; Is this
 an OEM version of Vista that was bundled?<br />
<br />
thanks<br />
<br />

<p>Hello.&nbsp; I am having the same issue with my drive.&nbsp; I to have gotten the run-around with going back between microsoft and sony.&nbsp; I upgraded from vista 64 to 7 ultimate.&nbsp; I was using powerDVD9 and was able to playback blu ray with out any issues. I then updated
 drivers and have never been able to play back since then.&nbsp; I have done a new install of 7 ultimate and am troubleshooting hoping I can find a way to make it work.&nbsp; As of yesterday microsoft said take it up with sony, sony told me my drive is not supported
 with windows 7. BUT I have played back blu ray using windows 7 and so I know there is a way.&nbsp; If I come up with anything I will post it. Best of luck.<br />

            Hi, I am curious if anyone has a solution for this problem. I have been able to play Blu-ray movies on Vista (with WinDVD 2010) without a hassle (just a cleanup of the laser lens with a q-tip was needed). After upgrading to win7 the explorer all of a sudden
 does not recognize BD media anymore, only CD/DVD's.

            I am stuck here with the same issue. It has worked for me in Windows 7 Ultimate N before and now it won't do any more.<br />
The drive still works with CDs/DVDs and using another operating system i can still vie files on bluray discs so imho the drive is ok.<br />
The drive itself was hacked to bypass aacs authentication but even rolling back the hack did not help me out.
