<h2>            access denied on C&#58; drive due to accidental security user name deletions on C&#58;drive properties</h2>
                    
<p>By accident I deleted all group and user names in the security properties of the C: drive</p>
<p>shortly after I tried to access the C: drive and found out that access was restricted to it.</p>
<p>I tried using the security editor but I'm also locked out from that because I dont have permission, even though I'm running the current user under administrative settings.</p>
<p>This is very troublesome because I have most of &nbsp;my computer files located in the C: drive, and I'm unable to run application shortcuts from the desktop since the directory paths of all the applicaions shortcuts lead to the C: drive, which is is inaccessible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I have tried to disabled the UAC and other services that relate to the user name and groups &nbsp;but that too Is "access denied"..</p>
<p>I am not able to run CMD and RUN.exe from normal mode but I can in safe mode with command prompt,</p>
<p>so I believe that any possible solution would have to be done under safe mode with CMD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also tried to follow this following instructions &nbsp;but I had no success because the instructions was for someone with a vista and some of the file directories that are mentioned their is not applicatible for Windows 7.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I heard that formatting the drive can bring back the factory settings and the previous user names, but formatting is not an option for me, I never run'ed a back up of the C: drive or any of its contents, so loosing all that data would be devastating to my
 financial and emotional state.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is their a way to bring back the user names that I once has under the &nbsp;C: drive security properties?</p>

            Hi Elizabeth
<br />
<br />The old format menu was removed a long time ago . . .
<br />
<br />The different formatting options have been mostly moved onto the Home tab
<br />
<br />Select the text you want to format
<br />
<br />No 1 will give you font formatting, No 2 will give you paragraph formatting options and No 3 will allow you to apply a style to the selected text
<br />
<br />For a professional looking document, the Style option is the best, you set out a style for normal text, headings . . . etc and the whole document will take that style, which leads to a consistent  looking document . .

<h2>            Right click on Windows Explorer items cause crashing</h2>
                    <p>I know this has been asked before and I tried using the solutions in this forums.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I used ShellExView from Nirsoft and started by disabling every non-microsoft shell extension. It solved the problem. However, I enabled all the items again, and funny enough the problem did not come back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However though, when I restarted the computer, the problem came back again. I guess I will have to disable all the extensions, the start enabling one by one and then restarting the computer to find the culprit. That will take me some time... I could do it
 by blocks I suppose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, Is there another way without having to enable one by one and restarting the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance....</p>

            Hi Dewa,
<br />You may use splitting technics: turn off a half of extensions and look in the guilty is in this half or another. Than turn off a half of problem half and you'll found a quarter with guilty extension. And so on. I think the 5-7 iterations will be enough.

    <title>Can I stop windows 10 from not updating the timestamp on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tbuser  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I stop windows 10 from not updating the timestamp on updates&#47;writes...</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this started in Win8.x or unique to 10, I know it's not in Win7 (except specific things like personal sql database), but what someone decided to do is to set *every* timestamp field of a bunch of files Windows uses as to not be updated for
 any file IO (I have a feeling it's a common function because it is even doing it to read-only things like .dll's).&nbsp; Process monitor can be used to see it via the&nbsp; SetBasicInformationFile requests (can look at SetFileTime API docs as well, -1 in a timestamp
 field says to not update the timestamp for io).&nbsp;&nbsp; The normal process to do this is to CreateFile(), then SetFileTime() with the -1 values, this was more used in the past for the LastAccessTime value, but since disabled in Vista, it's not as much an issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there is a problem with not updating the update / last write timestamps because you have changed data without a way to detect it (USNJrnl is no help).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is of course for backup and/or syncing everything (including logs and caches).&nbsp;&nbsp; There is no
 way to do it for these files without looking at the contents (and there are no FRS flags or Attributes bits that could say "assume this file is always changed") .&nbsp;&nbsp; I would like to know if there is a registry setting that can stop Windows 10 from doing this?&nbsp;
 I don't think the overhead of tracking update/last write times and writing on "close" (most of these are kept open until reboot or mode switch) is much of anything, but the decision to not update those times are problematic.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many files that happens to, but let's focus on the ones I know it happens to.&nbsp; The items in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\TempState</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wanted to narrow it down to a file.&nbsp; The TileCache_100_0_Header.bin file in that dir is one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is separate so ignore if it will add confusion:</p>
<p>I also know in the RE environment as well, it can update a shadowcopy file without changing its timestamp, say restore a partition to locked partition (or new area), unlock/notifyos of changes, shadow file is modified, restore again on locked partition but
 that file date/time not modified nor any USN, hence can't tell it changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT 5/20/2017: I see the on that particular header file the USN actually will get updated via VSS even though timestamp does not.&nbsp; But USN updates are delayed (perhaps that's by design).</p>

<p>Can you please check Event Viewer for error reports.</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged
 and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report
 at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the Details tab and check the box before XML View.
 Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally
 Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer
 was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important
 and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>
<p><span>If you just want a chkdsk report on your C partition select Start, Run, type "cmd" without quotes in the box and press the ENTER key. Type chkdsk and press
 the ENTER key and a report, detailing amongst other things a summary of how the disk space is utilised, is provided. If you want a report on a partition or drive other than C you need to go to that partition. To access F, where F is the required partition
 you type F: and press the ENTER key.</span></p>
<p><span>Copying reports from a command prompt can be tricky. Right click and select Mark. This enables you to highlight selected text and click to copy. You then go to an open Word, Notepad or similar
 file, right click and paste. The selected text transfers from your clipboard to the open file. You can paste directly into a reply message to most forums.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>We'll need to&nbsp;"do some digging" here. Please answer <em>each of the following </em>
[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. When (approx. date) did your late father&nbsp;purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. When (exact date, preferably) did the computer come into your possession?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1c. Did Win7 come preinstalled on the computer when&nbsp;he bought it, did he do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did&nbsp;he upgrade a (e.g., WinXP) computer to Win7? </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>1d. Assuming you have to sign when you start the computer, is your User Account password-protected?&nbsp; Is it your father's User Account or did you create a new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1e. How long (approx.)&nbsp;has Windows Update been offering the free Win10 Upgrade to the computer?</p>
<p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Is&nbsp;KB3104002, KB3109094, KB3099862, KB3108670, KB3108371, KB3108381, and/or KB3108669 listed in

<p>
</p><p>5b. How about KB3112343, KB3035583, KB2952664 and/or&nbsp;KB2990214?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt;&nbsp;</em>Is <strong>Java Version 8 Update&nbsp;65</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt;
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

8c. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>

<h2>            File History</h2>
                    <p>I ran the File History program to backup my files to an external drive&nbsp;and it appeared to work OK.&nbsp; It ran a little over 10 minutes, the light on the drive indicated it was writing to it OK, and ended OK showing how many GB had been written.&nbsp; &nbsp;But, when
 I ran File Explorer against that Drive to verify it had backed-ok it was not listed as being there.&nbsp; The amount of storage on the Drive was the same as indicated by the File History program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the first time I have run this back-up program.&nbsp; I didn't have the opportunity to assign a file name and I assume it was assigned by the system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems I have back-up data on the external drive without a label or ID.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know about File History or any suggestions</p>

            <p>File History is a continuous system that backs up constantly every few hours.&nbsp; It's not a "backup once and give it a name" kind of thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it watches the files you use and backs them up as you modify them.&nbsp; It keeps multiple versions of every backup so you can always go back in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apple has the same thing but they call it, "Time Machine".</p>

            <p>Hi Alana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for upgrading to Windows 10. We understand the inconvenience that you're going through regarding the internet connection. Do not worry. Let me help you regarding this issue. However, we need few details regarding this issue for further troubleshooting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the Computer?</p>
<p>2. Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? Is it Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>3. What's the exact error message that you receive when accessing the webpages through the browsers?</p>
<p>4. Are you able to access Windows Store without any internet connection issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be Network Driver related. Hence, I suggest that you update the Network drivers through the Device Manager. If the issue persists, then I suggest that you uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers from the manufacturer's website. In case
 you do not find any Windows 10 related drivers in the manufacturer's website, you may download the Windows 8.1/Windows 7 drivers and install them in compatibility mode. Refer to the following link to view the steps for the same:</p>

            Hi Ricardo,<br />
<br />
Possible BIOS issue is one of the possible reasons why this issue is happening since it's happening during the bootup process. We recommend performing an Automatic Repair to help resolve the issue. Click this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-update/every-time-i-boot-i-get-a-blank-green-screen-after/eb6d316b-79ef-4518-8c69-f6177e44c350">thread
</a></strong>and follow the steps given by <strong>Ramesh.Kumar</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, we recommend contacting HP support and request updating the BIOS and chipset drivers on your computer to see if it helps.<br />
<br />
Keep us in the loop with the result.

<p>Sounds like malicious software is afoot and it does not want you to use Task Manager to find and remove it. &nbsp;It knows what you are going to use and won't let those usual tools run. &nbsp;It wants you to give up and perform a Repair install, use a Restore Point
 or even think you have to reinstall your XP.</p>
<p>You can outsmart the malicious software (then fix it).</p>
<p>Using Explorer, navigate to the c:\windows\system32 folder (usually) and locate the taskmgr.exe file.</p>
<p>Copy the taskmgr.exe file and rename the copy something that the malicious software will not recognize. &nbsp;I like to call the copy:</p>
<p>c:\windows\system32\jose.exe</p>
<p>Double click jose.exe and see if the Windows Task Manager window will open.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;malicious&nbsp;software will not let the taskmgr.exe be a running process, but it does not know about jose.exe as a process (it might someday though), so you just need to outsmart it.</p>
<p>There are usually a few other things that also won't work that you would find out about later, so I recommend you do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reduce the chances of malicious software by running some scans. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs&nbsp;then resolve any remaining issues:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>These can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<div>When the scans run clean, we can fix any other issues.</div>

<p>Hi Jose!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wow!&nbsp; Thanks for the help. I have been on my computer all day trying to get somewhere with no luck! I did what you said regarding renaming taskmgr.exe and voila.... there it is working under seanmgr.exe now. So... that would mean that I may have some malicious
 software on my machine. Just so you know, I previously followed all the steps listed at this page http://www.pchell.com/support/taskmanagerdisabled.shtml&nbsp; to try and fix the taskmgr issue. I hope there will be no ill effect from it!!</p>
<p>Also fyi, I ran two scans earlier today which found nothing. One was Kapersky Online Scanner and the other was Microsoft Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool.</p>
<p>One of my big problems that started me down this road is I cant open any Google sites or Yahoo sites with any of three web browsers (IE, Firefox, Chrome). I cant get to my gmail account which is my main mail. I also tried logging on to another forum but
 I couldnt register because the registration page had a field that loaded through a google page, which would not load! I then tried to contact them and the contact page also used the same google page for a required field! So I could not even ask my questions!</p>
<p>Today I also uninstalled AVG free anti virus as I read on another site that it can cause problems. So I tried installing Avira and was unable to install. I spent several hours trying to get the install working with support at Avira Forums but I think they
 are out of ideas! So right now I have no antivirus protection running!</p>
<p>I have downloaded malwarebytes and I am about to run that. I will then download Superanti spyware and run that.</p>
<p>I will keep you posted.</p>

<p>Good job.</p>
<p>I think I must have probably once spent the better part of a day&nbsp;figuring&nbsp;that TM thing out too. &nbsp;Now, there is no more "trying" things.</p>
<p>That pchell WWW page is for a different TM problem and I don't care for their solution either. &nbsp; Sure - it will relieve you of that symptom, but it does not remove any malware from your system so the "solution" is incomplete. &nbsp;It does not mitigate the risk
 of registry editing either. &nbsp;It is a risky workaround at best - not a solution. &nbsp;If you have that problem, you probably have 3 or 4 other problems you don't even know about too. &nbsp;You would need to fix them all.</p>
<p>So far, you have not listed any scanning software that I would ever count on to find maybe even the most basic problems. &nbsp;Weak, weak, weak... - and they slow your system down with too much overhead if you just install them out of the box. &nbsp;If you feel you
 must run something like AVG, let's talk about it first. &nbsp;Avira - maybe a little better, but I am not usually a recommender (or a tryer).</p>
<p>Microsoft&nbsp;is certainly not in the malicious software detection and&nbsp;removal&nbsp;business, but they had to come up with something. &nbsp;Obviously&nbsp;they did not work in your situation.</p>
<p>Malicious software will also sometimes not let you get on the Internet and if you can, it will not let you get to Google because it knows that is the first place most people look for help, so it breaks it. &nbsp;Sometimes it will block the MBAM or SAS pages or
 other pages - it knows what you are&nbsp;going&nbsp;to use to try to find it and prevents you from doing it. &nbsp;It knows the software that will detect it and knows how to hide from it - or to keep said software from installing or running at all. &nbsp;The malware writers practice
 this stuff too. They are happy when you give up and mistakenly think you must reinstall XP (they win!)</p>
<p>Some malware will even prevent MBAM and SAS from installing or running, so you have to do the rename trick on that too.</p>
<p>Sounds like you have a browser hijack too, so your Internet may still be broken when you get done. &nbsp;The scanning softwares can't tell if some of the things on your system you did on purpose of malware did so it leaves them as it finds them.</p>

<p>Hi Jose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, so far you are right on! Heres my update. I Installed both MBAM and SuperAntiSpyware. I ran a full scan with MBAM first. I will post the log file at the end of this message. It found 750 items! I cleaned them all! I then tried Task Manager with cntrl/alt/delete
 and guess what....... it worked! I then ran SuperAntiSpyware and it found aprox 280 items which I also cleaned. Most of them were tracking cookies. I then tried the Avira install after that and voila, It also installed without any problems! So... now the big
 test..... can I load any google sites????? Doh! google still not opening. So then I tried Yahoo and found I can now open Yahoo! At least I can search online now! I then ran MBAM once more and it found nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So... Great! Thank you very much for the help! Now do you know what to do next as there is still either some malware left or damage done by malware. I would really like to get to my gmail! Also If you dont like Avira what do you suggest?</p>

<p>That is a lot of stuff.&nbsp; I wold say that posting MBAM and SAS logs is too much information for these forums.&nbsp; SAS is good for tracking cookies but sometimes MBAM will miss something SAS will detect.</p>
<p>Sometimes there are some leftovers that the scanning softwares can't fix because they don't know if they are changes you made on purpose or not, so it just leave them as it finds them.&nbsp; This is usually a good thing, but the malware will "adjust" some things
 for you to trick you and (once again) so you can't use the usual methods to try to find it.&nbsp; The malware could probably care less about Yahoo! but does care a lot about Google.&nbsp; If you were malware and did not want somebody to find you, would you rather break
 their Yahoo! or their Google?&nbsp; (I would break them all).</p>
<p>What happens when you try to use Google and what is your browser?</p>
<p>What browser are you using for the Internet and if it is Internet Explorer, what version.&nbsp; Do you have Firefox, Chrome, etc.&nbsp; and do things work okay there?</p>
<p>We need to know more about what "Google not opening" means exactly.&nbsp; If you open your browser, can you get to google.com, or you just can't get to gmail,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What does not opening mean...</p>
<p>Here is a list of things to check when the malware breaks your Internet completely so it will not hurt to look at these things.&nbsp; If you make any adjustments, make a note of it so you can undo it if your momentum starts to go in the wrong direction:</p>
<p>Let's verify your network connection properties.<br />
<br />
Some malware will tamper with these settings and your anti malware software can't tell if you changed them or malware changed them so after removing any infections, it will just leave the settings as it finds them (this is usually a good thing) but may leave
 your Internet access disabled.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
inetcpl.cpl<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Internet Properties control panel applet, Connections, LAN settings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Or, from Internet Explorer click Tools, Internet Options, Connections, LAN Settings.<br />
<br />
These settings control your Internet access for all browsers.<br />
<br />
On most non corporate environments, there will be a check in Automatically detect settings and the other boxes are (like Proxy server) are UNchecked.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
Automatically detect setting = <strong>checked</strong> <br />
Use automatic configuration script = <strong>UNchecked</strong> <br />
Use a proxy server for your LAN = <strong>UNchecked</strong> <br />
<br />
<br />
Make any adjustments and click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Check your settings for the way your network adapter obtains it's IP and DNS settings.&nbsp; On most home systems, these settings should be set so the system will obtain the settings automatically.<br />
<br />
If you have another system on your network that is working, you can compare those settings with the settings on the system that is not working and make adjustments.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Network Connections and select your current network connection.<br />
<br />
On the General tab, click Properties.<br />
<br />
In the drop down list in the middle, locate and highlight the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) selection and click Properties.<br />
<br />
In the Internet Protocol Properties window, the usual selections are to obtain the IP and DNS settings automatically.&nbsp; Enable the following two options:<br />
<br />
Obtain an IP address automatically<br />
<br />
Obtain DNS Server address automatically<br />
<br />
The rest of the options in the screen should then be grayed out/unavailable.<br />
<br />
Make any adjustments and click OK, OK to save the settings.<br />
<br />
Restart your computer and test your connectivity.</p>

<p>Hi Jose!</p>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for your help and give you an update. I finally managed to get registered on that other forum (TechSupportForum) and they were able to help me clean my computer. I have the thread if your interested in seeing the progress.</p>
<p>http://www.techsupportforum.com/security-center/virus-trojan-spyware-help/504527-help-problems-malware-after-effects.html</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything seems to be great now as all problems are gone. Again.... thanks for the help!</p>

<p>That is good - I read the thread and that is a good forum to get some more advanced help with specialized tools from people that do this stuff all day.</p>
<p>I also participate in those forums (and others like it) and will sometimes just punt the issue to the malware removal experts. &nbsp;I know when to punt! &nbsp;The issues are always good when it comes out to a happy ending - especially one that fixes he problems instead
 of just giving up and reinstalling XP.</p>
<p>Your Task Manger issue is an interesting problem that stumped me once in the past for a little bit (actually it made me mad until I figured out what was going on).</p>
<p>I hope somebody else will come across this thread as an answer to their problem some other day and see that it is not hard to get TM running again in situations like yours and then finish fixing the rest by just outsmarting&nbsp;the malware a little bit. &nbsp;There
 are a few other XP programs that have this exact same symptom and similar solution that will allow you then to use other tools to clean up the little messes.</p>
<p>Sadly, the usual suggestions are try this, try that, maybe, might be, could be, expand it, copy it, replace it, repair your system, reinstall, etc. These would have all been wastes of time for you.</p>
<p>I am glad that you did not give up.</p>

    <title>windows media center freeze examining tv signal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> quadnutter  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows media center freeze examining tv signal</h2>
                    <p>I have a recurring problem.</p>
<p>I am trying to update my Windows Media Center tuner TV channels.</p>
<p>I am using a Philips SAA7130, Hybrid Capture Device and I am using Windows 7 Ultimate.</p>
<p>Since I moved to Windows 7 from VISTA,&nbsp;every time I go into Windows Media Center and try to update my TV channels, once it gets past enterting my Post Code for the UK and downloading the guide ok, it then goes to "Examing TV Signals" and then the computer
 freezes.</p>
<p>The only recovery I have is to power off/on the PC to recover.</p>
<p>I tried various solutions on the web to bypass this problem but none of them work.</p>
<p>It is most frustrating that the program freezes.</p>
<p>I tried updating this device with a new driver found on the Windows 7 driver list, as I cannot find a reliable one on the Web.</p>
<p>I have updated to 6.0.1.3 dated: 08/05/2009 Philips Semiconductors but this has made no difference.</p>
<p>Judging by searches on the web there seem to be many other users having the same problem, and also with different TV tuner cards.</p>
<p>I am using this TV tuner card, and it is plugged into an external aerial. This is the only method I have on my PC for receiving Digital TV programming in the UK</p>
<p>It worked ok when it was running on Windows VISTA.</p>
<p>Have you any suggestions please?<br />

            <p>All,</p>
<p>Sorry for the delay in responding. I never did see the file mediaCenterDataStore.db&nbsp;mentioned above so trawled the Internet and found that the best way to resolve the problem is to disable Windows Media from running. The PC then has to restart.</p>
<p>Then you re-enable Windows Media Center, and then open Windows Media Center and commence the TV tuning process and this time it works fine.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I also discovered that my TV tuner card no longer worked, so I replaced it with a PCTV T2 NanoStick.</p>
<p>I can now get TV working both on the PCTV s/w and also on Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>Everything is now working fine and this&nbsp;question&nbsp;can now be closed off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those interested this is how to disable Windows Media Center for WINDOWS 7 Users:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>START</p>
<p>CONTROL PANEL</p>
<p>PROGRAMMES and FEATURES</p>
<p>Select "Turn Windows Features on or Off"</p>
<p>You'll find it on the left side of the panel</p>
<p>It opens a new window</p>
<p>Look for </p>
<p>MEDIA FEATURES</p>
<p>Expand MEDIA FEATURES</p>
<p>Untick Windows MEDIA CENTER</p>
<p>Follow the instructions to continue.</p>
<p>This takes a while.</p>
<p>It is worth making sure you have nothing else running as the PC will want to restart after this</p>
<p>Reboot the PC</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now go back to the above process</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Re-Tick WINDOWS MEDIA CENTER to enable it again</p>
<p>It does not suggest you restart your PC, but I did anyway</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then opened up MEDIA CENTER in the normal way</p>
<p>I then managed to complete the TV Tuning process which took a long time but did not hang at all.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
