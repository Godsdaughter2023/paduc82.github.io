            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to determine just exactly which device has the problem because windows doesn't have what it needs to identify it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try updating all of the chipset drivers for a start, or you can unplug one attached device at a time until the yellow triangle in Device manager disappears. Then you will know...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may not be a chipset, but something attached to the controller.</p>

<h2>            What we want to see in Saints The Third&#33; Lets make this a popular one people and maybe they will listen to us the consumers&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>ALRIGHT LET'S BEGIN! First off I know this won't be in the game on launch date but let's see a modding tool. so we can create our own clothes, weapons, missions, etc. then make a user content store like what infamous2 did. I can say for a fact that people
 would pay 30 dollars for a dlc like this perhaps more. Second DLC should focus on adding new weapons, clothes, cheats, vehicles, missions. Third DLC should be focused on fun! add crazy stuff like super powers, like flying, laser vision, slow time. They say
 they want this game to just be crazy fun! well give us what we want and we will be playing this till Saints 4! and thats a fact. NOW to all the user's reading this let's make this popular and maybe we can get the developers attention. So let's hear your crazy
 ideas and maybe we can make your saints dream DLC real when this game hit's store selves!!!!! &nbsp;I focused on DLC but let's tell them everything we want in this game after all we are the ones paying 60 dollars for this game!!!!</p>

<p>I like the making custom clothing idea. &nbsp;Like having more decals and being able to add more than one to an item. &nbsp;The custom modding tool probably will not happen especially for the consoles. &nbsp;I just want more fun activities..I have been playing SR2 a lot
 lately, taking my time to really check out the sites. &nbsp;They have so many diverse areas that look great yet we never really get to appreciate them because there is nothing to do in them. &nbsp;Like th Marina for example..Its beautfiul with a beach, Casino's etc..yet
 all you can do is play slot poker and black jack. &nbsp;A beach type game would of been nice..and maybe the ability to site down in chairs would be cool too. &nbsp;I dunno just make all of these cool places worth hanging out in..The main parts of the city seem to be
 the only places with stuff to mess with. &nbsp;I would like more activites that keep the game going. &nbsp;Like at night clubs have a dance dance type game and beer pong at the univeristy bars etc. &nbsp;have a live football game at the stadium..like a random type thing.etc.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong, they will probably get my 60bucks no matter what. &nbsp;Though, I think the game is going a little over the top. &nbsp;i mean come on... &nbsp;tanks, air strikes... &nbsp; they got the character running around like James Bond. &nbsp;It just doesn't feel like
 Saints Row to me. &nbsp;They probably could of got away with calling the Title anything. &nbsp; &nbsp;I just hope you could still interact with your gang, and i hope they added more to that feature. Like not only being able to customize your character, but also each member
 of your gang; And it would really be cool if you can select between them, so you can play multiple roles. &nbsp;But i'm sure not much of this will be in there because the developer was spending all their energy shooting people out of cannons, which looks like fun,
 but could get old, if the game over all doesn't hold my interest.</p>

<h2>            make media player 11 work in windows 7 x64</h2>
                    I would like to use media player v11 on windows 7.&nbsp; how can I get it to install and work like I want on windows 7?&nbsp; I have been using windows 7 for some time now and there is one problem I cannot&nbsp; get past.&nbsp; I do not like the new media player v12.&nbsp; I don't
 like how it switches between two different windows and has been acting.&nbsp; Every time there is an update to the player and it is improved upon, I have adapted to the change and see it as mostly for the better.&nbsp; However, this v12 is an exception.&nbsp; I like the
 one window view much better with tabs across the top.&nbsp; v12 also does not have a mini mode that I can find.&nbsp; I liked the mini player that I could put on the toolbar and control the music without leaving my work.&nbsp; If windows 7 is so customizable, then why can
 I not install the version of media player I want?&nbsp;

<p><strong><span>Hi sedgewic,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You cannot install Windows Media Player 11 on Windows 7 as it already has Windows Media Player 12 as an upgraded version
 available with it. But you have an option to disable and enable version 12 in Windows 7 as and when required from the Windows turn on or off features option under Media.
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>You may refer the below link to view the option to disable and enable windows media player -

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Also, Windows Media Player 12 does have specifically two different modes – now playing mode and player library. The
 now playing mode is very similar to the mini-mode you have used with additional features. You may switch between the two quite easily by just using a single button. You may refer to the below link for details regarding the modes -</span></strong></p>

<h2>            United States Technical Support</h2>
                    <p>Are there American IT professionals working with Microsoft in the United States that customers can contact rather than dealing with IT personnel in India or Southeast Asian countries? &nbsp;I have just survived a two-day ordeal with a Windows 10 problem, which
 I am hoping is finally resolved. &nbsp;A four-hour "chat" session ended up in complete failure to resolve the problem. &nbsp;It took three attempts to get through by phone as the first two phone call attempts were disconnected. &nbsp;Today it also took three attempts by
 phone to finally be connected with someone who was able to resolve the final piece of the problem (hopefully).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later this week I intend to attend a couple of classes at a local Microsoft Store and perhaps I will not only learn something important about the Windows 10 Operating System as well as Office 365, but perhaps I will discover that Microsoft is willing to
 supply technical support to Americans by Americans. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Nil1234 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />

    <title>Slow Cold Boot &#40;but not restart&#41; on Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john cale  say:</h3>
<h2>            Slow Cold Boot &#40;but not restart&#41; on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>I am usually on the other end of this, constantly scouring forums for answers to others' issues, but this one is mine and it has really escaped me. Hopefully someone out there can help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem: </p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 8.1 Pro installation hangs on a cold boot. I have disabled all of my user-added services and it still hangs. I have a 256 GB Samsung 830 SSD as my boot drive which passes SMART testing and has no visible problems. For the last two years, it has
 normally taken under 30 seconds to reach the desktop and be usable from a cold start. Starting around three weeks ago, It is now a minute and a half, plus an added thirty or so seconds of slow processing once at the desktop where explorer (file system, not
 IE) won't open and a few other services won't start immediately. An added issue is that my icons start all-white and flicker after login, usually taking a right-click-&gt;Refresh to reset (however, I think this has been a problem since before the three weeks).
 At around 2-&gt;4 minutes, it's a usable and fast machine and acts normally until next cold boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- on cold boot (shut down, then power button) it will take 40-45 seconds after the Windows 8 logo appears for the spinning dots (it used to take 5 seconds or less)</p>
<p>- white icons appear once at desktop, takes a minute or two to reset and for all services to start</p>
<p>- on restart (using the restart command within windows) the first symptom of long boot doesn't happen, but icons may still flicker</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnosis:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Windows Performance Analyzer/Recorder is a wonderful tool but does not seem to have a cold boot option (one where you can shut down and take an analysis on boot), instead only being able to record a restart, which does not help since it behaves normally.
 If it does, please tell me, but I don't see it.</p>
<p>- Fast boot is not available on my system, so that is not a factor in this.</p>
<p>- I want to be able to see what is happening on a cold boot. I have tried a few utilities, but none work as I expect. I want to be able to see what services/processes/whatever are trying to load at a cold boot, just as you can with the Windows Performance
 Analyzer/Recorder with a restart.</p>
<p>- I am not a "try to disable A-&gt;Z services" person. I need to <em>know </em>what's causing this, not
<em>guess </em>at what's causing this.</p>
<p>- I am not interested in "don't shut your system down then" philosophies.</p>
<p>- If my tone sounds off, I'm sorry, but this problem has really frustrated me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard: MSI x58 Pro (MS-7522, BIOS up to date)</p>
<p>Processor: Intel i7 920 @ 2.67 Ghz</p>
<p>RAM: 24 GB @ 1333 Mhz</p>
<p>Boot drive: 256 GB Samsung 830 (firmware up to date)</p>
<p>GPU: EVGA GTX 770 (NVIDIA)</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1 Professional (all updates applied 4/8/2015)</p>

</p><p>Are you using Samsung magician software (or any other SSD software) to enable "RAPID" mode?&nbsp; Recently Samsung updated magician to version 4.5 and it has a problem with rapid mode especially in win 8 &amp; win 10.&nbsp; It reverts back to SATA 3gb instead of 6Gb.&nbsp;
 That doubled my boot time as well until I reverted back to SM ver 4.4</p>

            I do have Magician installed but my motherboard is SATA II (3 Gbps) only so that would have no effect here. I have ran a number of speed tests to make sure it is running on SATA II, tapping out at around 250 MB/s. I checked and RAPID mode is not available
 for the Samsung 830 anyway, so that is very unlikely to be the culprit. &nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Troubleshooting IR sensor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rawkin scarface  say:</h3>
<h2>            Troubleshooting IR sensor</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having problems with the IR sensor on my XBOX 360. Performance recently started degrading, to the point that none of my controllers or remotes can communicate with the Xbox from more than 3' distant, and must be directly in front of the IR sensor. Even
 under this circumstances, performance is intermittent at best.</p>
<p>I've removed the face plate and ensured both ends of the IR 'funnel' are clean, as well as the receiving surface of the IR sensor. This did not help.</p>
<p>Removing the bottom half of the case as well as the face plate returns IR functionality to normal, but I do not feel this is a reasonable long-term solution.</p>
<p>Are there any fixes which can be performed? Does anyone have any insight on what is driving this situation?</p>

            <p>Hey there Rawkin! This sounds to me like something that would be solved by sending your console for a repair. I would definitely suggest not trying any more repairs on your own. That type of thing will void your warranty and make you not able to send your console in for an official repair. Here's a link on how to get things started: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/repair/repair-process" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../repair-process</a>.</p>

                    <p>I've read through the forum &amp; can't find any other post regarding these specific error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on "get help regarding this error", the page is absolutely NO HELP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Upgrade App has told me on a few occasions that I was ready to proceed &amp; when I do, all I get is "Something happened. Try again later".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is frustrating and it's SMASHING my download limit (9 attempts so far, well on its way to the 10th).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the Surface Pro 3 would be amongst the easiest of devices to upgrade, based on the fact that it's a Microsoft device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please offer a solution / reason &amp; if not, please tell me how to stop the downloads from continually draining my download limit.</p>
<p>

            After spending 8 hours with Microsoft tech support on the phone, running every test possible and reading every forum out there I got the solution. My Surface pro refused to update to windows 10. What resolved the issue was downloading a recovery drive
 from Microsoft and resetting my Surface from that drive (on USB). It rewrote all partitions removing the error completely. It took a lot of time but the issue is now resolved. Hope this helps.&nbsp;

            <p>**** UPDATE - SOLUTION FOUND ****</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all of you folks that are still looking for a solution, I tried so many methods that were suggested that didn't work, but I finally came across a relatively easy method right here on this forum that solved my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to the thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-update-error-code-80070714/c49366ac-b14e-4190-a656-1d3011629325</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution for me was to follow the method listed on the above thread where&nbsp;SQL services in Msconfig were stopped, W10 update downloaded and installed, then SQL services restarted. Easy fix in the end. Shame about the many hours wasted looking for the
 solution...</p>

<h2>            Skype - Calling and Messaging</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am using windows 10 in my desktop pc. Since I downloaded Skype it appeared to have several problems each day. When I first downloaded it, I my contacts were all missing (I have used skype in the past, in my laptop) and I couldn't find any new people.
 I deleted skype and installed it again and it was working properly (My contacts were there and I could add new people). Next day, when I turned on my pc, I noticed that I couldn't send messages to my friend (I wrote the message but after pressing enter nothing
 had happened). So I reinstalled skype. Today, I opened skype, chatted with my friend, and then turned off my pc to do my homework. When I opened it, I sent my friend a message but an error appeared next to my message saying: message not sent. I texted a few
 more messages but the same error was next to them. Then, I restarted my pc and now I cant even post a message. I know it was long but im sorry. Care to help?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Does the problem have anything to do with the fact that my dad closes the internet on my computer everyday at 10:30?</p>

<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Please post any corrupt files here in case we can replace them with good files from the disk if there aren't too many.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning
 startup or documents (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
This could be caused by malware.&nbsp; <span>
While in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Safe Mode</span> with networking (click repeatedly on F8 during the boot process) try to run anti-malware programs.&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp; install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Sculpt Touch Mouse problems with windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new sculpt touch mouse and I have a HP envy 15, I'm using a generic Bluetooth dongle for connect the mouse and the computer, the bt device is working, recognize the mouse and working fine for few minutes, after a while the mouse stop working.
 If I turn off/on the mouse work again for few minutes and again stop. I test the mouse connecting to my windows 10 mobile phone and work really good without any issue, I test with a android tablet to and work just fine. I test the bt device and work fine to
 transfer files between the pc and phones, and test with bt headphones too and everything work fine.</p>
<p>I search in the event viewer and I get this warning&nbsp; message "The remote adapter (7c:1e:52:72:cf:42) is no longer a paired device. Its link key has been removed." and then this error message "The mutual authentication between the local Bluetooth adapter
 and a device with Bluetooth adapter address (7c:1e:52:72:cf:42) failed." In some cases I get this warning "Bluetooth HID device&nbsp; either went out of range or became unresponsive.".</p>
<p>I try a lot of solution found in the web like: using the troubleshoot assistant, try to update the bt drivers (it use the generic Bluetooth driver), try to uncheck the option on power management tab but this tab is not showed for the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else, I'm&nbsp; thinking that I waste my money with this product.</p>

            <p>Your inbox got corrupted and the messages may have been wiped from it.&nbsp; Close OE and go to the message store and move the inbox.dbx file to another location.&nbsp; OE will then create a new one.&nbsp; To get the messages from the older inbox you can try to extract
 them (cf. <a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/</a>) or you can look in the recycle bin or message store for an inbox.bak file and if it is present, then&nbsp;you can import it back into OE using the method described here:&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/backup.aspx#imp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/backup.aspx#imp1</a>&nbsp; (see that page also for details on the message store location and also see
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#2</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This happens quite a bit to OE users, as they let their folders get above a few hundred megabytes and once that happens they get very susceptible to the type of corruption you are experiencing.&nbsp; In the future, it is recommended that you backup your important
 messages, as this is likely to happen again, or your hard drive could fail.</p>

            You need to be doing that from an elevated cmd window.&nbsp; AKA Administrator Command Prompt.&nbsp; If you were doing that the command line&nbsp;Prompt would not be showing your User Profile (by default).

<h2>            Dashboard displays text in the wrong language</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody.</p>
<p><br />
I have a problem with my new Xbox 360.</p>
<p>As soon as I log in with my Xbox Live account on the console, the dashboard partially displays text in a wrong language. Two titles use small letters instead of capitals which would be usual in German. My Xbox 360 displays
<em>"filme &amp; TV"</em> instead of <em>"TV &amp; Filme"</em> and <em>"musik"</em> instead of
<em>"Musik"</em>. Everything else is normal. Only if I disconnect from Xbox Live, the dashboard displays correctly.</p>
<p>I read in the Xbox support sites the thread <em>"Xbox 360 Dashboard displays text in the wrong language"</em>. This recommends to change the Xbox Live region to the same the console has. Both were Germany so I tried to change to Austria where the usual language
 is German too. Unfortunately, this step did not solve the problem with the wrong text.</p>
<p>Could someone please tell me how to display the right language while connected to Xbox Live? And is it possible to reverse the region change without waiting three months?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Calendar Sync Issues With Google Calendar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rgeee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Calendar Sync Issues With Google Calendar</h2>
                    I have set up my google email and calendar to sync on the Windows 10 Calendar App.&nbsp; I noticed that some of my re-occurring appointments form the google calendar appear on the windows calendar and some do not.&nbsp; I have gone and checked and there are no differences
 between the appointments that show up and the ones that do no (when they were originally set up on google).&nbsp; I have tried to re-create similar appointments on the Windows 10 calendar app and they will sometimes show up for a couple of seconds and then disappear.&nbsp;
 However, they do appear on my google calendar when I log directly into it.&nbsp; Bug?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly reply: </p>
<p>1. Is the issue confined to appointments&nbsp;which are synced to Windows 10 Calendar app&nbsp;to Google Calendar alone?</p>
<p>2. Can you see&nbsp;appointments marked&nbsp;in&nbsp;Windows 10 Calendar App separately as well? (meaning appointments which you created in Windows 10 Calendar App that are not synced with Google Calendar)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest&nbsp;verify your privacy settings in Google Calendar and check if all the appointments are accessible. Also, post this query on Google Support and ask for assistance.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            FIGHT NIGHT ROUND 3</h2>
                    <p>Hallo, I'm wondering why there is no Boxing Game at all on XBOX&nbsp;ONE.</p>



<p>I've read in multiple forums that the XBOX&nbsp;ONE&nbsp;Players&nbsp;beg for FIGHT&nbsp;NIGHT ROUND&nbsp;3 to come back.</p>



<p>Most of the fans, including myself, think FIGHT&nbsp;NIGHT&nbsp;ROUND&nbsp;3 was the best Boxing Game ever with the best Gameplay-Engine.</p>



<p>Does&nbsp; in general anybody care about the request?</p>



<p>Since I've read, that there will be&nbsp;no new boxing games in the future, because MMA now is the hype.</p>



<p>Please bring at least a very good old boxing game back - FIGHT&nbsp;NIGHT&nbsp;ROUND&nbsp;3.</p>



<p>Regards Wolfgang</p>

            <p>Hi, this happens a lot with the Spider games. One shouldn't have to uninstall and reinstall the game every time, especially when paying for Premium Edition. So frustrating. It's affecting the April 10 Challenge 26 in the World Tour and has affected so many Star Collection spider games. This shouldn't happen so often and there should be an easier fix.</p><blockquote>

<h2>            Acer Aspire 5735z Windows 7 update to Windows 10 blue screen loop errors, need help ASAP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have an Acer Laptop I updated from Windows 7 home Premium 64-bit to Windows 10 64-bit. I updated using the media tool and it worked fine for about 24 hours. I then noticed that my CPU performance was at 97% on start up and I also downloaded a few updates
 to drivers and security updates....now I have the BSOD! Please help!! I no longer have my Windows install disc for Win 7 and I am on an error loop of the blue screen. I have gotten pretty much all the kernel errors, the IRCQ errors, invalid page errors, and
 each one just restarts my computer. I have downloaded the win 10 media tool to disc and to USB and tried to boot from both with no luck. Any suggestions kind friends???

 all of a sudden. I have HP Envy 15 Notebook Intel Core i7-4710HQ @ 2.5ghz 8 cpu with 16384 MB RAM. Recently checked my device action history, apparently i'm having a "processor x isnt running right because of firmware limitation" or something or the other
 error and it might be affecting my computer somehow? This hasn't been a problem before and I have recently installed Windows 10 and even updated all my drivers and tried reinstalling all that business and every game i play crashes after about 10 minutes of
 gameplay. Any ideas?</span>
