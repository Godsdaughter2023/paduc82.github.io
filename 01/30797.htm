<h2>            Abnormally high internet bandwidth usage &#40;something to do with Windows 10 download&#41;</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Firstly, I'm on a limited internet plan (12 GB per month). My issue cropped up earlier today when I noticed (fortunately) my bandwidth usage had crossed a shocking 1.3 GB in the hour-and-a-half or so I had left the PC unattended.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Resource monitor pointed me to "svchost.exe [netsvcs] with Address: C-0001 .C-MSEDGE.NET which later changed to a184-26-162-89.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com".<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, the windows update icon in the taskbar indicated a download progress of 38% even though the Windows update page on the control panel says there are no new updates available. The last big update of this proportion was the SP1 (around 900 MB).
 Please see the attached images below.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Killing the windows update PID in the taskmgr didn't help. As a temporary fix, I've had to downgrade my internet from 3G to 2G to slow down the download.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have a strong suspicion this has something to do with a botched GWX (Windows 10) program running in the background despite the fact that I've clearly not reserved my PC to receive the upgrade files. The 38% (1.3 GB) download progress also nearly
 tallies with the 3 GB or so total download size of windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if someone could help me put an end to this nonsense.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in advance.</span></p>

            <p>Seems the support guys are all busy on the Windows 10 forum. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>A full 24hrs later windows update continues to download this anonymous update in the background. It now stands at 46% complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning windows update completely off (which is counter productive) seems to be the only solution for now. It would help if someone can shed some light on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had other plans with regard to updating to windows 10: "wait and watch policy". Being on a limited bandwidth I had planned to update via ISO a few months down the line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is indeed Windows 10 update downloading in the background, I would like to have a way of confirming this so that I can let it complete and hopefully make an ISO out of it. I'm not expending another 1.5 GB on a rogue update that doesn't identify itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I've attached the download files from the windows update directory:C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\35832e431aaed2f5400e0c644d9e4252...You'll find a 2 GB temporary file, presumably the windows 10 update I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also happen to have a "$Windows.~BT" folder in C: drive (created on the same date as the tmp file). It seems GWX app has initiated the windows 10 download without my consent. Ridiculous.</p>

            <p>I'd be very interested in the outcome of this - I have the exact same issue!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the windows update finished quite quickly - takes 2 or 3 minutes to get up to 100% and then the process stops, but is happens every half an hour or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned above, when the Windows Update icon appears in the system tray the Windows Update screen from control panel shows no indication of any update downloading, and when looking at the installed updated nothing has been installed for several weeks.</p>

            <p style="text-align: justify">After a lengthy chat session with a support staff I got as far as knowing (confirming) that the already downloaded files are indeed for Windows 10 but couldn't get the information as to why the download was initiated without me
 having reserved via the GWX (Get Windows X) app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Therefore, as a next step I would like to let the download resume and let the upgrade happen. However, I would like to know if I can make an ISO of the already downloaded files using the&nbsp;<span>“<strong>MediaCreationToo</strong>l”</span>&nbsp;for
 future re-installation<span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span>As already mentioned, I'm on a limited data plan and don't fancy a complete redownload. So, I would appreciate if someone knowledgeable out there can confirm the Media Creation tool recognises the already downloaded
 files and not download the whole thing again. The chat session was interrupted before I could get this info.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">As it stands now the download status is 46% complete. So, if I were to run the
<strong>tool</strong> would it resume from where it left off or do I need to wait until the download is fully done before running the tool OR would the
<strong>tool</strong> download from scratch either way.</p>

            <p>I'm getting it too. "svchost(netsvc)" Process - coming from- "c-0001.c-msedge.net"&nbsp; BUT, only on my W8.1 that I'd already upgraded to W10. The W10 D/Ld was fast. A constant 10Mbps (1.2MBs) 1 hour for 4GB. And that's in New Zealand. the ends of the earth.
</p>
<p>My W10 pc, is now always D/Lding about 200MBs each time I start&nbsp;my PC. My other PCs. that have been offered GWX, but Ive not installed W10,&nbsp;from W7 and W8.1 upgrades respectively, Ive disabled the GWX in Task Scheduler from running or triggering (Cant recall
 which I did) But I never get any bother with them from anything to do with W10 or GWX. And No c-0001.c-msedge.net.
<br />
As you said, the "c-msedge.net"&nbsp;data, updates nothing at all in Windows updates, none pending none done. I DO NOT Like, the W10 Windows update system. No control over it at all, about what you install, or if you want them or not. A few improvements over 8.1,
 but many things I don't like. Even ess control over all your system stuff than 8.1. But it must be to do with W10, as the address is "msedge" As MS Edge is their new browser for W10. (Horrible, and mine wont even open.)<br />
Now I'm just about to check out another search option that I saw come up, it mentioned the c-0001.c-msedge.net data use. "Here is how to disable Telemetry and Data Logging in Windows" Is the title<br />
Maybe that data is to do with this telemetry stuff. Itd make sense. Ive noticed a lot of telemetry Windows Updates lately. I'm gonna disable it and see. I so hate W10 WSAPPX (WinStoreApps) that Auto update and you cant stop them. Apps Ive never used. I Uninstall
 each WinStoreApp I see updating without my say-so. <br />
</p>
<p>Some of them (ie; Edge), you cant uninstall though. Bl%#*#^dy "Office Hub"&nbsp; I Don't Have It. I Cant Use any Office stuff, unless I Buy it. I uninstalled the useless Office app that all it is , is a Please Uprade and Buy, box. But with that not installed,
 I still get Office Hub Updates. I think W10 is no better than 8.1. I thought every 2nd windows was a good one. was that W9? Will there ever be another W7 of the future, or near Present?
</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry, that telemetry post was irrevevant. Hope someone works it out.</p>

            My solution was to go to "Disk Cleanup", click on "clean up system files" and then delete everything to do with temp files, Windows Defender, Windows update Log files, Delivery Optimization Files, and anything related to upgrades and old Windows installations
 and anything you think you can part with. &nbsp;I rebooted, and I did see some network/cpu usage from the process, but after a little while it tapered down to nothing.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!

            I also faced the same issue, but it was fixed automatically. It might sound funny but as i opened the malwarebytes website to downlod it for a check, the download of the svchost process got over. I know doesn't have any connection with it, but i felt like
 the process got scared of malwarebytes. :P

            Wait till you actually run Windows 10. This goes on all the time. svchost downloads all sorts of anonymous stuff and screws up bandwidth on a regular basis. You also can't control when actual recognised updates happen unless you use wi-fi, which you may
 be able to mark as metered.

<h2>            Major crash and now nothing will work</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP 110-243w Desktop upgraded to windows 10 from 8.1. The upgrade was just after I bought it a few years ago, and has caused no problems that I can tell. I'm self employed and this is my work computer and has a ton of stuff on it I absolutely need.
 Yes I know how stupid I am for not having a back up. <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;I came in to work and got a bluescreen error on start up. It was VIDEO TDR FAILURE (IGKMD64). It did its information gather to 100% but never restarted itself so I just left it alone for a while. Three hours later it was still on that screen so I manually
 reset it.&nbsp;<br />
After it loaded it would sit on the password page but neither my mouse or keyboard would work. So I reset it again with the same result. I reset it again in hopes of going into recovery mode but anything I tried sent me to a blank (no code) bluescreen and restarted.
 Last restart got my keyboard working again but not my mouse. So I log into window and imediatly get the video tdr failure. I let it sit the rest of the day and it never moved so before I went home I reset it manually again and left it. The next morning it
 was on the password screen again with keyboard only functionality as before, but this time when I logged into windows it didn't bluescreen. I maneuvered to system recovery and initiated a refresh. It took a long time and I didn't sit and watch it all so I
 don't know if it gave any errors or what, but when It reset it wouldn't do anything. The power comes on the fans turn on and the disk drive starts up but then everything stops. The fans run and the power light is on but nothing ever comes up on the screen.
 I restarted a time or two and nothing ever happens so i let it sit again when I go home.
<br />
The next morning Its on a bluescreen again It says "your system failed to start we will restart etc" no codes, and a continue button. I press continue and it flashes a different bluescreen for a millisecond and the only thing I saw on the code was "USB".&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 let it sit all weekend.&nbsp;Now I'm back to the nothing again.When you restart it the power comes on the fans turn on and the disk drive starts up but then everything stops. The fans run and the power light is on. I cant get to anything as nothing ever comes up
 on the screen.<br />
I made an "Instillation media USB" but as expected it didn't do any good as I cant change how the system boots. I'm lost and I really need some of the files on this pc. Help?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
We might be looking at hardware failure issue with the computer, let try to do a simplified hardware troubleshooting. Turn on your computer with only the mouse, keyboard and monitors connected.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> If your computer still fails to startup after this test. We recommend contacting the manufacturer for possible hardware repair.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            Nothing ever worked so I bought a new computer. It was time anyway. So I switched to data recovery mode after the new one arrived. I bought a universal USB drive adapter and plugged it into the hard drive I removed from the old computer. I am able to recover
 all of my files, or at least all of the files that were important to me. &nbsp;I haven't lost anything that I know of, but I've had that computer for about 3 years and I don't even remember what all was on it anymore. Now I have a new question. Can I just buy a
 new preloaded hard drive for it and still get some use out of it or does it sound like something other than the hard drive? Or is there anyway to refurbish or reset this old hard drive as it sounds (to me) like it was a programming conflict? I have an older
 computer we only use to print shipping labels and it is on its last leg, and fixing this computer sounds like the cheaper option.

<h2>            Any Comparable&#47;Compatible Kindle Apps for Surface Go&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Recently purchased the Surface Go w/Windows 10 for mobile productivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I was thinking that it would be awesomely cool to have access to my Kindle app, which it doesn't appear to be compatible w/the Surface Go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that there is a Kindle Cloud Reader, however, it does not appear to be compatible w/the Surface Go either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another compatible/comparable app to Kindle for the Surface Go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geez, this is very disappointing if nothing comparable. I still have time to return the entire Surface Go bundle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Dear WandaP1<br /><br />The Surface Go comes with an S version of Windows 10- essentially only allowing installation of apps from the Microsoft Store.<br /><br />You can install the Kindle desktop reader by unlocking Windows 10 Home for free from the Store app by searching for "S mode" and following the instructions from there.

            What protection will I have on the Windows 10 tablet if I switch out of S mode?<br />
Will the other Microsoft products, i.e. Word, Excel, PPS, etc still work properly if I switch out of S mode?<br />
Will I still be able to visit and download from the Microsoft store if I switch out of S mode?

            Dear WandaP1<br /><br />There is a general FAQ by Microsoft on Windows 10 S mode here- <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020089/windows-10-in-s-mode-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402008...</a><br /><br />Essentially switching out is safe- Windows 10 includes it's own firewall and system scan. However you must take care when installing applications downloaded from sources other than the Microsoft Store. Last I checked, the Amazon installer for Kindle desktop is safe.<br /><br />The rest of your office apps should work fine . You can still install apps from the Store.

<p>
</p><p>I find I need to rebuild my system.&nbsp; Are all the updates for Windows 7 Professional 64-bit (or Ultimate, I have both) available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further does Microsoft have a good clone program?&nbsp; If so, after rebuilding, I will clone the drive as my clean backup, restoring the drive before each new set of patches or new program installation as long as they may continue to offered, applying the patches/installing
 the new program, and then cloning again.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Security updates</h2>
                    <p>My desktop is running Windows 10 version 1511 and it keeps trying to download and update the latest security updates, it will download the update and try and install the update and it fails and I get a message saying that Windows is restoring to the previous
 version of windows. so I tried downloading the latest version of Windows 10 (Windows10 upgrade 9252) the computer takes an age to get ready for the download then will ask for a restart and I will then get the same message 'Windows is restoring to the previous
 version of windows'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop is an HP Envy Phoneix with an I7 processor 32Gb Ram and 64 bit encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have these issues with my laptop which is the same standard except it has 16GB Ram and is running version 1703 of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how do I stop the desktop trying to install these upgrades and failing or how do I get it upgrades successfully.</p>

<br />
<br />-----------------
<br />
<br />To Update :
<br />
<br />Remove any 3rd party antivirus/security program - fully uninstall it and them run its makers removal tool. Windows Defender in Windows 10 is a fully functional antivirus.
<br />
<br />Remove ALL the peripheral devices you can.
<br />
<br />You can now try to run the Media Creation Tool to Update.

<br />
<br />If no luck, and I would do this anyway after updating the BIOS, is to do a Clean Install with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update 1709.
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.
<br />
<br />Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<p>I have turned off the anti virus one thing that is not clear on your download page and that is what to download, I have been clicking on the 'update button' not the 'download tool button.</p>
<p>So I am waiting for the machine to do its thing after clicking the Update button which did not work previously because I had the Antivirus working, if it does not work with AVG turned off I will try the create installation media button with AVG turned off
 and see what happens, I will advise the outcome when the desktop finally decides to work. Did I say that this process takes hours to preform!</p>

            Turning off AVG is not sufficient. You actually need to fully uninstall AVG and then run its removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Windows 10 has Windows Defender which an excellent antivirus with superior compatibility. The new Fall Creators Edition adds Exploits, Controlled Folder, access and more. And you lose all of that if WD is off.

            Thanks for the advice NOT, it cost me $160.00 to have things set right after following your advice, AND my computer is still doing the same thing. So I suggest that a Microsoft Engineer (if there is such a thing) get off his bum and deliver an up date
 that will work on version 1511.<br />
I am not happy with the cost this has incurred or the bad advice!<br />

<h3> rezarose  say:</h3>
<h2>            PATA support and run windows 7 but Windows 7 not install in SATA Hard disk. all in intel 945 chipset motherboard.</h2>
                    
<p>///////I troubleshoot more than one pc with dual boot system which run windows xp and windows 7. Which system are most latest- intel g31 chipset, 2gb ram, 500 gb sata hdd, 2.5 ghz intel dual core etc.///////////</p>
<p>But, NOW i face some installation problem with my pc.</p>
<p>Yesterday I run my pc smoothly with windows 7 with 2 ghz pentium 4, 1 gb ram, 80 gb pata hdd, 945 chipset motherboard etc. I need more storage area, so I purchase a hitachi 500 gb sata hdd. my motherboard has one pata connetor and two sata connetor. I use
 the pata connector to attach my hdd and dvd. they worked fine.</p>
<p>BUT, when I attach my new 500 gb sata hdd to sata connector and remove the 80 gb pata hdd. Only dvd attach with pata connector. I insert my windows 7 installtion dvd to the drive and restart my pc and go to bios. This is AMIBIOS. I find bios recognize the
 sata hdd as primary master and dvd to secondary slave drive. I also find sata drive mark in IDE form. (Their also RAID and AHCI also available.)</p>
<p>I save the configuration and reboot. After reboot, When pc want to start from dvd, I press the space key from keyboard and the setup start to copy installation file in 2 stage and I find it complete the copy process. And pc going to start up, BUT, BUT a
 green color bar running through a tube for about 2 hours. Nothing happen.</p>
<p>Second term. I reboot my pc and insert windows xp installation cd to drive. and it install the xp without any disturb. And windows xp run in 500 gb sata hdd smoothly.</p>
<p>Then, I insert my windows 7 dvd to drive and INSTALL WINDOWS dialog box appeared. I choose Install now and after that "setup is copying temporary files" completed. A new window come and it has a dialog box and two panel in lower area. (I write detail to
 check out my fault).</p>
<p>Then, I click on "Do not get the latest updates for installtion" from "Get important updates for installation" dialog box. Then, Licence term appeared and I accept it by click on check box and I click on next.I choose "custom (Advanced)" from "Which type
 of installtion do you want" dialog box.</p>
<p>Then, Where do you install windows diaglog appear. I see all of my sata hard disk partition. And I mark a GREAT POINT here.I do not find the tools to make partition, delete partition, format, extend, delete, new etc. Somewhere I seen a option like "DRIVE
 OPTIONS (<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A</span>DVANCED), and I dont find that option.</p>
<p>I just find a dialog box like this- http://www.blackviper.com/Articles/OS/Install_7/images/image2_3.html (without drive options)</p>
<p>Are there any problem with "Load Driver" option?</p>
<p>I select Disk 0 Patition 3: New Volume (H:). And click on next. Then in new dialog box "copying windows files" fully completed. And "Expanding Windows files" complete only 27% and system going to restart. But when system want to the system show only the
 image like- http://www.blackviper.com/Articles/OS/Install_7/images/image4_1.html. And the system hang out.</p>
<p>That's all, I also hang out with my pc.</p>
<p>Note: I am fine with my old pata 80 gb hdd, when I connect it to my pc. There also I find another POINT. When I connect all sata, pata hdd and dvd to the pc. The pc also hang out.</p>
<p>I guess there are some mis combination in&nbsp;IDE configuration in BIOS&nbsp;or SATA HDD DRIVER requirement.</p>
<p>What you think. Please help.</p>

            Recently other people have reported similar problems. Updates causing some Windows sub-programs and services to run wild increasing CPU use and temperature which in turn causes the FAN to run more frequently and faster (noisy!).
<br />
<br />Go in to Task Manager, look in the Processes view. Click on the CPU column heading until the tasks using the most CPU cycle sort to the top.
<br />
<br />Then you can research (google) and / or ask here questions about the specific tasks that are using the most CPU. 
<br />
<br />Sometimes all it takes is starting the services dialog (using Run as admin), stopping and restarting the problem service.  That seems enough of a "kick in the pants" to make them run sensibly again.

            Yes some services are designed to auto restart.  Since MS wants to know everything we do, it is not surprising that Problem Reporting restarts. But it should not be monopolizing your CPU.
<br />
<br />If you feel comfortable editing the registry you could try the tip in this question and reply:
<br />DISABLE ERROR REPORTING
<br /><a href="https://superuser.com/questions/950997/disable-error-reporting-in-windows-10-home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/950997/disable-...</a> 
<br />
<br />It appears that the only option available to Home users is to disable Error Reporting via modifying the Disabled key in the registry.
<br />
<br />Open Regedit. Navigate to:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting
<br />
<br />Find the value named "Disabled" or add a new DWORD value with this name if it doesn't exist. The default value of this key is 0. Double click it to edit, change the value to 1 and save.
<br />
<br />This disables the automatic appearance of the dialogue where Windows is searching online to try to find a solution. You are instead shown a dialogue stating that the application has crashed, giving you the option to Debug. However, unlike previous versions of Windows, no error code is provided in this dialogue. The specifics of the error must be accessed through:
<br />Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Security and Maintenance
<br />Under the tab "Maintenance", you can click "View reliability history", which will show a list of all app crashes. You can then click "View technical details" beside each crash to get more detailed information, such as a the error code(s) thrown from the application on crash. 
<br />

            <p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade. </li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed. </li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.
</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications). </li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing. </li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.
</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start </li><li>Type: MSCONFIG. </li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard </li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup. </li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box. </li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.
</li><li>Click OK. </li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart. </li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>

                    I've got a Pro Surface 3 docking station and the power supply has stopped working. Had it 2.5 years so well out of warranty. Struggling to find a replacement here in Australia. Anyone got any ideas ? There's a Microsoft store in Sydney but as i'm in Perth
 you might as well tell someone in Alaska to go to the store in Florida .&nbsp;

<h2>            Game Passion problem&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Attention: First of all, let me say, that this is somewhat of a long read. If you have a great passion in games and about the industry, or is just a passionate gamer, this might interest you. So take some time to read it, you might enjoy it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey everyone! I’ve been an xbox live member since 2007(Jan I believe), and I guess you can say I’m new to the forums again. Yes, again. I was going on the forums a lot before they changed this up, and just simply before I stopped gaming
 for a while. Now, I certainly don’t want to vent to you guys, but since I remember this forum as a mature and adult like forum, I was thinking that this would be an “appropriate” place.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Just for<span>&nbsp; </span>a heads up, this might be a long read, but I believe you might find it interesting because of my passion(or previous) for video games and how I view them. It could be very similar to yours.

<span>&nbsp;</span>I’ll break up the whole read with paragraphs. </p>
<p>I’m currently in high school, 16 years old, and just finished my sophomore year. The beginning of my sophomore year was the first year for me in a private school. I’ve went to public schools most of my life, and around the country, and
 this was my first year at a private school.<span>&nbsp; </span>By around the country, I mean that my family moved a lot, my mom, pops, and older brother moved to Seattle in ’91
<span>&nbsp;</span>from Russia, and since then moved a lot(Dad is a doctor). I’m currently residing in VA.
<span>&nbsp;</span>from Russia, and since then moved a lot(Dad is a doctor). I’m currently residing in VA.
</p>
<p>But getting back to the point, I moved a lot, been to some crappy public schools, and my parents gratefully allowed me to go to private school. I took a lot of things for granted when signing up for classes there, thinking that the advanced
 classes there would be as easy as the public school ones.<span>&nbsp; </span>Just an insider, advanced classes at public schools aren’t really advanced, or much difference from regular classes, from my experience. So I took a lot of things for granted, and ended
 up with a whole cluster and couldn’t manage my time correctly. I ended up having a couple anxiety attacks in the first semester.
</p>
<p>Along with this, I had to basically give up gaming for a while. It wasn’t a huge problem at all, because I was already struggling with this internal problem with games a year before.
</p>
<p>Now it gets to the main part</p>
<p>A year before, like I said, I was somewhat struggling with games. This passion I had. I’ve been playing games since I was 2, and clearly remember some great memories at that<span>&nbsp;
</span>age all the way up till now. I have two passions, Music and Video Games. I take them to deep heart. I’ve been playing games since age 2, and always had great ideas for them. As for music, I’ve always been surrounded around music, started playing piano
 since age 9, and like games always had ideas. In a non cocky way, I describe myself as a visionary. Ever since around age 11, and going through rough experiences in public schools(I went to schools that were located near, or sometimes in the ghettos, etc)
<span>&nbsp;</span>I’ve been somewhat able to grip reality and be more above age level thinking than most people my age, or any people in my age group. It’s one of the reason why I can’t find a good, “best “ friend in this small town, just feel like my maturity
<span>&nbsp;</span>I’ve been somewhat able to grip reality and be more above age level thinking than most people my age, or any people in my age group. It’s one of the reason why I can’t find a good, “best “ friend in this small town, just feel like my maturity
 Is greater than others, but not in a cocky way.</p>
<p>So ever since then, with the above age level thinking, it’s helped me greatly in creativity, of course dealing with people and just reality in general, and doing things that not many would do my age. I started writing stories and such,
 and just saw that Video Games, can be just like any other entertainment product. Such as books, movies, etc. Many of those authors take it to heart, and do it not because to entertain people, but to send a message, to do something different, etc. I saw that
 the whole video game industry is changing, being up to par to many other industries, but changing in an artistic way. From the music(which by the way, im a huge fan of the music in may games), to acting, and such.</p>
<p>Well I can go on with my whole thoughts on video games, but hopefully you guys get the point. Anyways, I’m 16 now, and around age 13-14, things started to change. Of course with me having different ideas, different interests, being more
 of a cultural person in a way, by gaining interests in musicals, books, philosophy, etc. I saw all of this, that can be useful in my interests, in music and in video games. The things you can conjure with knowledge can be phenomenal. But one thing was missing,
 that feeling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That feeling of exploring something new in games, that feeling of enjoyment, that feeling of just nostalgia, and feeling of excitement in general.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It all started at age 11 when I had xbox live and saw my perspectives in games, and it was slowly fading away. Along with Freshman year of high school coming up, I went on a hiatus, all the way till(hopefully) now. I tried my best to play games, but
 it seems like those feelings weren’t there anymore; I still saw the visions and things that made me passionate about games, but that emotionally feelings weren’t there. Along with G4 being cut from Direct Tv, it was almost impossible to keep up. So ever since
 Freshman year, till the end of sophomore year, which is now, the present, I haven’t been that actively video game-“astic”.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Mainly during that hiatus, I started songwriting, more focusing on piano and music in general, and definitely feel that music is my true love and something I want to pursue in as a career.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Mainly during that hiatus, I started songwriting, more focusing on piano and music in general, and definitely feel that music is my true love and something I want to pursue in as a career.
</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean that I can love games too, or at least par take in the video game industry too. Anyways, This summer, I want to get back into it, and checking out some new games coming out, like LA Noire, I think I might have a
 chance of reviving that feeling again. </p>
<p>What do you think? What can I do? And my whole big question is, what do you think of my situation? I know this forum has been an adult/mature forum for a long time, and some really good answers, or at least reasonable ones, would be great.
 I know many people here are way older than me, ages from 20-40, maybe older, so I would like a word from you older folks, since you obviously have more life experiences than me.
</p>
<p>Overall, thank you for reading this(hopefully) and for your time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">To be honest I think you are putting too much stress on yourself rekindling a feeling or sense of belonging that you used to find in playing games. People do things for different reasons and gaming is no different.&nbsp;Let
 me ask&nbsp;you; why is it so important&nbsp;for you to feel the same way about games? As you get older and have life experiences, you'll feel differently about things. This is totally natural. So why's it so important to you&nbsp;Iceman?</span></strong></p>

<p>I think most gamers go through this, &nbsp;I did. &nbsp;I had gamed since Atari 2600, when I got to 13 or so, I did not game as much. &nbsp;I still gamed just not like I did. &nbsp;Out of 7 days I would game maybe 2 or so, &nbsp;about 4 hours. &nbsp;It came back around 23 or so.</p>
<p>You sound worried about and you should not be. &nbsp;Do what makes you happy and dont stress.</p>

<p>I remember when I was younger and I was always scared of bailing on my dreams and desires. &nbsp;I would always think that if I didn't become what I wanted to be at the moment then I would be a failure. &nbsp;Turned out, it's not so bad that life has turns and forks
 in the road. &nbsp;I had my heart set on going to one specific college and I already had my major... My life was set up... at the age of 17. &nbsp;Now 23 and nothing I planned happened. &nbsp;But my life is no less successful. &nbsp;Now all I need is an attractive person with
 boobs and life will be complete. &nbsp;And THAT, my friend, will never change.</p>

<p>Life goes in stages. You'll have your ups and downs. And you can't predict what will happen either, so when something unexpected happens, do the best with what you're given. If you want to keep your passion in games, keep it. You may not be able to play
 them often at the moment, but who knows, in the future you'll have plenty of time.</p>

<p>Chris: I understand the fact that things may change, but thats me talking. I've gone through changes, and it's definitely happened to me. But one thing i know for sure, is that, with video games and music, it's something that i've sticked by my whole life.
 Its something i truley love. I definitely thought I was gonna be a game designer/writer, obviously thats not my main point anymore, but definitely maybe something in future consideration. I think if you have &nbsp;a passion, and know that feeling, it will stick
 by you your whole life, maybe it wont, but definitely for a long time. Same thing with a girl or women you love, that one girl, that you want to spend your whole life, you know its certain</p>

<h2>            Unable to connect to windows services after clean Windows 10 install</h2>
                    <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded my PC from Win 8 to Win 10 a few months ago and had no problems. After the most recent upgrade to build 1511 everything went haywire with many, many different BSODs. After many headaches and failed refreshes / resets, I resolved to do a clean
 install, off a DVD I burned using the media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation appears more or less successful, but none of the windows services that relies on a user account or connection to a Microsoft server works, BUT I am able to use Edge(?!).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am unable to connect to Microsoft servers to Activate my Windows ("Unable to reach Windows activation servers"). Microsoft Smartscreen does not work, nor does the Windows store ("Check your connection"), nor does Cortana, nor am I able to log onto
 the PC using my Windows account. Using Edge, at all sites it tells me that&nbsp;there is a problem with the site's security certificate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am connected to the internet via a LAN cable to my router. In homegroup settings it says "Before you join a homegroup, you must first connect to a network". In Network &amp; Sharing Centre it says "You are not currently connected to any networks". How can
 I not be connected but still partially using the internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help GRATEFULLY received.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />
Tom</p>

            <p><span>Hi Tom,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A quick question before we proceed:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the make and model of your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This issue might occur due to corrupt or missing system files. Also if the service that is used while installing apps for users on the computer is not running, you could receive such error message.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Follow the methods below&nbsp;and check if it resolves the issue:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Check if the AppX Deployment service is started and running in Automatic mode. Follow the steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press Windows+R key and type “services.msc”. Hit Enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) Locate AppX Deployment service (APPXSVC). Right Click on it and select Properties.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>c) Click on Start under service status and select Automatic under startup.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>d) Go to Dependency tab and check for the dependent services. You need to expand Remote Procedure call service. You would find couple of services: DCOM Server Process Launcher and RPC Endpoint Manager.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>e) Close the window and look for these services. Right click on DCOM Server Process Launcher and click on Properties. Set the service to automatic and start the service. Similarly,&nbsp;start the service for RPC Endpoint Manager in Automatic mode. Close
 the services window. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Check if you still receive the error message. If yes, proceed to the next suggestion.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to do an SFC scan and see if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. This article describes how to run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to scan your system files and
 to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to install the latest network driver from the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are not able to login to using the Microsoft account then ensure that you are typing the password correctly. Make sure that Caps Lock is turned off, and that your email address is spelled correctly, and then try again.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to install any pending updates on the pc to check if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I also suggest you to look at the activation screen and if need be then activate windows online. If any issue with online activation then I suggest you to go with phone activation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may also reset the internet router to check if that helps. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information helps. Please post us if you need any further assistance with Windows.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Anju,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your swift reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't say if your advice was successful because before I read it decided to do another complete clean install, now&nbsp;including reformat of my main drive. This more or less seems to have solved it and I am back online and systems seem to be running as they
 should. </p>

</p><p>I did, however receive one BSOD regarding MEMORY_MANAGEMENT when I tried to link my windows media player's library to the music stored on my second hard drive. Not exactly rocket science... Anyway, I can confirm that both sfc scan and the memory check tool
 reveal no problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe all is well so will sign off for now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, my PC is a homebuild that has been operating happily for nearly two years on Windows 8 &amp; 8.1. Upgrade to Windows 10 was fine for four or five&nbsp;months, until it all went wrong on the latest update to version 1511. Suspect system file&nbsp;issue
 not hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help.</p>

    <title>Overwatch loot boxes not appearing&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minecraftmanrw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Overwatch loot boxes not appearing&#33;</h2>
                    <p>There have probably been similar problems to this, but I purchased Overwatch Game of the Year from gamestop, I already called them, and recieved the 10 free loot crates code. I entered the code in microsoft store, and it said the code was valid, so I started the game up, and to my surprise, there were no loot boxes whatsoever in my game! Is this a common glitch and is there any way you can fix this? Incase you attempt to send lootboxes to my account for whatever reason, It was on another account on the Xbox, minecraftmanrw7. And no they are not on another account, I checked.</p>

<h3> gronaldo44  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can&#39;t remove my password Windows 10 Microsoft account</h2>
                    I want to remove the password from my desktop at home. It won't let me because I logged into my microsoft account. I can't simply use a local account because the stupid system doesn't let me play my "Halo Wars 2" game I purchased unless I'm signed in on
 the account. The whole idea of me not being aloud to remove it is stupid to begin with. Whoever designed knows just as well as I do that if someone had intention to hack my PC and had it in physical form the password doesn't stop them in the slightest. It's
 just tedious and a false security. Please only require a password for accessing Microsoft apps not my whole PC. I ignored it at first, but this becomes exceedingly frustrating every time I boot my PC.

            This has all come about when I downloaded the Skype Update.&nbsp; There is no provision for me to set it up with my Skype Name, and shows zero money in my Skype account.&nbsp; I have now completely uninstalled the update and gone back to the 7.4 Skype.&nbsp; This software
 recognises my Skype account and the amount of credit and contacts&nbsp;I have in Skype.&nbsp; The only problem now is the setup of&nbsp; my IPEVO handset.&nbsp; I have tried quite a few times to test the 'Echo' but I cannot hear anything. to further the test.&nbsp; My Mobile works
 first time and every time I log into Skype.&nbsp; I am sorry to say that since Microsoft got their hands on Skype it is not only me that is unhappy with the new software.&nbsp; WHY?? would Microsoft Repair, Change a very good VOIP Software with something that does not
 work?

<p>I think you are completely missing the point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1, I cannot use my handset with the 7.4 Skype software, on my PC.&nbsp; I could always connect before,&nbsp;(like a fool), downloaded the latest update.&nbsp; Reverted back to 7.4&nbsp;</p>
<p>2, If I update to the latest Skype, 8.12, credit is missing, does not recognise my Skype name and my handset does not work.</p>

</p><p>I can make Skype phone calls from my mobile, but I am not querying my mobile as a problem.&nbsp; It is my PC that will not connect to Skype via my handset.&nbsp; it is an IPEVO Model:VP170 with the latest software.&nbsp; My PC is Windows 7 64Bit and has been for the past
 4-5 years.&nbsp; Latest Microsoft updates installed.</p>

<h2>            Finalizing your settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently we bought a new laptop with Windows 10 already installed.</p>
<p>After switching it on and going through the few settings it keeps on hanging at: ' Finalizing your settings'.</p>
<p>I tried both offline and online activation; both don't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Navneet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your quick reply. I have it solved now. I stopped a few blocking processes in the startup.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I am having the same issue, except desktop. I upgraded from 7 ultimate to 10. I got to the finalizing your settings part and can't get further. I have tried to remove all external devices, and do a hard reboot several times now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can I do?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What helped for me in the end was forcing a reboot by pressing the power button three times during startup.</p>
<p>Then it refreshes completely.</p>
