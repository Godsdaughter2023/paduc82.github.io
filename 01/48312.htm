    <title>Windows 8 won&#39;t boot - stuck on black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xaviira  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 won&#39;t boot - stuck on black screen</h2>
                    <p>So I recently ran a Malware Bytes scan, found a handful of suspicious things, and opted to delete them. MalwareBytes prompted me to reboot, I did so, and when it restarted, the screen loaded to a black screen with a moveable cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I reboot it brings up my login page, prompts me to enter my password and then as soon as I hit enter it says "welcome" and brings me back to the black abyss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get it into system recovery mode by holding shift and pressing "restart" at the login screen. Trying to boot it in safe mode gives me the same black screen. If I bring up commend prompt directly from system recovery and run sfc/scannow, it says it
 found and successfully repaired corrupt files. It says changes will take place after the next reboot. So I exit and reboot, and nothing happens. I have run sfc scan three times now, gotten the same message, and nothing seems to actually get fixed upon reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do now? My important files are backed up, so I'm not too worried about that, but I really need this laptop to work.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not worried about your Data as they are backed up, the manufacturer would have a Recovery partition to reinstall the OS from imaged on the Hard Drive.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am running on latest the latest Apple MacBook with up-to-date macOS 10.14 and up-to-date Skype&nbsp;8.33.0.41 and up-to-date Skype Meetings app. It has gotten to a point where it is basically unusable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My internet connection is 140 Mbps download speed and 7.0 Mbps upload.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled and re-installed Skype and Skype Meetings apps and unfortunately my issues persist.</p>

<span>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that the Desktop icons are missing on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the following information to understand the issue better.</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>For desktop icons, did you install any theme to hide the icons?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Are you using Dual Monitors?</p>

<h2>            Reinstall Windows 10 on Surface Pro &#40;2017&#41; but can&#39;t install Surface app</h2>
                    <p>I had to do a complete re-installation of Windows 10. I used the Windows Media Creation tool to create a new USB drive, mostly because I couldn't get Windows to create a recovery USB. While everything is pretty much installed from Windows Update and Microsoft
 Store, the Surface app will not install. I hit the 'Get' button and all that happens is the screen refreshes and then nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to download and install the Surface app manually?</p>

<h2>            Replacing corrupted Storage Folders in WLM with clean folders on the C-drive</h2>
                    <p>Somehow, a lot of subfolders in Storage Folders in WLM have become corrupted.&nbsp; This seems to have happened when I upgraded Win 7 to Win 10 and rolled back to Win 7 again (for personal reasons).&nbsp; Most folders now contain emails where, no matter which one
 is clicked on, the same content is shown.&nbsp; I have found the uncorrupted folders on the C-drive, but I can't seem to get them back into WLM, where they belong.&nbsp; Here's where they are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\users\San\App Data\local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Storage Folders (1)\Recovered Items\09-07-2015\Storage Folders\ Imported Fo b29\local folders\Imported Fo 84e\Recipes</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide detailed instructions.&nbsp; It would be greatly appreciated (and my wife would experience inexpressible joy upon the recovery of her hundreds of cherished recipe emails!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>... a lot of subfolders in Storage Folders in WLM have become corrupted ... folders now contain emails where, no matter which one is clicked on, the same content is shown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This isn't a corruption in the folders themselves or the messages they contain, but in the database index that tries to keep track of which messages are where, along with information about their status (read/unread, replied to etc.). From the path you quote,
 it seems that folders have been repeatedly imported from the same place as they were in originally, for whatever reason. A complicating factor in your case is that the path to these recovered/imported message files is getting longer and longer; eventually,
 Windows will say stop - very long file paths can't be resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as if many of&nbsp;those who revert to Windows 7 from Windows 10 experience a corruption&nbsp;of the store folder (the folder where messages, calendars and account settings are stored). Depending on how complicated your store folder is (many accounts, many
 calendars, many messages in many folders), it may be simplest just to create a new store folder and repopulate it:
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>While viewing your message list in Windows Live Mail, press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options. On the</span><span style="font-style: italic"> Advanced</span><span> tab, click
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Maintenance</span><span> and then </span><span style="font-style: italic">Store folder</span><span>. Copy the path shown for the location of the store folder.<br />
&nbsp;</span> </li><li><span>Close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes (the program will continue to run in the background while it does its housekeeping).<br />
&nbsp;</span> </li><li><span>Press Windows key + E to open an Explorer window, then paste or type the path you copied at (1) into the address bar and press
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Enter</span><span>. This should open your store folder.<br />
&nbsp;</span> </li><li><span>Right-click on the folder name in the navigation pane and select </span>
&nbsp;</span> </li><li>A repair&nbsp;should check that all the program files are present and correct and properly registered where necessary. To do this, close all running programs, then press Windows key + R, type
Enter</span>. In the window that opens, select <span style="font-style: italic">Repair all Windows Essentials programs:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;</span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a996dc08-2f59-43ec-b232-7d09f0289de3" /><br />
<br />
When it's finished, reboot the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><span>Launch Windows Live Mail and wait until the program settles down before doing anything. Then press Ctrl-Shift-T to start the
</span><span style="font-style: italic">Add your email accounts</span><span> wizard and follow the prompts to add your email accounts again.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> </li><li><span>Click once on </span><span style="font-style: italic">Working online </span>

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span></li><li><span>Leave the program alone for some time (an hour or two, or even overnight) to allow it to re-index all your messages, then close it down and wait again for half an hour for the program to do its housekeeping.

<br />

            <p>Thanks, Firedog, for your quick reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, after trying to follow your instructions very closely, I ended up worse off than before.&nbsp; Now,
<em>all</em> of the emails in my wife's Storage Folders say, "Message cannot be found."&nbsp; When I went to Windows Explorer, I found some of the emails in the Windows Live Backup folder, others in the Windows Live Mail folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's where the emails are:<br />
C:\ users \ san \ app data \ local \ Microsoft \ windows live mail \ live mail backup \ recovered items \ 09 07 2015 823 \ storage folders \ imported Fo b29 \ local folders \ imported Fo 84e
<br />
</p>
<p>Fifteen consecutive subfolders in <em>imported Fo 84e</em> from Aliene &gt; Pix are all empty.<br />
The next subfolder in imported Fo 84, Recipes, contains the following (key!) subfolders:<br />
</p>
<p>Appetizers<br />
BBQ dogs<br />
BBQ dogs Bu Fbb (empty)<br />
Beef<br />
Beverages<br />
Breakfast<br />
Cakes&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Candy&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Cassaroles<br />
Chicken&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Complete menus<br />
Cookies&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Crockpot<br />
Desserts<br />
E-booklets<br />
E-meals&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Ethnic&nbsp; (empty)<br />

Light fat<br />
Pasta&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Pies&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Pork&nbsp; (empty)<br />

Quinoa&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Restaurants&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Restaurants (1)<br />

Sandwiches<br />
Sides&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Smoothies<br />
Snacks&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Soup-stew<br />
Turkey&nbsp; (empty)<br />
Vegetable dishes<br />
</p>
<p>The rest of the subfolders in imported Fo 84e (following Recipes):&nbsp; \Recipes (1) &gt; Truth or Fiction are empty.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, if you drop straight down from Windows Live Mail to Storage Folders (1) and go to Recipes, (that is,&nbsp; C:\ users \ san \ app data \ local \ Microsoft \ windows live mail \ storage folders (1) \ recovered items \ 10 19 2015 29 \ live mail b
 823 \ storage folders \ imported Fo b29 \ local folders \ imported Fo 84e \ recipes)…<br />
<br />
you will find all of the (empty) recipes subfolders listed above but this time with all their emails. In addition, you will find the Aliene &gt; Pix folders above with their emails and Recipes (1) &gt; Truth or Fiction with their emails.&nbsp; The folders in recipes above
 which are not empty are not listed in the location in the paragraph above (\ windows live mail \ storage folders (1) \\\\\\\ imported Fo 84e \ recipes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, I need detailed instructions to get the folders and their respective emails into the Windows Live Mail program under Storage Folders.</p>
<p>

</p><blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>That simply means that the index is incomplete, not that the messages are missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>C:\ users \ san \ app data \ local \ Microsoft \ windows live mail \ live mail backup \ recovered items \ 09 07 2015 823 \ storage folders \ imported Fo b29 \ local folders \ imported Fo 84e
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't look right at all. If you'd followed the instructions, you would end up with two folders in the Microsoft folder, one new one called<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Users\san\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>and one old one called<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Users\san\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Live Mail Backup
<br />
</strong></p>
<p>They should both contain a folder called <em>Storage folders</em>. The first should contain a folder called
<em>Imported folder</em>:<br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp;<strong>C:\Users\san\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Storage folders\Imported folder</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The next problem is that the file paths are too long. Windows can't cope with file paths (including the file name) that are more that about 225 characters long. This is a problem that has been growing in your case as a result of repeated, unresolved importation
 exercises. For example, <br />
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>C:\Users\san\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Storage folders\Imported Folder\Storage folder\Recovered items\09-07-2015 08-23-30\</strong><strong>Storage folders\Imported Fo b29\local folders\imported Fo 84e\Recipes\</strong><strong>BBQ
 dogs Bu Fbb\A1B2C3D4-0000</strong><strong>A1B2.eml</strong></p>
<p>is 246 characters long, so Windows - and consequently Windows Live Mail - can't handle it.
</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>I need detailed instructions to get the folders and their respective emails into the Windows Live Mail program under Storage Folders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please understand that Windows Live Mail is only creating a specific <em>view</em> of the messages in your store folder. There is only one set of folders and files on your hard disk; you see one view of them in Windows Explorer and a
<em>different</em> view of the <em>same</em> files in Windows Live Mail. The one in Windows Live Mail is currently inaccurate, most probably because of the long filepath problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't be tempted to move files around in Windows Explorer. Any move you make will be invisible to the database index, which can only act on changes made within the program. This will only make matters worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disconnect from the Internet again, and disable your anti-virus unless you're using Microsoft Security Essentials (there's no danger while you're not connected). In Windows Live Mail, press Ctrl-Y to reveal what should be the entire folder tree. Can you
 see a <em>Recipes</em> folder anywhere? If so, select it so that it's highlighted in the folder pane. Now click and hold that folder and drag it upwards, then drop it on the topmost
<em>Storage folders </em>heading. If there are too many folders below Storage folders for you to be able to see the topmost heading, while keeping the mouse button pressed point at the little upwards pointing triangle at the top of the folder pane's scrollbar.
 The pointer will probably change shape, but the folder list should scroll while you hover over the triangle. When you see the
<em>Storage folders </em>heading immediately below the outbox, point at it and release the mouse button. Now don't do anything else for a long time while the program attempts to adjust to the change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how you get on. If this doesn't bring the messages to light after the program has finished indexing, we'll try a completely different tack.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello, Firedog,</p>
<p>You said:&nbsp; Can you see a <em>Recipes</em> folder anywhere?</p>
<p>Yes, but in two different places in the <strong>Go to folder</strong> pane.&nbsp; </p>
<p>(1) The first <em>Recipes </em>folder is in the original Storage Folders folder, but in the Live Mail app the emails in this Recipes folder all have the message, "This message cannot be found."&nbsp; It appears that dragging and dropping this folder would not
 gain anything as it would put it "back" where it already is. Whaddya think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Further down the tree, in the Recovered Items folder, I see this:&nbsp; Recovered Items \<strong> Live Mail Backup</strong> \ Recovered Items \ 09-07-2015 823 \ Storage Folders \ Imported Fo b29 \ Local Folders \ Imported Fo 84e \ Aliene, blah, blah, blah,
 blah, <em>Recipes</em>, blah, blah, blah...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be identical to where, in Windows Explorer, I found the list of 20-odd sub folders, some of which held emails that could actually be opened, including in the folder for
<em>Recipes</em>.&nbsp; In WinEx, there were the empty folders in <strong>Live Mail Backup
</strong>that were found full of emails in the <strong>Windows Live Mail</strong> tree in my last post.&nbsp; In the
<strong>Go to folder</strong> pane in the Live Mail app, there are no two similar areas , just the one at the end of the paragraph above.&nbsp; Don't know quite what to make of that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, am I correct to think that the <em>Recipes</em> folder to drag and drop would be (2) above?&nbsp; Also, after the drag, drop, and wait, what would be the next step?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>It looks like it. The idea is to shorten the path to the files it contains as much as possible. Since there is already a
<em>Recipes</em> folder as a sub-folder of Storage folders, you should rename the one under
<em>Recovered items</em> before moving it. Call it <strong>Recipes (new)</strong> or something to distinguish it from the one that's already there.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Also, after the drag, drop, and wait, what would be the next step?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go hunting!&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether this is going to work, but it's worth trying before we resort to more drastic measures. I haven't got any messages in folders with impossibly long file paths to test with, so you're the guinea pig!</p>

            <p>I know it's been a while...life happens!</p>
<p>I tried the above (2) soon after your last response.&nbsp; Immediately, WLM showed that the process was complete.&nbsp; However, when I looked at the content of the Storage Folders, many of the subfolders were still empty, and those folders that seemed to contain
 their various e-mails all showed the same email in the read pane...one that has a number of photos and is dated 9/16/2006 with an old ISP, @adelphia.net.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, when I finally returned to attempting to deal with this issue, the emails and the tree appeared the same as in the above paragraph.&nbsp; I felt that I should start from the beginning and see what Windows Explorer showed to re-familiarize myself with
 the issue.&nbsp; After noting in Win Exp that the tree appeared to be the same as what I had written down way back when, I went back to the WLM app, and something new had appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a window indicating that WLM was "updating changes to your account."&nbsp; Okay, weeks later something might actually be happening!&nbsp; I had made no changes anywhere; I had only looked around to confirm the continuing issue(s).&nbsp; It is now about 24 hours
 later, and it is apparently still "updating."&nbsp; There is no progress bar, which I would have expected to see (the window even has an itsy bitsy image of a progress bar in the corner!).&nbsp; The open-program icon in the taskbar for WLM has a green field moving from
 left to right showing some kind of activity, but that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will leave the program alone for a day or two (?) to see if anything really transpires, but I am at a loss for what to do from here.&nbsp; Perhaps it is about time for the "drastic measures" you mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!</p>

<p>Those are symptoms of an incomplete index, as I tried to explain above. It's vital to leave the program alone after conducting major file operations, like moving a number of folders around. Indexing might take a long time, and meanwhile you'll see strange
 things in the message list and reading pane. However, if the problem is one of long path names, then it could be that Windows was simply unable to carry out your requests to move the folders around.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>This has nothing to do with messages in Storage folders. They are quite independent of any mail account and its activities. It does sound, though, as if there's a problem with that account.
<span>Click once on </span><span style="font-style: italic">Working online </span>

            Thanks for your reply, Firedog.&nbsp; I clicked on Work Offline, but there was no response, I think because the "Updating your changes..." window is still open.&nbsp; It seems that I would have to cancel the update to enable the Work Offline button, but then the
 updating operation would cease, and there would probably not be an error message to copy.<br />

            <p>Okay, here's a new and, I hope, useful update:</p>
<p>Today, the WLM "updating your changes" operation was complete. Under Storage Folders, a lot of folders (maybe half of them) were absent altogether, and those that remained were empty, except for one folder that had only 35 emails, and those showed only the
 same email in the reader pane mentioned above (the one from 2006 @adelphia.net).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win Explorer, nothing seems to have changed; all the folders and emails are where they have been.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My thought is to delete all sub folders under the Storage Folders in WLM and try the CTRL-Y operation to import sub folders. &nbsp;If possible, import one sub folder at a time rather than a bunch at once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Stefan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In previous versions of Windows, one could use a script ("InvokeVerb" method) to Pin items to Taskbar. This is not possible in Windows 10, as the "Pin to taskbar" verb can't be enumerated or invoked using script any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a workaround, using a third-party tool. Check out:&nbsp;<a href="https://deployhappiness.com/pin-programs-to-the-taskbar-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://deployhappiness.com/pin-programs-to-the-taskbar-in-windows-10/</a></p>

    <title>Solution&#58; inadvertent resizing of text and icons using touchpad on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linkysys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solution&#58; inadvertent resizing of text and icons using touchpad on older laptops after upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>My upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 went smoothly except for one persistent annoyance. When highlighting text or desktop icons with my touchpad, it frequently resizes the page arbitrarily. This is actually the "pinch-zoom" feature which has been optimized
 for touch screen devices. If, like me, you find this feature problematic on an older laptop, here is the solution.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the Windows Icon in the lower left-&gt;Settings-&gt;Devices-&gt;Mouse &amp; touchpad.
</li><li>Under Related Settings, click 'Additional mouse options'</li><li>Click 'Settings'</li><li>You should now see a menu for your specific touchpad device. Scroll through the settings and look for "Pinch Zoom" and disable it. For Synaptics ClickPad you will find "Pinch Zoom" listed under 'Scrolling.' After clicking Pinch Zoom, uncheck the box 'Enable
 Pinch Zoom'</li></ol>

            Thanks for posting on this annoying bug! I have a Synaptics ClickPad, but I didn't quite find the "Pinch Zoom" listed under "Scrolling". However, it now seems like the problem was solved with the latest cumulative update (KB3081438)!

            Hello again. Although haven't experienced resizing of&nbsp;ordinary text (documents or web pages) when I try to mark/highlight after the update, I just noticed for the first time what You just mentioned:&nbsp;If I move two fingers on the touch pad, the "pinch-zoom"
 feature changes the size of my desktop icons. If they are enlarged too much, they will move around and switch positions as well. Is this a new feature in W10, or was it like this in W8.1 as well? This is very annoying, since&nbsp;it is bound to happen accidentally
 from time to time!

            <p>For those using the Synaptics ClickPad Driver you might have issues from the above instructions finding where the "Pinch Zoom" is located.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you click on "Additional mouse options" the "Mouse Properties" dialog will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the "Device Settings" Tab there is a button called "Settings" click on this and it will bring up the "Properties" Dialog for the ClickPad.&nbsp; It is on this dialog that you will find this option mentioned.</p>

            Thank you. I was wrong about the problem being fixed, it is still there. I am able to turn off pinch-zoom, but I would really hate to do so, since this is a feature that I use all the time. I want to be able to pinch-zoom documents, web pages etc., but
 I don't want my desktop to get messed up when I accidentally do it outside the object. This also applies for pinch-zooming with the touch-screen. Who wants the desktop icons to get messed up and move around and become gigantic when your fingers swipe over
 the screen by accident? I don't know if it's a W10 issue or if it was there with W8.1 as well, but is is utterly annoying.

            This is a terrible answer. I still want to be able to pinch-zoom in applications that are made for pinch-zooming, like maps. But allowing pinch-zoom to affect the size of my desktop icons is ridiculous. I don't want to turn off pinch-zoom entirely. I just
 want to keep pinch zoom from affecting that one, isolated item.<br />

<p>I am referencing from a Dell Precision 7520 using Windows 10,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you click on "Additional Mouse Properties", you should open a window called Mouse Properties Box with "Dell Touchpad" as one of the buttons just below the title bar. Click on that and look at the bottom of this window for hyperlink&nbsp; "Click to Change
 Dell Touchpad settings".</p>
<p>Click on that to open a new window called Dell Pointing Devices.&nbsp; On the left side of this window, there should be a title called "Gestures".&nbsp; Click on that&nbsp; and on the right side of the window half way down, you should see a heading called "Two Finger Gestures".&nbsp;
 Beneath that heading there should be a checked box called "Zoom".&nbsp; Uncheck it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple!!??.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to use a "One Finger Gesture" to express your appreciation.</p>

<p>How do you access your email?&nbsp; That is, do you use a web browser to go to a website or do you open a program on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that you are using a web-based email service and are clicking a "mail to" link on a web site or trying to use "Send to ... mail recipent" from some right-click menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue here is that back when "mail to" was first implemented, most people had email applications installed on their computer.&nbsp; These days, most people use a web-based email service such as Gmail or Outlook.com (formerly Hotmail) or even (gasp!) AOL mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't use this "integrated" method of sending email with a web-based client.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you actually have an email client program installed, please let us know what it is.</p>

<p>I have Microsoft Outlook.com.&nbsp; I have Windows 7 operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's say I go to some the web site of one of my U.S. Senators as an example.&nbsp; While on the site I click on the name of one of her staff people to send him an email.&nbsp; When I click on his name I get the notice I posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you are saying I have no way to contact the staff member since I am using Outlook.com, is that correct?</p>

<p>In the situation you describe, you can't simply click on the link to send an email.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're lucky that there's even a way for you to send a "real" email.&nbsp; Many government officials -- including many, if not most, U.S. Senators --&nbsp; don't reveal their email addresses on their web sites and only offer a "Contact Me" web fill-in form.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you have to do is copy the email address and then go to Outlook.com and compose an email in the normal manner, pasting the copied email address in the "To" field.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the web browser you're using and how the web site is coded, you may be able to do this by right-clicking on the email link and selecting "Copy email address."&nbsp; If you have difficulty figuring out how to do it, give me a representative web site
 from which you want to send an email and let me know what web browser you're using.</p>

<h2>            Forcing display resolution on W10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I recently installed W10 on my PC whose display is driven by an ATI Radeon X1550 adapter.</p>
<p>The Windows driver let only select 64Hz resolutions, although the optimal resolution of my Samsung monitor is 1680*1050 at 60Hz.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The closest available resolution is 1600*1200 at 64Hz, but the result is very poor. I need a way to force the above optimal resolution.</p>
<p>TIA,</p>

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t figure out how to change my NAT type to open from moderate</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Before I start, I'll say that I have read the sticky, http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/157383.aspx, and couldn't figure out how to fix the problem with that link.</p>
<p>My Xbox 360 connects to my internet through a Netgear WN2000RPT repeater, which repeats the wireless signal from my Motorola NVG510 router.</p>
<p>i.e. Motorola NVG 510 -------&gt; Netgear WN2000RPT repeater/extender ---------&gt; Xbox 360</p>
<p>I have tried going through my router settings to Firewall --&gt; NAT/Gaming ---&gt; and adding Xbox 360 Live from the dropdown menu. The trouble is that the IP address I got from my xbox does not appear under the "needed by device" dropdown menu. Maybe I have
 the wrong IP from the xbox?</p>
<p>I have tried adding the ports needed for Live and Black ops manually to this list but black ops still says I have a moderate NAT type.</p>
<p>What can I do? Thanks</p>

<p>Do you still get a moderate NAT when connected direct to the Motorola? (bypassing the Netgear)</p>

<p>Yes, I have tried the portforward but I encounter a problem using it. The IP address that I found on my Xbox is not listed under the drop down menu "needed by device"</p>

<p>You could try it manually yes but I would expect it to show up as it is now</p>
<p>Try entering these details into the Xbox:-</p>
<p>IP Address: 192.168.1.50</p>
<p>Mask: 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>Gateway: 192.168.1.254</p>
<p>DNS; 192.168.1.254</p>
<p>See if that makes any difference</p>
<p>Also on that drop down box is there not an entry to choose to manually enter your own ip address? With some routers you get that choice, not sure about this one though.</p>

            No. You need a genuine qualifying windows to use an upgrade. You will have to purchase and install a full retail license in your situation.

<h2>            WET  Transferring back files from XP to Windows 7 upgrade</h2>
                    I transferred files from my computer using WET wizard to an external hard drive as instructed. I have upgraded to Windows 7 Premium. I have tried to relaunch WET to transfer the files back but I keep getting a message that the WET is not compatible with
 my version of widows. Any help would be appreciated.

<p>When you say WET, is it the WET you downloaded it from the Microsoft's web site or did you you use the Windows XP Files and Settings Transfer wizard? If you used WET from Microsoft's website, are you sure downloaded the correct one? There is one for Windows
 7 32 and 64 bit. The 64 bit WET is not backward compatible with Windows 7 32 bit.</p>

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to know that printers installed on the computer are not working and they are giving an error after running a troubleshooter. It could be due to corrupted or missing drivers or software issues or missing files on the system.</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try the below methods and check.</p>
<p>Method 1.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Automatically fix printing issues like printer does not work, unable to install printer, cannot connect to a network printer and other printing errors.</span></p>

<p>It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />
If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

    <title>Creating a Restore Drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayhaefy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating a Restore Drive</h2>
                    When new (one year ago) I was able to create a restore drive&nbsp; using a Thumb Drive 128 G. Recently, I received a Dell Update after which it recommended I create a new restore drive. When I try, it takes about 5 hours and fails at the very end with a message
 like, We can not create your restore drive. I would at least like to boot to Windows and try to fix a problem if I needed to. Can anyone help? Thanks.

            This will not make a restore on a drive but it will put a restore on the computer. What you can do is go to system properties and go to system protection and create restore.

<p>Hi are you using the Dell backup software to create the recovery disc? Do you still have the recovery partition on your computer? You can also make a windows recovery drive .Type or say recovery drive in cortana for the windows one. For Dell you need to
 open help and support app and there should be a way to make the recovery drive from there. If the recovery partition is not intact you may still be able to make one from the dell website .Ask &nbsp;on the forum or go to your model page and scroll down to the bottom
 of the drivers and update page and see if there is an option to create a system image. I made one from there for my Dell laptop.

<p>Hi sorry I thought you were trying for a Dell recovery drive. Don't know what all you have tried but here are some suggestions. Try disabling any malware program or AV that is not defender.</p>
Some reasons for not being able to create a recovery drive in Windows 10, 8 or 7
<p>You can create an either USB flash drive or optical disc based recovery drive on a Windows platform, which lets you easily access a failing Windows system that won't boot. Regardless of how you create a recovery drive, sometimes the whole process doesn't
 accomplish as expected, and one of the commonly seen error Windows displays is about 'we can't create a recovery drive' without pointing out the exact error source.</p>
<p>So, you have to dig out by yourself, by learning some general reasons and making a preliminary judgment.</p>
<p>1_ The option 'back up system files to the recovery drive' requires at least 16GB USB flash drive.<br />
2_ USB flash drive is with corruption problem that Windows can't format everything on the drive so as to create a recovery drive.<br />
3_ Windows file system has corrupted.</p>
4 highly recommended solutions for can't create recovery drive in Windows 10, 8 or 7
<p>Based on those mentioned causes that perhaps prevent you from creating a recovery drive in Windows successfully, here are&nbsp;3 highly suggested solutions that proved to be useful when the recovery drive creation stuck, failed and sent error message 'We can't
 create a recovery drive'.</p>
Solution 1_ Prepare another USB flash drive
<p>If you got an extra USB hard disk in your hand, go ahead replacing the current one and start afresh to create a recovery drive in the same way.</p>
Solution 2_ Check &amp; repair USB disk errors
<p>In the case that your flash drive has been used for several years and was formatted many times, it's necessary to check its health state and try to fix the bad sectors on it if found any.</p>
<p>Step 1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong>, click <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
Step 2. In the Command Prompt window, type <strong>chkdsk E: /f /r /x</strong>. Here you should replace E with your drive letter.</p>
Solution 3_ Check &amp; repair system files corruption
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.</p>
<p>Step 1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong>, click <strong>
Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
Step 2. In the Command Prompt, type the command <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> and then press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if any will help . I know Windows recovery drive does take a while but 5 hours ,somethings not right. Good luck.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the info. Am working with 2 new flash drives. 128 gig and 64 gig. No errors noted when formating. The 64 was a recovery drive created when laptop was new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did some reading on Dell site. Think I saw that if laptop will not boot it automatically starts a Dell recovery function. That right?</p>

<p>I think there is a key combo to get to recovery mode I&nbsp;dont &nbsp;know if it does this automatically. I think they have a tools partition that you can boot to so you can run tests and diagnostics if the recovery partition is intact. Go to the page for your model
 and check out their help files </p>
<p>
</p><p>You should probably make a windows&nbsp;Install Disk for the just in case &nbsp;with the media creation tool. I long ago clean installed windows so none of that is left on my laptop.</p>

    <title>Bug&#58; Win8 safely remove USB drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexringelmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Win8 safely remove USB drive</h2>
                    I've discovered a bug in Windows 8 Pro.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have recently formatted two different USB drives using Win8 (they're both 2 GB flash drives). Since then, they seem to have become "Windows to Go" drives, even though they have no files on them. I have never selected any "Windows to Go" feature, I used
 the normal format interface, just like I've been doing since Win XP. There were only the standard features like "Defaul Allocation Size", FAT32, etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Each time I want to remove them from my PC, I use the "safely remove" interface and wait for the confirmation message "safe to remove hardware". I've been doing this on the same machine running Win 7, I've never had problems.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But now, when I remove the USB drive, my PC crashes. About a minute later, it says something about encountering a problem. It then restarts. When it's booted up again, the following message appears:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i>Keep the USB drive plugged in. Only remove it after your PC has shut down completely. Otherwise, your Windows To Go workspace might crash and you could lose data</i></div>
<div><i><br />
</i></div>
<div>It's perfectly reproducable (not to mention annoying). So must I now power off my PC everytime I'm done with my USB drive?!</div>
                </div>

            Hi Manjunath,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your response. I tried your suggested fixes, they did not work.</div>
<div>&nbsp;1 - Hardware and Devices troubleshooter did not find any issues</div>
<div>&nbsp;2 - There are no Windows 8 drivers for my chipset / USB yet.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, I did find the solution after some more research. It is a problem with Windows. The following thread describes my problem exactly:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/disable-windows-to-go-workspace/9a1d4125-119b-4b31-bb45-300c8d1c1308">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-hardware/disable-windows-to-go-workspace/9a1d4125-119b-4b31-bb45-300c8d1c1308</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>I followed the instructions in the thread and my problem is now fixed. It turns out my removable USB drive had the same drive ID as my fixed drive (I'm guessing this could have happened when I formatted the USB drive - I'm not sure).</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, one problem still remains. Although the drive ID conflict is now resolved, Windows still thinks it is installed on a removable drive (Windows To Go installation). However, it is not. Therefore, I am unable to access Windows Store, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is it possible to disable Windows To Go? Or is there a way to remind Windows that it is actually installed on a fixed drive, not a removable USB drive?</div>

            yes... windows 8 has many many bugs... this is one of the most annoying bugs of windows 8 that windows 7 had not.<br />
<br />
when ABSOLUTELY NOTHING is using your flash drive or your SD card, when you sately remove it... windows foolishly most of the time says IT IS USED BY A PROGRAM,,, close the program etc.<br />

            <b>It is indeed the most annoying Windows 8 issue ever.</b><br />
<br />
So many times I try to edit a file and <b>Windows 8 </b>foolishly <b>thinks I have the same file opened elsewhere</b>, but this is NOT the case. Trying to remove a
<b>USB flash drive</b> is a nightmare! I <b>can never ever safely remove it UNLESS I restart my computer</b>.
<br />
<br />
<b>Windows 8 has been around for quite some time now, and the most annoying part is that they have not fixed this issue yet</b>, nor do Microsoft moderators attempt helping us troubleshoot this issue. Having to rely on 3rd party software to fix this bug is
 even more annoying because I have to learn the new software, making me pretend to be a tech geek messing with things I should really not be touching.<br />
<br />
Your post was on April 30, 2013, <b>it is now</b> <b>January 12, 2014 and no Microsoft fix for this bug yet</b>, nor a single reply from a Microsoft Moderator. I would really like some answers from Microsoft.
<br />

<b>This is Microsoft's official trouble shoot link to this issue.. </b>what a joke:<br />

            <p>I followed your steps and the computer asks me if I am sure that I want to remove the device, I click on yes and then nothing happens. The only way I am able to remove a USB safely is by either restarting the computer, or by Ejecting the drive by going to
 my computer and right clicking the usb, sometimes it removes safely properly, but most of the time it doesn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 is so old, an update to fix this problem is long overdue.</p>

<h2>            Manage mail accounts and folders</h2>
                    <p>Dear MS.</p>
<p>1.)</p>
<p>I created some "other"&nbsp; mail account and want to change the settings (e.g. imap-server). Can't find any way to edit the mail<br />
account settings.</p>
<p>2.)</p>
<p>Why I cant't remove this "outlook.com" account?i</p>
<p>3.)</p>
<p>As I found and read in&nbsp;another thread, you removed&nbsp;any possibility to add/remove folders. Very bad. But in addition - your (silly) mail app not is able to synchronize the correct folder structure and I have a couple of&nbsp;sent and deleted - folders (with different
 names) and&nbsp; so&nbsp;on&nbsp;and moving/deleting mails does suspicious things and mails&nbsp;disappear for ever.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the consequence of this unwanted second "outlook.com" account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>regards g.k.</p>
<p>
</p><p>btw. After testing 10 days Win10 I regret the migration. Even Win 8.x, which I used sometimes, has more/better configuration options and with one click in "tablet modus" i got the desktop.&nbsp;To which&nbsp;kind of consumer MS has<br />
created&nbsp;Win 10? Again essentially for the "I-Things"-gaming people? You will loose the one using a computer for</p>
<p>business purposes.</p>

<p>Sorry for my late answer. But I has to use all my "free time" for trying get "sleeping-mode" in win 10 again working (without success), which is much more annoying for me as this topic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's no more possible to change the folders on the client side (there are a couple of post's for this "feature" search for "add folders").<br />
But mail app also not maps the server side strucure as it should (tow and more times the same folder, other missing ...), as I pointed out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>@Kalpana Shankarappa<br />
The links you posted simply belong to "common knownledge" and so are not helpfull.
</p>
<p>At&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/changing-settings, </p>
<p>you find nothing about what I understood as "email-account-settings". What win 10 provides here as "email-account settings" are just some simple things - but not any important setting (as e.g. the port-nr, the address of th ISP ..).
<br />
So I conclude, that it is no more possible e.g. to change the IMAP-port-nr of an account or similar technical things. For that you have to delete and renew the account. Or is there another way? Then please post a link. &nbsp;<br />
It seems mail-app is just made for outlook.com (or similar)? I not want to use outlook.com at all, I have my own provider.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder problem I got, &nbsp;as I upgraded my win 8.1. notebook/tablet and my Win 7 desktop PC to win 10.<br />
win 8.1. notebook/tablet. Before it worked with the 8.1 - app on the notebook.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>... On my desktop I now use the thunderbird - client again and with the notebook I seldom send mails (which is the greatest problem - because of three different "sent"-folders").</p>
<p>So for me this Item topic is "closed -&nbsp;</p>
