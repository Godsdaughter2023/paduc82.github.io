<h2>            A USB port still provides power but doesn&#39;t recognize any flash drives or external mouse</h2>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a while, one of the USB ports on my laptop has stopped working. It never recognizes any flash drive or mouse I plug in. I thought that this was a dead USB port. But when plugging in a laptop cooling pad, the fans start to run. I tried uninstalling
 and reinstalling the USB drivers, but that one port still doesn't recognize anything.

            Hi TN.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything to try so that hopefully something works.  I'll also be standing by here to help with any steps and continue if necessary to help you further until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />1) Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />2)  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />3) If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />4) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />6)  Do you know when this started?   If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by a Version Update then you can roll it in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I've updated my USB and Chipset drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled the Enhanced, Hub and host controller and reinstalled it</p>
<p>I use the laptop keyboard and usually have an external mouse plugged in, it works on the two other ports but not that problematic one.</p>
<p>My system restore points from before the USB port stopped working has disappeared since I installed the April 2018 update (1803)</p>
<p>I did all the steps in the Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist and that USB port still won't recognize anything plugged into it.</p>
<p>I remember the USB port stopped working after plugging a USB to SATA cable that was slightly damaged from the USB end (how foolish of me!).</p>
<p>The device is a DELL Inspiron 15 Gaming 7567 running Windows 10 version 1903 with an expired warranty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE!!:</p>
<p>I have just reinstalled Windows from scratch and that USB port still doesn't recognize anything while the two others work without the need to install drivers.</p>

<p>I tried doing a search for it, but if I remember correctly, the last backwards compatibility update became available in 2009 as a system update, so as long as your console is up to date, you have the latest update.</p>

<h2>            Media Streaming in Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    I am trying to stream My Pictures from a Windows 10 PC to my Sony TV. The TV can see the folders but not the individual pictures in them. I believe that I have shared the entirety of my pictures folder and subfolders. I cannot turn off the password protection

<p>Hi Shuman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The suggested command didn't work because the syntax required further info such as password. However I found the solution via the TV software, so problem solved.</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Hi, <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community and for your interest in Windows 10.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I can understand, how frustrating it can be, when things don’t work as expected. </span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We apologize for the inconvenience caused. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
I'd be glad to help you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to follow these methods, mentioned below, to fix your issue:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>SFC Scan: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to perform a SFC Scan and check, if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption .The sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed, or
 damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please click on the below link and follow the procedure to run SFC Scan.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Click on, </span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)"><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></span></a>
<span>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
</span></span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Do not close the Command Prompt Window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persists, follow the Method 2.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2:&nbsp; </span>
</span></span></strong><span><span><br />
&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest you to boot the computer to Safe Mode and check, if the issue occurs. If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode, I suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check, if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to refer the article and check, if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode).</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/change-startup-settings-in-windows-10#v1h=tab01</span></span></a>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue do not occur in Safe Mode, perform a clean boot and check. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Warning: </span></strong><span>After clean boot troubleshooting steps, refer to the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup
 mode. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information helps you. Kindly post back with the updated issue for further assistance.<br />

<p>Thank you for your interest and your feedback.&nbsp; Surface Book was only recently released in the US and CA.&nbsp; It may be to soon to locate a 3rd party accessory to meet your needs.&nbsp; Also, as of this posting, there are no Microsoft Surface branded accessories
 of the type you mentioned in your first post.&nbsp; I cannot speculate on whether this type of accessory will ever be made available by Microsoft.&nbsp; The best resources for identifying the existence or availability of Surface accessories are the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Surface site</a> and the
Microsoft Store site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            How to change gamertag&#63; &#40;Under 18&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a little brother&nbsp;who's having issues with his Xbox account. Firstly, he wants to change his gamertag, but he needs to join a Microsoft family because of his age, but to do that, we need an Xbox 360 or Xbox One (we do not have a Xbox at all). Some certain apps have&nbsp;an Xbox account as a requirements.. How can he change his gamertag when we don't have a Xbox?</p>

            You are best off going to a working computer, create a bootable copy then perform a direct clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

<h2>            Problema de audio Fable II Retrocompatibilidad</h2>
                    
<p>Recientemente instale el juego Fable 2 en mi Xbox One a traves de la retrocompatibildad, el problema sería cuando al momento de jugar me precaté de que el audio de juego estaba en castellano y no en latino como lo habia jugado anteriormente, y me molestó
 porque este juego hace dos años lo jugue en latino, y siendo la misma copia del juego me esperé a que fuera latino tambien.</p>

<p>Así que preferí descargar el audio en ingles y para mi peor suerte me decía que la página no estaba disponible.</p>
<p>¿Qué puedo hacer? Quisiera jugar este juegazo sease en español latino o en ingles pues no estoy muy acostumbrado a jugarlo en castellano.</p>

<p>Oh, no puede ser lobezno, justo en la onda vital, espero que se solucione a todo gas! jajaja ok no... No sé si sea el caso con este juego pero, últimamente han estado cambiando los idiomas entre las regiones, por ejemplo; que a los de España les hayan puesto
 el latino y a nosotros el Castellano. Hay varios foros en los que pasa esto mismo, lo que podrías intentar pero no sé si funcione es desinstalar el juego y modificar la configuración regional de tu consola a España, cuando la consola tenga dicha región prueba
 en descargar de nuevo el juego, podría ser que ahí este el Latino...</p>
<p>Nos cuentas lo que paso, saludos! :D</p>

                    <p>Hello all:</p>
<p>I've just bought a Microsoft Confort Curve 3000 keyboard, but does not work with Windows 10 even if it says it is 'Windows 10 Compatible'. On Microsoft's website I can't find Windows 10 x86 drivers. Same thing is happening with my Lenovo FRU P/N 41U3013.
 Please help!</p>

You can do it by downloading a fresh copy of the driver from the keyboard (or PC) manufacturer's website.

            <p>Keyboards and mice are plug and play and don't need any drivers to work. Drivers are for the software that provide KB shortcuts and customized settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turn the computer off and remove the current KB and plug in the new one. Reboot. Windows 10 will recognize the KB. I have the same model and it works fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can even remove the kb and replace it while the computer is on. </p>

    <title>Windows 10 update killed my disk &#40;Your PC did not start correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alymtz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update killed my disk &#40;Your PC did not start correctly blue screen error&#41;</h2>
                    <p>To start, I have had Windows 10 for around 3 months now.&nbsp;<br />
I have had it installed on a clean disk, as I was worried my laptop had a trojan. When that happened I was running Windows 7 Home Premium.</p>
<p>I used d-ban, which wiped my hard drive successfully, and Windows 10 has been working just swimmingly.<br />
<br />
Until the updates.<br />
The first time it updated and restarted, it did the whole "preparing automatic repair"/"diagnosing your PC", then directed me to a menu where I could restart or go to advanced options.
<strong>Keep in mind, I did not shut down or unplug my battery whilst it was updating.</strong><br />
Through advanced options, I tried restarting, and shutting down, and it did not work, but then I went to troubleshooting and Reset my PC while keeping my personal files. Which worked, and everything went swimmingly from then on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the second update (maybe it was the same update as before, I am still not sure)</p>
<p>In my mind, I had perceived these to be different updates, as I had not received any notification after the last update incident to install anymore updates until three days or so ago. So I clicked restart so that it would update, and it gives me the same
 "preparing automatic repair"/"diagnosing your PC" then directing me to the same restart or advanced options situation.<br />
<br />
Prior to looking at this link:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>All through the advanced options and troubleshooting menu, I have tried to</strong></span></p>
<p>Restart the laptop</p>
<p>Shut down the laptop</p>
<p>Exit and continue to windows 10</p>
<p>Reset the PC (only with my personal files, I do not want to lose anything, as I have not had the time to back my files up)</p>
<p>System restore through three different points (The third being as far back as I am willing to go)<br />
Launching safe mode, safe mode with networking, and safe mode with command prompt</p>
<p>Trying to restart, reset, shutdown, and exit/continue with the driver signature enforcement disabled.<br />
Lastly, tried to enable boot logging.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nothing has worked<br />
Please keep in mind, my computer was working <strong>swimmingly</strong> <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
before</span> these updates. It was working even better than my windows 7 Home premium, despite me having a fairly old HP laptop.</p>
<p>The only thing that works so far that would give me any control if I knew what to do with it, is the command prompt option.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I go into what I have tried to do to resolve the issue in terms of Microsoft support, I will elaborate on the system restore in case it is needed.</p>
<p>I have tried to do a system restore with each point 3 times to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>First restore point: </strong>
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Error code:</span> Unspecified error (0x80070017)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">File that could not be extracted:</span> D:\$Windows.~BT\NewOS\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-ntfs_31bf3 (after this it cuts off and I could not expand to see the full name)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Error code: </span>Unspecified error (0x80070017)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">File that could not be extracted:</span> D:\$Windows.~BT\NewOS\Windows\WinSxS\amd64_microsoft-windows-lockapp.app</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, the fault on my part could have been that I did not think to follow this link&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930<br />
<br />
But I didn't know that I would have to do it in order for my disk <strong>to not be practically killed.</strong></p>
<p>In order to fix this, yesterday night I called the general Microsoft support hotline (800)642-7676, I got immediately handed a chick who was reading off a script. This did not surprise me, as I figured eventually, if my situation was bad
 enough, I would get redirected to someone who could help me.</p>
<p>I did indeed get redirected, but there was a huge miscommunication and several misunderstandings, to the point where the lady was trying to diagnose a whole different issue, and eventually we both gave up and labeled the case as resolved.<br />
I called again today in the afternoon, I was directed to a man similar to the first lady I encountered, except he was nice enough to be more straight forward with me and tell me my issue was out of his resources and that he could not help me, but advised that
 i take it to a technician.<br />
I felt like this was totally uncalled for, I am very good with keeping away from downloading programs, files, or photos from sites that I am not fully familiar with. I make sure to scan programs and other files before i use them. I do not go to fishy places,
 and even then google chrome helps me out by preventing me from visiting harmful places. I do not tinker with windows files, as I know something like this could happen if I did. Finally, like I have mentioned above, during the update process I have not shutdown
 or even unplugged my charger (if that makes any difference).<br />
Why do I have to shell out money for this? I'm a highschool student who has been a little too busy to work just yet, but when I do work, I am fully aware that my computer may be slowly getting out of date, and some parts aging or expiring could have possibly
 lead to this awful demise. So I will build a new computer and hopefully no problems.<br />
Until then, I need to stretch out my laptop for school, social life, and other personal uses.<br />
I know I mentioned some parts could be worn out and that could cause issues, but not this issue. As I will restate, my laptop was working
<strong>wonderfully</strong> before this. I have not had a single issue with ANYTHING. Nothing, whatsoever.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have made my situation aware to an answer desk woman I have chatted with today, so when she redirected me to a professional hotline I thought I could get help, and the number I received was (800)936-4900.&nbsp;<br />
They want $99-$400 to offer me support.<br />
Once I was aware of that, I thought, maybe I can get a professional worker through the chat if I try again.<br />
I tried again to no avail, and was told it was the fault of my laptops aging parts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to file a complaint, hoping that maybe this growing issue would be brought to Microsoft's attention, and they can stop making the solutions private and taking your money, but I was hung up on once the words were uttered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not smart with computers, but I know for sure, if my computer was having an issue with its slightly outdated model, it would not have presented itself this way. I feel like I am being robbed for something that was out of my control, or information that
 was out of my thinking reach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call it an unfortunate event, but I really really want assistance, I have lost my patience with you Microsoft.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any help is appreciated, even if it comes to the last resort, and I have to purchase a drive that will let me extract my files even though I am not able to access my desktop. Please be specific with the drive.<br />
<br />
</strong>If anymore information is needed please let me know! I need my files for school!</p>

            <p>From the repair option I tried to reset multiple times, and it gave me the same&nbsp;<br />
" Your PC could not be reset. No changes were made" alert, without describing any further as to what the error could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the repair option I actually tried a different system restore point from longer before than the first three system restore points mentioned and it gave me a different file that could not be extracted.</p>
<p>Which was E:\Windows\System32\drivers\ntf.sys</p>
<p>The error code remains the same as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean, did the new update remove an important drive? I don't get how my computer has been working just fine before this, and now a driver seems to be missing??<br />
</p>
<p>Is there anyway I can somehow download this file to the computer so it can work? Again, the command prompt works. Not the safe mode with command prompt, but the command prompt through the repair options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my computer is rendered dead because of the update, I would really appreciate some help in getting a backup drive or something that would allow me to see my files without being able to log on. Again, this was totally uncalled for.
</p>
<p>I do not want to come off mad , I am very appreciative of the tip you have given, it was a refreshing take as compared to what I have received so far.<br />
But again, I don't get why this is happening when everything was working fine before the updates. I have actually restarted my computer and shut it down and turned it on several times without it messing up. So I doubt this drive has been missing before I downloaded
 windows 10 or during using it. Therefore, it feels very uncalled for, and I don't want to shell out anywhere between $90-$400 to get something fixed that I had no idea how to prevent.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is probably a Windows Update that is not working well on your machine...</p>
<p>Everytime you Restore, Reset, or whatever, it will try to reinstall again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can suggest might be to reinstall Win 10 again clean, and then quickly&nbsp;disable Windows Update in Control Panel... Administrative Tools... Services...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a real good solution because this will also prevent Windows Defender from getting updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can boot your machine in to SAFE MODE in it's current condition, you might be able to resolve the problem by possibly uninstalling the most recent updates...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that one of them may have been a graphics driver, but it could be something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't remember the precise description to enter safe mode, but I think it is something like Advanced Startup, and the location to select it is on the last window of Troubleshoot... Advanced...</p>

            <p>It won't even let me go into safe mode :( It just does the whole gig again<br />
<br />
I have accepted that I probably will have to re-install windows 10, and follow this link&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">And just get an anti-virus to make up for the defender<br />
<br />
But I don't know how to get my personal files out when I am not even allowed in safe mode or the desktop?<br />
I would like tips for that, as I have school resources and files, along with personal photos and word documents.<br />
<br />
And possibly some help from Microsoft?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I don't like how they are releasing possibly detrimental updates and not having a way to back up their loyal customers (although I did not pay for windows 10 I consider myself as a customer as I have
 bought my laptop from them, bought windows 7 again when I had to clean my laptop, bought office bundles on other laptops, etc.)<br />
</span>Do you know if there is a way I can possibly send a plea for them to aid me?&nbsp;<br />
The $99-$400 could be going to me building a new PC, I don't want to invest too much into this aging laptop when I'm just going to build a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much by the way! I appreciate the immediate help!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Tool from the link you mentioned may or may not help...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would depend on when you get the chance to use it... In other words the machine may crash like it has now before you get the chance to use it... But it may work if you use it quick enough...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also don't know if that tool will work on your machine... It seems to me that I read somewhere that it will only work on the PRO and Enterprise versions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You shouldn't need to buy anything to reinstall Win 7 or 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as recovering your files go... It is possible to boot the machine with some LINUX based programs that have a "File Explorer" or similar...</p>
<p>This can be used to copy your files to a external HDD, Flash Drive, or whatever...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I normally use a program called Parted Magic for this... Here is a link to the last free version...
<a href="http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/parted_magic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.majorgeeks.com/files/details/parted_magic.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When you open File Explorer from the shortcut on the Desktop, your drive will be listed on the upper left of the window as something like SD0, SD1, and etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you click on that, the drives will show up on the right side of the window in a more Windows like fashion...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ISO download can be burned as a IMAGE to a bootable CD... or with specialty tool, can be made into a bootable flash drive...</p>

            <p>I know I will not need to buy anything to re-install windows 10, I was referring to a special hard drive if needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is fine if the tool does not work, I was mostly referring to using it after all of this got fixed. (Although I would like to know how to prevent these updates from happening)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I will use the Parted Magic and let you know how it goes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
But just to clarify, do you mean desktop as in the desktop given by the Parted Magic program? As I have said before I am not able to get onto my desktop, I don't know if that would make using this program an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external hard drive that I can put all my files into, so if that works then I should not have an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for the program recommendation. I will try first thing tomorrow to install the program onto a boot-able device, move my files to the external hard drive, then re-install windows 10.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other than what you have described so far about Part Magic, is there anything else I should expect?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes... I was referring to the "Desktop" that appears after Parted Magic boots...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Parted Magic completely bypasses Windows, so there are no windows issues that will effect it.&nbsp;Just BIOS Settings or hardware issues..</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a lot of ways parted Magic and other Linux OS's mimic windows fairly closely, but there are a few exceptions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The window on the left won't display drive names... That's about the most confusing part... Just drive\partition number and size... But when you select one, it will appear on the right side with the naming you would expect to see in Windows...</p>

            <p>I apologize for the long delay in response.&nbsp;<br />
So everything you suggested worked, thank you so much. Windows 10 is running as swiftly as it was before. I am so glad that I didn't have to go to an expensive technician.<br />
Many manyyyy thanks!<br />
</p>
<p>I will have to ask though, as I cleaned my computer, and re-installed Windows, I am not able to detect what updates did this to my computer. Recently, without my permission, it has updated. I was not able to take down what it updated, and when I click on
 the "Updates were installed" notification in my notifications on the tray, nothing happens. I tried looking at update history and it is blank. If there is another way to check?<br />
Anyways, it has not done anything to my computer, nothing seems to be impaired.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there anyway I can prevent the next update in case it is the update that messed up my computer?</p>
<p>I know it's dangerous to mess with the updates, but I am going to turn it back on once HP checks my device in compatibility with windows 10, as apparently they are in the process of checking all of their models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyways so much, was a huge relief in terms of being able to continue taking my work to school.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also noticed that some of the Windows Updates don't appear in the list, and others do...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender no longer show up for sure... One thing I think I going on is that some of the updates are considered part of the installation, and don't get listed...</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the first things that happens after Win 10 installs is that it immediately does a OneDrive Update... This doesn't appear on the list either...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try looking in Programs and Features and clicking on the "View Installed Updates" on the upper left... This is a different list, and is also where you can uninstall updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Windows Update is the only way I know of to block updates... other than the mentioned tool... The problem even with the tool is that to my understanding, it only works AFTER the update has been installed the first time... It will then allow uninstalling
 the update and blocking it from installing again..</p>
<p>
</p><p>That isn't of much help if the bad update causes a crash...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to hear you are up and running again...</p>

<p>
</p><p>**EDIT** Ok my foot is officially in my mouth. Turns out that I needed to reinstall Win X and ignore activation until complete and then sign in and verify my account. Works like a charm now and I am totally chagrined. **EDIT**</p>

    <title>How Xbox Saved My Life - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr bumperhumper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Xbox Saved My Life</h2>
                    
<p>Alright so i'm just going to get right into it. &nbsp;All my life I've been a gamer. &nbsp;Video games had been my whole life for most of my childhood. &nbsp;As we all know, doing nothing but sitting down and playing video games isn't good for your physical health generally
 speaking. &nbsp;Well I started gaining weight like crazzyyyy. &nbsp;By the time I was 18 (mid 2012), I weighed 315 lbs. &nbsp;People at school of course made rude remarks about me whether it was behind my back or right in front of me. &nbsp;Being overweight is no easy way to
 live for the most part. &nbsp;PE class was especially tough, with all the skinny folk running around and breezing through the mandatory mile-long run to pass the class, while I was laps behind. &nbsp;It got pretty bad affecting my mental state that I had gone into depression
 and nothing really made me happy; I couldn't find the motivation to get up in the morning, etc. &nbsp;I had been to the doctors many times for various purposes, and every time they'd bring up my weight and how it wasn't good for my health and I was reducing my
 lifespan. &nbsp;I was like a lot of other overweight people, I wanted to lose weight, but just couldn't get the motivation to do it. &nbsp;Well May 18, 2012 I graduated high school and decided to change myself once and for all and finally lose that extra weight. &nbsp;So
 all summer, I stayed out of the kitchen and stayed in my room playing various video games (Halo 4, GTA V, Red Dead Redemption, etc.) &nbsp;And near the end of the summer break, heading into mid-August, early September, I had lost around 75 lbs, and boy was it showing.
 &nbsp;Then I got into college, and the first thing I did was set up my Xbox on my desk, right next to my HDTV that also served as my monitor for my laptop (VGA cable from laptop to TV). &nbsp;And around 3 months into college I had lost a total of roughly 110 lbs. &nbsp;I
 started attending the gym, I felt like I was actually normal for the first time, and heck, I even got a girlfriend for the first time in my life. &nbsp;All signs of depression were just about gone and I finally had a positive outlook on life. &nbsp;I have Microsoft
 to thank for this, because without the Xbox, I would not have been able to have my mind distracted long enough to stay out of the kitchen except for 1-2 times a day. &nbsp;From the bottom of my heart, thank you Microsoft. &nbsp;I wish you the best of luck with the Xbox
 One and I hope to get one whenever I can. &nbsp;Stay awesome :) &nbsp;And at the end of this post will be an image of the before and after shots of me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good job!! Keep up the good work. Portion control, and eating healthy snacks between meals roughly every 2 hours is a healthy habit to get into to and is sustainable, for keeping the weight off. That's how I've done (and do) it with success - along with
 exercise, which is very important for cardio - keep that heart healthy, and pumping plenty of blood and oxygen through your body.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life is short to begin with. Very glad to hear that you love yourself, and have made this change in your life. Life is indeed a gift...and a blessing.</p>

                    two days ago I bought a NEW Dell 3050 OptiPlex computer with Windows 10 installed.&nbsp; I would like to copy a PDF file to a DVD and it keeps telling me to insert a DVD when one is already inserted.&nbsp; How can I perform this function?

<p>(You probably don't want to hear this but here goes anyway ...) wouldn't you rather copy the PDF to a USB flash drive? It's so easy: just copy and paste. Flash drives are smaller and more easily transportable. And it's easy to copy your PDF from the flash
 drive to any place else.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 has the ability to Sync documents between PC's used with the same Microsoft Account, so that could be why things showed up on your new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To eliminate the potential interference that you suspect, you could install Windows 10 to a separate partition and login to that copy of Windows,&nbsp;using only a Local Windows Admin account, keeping the PC offline during this install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other things to try on the existing Windows install&nbsp;is to create a new local Admin account with a different name and password&nbsp;and remove Admin status from your current account.&nbsp; Also ensure that the default Administrator Account is disabled and that there
 are no other Admin accounts on your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Windows Defender Offline, by choosing Scan Offline button, if you have the Anniversary Update version of Windows 10, to see if there are any malware and viruses installed.</p>

            Yes I saw documents on their computer that were from mine.&nbsp; I also saw my emails and some of my daughters documents from her google account and my daughter has never been on her computer, actually I hadn't either.&nbsp; I put her on my computer one day as a
 guest as she needed to do something.&nbsp; Since that day it has been a mess.&nbsp; Maybe she is hacked first?

</blockquote>
<p>So, anyone that is allowed to get onto my computer under guest would have the potential of getting their documents mixed up with mine?&nbsp; That is very scary as all my documents have "no sharing".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;I wonder how she has my emails going to her computer AND how does that explain why she is now the administrator on the computer and&nbsp;I no longer am.&nbsp; Does that just automatically happen?&nbsp; How do I change that back since it is my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my daughter's documents have never been on my computer, they were on her google drive which I have never seen but I am sure she has logged into her google account on my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; FYI,&nbsp;she has never seen any of my documents nor have they ever showed
 up on her google account or her personal computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>One more thing, why would Microsoft give anybody permission to download my emails without my permission?&nbsp; I read a log of hers that states just that.&nbsp; The log does show that she had the wrong credentials several times, however, by the end of the document
 it shows she eventually got them.&nbsp; She says we both must have been hacked or something that is why I am trying to figure this out.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a scan of all documents and searches done on her wifi and mine to obtain these logs.&nbsp; Most of it I don't understand but I am sure that all of my stuff has ended up on her end; nothing has ended up on mine.&nbsp; I am so confused and scared that my personal
 information could also be out for anyone to grab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond if you can help.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

            <p>Rather than waiting, you should regain Admin access and take control of your computer now. &nbsp;Keep it offline until you do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is software from Lazesoft which will enable you to regain Admin access by activating the default Administrator account. &nbsp;Once you are able to login with this account, you can grant your own account Administrator rights and disable those rights on other
 accounts. &nbsp;Lazesoft can create a bootable USB to use to regain Admin access.</p>
<p><a href="http://lazesoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lazesoft.com/</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, from another computer or phone, you can go online to Microsoft to secure your existing Microsoft Account and give it a new password and security questions. &nbsp;Set up 2-part authentication, which uses your mobile phone and a Microsoft Account App
 to require a generated Code to access your account from any new device that has not already been authorized. &nbsp;Here is the App for an Android phone:</p>

            <p>OK, if you have restored to factory settings, you have wiped out whatever was on there before. &nbsp;Are you using different Windows and Local accounts with different secure passwords than before? &nbsp;The 2-part authentication is still advised to implement. &nbsp;Even
 Facebook has this option via their phone App for Facebook accounts. &nbsp;Google also has an App called Google Authenticator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your router and Wi-Fi should be setup as securely as possible. &nbsp;Use WPA2 for Wi-Fi and setup a secure Admin password for your router. Disable remote access to your router.</p>

<h2>            Computer always crashes when waking from sleep right after Windows 10 Update - Dec 2017</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following a Windows update last week, my laptop crashes every time I try to wake it from sleep or hibernate. When I try to turn my computer back on from sleep, now I get a grey/white digital snow screen, a clear crash that can only be solved by forcefully
 turning off the computer and then turning it back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never experienced anything like this before and I can precisely pinpoint it to the last Windows 10 update. Thanks
<del>Obama </del>Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the most recent updates according to my update history:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709 - 12/1/2017</li><li>2017-11 Security Update for Adobe Flash Player for Windows 10 version 1709 for x64-based Systems KB4048951 - 12/2/2017</li><li>Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems KB4041994 12/2/2017</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>A few more updates were installed yesterday but none solved my issue so...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's any help, I have a 2015 13' Alienware laptop, Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.59GHz with 16GB of RAM, and using an NVIDIA GeForce 960M Graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to fix this issue? It's not that I'm getting tired of my computer crashing but... yeah, I'm getting tired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>I'm glad that the new version of Skype is working for your device properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're referring to your Skype Name, normally it's shown under your profile after clicking your account's profile icon on the app. If you're not seeing it, you can utilize Skype for Web to check it.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://web.skype.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Web</a>.</li><li>Click your profile picture.</li><li>Your Skype Name (<em>Skype ID</em>)&nbsp;is shown under your display name.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
