<p>Entre ver la actividad de xbox live gringa y chilena con players no veo mucho cambio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>¿Cuanto pagan ustedes en € anualmente por gold?</p>

<p>En España lo que hace el 99% de gente es tirar de webs donde se venden el codigo canjeable para las suscripciones de un año, mas un mes (13 meses) que estan entre 30€ y 40€.</p>
<p>Ojo, hablo de las tarjetas prepago... no de los crackers piratas que venden cuentas infladas de MS Points que Microsoft persigue y denuncia.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Igual cuando Microsoft Iberica decida cerrar o darse cuenta de que los servicios no estan a la altura de paises como USA o UK, y rebajen el precio de la suscripcion hasta que este a la altura realmente. Pues la gente igual volvera a pagar por Xbox Live y
 asociar las tarjetas VISA o PayPal.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yo desde luego que no lo hare hasta que no se pongan al dia y teniendo en cuenta como va la cosa, igual hasta me paso a Silver.</p>

<p>Yo tengo una duda, ¿estas webs estilo www.livecheap360codes.com o similares, son 100% legales los códigos? o me podría encontrar con la desagradable sorpresa de que compro el codigo y xbox me baneara la cuenta o similares.</p>
<p>Y si es legal, no acabo de entender del todo que pasa en España, no es normal que el mismo producto que en otros paises cuesta 40€ aquí cueste 60€ es de locos de verdad.</p>

    <title>Refund if MS refuses to support upgrade&#63;&#63;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ll_ike  say:</h3>
<h2>            Refund if MS refuses to support upgrade&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft is finally admitting that they are annoyed with laptops that only have 32G of internal storage (even though it's a batter life saver and makes for ultra-light laptops) and don't support the upgrade. My question is, MS seems to just not want to
 solve this problem even though I paid for Win10 for this laptop. If you don't have a solution, can I get a refund?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I cleared 10G of space off of my laptop, which meant deleting even MS Office and the 8G requirement that is advertised is a bunch of crap. They never tell you how much you need and EVERY attempt at upgrading fails. MS just doesn't care. I have
 tried the media creation tool JOKE a dozen times and unless you have over 8G of space on your laptop, it will not allow you to make a copy of the upgrade on a USB drive - WHICH TOTALLY DEFEATS THE POINT!!! &nbsp;So sick of being jerked around like this. I want
 a refund for my Win10 if MS won't provide the support that I am entitled to!</p>

<p>It's Microsoft's fault you bought an underpowered device that would be difficult to upgrade because it has so little space? I think you should just realize you learned a lesson and next time don't buy the cheapest equipment out there. Buy something that
 will do the job, and if you can't afford it, wait until you can.</p>
<p>Maybe you should try Linux on your device.</p>

<p>This "cheap" equipment has an 8-hour battery life and is ultra-light. It can with Win10 installed. They advertised for ages that you can upgrade these laptops but now are just lecturing that we were stupid to buy them - EVEN THOUGHT THEY CAME INSTALLED WITH
 WINDOWS! &nbsp;The question is, to what extent should I be compensated for not receiving the Win10 upgrade that I am entitled to? I mean, this OS is supposed to include free upgrades, right? That was the deal. MS is rejigging on this, What part don't you understand?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and there are over 1,700 people on here with same problem but MS is too busy making billions with forced subscription services than to hire a few competent support people to answer the questions on here. You gotta give them credit for turning support
 over to their customers and washing their hands of it. LINUX - YOU NEVER SOUNDED SO GOOD.</p>

<p>Good. Go with Linux then.</p>
<p>But FYI Windows 10 does allow you to save the Media Creation Tool to an external hard drive, or a USB Flash Drive so you lied about that.</p>
<p>Or, perhaps, you're just misinformed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This is where you go to get that.</p>
<p>Then you download the TOOL.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meaning you DO NOT CLICK where it says "Download Now" you click here:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6bdc23fc-7b3c-47bc-afb7-e032d05c17ba?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6bdc23fc-7b3c-47bc-afb7-e032d05c17ba?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>INSTEAD</p>
<p>THEN YOU SELECT "SAVE AS" and select your external drive the usual way (probably by finding "This PC" using the search window in your options and then double clicking the place you want to save the file and then clicking "save" to download.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Helps to know what you're doing, of course.</p>

<p><span>The device manufacturer or installer warrants that properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft materials that accompany the software. If you obtain updates or supplements directly from
 Microsoft during the 90-day term of this limited warranty, Microsoft provides this limited warranty for them. This limited warranty does not cover problems that you cause, that arise when you fail to follow instructions, or that are caused by events beyond
 the reasonable control of the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft. The limited warranty starts when the first user acquires the software and lasts for 90 days. Any supplements, updates, or replacement software that you may receive from the manufacturer
 or installer, or Microsoft, during that 90-day period are also covered, but only for the remainder of that 90-day period or for 30 days, whichever is longer. Transferring the software will not extend the limited warranty.</span></p>
<span>
<p>The manufacturer or installer, and Microsoft, give no other express warranties, guarantees, or conditions.
<strong>The manufacturer or installer, and Microsoft, exclude all implied warranties and conditions, including those of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. If your local law does not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,
 then any implied warranties, guarantees, or conditions last only during the term of the limited warranty and are limited as much as your local law allows. If your local law requires a longer limited warranty term, despite this agreement, then that longer term
 will apply, but you can recover only the remedies this agreement allows.</strong></p>
<p>If the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, breaches its limited warranty, it will, at its election, either: (i) repair or replace the software at no charge, or (ii) accept return of the software (or at its election the device on which the software was
 preinstalled) for a refund of the amount paid, if any. The manufacturer or installer (or Microsoft if you acquired them directly from Microsoft), may also repair or replace supplements, updates, and replacement of the software or provide a refund of the amount
 you paid for them, if any. <strong>These are your only remedies for breach of warranty.</strong> This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state or country to country.</p>
<p><strong>Except for any repair, replacement, or refund the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, may provide, you may not under this limited warranty, under any other part of this agreement, or under any theory recover any damages or other remedy, including
 lost profits or direct, consequential, special, indirect, or incidental damages.</strong> The damage exclusions and remedy limitations in this agreement apply even if repair, replacement or a refund does not fully compensate you for any losses, if the manufacturer
 or installer, or Microsoft, knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages, or if the remedy fails of its essential purpose. Some states and countries do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or other damages,
 so those limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. <strong>If your local law allows you to recover damages from the manufacturer or installer, or Microsoft, even though this agreement does not, you cannot recover more than you paid for the software (or
 up to $50 USD if you acquired the software for no charge).</strong></p>

<p>A snarky jerk who thinks he knows it all just reveals his worthlessness by saying that I am lying and that I don't know what I am doing. I have already had level 2 tech support admit this was a KNOWN ISSUE, Sherlock! Just because it works on your computer,
 which is not mine, is the weakest approach to trouble-shooting. Course, it would help if you knew anything about that. The Media Creation Tool is NOT allowing me the option to download to USB drive. &nbsp;A KNOWN ISSUE!&nbsp;</p>

<p>whether you can install Windows 10 updates or not really is not a Microsoft issue. You "Bone" is with The Computer Manufactures who saw a way to make a Killing at little cost. Yes, there are some who can't install because of space but there are those that
 can't install the latest feature updates because the computer is no longer capable to install these new upgrades as it is too old. Microsoft may have its issues but it is not responsible for everyone's computer that has issues with these upgrades.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.</p>

<h3> ellenfountain  say:</h3>
<h2>            new Dell U2415 dual monitors &#34;black out&#34; briefly with Windows 10</h2>
                    Just bought two new Dell U2415 monitors for a dual display. They are connected to an NVidia260GTX graphics card with HDMI cables. Generally, I'm very happy with the monitors, EXCEPT (and this is a huge EXCEPT), randomly and occasionally, one or the other
 just goes black for a second or two then comes back on. This happens right in the middle of doing something in PhotoShop, or using Outlook, scanning or any of the programs I use. &nbsp;I also recently upgraded to Windows 10. Dell tells me this is a Windows 10 problem
 and not a monitor problem, and told me my system doesn't support Windows 10. If it is the monitors, then I need to return them within the return window. Can anyone shed some light on this problem?

            <p>I had already run the trouble shooter, and it finds nothing amiss. I also have the most current driver from NVidia, and have my updates set to automatically update with the latest driver available so that I'm always current with that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did not find anywhere on the NVidia site to download/install display and chipset drivers - are those different than the NVidia drivers for the Display Adapter? &nbsp;I am still having the blackout problem, randomly, at least two or three times a day, doing
 a variety of things. Wondering now if it might be related to my Wacom tablet in some way (in fact the screen blacked out and came back on just this second as I was typing this).</p>

            Still no answer to this problem of Dell U2415 monitors occasionally blacking out for a second or two. Since I got the monitors at about the same time I upgraded to Windows 10, I don't know if it is a software (Windows 10) or hardware (monitor) problem.
 Dell passed the buck to Microsoft (telling me my computer isn't compatible with Windows 10 - don't believe that since I've been using it a little more than a month now with everything working just fine). Microsoft and NVidia have been no help either, and now
 it's too late to return the monitors. Using HDMI connection to video card. Wish somebody had an answer.

            <p>Sorry, this might not be of much use to you, but at least some consolation....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having the exact same issue, and I'm on a single monitor set up. Monitor blacks out for 1 or 2 seconds, at times it becomes more frequent and might happen 2 or 3 times per minute.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Monitor is also not detected if I turn it on while my PC is POSTing, I have to turn it on only after Windows has loaded (I'm on an SSD, so that's not that big of a deal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can tell you I do that helps when the monitor starts blacking out is to turn it off and on again. I've noticed that the monitor only tends to do it on a "per session" basis, meaning that sometimes when I turn it on, it might exhibit the
 behavior, but after turning it off and on again, 9 times out of 10, I'll get a use "session" where the issue does not appear even after having the monitor powered up for several hours, and the remaining 1 time out of 10, I'll get a "bad session" when the blacking
 out will appear not even 5 minutes after powering on again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The monitor is the best I've ever had (I'm not used to monitors this nice since importing them in my country is very expensive), so I've learned to live with it.</p>

            <p>I'm having the same issue with one of my monitors (I have three of them), but I'm on Windows 7. I have also tried different video cards (including an ATI one, not just Nvidia), and the issue persists across all of them. Two of the three monitors are fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I am also using the HDMI connection. I'm wondering if it might be something related to that. Perhaps an interruption in the signal? I tried switching the HDMI cable to the other HDMI port on the monitor, but still the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using a straight HDMI cable, or a DVI-to-HDMI cable? If the latter, is it connected to a DVI-I or DVI-D port?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my scenario, I'm using a DVI-to-HDMI cable and across the different video cards, I've been using the DVI-I port.</p>

            I ended up getting a new NVidia graphics card, and am using the DVI connection instead of the HDMI. I also got a new Wacom tablet with a more current driver. That solved the screen blacking out problem, but now I have a new problem. When the computer goes
 to sleep, on awakening I sometimes (not always) get a message that the display has shut down and recovered. Sometimes this is accompanied by a very pixelated patch (about one x three inches) on one or the other of my monitors. This resolves if I restart the
 computer. So - just weird stuff. Hard to nail down whether it's Windows 10, monitors, graphics card or what.

            <p>You might want to just double-check your power draw/load and ensure your PSU is handling it. If you have a decent battery backup / UPS system (I maintain that everyone should have their computer on one so you have a chance to save and shut down in case of
 power loss, among other reasons), then many of those units should have a display that will tell you how many watts are being pulled. If you have a PSU that is getting maxed out or just getting old, it might not be delivering the power that your computer and
 graphics card need to properly function and change between states. Toms Hardware has a list of good PSUs, broken down into tiers, in case you want to replace yours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, Windows 10 has had some sleep-related problems that have been fixed recently, so double-check your Windows Update. I have a laptop with Windows 10 that didn't automatically grab the latest "big" update, so it's worth manually checking.</p>

            <p>This issue has "mostly" resolved itself - getting better with every Windows 10 update. I am only very, very occasionally getting the "display has shut down and recovered" issue now, so I'm thinking it was a sleep-related problem. Am having no issues with
 the screen blacking out now, and generally am very happy with my Dell dual monitors.</p>

            Hi Abdul, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            <p>Hello JudyShelton,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. I understand that you want to convert your .VOP files to a file that can be used on Microsoft programs. Unfortunately, we cannot provide an exact converter program. We can suggest that you use your favorite search engine
 to look for a converter within the web.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case you have issues within Movie Maker, please let us know. We'll be here to support you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I assume you mean VOB?<br />
There are plenty of free good converters listed here<br />
http://myvideoproblems.com/WebPages/UsefulProgrammes.htm<br />
I like mpeg streamclip which will convert it to a dv.avi file for you.&nbsp; one of the reasons I like this app is because it will recognise the joining of mpeg files which make up a vob and convert them al into one file. SOme converters will just convert the first
 mpeg file.<br />
Freemake is also very good.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Surface Devices &#38; Standart PC Devices Are Affected From USB EnhancedPowerManagementEnabled Bug</h2>
                    <p>So fatal bugs in regards of active usb&nbsp;EnhancedPowerManagementEnabled=1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have modern desktop mainboard with 10-13 USB3 ports soon you will find strange bug with entire PC. Everything seems to be associated if EnhancedPowerManagementEnabled is enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example this registry:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\Upgrade\Pnp\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceMigration\Devices\USB\VID_NNN&amp;PID_NNN&amp;NN_00\6&amp;00e000&amp;0&amp;0000\Device\EnhancedPowerManagementEnabled</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Surface devices and standart PC devices - all are affected. The results from this fiasco feature - USB only "Enhanced Power Management" are strange, random and fatal. They are so many and all are related with usb connected hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other feature which is associated with large count of bugs is "Fast Start".&nbsp;<br />
USB only "<strong>Enhanced Power Management</strong>" + "<strong>Fast Start</strong>" option break
<strong>HID service</strong> and entire Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft QA India do not want to make one simple test:</p>
<p>1. Run windows with 10 different devices which is connected on USB3 ports.</p>
<p>2. Enable "<strong>Enhanced Power Management</strong>" on all devices and "<strong>Fast Start</strong>".</p>
<p>3. Use powerful Intel CPU with Turbo Boost for example.</p>
<p>4. Restart PC and check device manager with hidden devices option.</p>
<p>5. Repeat 1000 times point 4 to see the strange and random result.&nbsp;</p>

                    Hi All,
<div>I use windows 8 pro for work and we use a client software which is run from a network location. I've mapped the network drive and can get into the folder through My Computer however when I go to use the client software or install a fresh version and select
 the mapped drive location I get this error "The drive or UNC share you selected does not exist or is not accessible"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the query description, it looks like you are unable to access the file location of client software after mapping a network drive as you get an error message prompting “The drive or UNC share you selected does not exist or is not accessible”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
I would like to ask certain question on this issue to help you better:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this issue specific to a particular file?</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, you are unable to access the files, I would suggest you to copy that software, that are using, on the computer and then try to install the client software.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue occurs, I would suggest you to post the query on Microsoft TechNet Forum for further help on this issue.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience that you are experiencing. I will surely help you on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to the power plan settings is corrupted and also due to outdated display driver or some other devices are responsible to keep it awake.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below method and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1.</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to run Power troubleshooter, it helps to fix any issue with the power settings of the computer. Follow the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + W</strong> and type<strong> troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Hit <strong>Enter</strong> and click on <strong>View all</strong> on the left panel<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></li><li>Click on <strong>Power</strong> and click on <strong>Next.</strong></li><li>Now follow the onscreen instructions to troubleshoot the issue, using Power troubleshooter.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue still persist try the below steps:</p>
<p><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to check if there is any devices that is preventing the computer to go to sleep mode when you close the lid. Try the below steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + S</strong> and type <strong>cmd</strong>.</li><li>Right click on it and select <strong>Run as administrator.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>Powercfg -devicequery wake_armed </strong><span>and hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.</span></li><li>You will get the name of the devices which may occurring the issue.</li><li>To disable a specific device from waking the computer, type command <strong>Powercfg -devicedisablewake "devicename"
</strong></li><li>Make sure that you replace the “<strong>devicename</strong>” placeholder with the name of the device that you want to disable.</li><li>If the issue is still same after you disable one device, disable the devices in this list one by one until you determine which device is causing the issue. If you want to re-enable a device to wake the computer, type command:
<strong>Powercfg -deviceenablewake "devicename" command</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information is helpful for you, post us with the status we will be glad to help you.</p>

<br />

<br />
<br />
You'll have to pick the one(s) that fit your situation. Or you could just copy your data from the XP machines instead of doing the Easy Transfer.

    <title>Xbox is unresponsive sometimes when using instant-on. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fugisan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox is unresponsive sometimes when using instant-on.</h2>
                    
<p>Continuing unsolved issue from&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/t/1877808.aspx<br />
<br />
My issue is when using the instant-on feature, when i turn my xbox on occasionally, every day or so, it will turn on, but no apps or games will open. The console simply sits at the main xbox screen, i can select options and can move the cursor around, but
 when i select and go to open an app or game, it just sits there and does nothing,<br />
<br />
A Hard reset will correct the error but it does not fix the issue as it continually returns.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I contact xbox one supoort ages ago and they said it was a bug ( Reference number #<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. They got me to;<br />
<br />
1) Clear persistent storage 3 times and<br />
2) Clear the mac cache<br />
<br />
This fixed my issue for another few days, then it continued.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have done the following troubleshooting steps;<br />
<br />
1) Deleted my profile and re-synced.<br />
2) Turned the xbox off for 10mins unplugged to clear the cache<br />
3) Bought and replaced my old wireless router with a new one.<br />
4) Completely reset the Xbox one to factory defaults.<br />
<br />
None of these issues have solved the issue, multiple people are reporting the same issue. The ONLY fix i have found is to disable the instant on feature. This is not a fix but a workaround.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Please guys look into this and release a patch or something. Or help me out!<br />

<p>There are loads of threads full of people, myself included, having the same problem, all of which are being ignored by MS.</p>
<p>Instant On seems to have been broken around the time of the November update. </p>
<p>Sadly as we all seem to be completely ignored, we have no way of knowing if MS have even acknowledged the issue, let alone having any intention of fixing it.</p>
<p>In the meantime, all we can do is switch to Power Saving mode, or put up with constant hard resets, neither of which is a satisfactory solution.</p>

<p>It has NOT been fixed with the February update.</p>
<p>I was having the issue with my console switching from instant on mode to energy save mode after a few days.&nbsp;It eventually got to the point where it did that every day.&nbsp;Power brick light would go from white to orange, console would not turn on with controller.
 I have to press the power button on the front to turn it on. It works fine after it finally boots. But it still says 'Instant On' in the settings. I just gave up and switched it to energy saver.</p>
<p>I downloaded the [Feb.]&nbsp;update, put it back into Instant On mode and it had the same problem that night. Turned it off for the night and the next morning it was in energy save mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I removed my profile, shut down the console, unplugged everything,
 held the console&nbsp;power button (with everything unplugged) for 30 seconds, plugged it all back in and turned it on.
</p>
<p>I actually thought it had worked. It went 3 days staying in instant on mode. But then this morning, I looked... and the power brick light is orange... a g a i n. Had to turn it on with the power button because the controller wouldn't do it... a g a i n.
 I've done everything that's been suggested on here and more to get it to work.</p>
<p>I think I've been more than patient with it. Waited through December, January and now almost half of February to get this latest update only to find it didn't work anyway. To the best of my knowledge, MS has never acknowledged they're aware of the problem?
 Unless I missed it? I'm not asking for some formal apology or compensation... I would be happy enough to know they're aware of the problem and are working on it. I don't think that's too much to ask?</p>

<p>"xxx Dante X xxx", Thanks for the response. Perhaps these problems aren't related, I've seen posts that are similar to my issue and posts that are similar to OP both in the same thread(s). If, by "energy problem" you mean I should try plugging the Xbox into
 the main wall plug and not use a surge protector... already tried that... didn't work.</p>

<p>There must be an awful lot of us with the same "energy problems" then!</p>
<p>Instant On worked perfectly right up until the November update, it's not worked since. It would be nice if Microsoft just acknowledged that something got broken in the update and were working on a fix, I'd happily accept that, but no, they just continue
 to complete ignore us all and there's not a *** thing we can do about it :(</p>

                    I have a Compaq Presario 503WM with Windows Vista Home Premium that is having problems after a Windows update today.&nbsp; First I installed .NET Framework (3.5?).&nbsp; Then&nbsp; Windows update started and downloaded some more updates, then asked to restart my computer
 - during restart received the message of configuring updates, but when it got to Configuring updates: Stage 2 of 3 - 100% complete.&nbsp; Do not turn off your computer, nothing is happening - neither my internal or external hard drive are doing anything and Ctrl-Alt-Delete
 doesn't&nbsp; do anything.&nbsp; What should I do next?<br />

Prior to this I installed Hallmark Card Studio 2010 Deluxe and received a 2738 error message.&nbsp; Followed the instructions on Microsoft to add two files that had to do with the VB script.&nbsp; Then Hallmark installation instructions downloaded and installed .NET
 Framework 3.5.&nbsp; The Windows update started and installed (I believe) 4 critical updates.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I am guessing that part of the issue might be a driver which is really older or similar which should not be loaded.<br />
<br />
Do this to leave Windows Updates on (after you gain access) and to stop Driver Updates from loading.

    <title>Location incorrect in weather app and find my device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonesy184  say:</h3>
<h2>            Location incorrect in weather app and find my device</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Surface Pro 2017 and just noticed the weather app and find my device keeps defaulting to Cape Coral, FL when I now live in Knoxville, TN. I have changed my address on my MS account, but both apps still insist that I am in Cape Coral.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have googled this issue for some time now and it looks like others have the same problem. I have not been able to find a solution and it's driving me crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have already changed the default address in weather to Knoxville, but I want it to know where I am when I click the "Always update location" button, NOT the hard default that forces the correct location. The weather app is not so bad, but there are
 obvious undesirable implications with the find my device feature.</p>

            There are a several ways to identify your location.  
<br />
<br />Bluetooth. Bluetooth is very short range. So when your device makes a bluetooth connection it is typically to a known fixed geographic location. This can be very specific.
<br />
<br />The one you are probably more familiar with is cell phone based. That uses the distance and direction from 3 or more cell towers to pin point your location.  This tends to be not very accurate but pretty good.
<br />
<br />Another is "GPS".  It uses signals from 3 or more SATELLITES.  It can be very accurate.
<br />
<br />The one you are having problems with is "IP" based.  Your IP number has a rough geographic location associated with it, typically something like city sized.  Sometimes, like your case, that location is wrong.  There is not much you can do about that. One thing you can try is using a different DNS service.  That is the service that translates www.???.com into 'IP' numbers.  There are many services and they keep their own records. So while the geographic location may be recorded incorrectly in on e place, others may be better.
<br />
<br />There are many alternative DNS providers. Here are links to one:

<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs. 
<br />
<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<p>Windows 10 has several settings that control access to a device's location.&nbsp; They can be found under:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px"><strong><em>Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Location</em></strong></p>
<p>The first two settings are called&nbsp;<strong>Location </strong>and <strong>Location service</strong>. If either one is turned off, then Windows will NOT REVEAL your location to apps that ask.
<strong>Location </strong>is a system-wide setting, and if turned on, then <strong>
Location service </strong>controls location access for the current user only.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure that <strong>Location </strong>and <strong>Location service</strong> are both turned on.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The next setting lets you specify a&nbsp;<strong>Default location</strong>&nbsp;to be used whenever Windows cannot determine your location with any degree of accuracy or confidence. I'll come back to this setting in a moment.<br />
<br />
This is followed by a way to <strong>Clear </strong>your location history stored on this device, as well as
<strong>some links</strong> to manage or review information concerning your location online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, you should see a list of Apps. This is where you can allow or deny location access on a per-app basis.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Make sure this setting is turned on for the "Weather App" and "Find My Device".</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that despite having identical names, this more general Windows 10 <strong>
Default location </strong>setting does NOT work in the same way as the <strong>Default location</strong> setting in the Weather App. The Weather App will
<em>always</em> use its default location if one is specified. Windows 10 only uses its more general default location setting<em> if all else fails</em>. I have devised an experiment, which exploits that difference. I think it should be able to identify the
 underlying location problem on your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Start the Weather App and select the&nbsp;<em><strong>Settings </strong></em>tab. Make sure that
<strong><em>Launch Location</em></strong> is set to <em><strong>"Always detect my location".
</strong></em>Exit the Weather App.</li><li>Go to the general Windows 10 <em><strong>Settings -&gt;&nbsp; Privacy -&gt; Location</strong></em> and temporarily set your
<strong>Default Location</strong> to somewhere that's way off - wrong by thousands of miles (let's say Timbuktu in Mali).</li><li>Note which of the following networks are up and accessible form your Surface Pro 2017:<br />
(a) Ethernet, (b) Wi-Fi, (c) Bluetooth, (d) cell phone connectivity (via optional LTE-Advanced modem).</li><li>Start the Weather App again and select the&nbsp;<em><strong>Favorites </strong></em>tab. Make a note of the first listed favorite (the Launch Location), and exit the Weather App.</li><li>If it is <em><strong>Timbuktu </strong></em>(Windows hasn't got a clue where you are), then go to Step 9.</li><li>If it is <em><strong>Cape Coral</strong></em> (Windows THINKS it knows where you are, but it's WRONG), then go to Step 8.</li><li>If it is <strong><em>Knoxville</em></strong> (Windows got it right), then the
<strong>Location Service</strong> works correctly when Windows has access to the infrastructure of the networks you noted as available in Step 3. Go to Step 8.<br />
<br />
</li><li>To reproduce the problem and perhaps isolate the cause, disable all the networks listed in Step 3. Then re-enable each of the networks ONE AT A TIME, repeating the steps from Step 3 each time. If you ever get to Step 6, then the one-and-only enabled network
 that time is the SOURCE OF YOUR PROBLEM. If you ever get to Step 7, then ADD the one-and-only enabled network that time to YOUR LIST of reliable location sources.<br />
<br />
<strong>SOLUTION A:<br />
</strong>(a) Ensre that a network on YOUR LIST of reliable location sources is up and available.<br />
(b) Whenever you require an accurate location, ensure that the network observed to be the SOURCE OF YOUR PROBLEM is neither up nor available.<br />
<br />
</li><li>Using the infrastructure of the networks you noted as available in Step 3, Windows was not able to determine your location with any degree of accuracy or confidence. Enable as many of the networks listed in Step 3 as you can. Restart the experiment at Step
 3. If you still end up here, then you MUST EITHER modify the general Windows 10 <strong>
Default location </strong>setting every time you need an accurate location OR ...<br />
<br />
<strong>SOLUTION B:</strong><br />
Move back to <em><strong>Cape Coral, Florida</strong></em>.<br />
<br />
Phew!</li></ol>
