<h2>            How do I restrict web browsing to only certain websites&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hey, guys!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to know how to restrict my computer to certain websites. I know how to set up parental controls, but I don't want to do that. I'd like to restrict
<em>the administrator </em>account, but Windows won't let me because I'm the administrator. Is there another way to do this? What I'm trying to do is set the computer so that it only has access to certain websites (similar to what can be done with parental
 controls). I don't want to block certain websites. I want to&nbsp;<em><strong>access only certain websites</strong></em> and
<em><strong>not allow the computer to access any other websites except for the ones on the list.</strong></em> Is there a way to do this? Is there a way to for the administrator to do this without having to set up another user account or parental control account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>R. Best</p>

            <p>There's not a way to do this built-in.&nbsp; I'm sure there is software online that can help (although as the administrator, you can always bypass or turn off the software).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you only want to block a few sites, you could edit your hosts file.&nbsp; However if you wanted to block "everything except a few", that would be impossible because you can only block -- not allow -- sites by using the hosts file.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Ambassador XP frozen&#63;</h2>
                    So, I'm a new Ambassador, having just started today, and I've had ~10 chats in which I'd like to say I've been quite helpful, but I've received no XP at all, or Tenure. In addition, I talked to some other Ambassadors and it seems to be widespread, one
 of whom said theirs has been frozen since the 7th. I've not been awarded a forum badge because I can't even get to level one because nothing is being registered. If someone could get back to me or if any other Ambassadors are having the same problem post in
 the thread! Thanks in advance!

            Hi dawnrivera1 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />When you attach a Webcam to Windows 10, it will look for the best drivers for the Webcam and install.  In some rare cases, it may require you to install Webcam specific drivers.
<br />
<br />To check the Webcam, type Camera in Cortana search and run Camera app. 
<br />
<br />If you face problem, revert to me with make and model of your Webcam.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore</span><span>
 is a very useful feature of Windows </span><span>Vista</span><span> but it has one main
 drawback. After running for a few weeks, it can use a lot of your hard </span><span>disk space</span><span>.
 With the default settings turned on, System Restore might use up to 15 percent of the space on each disk. For example, if you have a 250GB
</span><span>hard disk drive</span><span>, System Restore might end up using 37,5GB of
 it. </span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
Also, right-click on the Recycle Bin &gt; Properties &gt; see how much drive space that is using.<br />
<br />
Cheers.</span></p>

<h2>            My download files keep freezing</h2>
                    I do not think I have a virus because I have Norton security but when I try to open up download files it freezes. &nbsp;It does not really freeze but it has been stuck on the loading icon for over 2 days. I cannot shut down my computer or exit out the computer
 folder. I cant access any programs or shortcuts except for the ones on the start menu and task bar. I have 5 computer folders up because I repeatedly go in them to try to open up my download files again but fail. Then the same loading icon next to mouse pops
 up and never goes away. I really don't know why, but I cannot exit it out, shut down my computer, or bring up task manager. The problem seems to be just with my download files within the computer folder. Nothing is wrong with my internet and i can access Google
 chrome on my task bar. But like I said earlier, the icon on the surface screen thing will not work if i click on them.&nbsp;

    <title>Photoshop Elements Serial Number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveferrier  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photoshop Elements Serial Number</h2>
                    I purchased Photoshop Elements from the Microsoft Store, it has downloaded and loaded fine. The one thing I don't have, and it seems to be a common problem, is the serial number. Doing some research I cannot find any resolution to the issue. Another problem
 is you guys make it almost impossible (i'm still trying with no success) to talk to or contact any living person about his problem. Extremely disappointing for a company of this size to make it so had to resolve issues.

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />If you bought it through the Store you should not be prompted for a serial number. 
<br />
<br />Launch the Microsoft Store and look under purchases. You should be able to install from there and you will not be prompted for a product key. 
<br />
<br />If you want to talk to a live person:
<br />
<br />1. Talk to support

            Hi BigDaddy6969 
<br />
<br />You cannot actually gift him a game, due to regional differences, what you can do is provide them with a Microsoft Store Gift Card, they can then purchase that game for themselves, in that region . .

    <title>Windows XP Home SP3 Cant boot into safe mode from a crash Sony laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows XP Home SP3 Cant boot into safe mode from a crash  Sony laptop VGN-A790</h2>
                    <p>I get to the window that shows safe mode safe mode with networking, and last good configuration none of which works. If I choose safe mode, I get a black screen with a long list, such as multi(0) disk(0)&nbsp; rdisk(0)partition(2)\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\compbatt.sys
 and about 50 others.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>I am not sure if this happened because I updated java plug in later reading with xp it should be uninstalled, since there is no longer support for xp. The only recovery disc I have is for xp pro sp 2, but I need to get one that is xp home with sp3. XP home
 came installed on the laptop at purchase, and has since been updated to sp3. Is there a way to create a bootable disc using sp3 from a computer using windows 7, I have borrowed from a friend for 48 hours.<br />
<br />
The only other disc I have is the one that sets it back to factory settings supplied by Sony, but can't do that, since I will loose files. The disc wont do it anyway since I have ie7 or 8 and SP3 is installed.&nbsp; I have tried F8 multiple times with no luck, however
 I am using a wireless keyboard, although the arrow keys work to choose safe mode, after that,&nbsp; I can't get past the long list (example above), and leaving it idle at the screen with the list sends it back into a recycle of reboot. Choosing anything else in
 the list does nothing including last good config. I have no known way of seeing a blue screen.<br />
<br />
I have no backup of files and can't loose 10 years of work, etc. I had&nbsp; a similar issue once before when my hard drive died about 3 years ago, but since have replaced the hard drive, and files were transferred using Ubuntu. I could download ubuntu to a USB
 drive that is bootable and try that I just don't recall from the last time if I left that option available in the bios for future issues in case I needed it but I think I did, if there is a way that I can fix it using Ubuntu? I won't be replacing this computer
 until November, so I need to get it back working again, any help or suggestions will be much appreciated as I was in the middle of a job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly,</p>
<p>Stacey</p>

            <p>XP cd with SP3,isnt what you need,just a xp installation cd v2002 would</p>
<p>help,otherwise,reinstalling xp or "repairing" the current OS is out because</p>
<p>of IE updates &amp; WMP 11,plus other updates youd have to remove 1st.</p>
<p>Either way,with a installation cd (any version),start pc &amp; enter BIOS,install</p>
<p>cd,set to boot to cd (1st boot priority)hd 2nd,exit &amp; save,press any key</p>
<p>to boot to cd,if SATA or RAID are installed,press F6 option,use floppy</p>
<p>for drivers (follow screen),at cd menu,press&nbsp; r&nbsp; key for recovery console,</p>
<p>select 1 for C:&nbsp; press enter for password.Type: FixBoot&nbsp; Agree,type:</p>
<p>CHKDSK C: /R&nbsp; Once its thru,chk data,look for bad sectors,or type:</p>
<p>EXIT&nbsp; Let xp start auto.</p>
<p>Also,in recovery,software can be stopped,"Disable"&nbsp; Listsvc&nbsp; gets you the</p>
<p>running software.Read KB 307654&nbsp; or&nbsp; 307545</p>
<p>All this can/could solve the problem,unless a hardware failure exist...</p>

            <p>Unfortunately, the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know next to&nbsp; nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
If you have a Dell computer, what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not use any recovery disk that came with your system - sounds too risky.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you choose to boot in Safe Mode you will see lots of scrolling messages in white text on a black background (this is normal).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you choose to boot in Safe Mode, does the system just restart or does it appear to hang?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system hangs, what does the last line on the screen say (exactly)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it restarts, reboot again and start repeatedly tapping the F8 key to get to the Advanced Boot Options Menu from the Advanced Boot Options menu choose:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong></p>
<p>If there is a problem booting, XP is configured to automatically try to boot again and you can get stuck in a loop of just being unable to get past the boot options screen or none of the boot options you choose will work.<br />
<br />
Sometimes when XP has a problem starting or crashes and tries to start again, it will give you a "short" menu of boot options and none of them will seem to be the right ones to get your system going again.&nbsp; Something like this:<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
<br />
You've tried them all but the system just keeps restarting!<br />
<br />
The options resemble the XP Advanced Boot Options menu, but the one option you need (Disable automatic restart on system failure) is not offered because XP has gone too far along in the boot process and offers you a limited number of boot options.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, you must manually invoke the Advanced Boot Options menu yourself until you do see the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong><br />
<br />
When you do get to the correct XP Advanced Options Boot menu you want to see, it has options on it like these:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt<br />
<br />
Enable Boot Logging<br />
Enable VGA mode<br />
Last Known Good Configuration (your most recent settings that worked)<br />
Directory Services Restore Mode (Windows domain controllers only)<br />
Debugging Mode<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> <br />
<br />
Start Windows Normally<br />
Reboot<br />
Return to OS Choices Menu<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What you need to choose from that menu is the option:<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure<br />
</strong><br />
Then if XP fails to boot normally, you will see an error screen with information and clues regarding the problem and then you can decide what to do next.<br />
<br />
If you do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option, you need to reset your system and start tapping the F8 key on the keyboard until you do see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again and start tapping the F8 key with more urgency (sooner and more frequently) until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure, then select it.<br />
<br />
You need to keep trying the F8 menu until you do see Disable automatic restart on system failure option, and select it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system is experiencing a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), we need to know what the screen says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a BSOD example showing information you need to provide:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffud.community.services.support.microsoft.com%2fFud%2fFileDownloadHandler.ashx%3ffid%3d61d9d586-827e-4c8f-b9b8-ea00897dd947" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Send the information pointed to with the red arrows (3-4 lines total). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Send the entire *** STOP message line since there are clues in the 4 parameters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it looks like there is some kind of file name listed under the STOP message, send that line too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skip the boring text unless it looks important to you. &nbsp;We know what a BSOD looks like, we need to know what your BSOD looks like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Respond to the queries and report back the results from the Disable automatic restart on system failure screen and you can decide what to do next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are waiting:</p>
<br />
<p>You are unlikely to "fix" your system using Ubuntu since Ubuntu uses a different file system and doesn't have the tools built in you need to fix an NT File System (NTFS), but you could hopefully copy your personal files it or you could make a Hiren's Boot
 CD, boot on that and copy your files off and perhaps use it to do some repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You really can't tell if you can fix it or not until you know what is wrong with it - then you can decide the best way to see if you can fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD and start with a chkdsk with error correction.&nbsp; Here's how:</p>
<p>Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things you need to Uncheck too (anything to do with your browser home page, AVG, etc.).<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />

<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>cmd</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</strong><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.

<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.&nbsp; Don't think I want to do it on this borrowed laptop running windows 7<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Think it's already set this way, as I am able to boot with the XP pro disc I'm just afraid to follow prompts because I have xp home
 installed and don't know what issues that will cause.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>cmd</strong><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<strong>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</strong><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
</p>
</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it
 may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp; Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It
 may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system. <br />
<br />
Ok will try all this, but I know from past experience like when running a full anti virus scan it can take more than 24 hours. I think I will make the windows xp home sp2 disc from the microsoft site here
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310994/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows XP Setup disks</a> and then follow instructions on how to do a repair instal such as
<a href="http://www.oucs.ox.ac.uk/helpcentre/troubleshooting/winxp/index.xml?splitLevel=-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these</a> or <a href="http://www.informationweek.com/software/operating-systems/langa-letter-xps-no-reformat-nondestructive-total-rebuild-option/d/d-id/1044226?page_number=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
these</a> if after I've done all of the above, and if I don't have any luck? Do you think this is the right thing to do if i can't use the F8 to read the blue screen? I tried to respond to each of your questions/statements above just in case you missed that.

            <p>When the last thing you see on the screen in Safe mode is mup.sys, lots of folks think the problem is with mup.sys and go to great lengths to try to replace it but that is not the problem at all - mup.sys has already loaded and the problem is what comes
<em>after </em>mup.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When XP boots it checks all volumes (hard drives) to see if the "dirty bit" is set on a volume and if the dirty bit is set, XP will automatically run a chkdsk with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) to try to clear the dirty bit.&nbsp; The dirty bit can get set on
 a volume from a power failure, power interruption, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, using the power switch, plug pulling, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Safe Mode after mup.sys loads, that is when XP checks the dirty bit on the volume and if a chkdsk needs to run, it is going to run and you will not see anything else on your screen - probably for a long time.&nbsp; The system will appear that it is hung or
 stuck on mup.sys (but XP has already gone past that) and the chkdsk is probably running.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can tell this by observing the HDD access light on your system (if it has one) and/or by listening to the system to hear if the HDD is "working".&nbsp; If the HDD light is flashing/blinking that means that XP is doing something and if the last thing you see
 is mup.sys, XP is running the chkdsk with error correction.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is your HDD light blinking/flashing when the system appears to be hung on mup.sys?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case, you need to wait it out and it could take a very long time (perhaps hours) depending on the size of your HDD, the amount of data on the HDD and what the chkdsk finds to do and even then it
<em>still </em>might not clear the dirty bit so the next time you reboot, you will appear to be "stuck" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to see it (for those interested) is to schedule a chkdsk with error correction to run on the next reboot of XP and then boot in Safe Mode.&nbsp; Your system will appear to be hung on mup.sys (but it has already loaded) and that is when the chkdsk
 is going to run and you will be "stuck" there for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The trouble is, you can't see the chkdsk running it to know what it is doing or if you need to run the chkdsk again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required) and run the chkdsk with error correction from there but it looks like your system has SATA drives and that may make using the Recovery Console an issue since the RC does not include SATA
 drivers.&nbsp; You may be able to adjust the BIOS to make it work, but you will not be able to access much on your system from the RC for it is limited.&nbsp; For example, you would not be able to copy of your personal files since the RC only lets you access a few folders
 and you won't be seeing any external USB storage devices you might have plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the case of using the RC on a SATA system, you will not be running fixboot, fixmbr, chkdsk, or even a "dir" command but you can sure try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I like Hiren's.&nbsp; It does not have these issues and you can explore your system just like you can from XP and copy your files off to an external USB device if you need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you make the Hirens's Boot CD you can run the chkdsk with error correction manually and watch it run and run it again if you need to until it reports no problems (it might need to run more than once).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Work more on F8 and getting to the <strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong> option to see what the BSOD says (assuming you are getting one) and that might reinforce the need to run the chkdsk with error correction.&nbsp; It will work if you
 get it timed just right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to make the floppies, you will find that you can't Repair a SP3 system using SP2 media, but you can sure try and then you will see a message like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Setup cannot continue because the version of Windows on your computer is newer than the version on the CD.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never repaired a system in my life to fix any XP problem and I have never even suggested it (and never will).&nbsp; To me it is a very desperate move and the next to the last thing to "try" to fix a broken system and you have many other better options
 that do not involve the word try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt a Repair is going to fix the dirty bit on a volume anyway (if it is set), but that is another thing you can try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a tryer.</p>

            I have a XP &lt;strong&gt;pro&lt;/strong&gt; disc without sp2 or sp3 on it, in fact I don't even know if it has sp1 on it. I want to make an xp &lt;strong&gt;home&lt;/strong&gt; bootable disc, to try to fix my xp home laptop. I can't get past the reboot loop tried f8 at least
 20 times, and I've tried the Hirens boot cd, neither work. My thought is to use the xp pro contents to make a bootable xp home cd, and add sp2 and sp3. Is this ok to do or do I need to buy an xp home disk. I don't have any drivers to update as none were ever
 done on my Sony avg-a790. I don't know of any other way to get to the bsod screen and read the error, but just in case something goes wrong I want to have a cd with the correct repairs ready

 a new disk? <strong>You can see me original post</strong> <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/windows-xp-home-sp3-cant-boot-into-safe-mode-from/a469d388-6110-4646-bf99-33e25b792799?rtAction=1405989281726">

<h2>            Network Transefered DLC not working</h2>
                    <p>The specific DLC I'm talking about is all the DLC from Fallout 4</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had networked transferred the DLC onto my new Xbox One, yet when I go to the add ons section in the main menu of the game it says none of them are installed. How can I resolve this issue?</p>

            Try downloading them to the console instead. They may have got corrupt during the network transfer, hence why the game does not recognize them.

<p>Hello Stabes!</p>
<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums. I understand you're having trouble with using some DLC for Fallout 4. If the network transferring is making them not show up on the new Xbox One I recommend you install the DLC directly from the Xbox Marketplace.
 Just press "Y" at any time while on the Dashboard&nbsp;of your Xbox One and search the content you're looking to install. Give it a try and let us know with a&nbsp; reply how it goes.

<p>Thanks for the response!</p>
<p>I tried this before submitting my question, however when I did the marketplace showed the prices of the add ons as if I had never purchased them. I thought it would be faster and less of a hassle to do a network transfer of the items</p>

<p>Hi Stabes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked in the game itself under ready to install? If they aren't there you may have to install the game again. Also make sure they are still in your

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing I would recommend is clearing the cache on the Xbox one. You can do this by holding the power button - when the Xbox is on- and keep holding it until the Xbox One shuts off. Once this has happened, please leave it for 30 seconds then reboot
 the Xbox. You should then see the Xbox One splash screen when you have turned it on.

I boot into the Windows 10 ISO and see the Windows flag logo. A second later it blue screens and gives me that error. I can't even get into the Windows 10 setup process.<br />

            I have been trying to update to Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 since 2013. I bought this computer back in 2011 and didn't expect its lifespan would end so abruptly. Funny enough, my Asus A8H from 2007 is able to install Windows 10, whereas my Asus U43F is
 not. I have contacted Asus Tech Support on multiple occasions for help on this issue. They flat out said that because your computer came with Windows 7 we are under no obligation to help you on any other operating system besides that. I have ran Microsoft's
 Upgrade Assistant and it has stated that my computer was compatible with an upgrade to Windows 10. If I knew my computer would not be able to upgrade past Windows 8 I would not have purchased this $700 computer. I have felt cheated and lied to by Asus and
 will most likely not purchase their products again, because I simply cannot be certain if their products will be supported in the future.. I will be switching to Apple's Mac and avoid the headache that comes with Microsoft and PCs. It has been

<p>
</p><p>I have my <strong>User Files</strong> on another HDD which is a spinning disk and my system files on the SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disabled Windows Defender</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unplugged<strong> EVERYTHING</strong> from the <strong>external por</strong><strong>ts</strong> of the computer and then update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Install goes fine. Extracting files.. Configuring files..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once configuring files is completed it restarts. I see a flash on the screen (very very quickly) and then it says restoring your previous version and then error message on login.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have the same model of laptop as you do, and I have exactly the same result. I'm still searching a way to make this work. I will share my findings if i'm able to do the upgrade. Please let me know if you were able to find a solution.</p>

            <p>I have done everything on this list and still get the 0xC1900101 0x20017 error during SAFE_OS phase with an error during BOOT operation</p>
<p>
</p><p>100% my drivers are all updated</p>
<p>I have unplugged all of my drives except the C drive</p>
<p>I have no external devices connected</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I read, the ISO file is NOT a viable option, since the installation process I find, including DaCosta's links, says install WIndows 10 then reinstall Windows 10 from ISO, but if I could install Windows 10, I would not need the fricken ISO to reinstall.
 If there are better instructions somewhere on how to use the ISO file that does not FIRST include a successfull install, that would be awesome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have 9 attempts and over 20 hours into the "FREE" Windows 10 disaster, and as far as I can tell, I have progressed very little. Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for this abortion.</p>

            <p>i had the same error, had to run an in place install to attempt to fix another problem (random glitch caused when the win 10 upgrade first became available) and after scouring every DB i could find, i got this page of solutions to work (used all of them
 to be sure), it would seem the error is caused by some miscommunication with your chip set, i tried solutions 2 and 3 first, and then 1 which ended up working. this is instruction to edit the ISO of the installer package, so use caution; i feel it's safe and
 have tried it with success, but that doesn't mean everyone will... enjoy!<br />

<p>
</p><p>edit: important to note, it was not feasible for me to do a clean install, and that may work as well. i tried cleaning everything out, and using an un-modified dvd installer first. my system is older, but well within the requirements for the OS.</p>

    <title>Meu console riscou meu disco - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bodesujeirinha2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Meu console riscou meu disco</h2>
                    
<p>Olá! Há poucos dias comprei um XBOX 360, travado, e estava jogando meu GTA V tranquilamente quando ouvi um barulho muito sinistro vendo do console&nbsp;(que fica na vertical) e então o jogo travou. Quando tirei o disco do console, ele estava todo riscado e agora
 não funciona mais. Ninguém encostou no console neste momento. Foi muito sinistro. Acionei o suporte da Microsoft e o atendente orientou a trocar o console e tentar trocar o jogo onde eu comprei. Consegui trocar o console mas o jogo a Microsoft não quer me
 ressarcir sendo que a causa do problema foi o próprio console. O pior de tudo é o cara do suporte me tirar falando que eu mexi no console enquanto rodava o jogo, ou seja, como todo suporte no Brasil ele quer é que o cliente se lasque a ter de admitir que o
 meu produto veio com defeito. Tenho um console (Arcade) bem mais velho que nunca tive problemas e neste Slim deu isso.</p>

<p>É evidente que você não leu tudo o que escrevi. Ninguém tocou no console. Estava jogando com o controle sem fio e a um metro e meio de distância quando houve um ruido alto vindo do console, o jogo travou e quando tirei ele havia riscado o disco. Tenho anos
 de experiência com informática e não poderia cometer tamanha estupidez de virar o console ligado. Estou sondando pra achar mais alguém que isso tenha acontecido.</p>

<p>Cara aconteceu comigo no jogo MK, &nbsp;ja faz um tempo.</p>
<p>Realmente nao sei como mas parou de funcionar mas nao fez quase nenhum barulho, tirei a midia e la estava o dito cujo do arranhao.</p>
<p>Nao roda nem a pau, ai para nao perder o jogo arrumei outro MK emprestado, instalei no meu HD e uso a midia arranhada só para iniciar o jogo, dar o boot. E funciona perfeitamente.</p>
<p>Desse dia ate hoje pode ser o que for instalo antes de jogar qualquer coisa.</p>
<p>Ate essa baboseira de só instalar o disco 1 do GTA e o disco 2 nao só por causa de umas cenas que por menos de 1 segundo ja esta blz.</p>
<p>Nao arrisco mais nao cara a experiencia fala mais alto.</p>

<p>Comigo foi diferente, o disco do Assassin's Creed Revelations, roda mas não abre, não virei o console não mexi no CD durante um bom tempo e quando fui jogar, puf, nem barulho deu, parece um pouco "queimado" nas bordas, tipo desfigurado.</p>

<p>Eu comprei o gta 5 no lançamento e aconteceu exatamente a mesma coisa, o leitor do xbox riscou o meu cd. Mas no meu caso o xbox estava na vertical e meu pai acabou esbarrando muito de leve nele, que foi o suficiente pra fazer um *** risco na midia. Levei
 o cd em uma loja de games aqui perto e eles disseram pra eu nunca usar o xbox na vertical e tbm não usar controles com fio, porque ele é muito sensivel e pode riscar o cd facilmente.</p>
<p>Como o gta5 tinha esgotado eu mandei o meu cd para polir(não estava lendo nada do cd), e por sorte voltou funcionando perfeitamente =D</p>

<p>Aconteceu com meu bf4 também há 2 semanas, fiquei muito bolado, dae levei para POLIR, não aqueles que enganam, e o cara tirou todo o risco da midia, ta novinho.</p>
<p>Procura algum lugar para polir a midia, antes pergunta se vai resolver, se ele vier de conversinha deixa pra la. Procure alguém que te dê certeza que vai resolver.</p>
<p>E faça o que o rodrigospfc falou, grave todos os jogos no hd e use o cd apenas para o boot.</p>

<p>Já aconteceu comigo também. Comprei outro disco e paciência. Agora eu sempre instalo os jogos no HD, pois, mesmo riscado, pode ser que dê para jogar já que o disco servirá como um boot.</p>

<p>Esse é o único problemas das medias físicas, tenta trocar na loja q você comprou alegando alguma irregularidade na media, pois como você não tocou no console a media pode estar fora de balaço ou algo do tipo.</p>

<h2>            Backwards Compatibility Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,</p><p><br /></p><p>I’m having issues installing Splinter Cell: Blacklist from my Xbox 360 disc on to my Xbox One. I’ve checked to make sure and it is reading discs just fine, but whenever I input the disc or try to load it I’m told that it’s not backwards compatible. I’ve pulled it up on the store and seen it online, and I love this game to death but I would like to play my original copy instead of paying $20+ for something I already own. Would anyone be able to help? Thank you!</p>

<h2>            My profile is acting strangely when I try to play a game.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all. I hope someone can help me out with this. It's my first time posting here with a problem so please bear with me if I don't give enough info or something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what's going on, but when I log into my profile, it tells me I have the right number of gamer points. Then I try to play a game, and all my gamer points are gone! I try to sign out and back in with the game booted, and I'm prompted to select an
 avatar (which just brings up a message that the avatar couldn't be saved). Doesn't fix the problem. Also, I check the achievements for the game I'm trying to play, and there isn't even a list of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I return to the dashboard to find 0 for my gamerscore. Also, my dashboard is back to the default green, and not the Yankee background that I should have. When I sign out and back it, everything is back to normal, and the cycle starts again. Can anybody tell
 me what's going on and how to fix this?</p>

<p>Hey mate, have you tried recovering your Gamertag to you console? If not, go ahead and give that a try. If that doesn't resolve the issue, please try formatting a USB stick for use with Xbox 360, and then try recovering to that instead (with the hard drive
 removed). Please let me know if you have any questions, and how things turn out!</p>

<h2>            Toshiba satellite l855-s5405 not working properly</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba satellite l855-s5405 from 2013. It seems to be overheating and spinning the fan very fast, even when browsing the web. I have gotten a blue screen error twice (memory management error) and today when I turned it on the screen was black
 after typing in my pin except for the mouse. I was able to get back into the login screen and I restarted. no luck. I shut it down and turn it back on. It finally works. Is there a way to fix these problems? will they keep happening? (I checked for updates,
 none needed execpt for first blue screen)

            Hi, Zack
<br />
<br />My name is Phillip and I am an Independent Advisor. I hope it helps.
<br />
<br />Try to enter Safe Mode  to repair Windows.
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

    <title>Windows 8 on Asus notebook won&#39;t boot, error 0xc000000f, recovery - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 8 on Asus notebook won&#39;t boot, error 0xc000000f, recovery partition useless</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>my ASUS just crashed, and it didn't start, all I got is the ASUS "republic of gamers" screen, then black screen.</p>
<p>So I pressed F8 and selected "refresh windows", but it skipped and rolled back.</p>
<p>So I tried to check for startup problems, it said there are problems with the disk, and now I have the error message 0xc000000f.</p>
<p>Please have in mind, I have the blue screen error message, I can not press Enter or anything else.</p>
<p>Only thing I can do is press "ESC" so I get into my BIOS, but after restart I immediately get back again to the bluescreen.</p>
<p>Pressing F8 while startup doesn't change anything, also SHIFT+F8.</p>
<p>I would like to get to the prompt screen to fix the BCD, but there is no way to get rid of the bluescreen and get into the repair screen.</p>
<p>Dell and Lenovo notebooks have some keystroke combinations to delete the bluescreen and go to the repair, but I can't find any for my ASUS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Biggest problem is that I buyed the notebook, but there was no cd/dvd, I also did not make any backup device after first start (like it was recommended after vista install), I only have a recovery partition.</p>
<p>Also there was no serial number sticker on the notebook.</p>
<p>So I can't use the recovery from the partition because I can't get rid of the bluescreen, and I can't refresh/reinstall because I have no CD or stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could download a DVD, but would like to have an official microsoft link, it would be even better to have a bootable USB device. Anyone have some helpful links?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I reinstall / repair, do I have to need a serial?</p>
<p>Because, like I just said, I don't have any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

    <title>How can I prevent the Windows 10 Op System file download&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nairb egdirnworb  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I prevent the Windows 10 Op System file download&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Like the forum post started by Mr. Koelling on July 29th 2015 entitled 'Upgrade Windows 10 Home failed", I also have many instances (15) of "Update to Windows 10 Home" showing as "Failed" in my update history.&nbsp; When I double click on any of these instances,
 I get a "Windows Update" window that advises me that the Error code associated with this is 80340020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm happy that these installations failed, because after the fiasco of Windows 8 I don't trust Microsoft's ability to design a good operating system and so I don't want to have anything to do with Windows 10 until the user committee has passed judgement
 on it and the bugs are worked out of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was away and had my computer off from Aug. 18th 2015&nbsp;until today, (Sep. 18th) and after becoming aware of the totally unscrupulous decision by MS to include the Windows 10 files as part of their Automatic Updates,&nbsp;before allowing anymore automatic updates
 I&nbsp;changed my update option to "Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Windows Updates shows me that there are 28 important updates available, (no doubt some are the Windows 10 file updates&nbsp;that failed before are included in these 28).&nbsp; However, I&nbsp;don't want to install any more updates without first being able to check
 and hopefully delete (or prevent) any Windows 10 updates&nbsp;that may be included in&nbsp;the list of 28 from being downloaded to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how can I know if any of the 28 updates available is the Windows 10 update, and if so how can I prevent any attempts for any more Windows 10 file downloads?&nbsp; My update history shows that the&nbsp;last update&nbsp;Successful update was on Aug. 14th
 2015, and that there were four&nbsp;"Failed"&nbsp;Windows 10 Home upgrade attempts from Aug. 15th to 17th.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using Windows 7 Home Premium with Service Pack 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on the "Install Updates' button, what will happen?&nbsp; I don't want to do this if there will be more attempts for the Windows 10 upgrade files to be downloaded that I can't prevent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a few of the forums about preventing the Windows 10 download, but anything to do with changing the registry is only for geeks and 98% of the users of this forum are totally incapable of applying that kind of a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.</p>

<p>I think you under-estimate the abilities of people to copy/paste/save/double-click...&nbsp; :-)<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is a peer-to-peer volunteer-based public worldwide web forum.&nbsp; The answers you get here will be raw in some cases, but may be the only ones you will ever get - and they usually work or they get called out on it fairly quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>With that in mind - the only safe/proven alternatives at this point are the 'removal of the updates that cause it' and then 'hiding those updates' and 'hoping more are not released or those are not re-released causing this issue all over again' OR a simple
 registry edit that changes/adds four entries and can be reversed by changing (essentially) a decimal '0' to a decimal '1' and vice-versa.&nbsp; The latter is more of a permanent fix and actually - in many ways - requires less skill and effort than the first alternative.&nbsp;
 The hardest thing about it - that I can see - is changing the file extension/saving with the proper file extension.&nbsp; (The method I give doesn't involve the end-user having to actually open the registry editor - just notepad.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Copy and paste the text below (and above) the obvious markers into a text file, save it as 'DisableGWX.reg' (&lt;-- changing even the file extension - if you cannot see it, you'll have to change your Windows Explorer view a bit to make this easier) and then
 use that (right-click on it, MERGE it into your registry) to disable the upgrade 'pushiness' you are seeing.&nbsp; Restart to get the full effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------- COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE ----------------</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\GWX]<br />
"DisableGWX"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate]<br />
"DisableOSUpgrade"=dword:00000001<br />
<br />
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\WindowsUpdate\OSUpgrade]<br />
"AllowOSUpgrade"=dword:00000000<br />
"ReservationsAllowed"=dword:00000000</p>
<p>---------------- COPY EVERYTHING ABOVE THIS LINE ----------------&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done, you should be without the notification and your Microsoft Updates should return to it's normal state.&nbsp; If you ever want to upgrade to Windows 10 again (remember, it is a work in progress and if you upgraded already on that system and activated
 - then there is a license for Windows 10 you will never have to pay for tied to that individual machine for the life of that individual machine) you could likely use the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> to do so *or* reverse the registry values above (all dword:00000001 becomes dword:00000000 and all dword:00000000 becomes dword:00000001) and save that file and MERGE it again.&nbsp; Restart and you are back where you were before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*TIP* for everyone out there.&nbsp; One thing I have not seen advertised about the 30-day rollback option you have with Windows 10 is that *if* you run the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool </a>at any point in those 30 days, it BREAKS the ability to rollback - even if you did it just to create an ISO image so you would have installation media to keep.&nbsp; This is because that tool recreates the $'Windows.~BT' and '$Windows.~WS'
 folders on the root of your C drive and those two folders and their original contents after the upgrade along with the 'Windows.OLD' folder (the only 'visible by default' one of the three) are all necessary for the rollback process to work.</p>

            <p>Hello Shenan.&nbsp; You have really gone to a lot of effort to help me, and I'm impressed and will give it a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, is there any way I can slow down or pause or back-up your animation GIF?&nbsp; Some parts are a little too fast for me to comprehend what you are doing.&nbsp; (I have changed my I.E. page zoom to 175% so that helps me see the small GIF image text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You recommend viewing your animated GIF in a web-browser and I wonder if you can explain how I can do that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also wonder if you can comment on a comment I made in my original question.&nbsp; I quoted from the "Change&nbsp;settings" part of my&nbsp;Windows Updates in my Control Panel when I said that I had changed from Automatic Updates to "Check for updates but let me choose
 whether to download and install them".&nbsp; The wording of this setting clearly seems to imply that there is some way that I can see what the individual updates are so as to be able to choose whether to download and install them or not.&nbsp; Can you tell me how I
 can choose whether to download and install from the 28 updates that Windows is advising me are available?&nbsp; What will happen if I click on the "Install updates" button?&nbsp; Will that enable me to see the 28 updates that are available and will I then be able to
 choose not to allow&nbsp;any of the&nbsp;Window's 10 Home updates that might be available to proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have some questions about your text explanation if you have the time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say <strong>"to disable the upgrade 'pushiness' you are seeing." </strong>
by the word "pushiness" do you mean any additional attempts by M'Soft to download the Windows 10 Home files to my computer?&nbsp; I think that is what you mean but just want to clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say <strong>"you should be without the notification" </strong>can you explain what you mean by "notification".&nbsp; Do you mean the update history list that shows the failed Windows 10 Home&nbsp;updates?&nbsp; Or some other notification?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks in advance Shenan for your reply.</p>

            <p>Sorry - animated GIFs are what they are.&nbsp; There are plugins for Chrome that can do it, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are viewing the web forum, you are viewing it in a Web Browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no such wording as you have given IN Windows 10.&nbsp; That was a Windows XP/Vista/7/8/8.1 thing.&nbsp; That is not available in Windows 10 and is a point of contention.&nbsp; In the prior OSes you can go into Windows Update and choose to see the updates available
 and simply check or uncheck the ones you want/don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The term "pushiness" refers to the solicitation for upgrading to Windows 10 - including it being listed in your Windows Update section of Control Panel and the notification icon at the bottom right (as shown in the GIF.)</p>

            <p>Hi back Shenan.&nbsp; Thank you again for your help., and thank you for finding a way in effect&nbsp;slow down your GIF animation by extending&nbsp;your mouse movements.&nbsp; When I hadn't heard back from you by last&nbsp;night I phoned a company called iYogi which is a fee for
 use Microsoft help service, (the wait time for Microsoft was 1 1/2 hours) and after hearing my tale of woe the rep was very helpful in telling me (as your GIF also shows) that I could click on the Widows Update text line that stated "28 important updates are
 available", and that I could then see a list of all the28 updates that were available to me, and un-check any that were related to Windows 10.&nbsp; In fact there were none related to Windows 10, and so I&nbsp;completed the download, installation and configuration for
 all 28 updates, which took about 45 minutes, and then did a re-start.&nbsp; I then checked&nbsp;my update history to verify&nbsp;they were all installed with no Windows 10 upgrade files, so I'm happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm not breaking the rules of this forum, the chap at iYogi was very helpful and so I would like to give them a plug.&nbsp; Their phone number from Canada is 1-877-317-5893, and their URL is

<h2>            Compte Xbox Live &#58; du PC vers la Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>bon voila maintenant 6 mois que je suis inscrit sur le Xbox Live car j'y joue via le PC. Je suis donc un membre gratuit. Cependant , j'envisage d'acheter une Xbox 360 et de passer à l'abonnement gold.<br />
<br />
Ma question est donc de savoir , si je peux garder le même compte et si je pourrais jouer via les 2 plateformes et que celles-ci me comptabilisent des succès ?<br />
<br />
Merci</p>
<p>Bon dimanche</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS : je ne sais pas si je suis dans la bonne section. Si ce n'est pas le cas merci de me dire dans laquelle je dois poster.</p>

<p>Bienvenue, alors étant un utilisateur des 2 plateformes, je te confirme que tous tes succès obtenus sur PC seront bien comptabilisés sur ta console, et inversement, les tags de tes jeux, et tes amis également. Tu pourras bien entendu continuer de jongler
 entre les 2 sans problème, et continuer de jouer aussi bien sur PC que sur Xbox 360 sans distinction avec ton abonnement Gold, groupes de discussion, invitations en partie, statut de joueur, tout est full compatible !</p>

<p>-</p>
<p>be sure to try a different browser (Firefox, IE) as well when applying.</p>
<p>If it still isn't working the best thing to do is to contact one of the Official forum support people (Mister and Misses) in the forums via PM (for exmaple go to this link and use the small envelope at the bottom to send a PM to Miss Ermine <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/12/t/442533.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../442533.aspx</a>)</p>
