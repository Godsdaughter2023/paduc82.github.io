<h2>            Disk Defragment and Task Scheduler</h2>
                    <p>It is probably the computer for being terrible, but I am trying to defrag because my comp is running slow on Windows 8. &nbsp;I go to the right side of the screen to settings, control panel, system and security, admin tools,then defrag and optimize your drives.
 &nbsp;The prompt says "storage optimization cannot start because the task scheduler service is not running. &nbsp;Start the task scheduler service and try again". &nbsp;So then I go into administrative tools, and click on "schedule tasks". &nbsp;it says "the remote computer was
 not found". &nbsp;I am on my local computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it actually pulls up, I have no tasks running. I go into "action", and only have the following options (all others are grayed out): &nbsp;connect to another computer, AT service account configuration, refresh, and help. &nbsp;None of these help me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont see any tasks running and I still cannot run a defrag. &nbsp;Can someone please help me? &nbsp;This is frustrating, it's like having kids and they both said the other did something; you never actually get an answer. &nbsp;That's how I feel right now. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two things to try...<br />
<br />
<strong>Check services are running/set to automatic<br />
</strong>1) Press the Windows key and R to open a run box</p>
<p>2) Type in services.msc and press enter.</p>
<p>3) Scroll down to 'Task Scheduler' and ensure it is 'Started' and set to start automatically -Right Click and choose Properties to change this if it is not set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try running defrag again and seeing what happens. If this doesn't work - or you find it keeps stopping</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Run System File Checker<br />
</strong>1)Search for cmd on the Start menu.</p>
<p>2) Right click the Command Prompt box and choose "Run as Administrator" at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>3) In the cmd window type in sfc /scannow</p>
<p><br />
This runs the system file checker which checks for any issues with Windows system files. This can take awhile to run.</p>

<p>there are no Windows XP drivers available for your laptop so you probbably will not be able to install Windows XP on it.</p>
<p>Windows 7 comes with compatibility mode that may allow some, but not all,&nbsp;older software to work. Please see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>If you have Windows 7 Professional, Ultimate or Enterprise edition then you may be able use XP Mode to enable you to run your XP software in a virtual environment. Please see:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-xp-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/products/features/windows-xp-mode</a>&nbsp; .</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Windows XP support officially ends in 2014. Rather than trying to return to Windows XP you may want to look for solutions that are more forward looking.</p>

            <p>Before you consider replacing Windows 7 with Windows XP. Have you tried familiarizing yourself with the OS first?</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/for-the-former-windows-xp-user-welcome-to-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2009/08/19/for-the-former-windows-xp-user-welcome-to-windows-7/</a></p>
<p>If you want to run Windows XP, you might want to consider dual booting Windows 7 and Windows XP. You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP.</p>
<p>The first option I would recommend, if you really need to run Windows XP is to use Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode, you will need to upgrade to Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate in order to gain access to Windows XP Mode.
</p>
<p>Windows 7 - Anytime Upgrade - Frequently Asked Questions:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-Anytime-Upgrade-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Windows-Anytime-Upgrade-frequently-asked-questions</u></a></p>
<p>Windows 7 - Anytime Upgrade features:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-anytime-upgrade" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/features/windows-anytime-upgrade</u></a></p>
<p>-----------</p>
<p>or, if you have a full retail version of Windows XP Professional or XP Home, you can download the free Windows Virtual PC and use your own license;</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/how-to-use-virtualization-softwarewindows-virtual-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://techingiteasy.wordpress.com/2012/05/02/how-to-use-virtualization-softwarewindows-virtual-pc/</u></a></p>
<p>The other option, if you already have a Windows XP license, is to dual boot with Windows 7:</p>
<p>The following instructions will show how to dual boot Windows 7 and XP on your machine instead of replacing one with the other.
</p>
<p>It is important you have a reinstallation or repair disc in case you need to reinstall or repair your WIndows 7 installation.
</p>
<p>The following article will show you how to create a repair disc:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/02/09/how-to-create-a-system-repair-disc-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://notebooks.com/2011/02/09/how-to-create-a-system-repair-disc-in-windows-7/</u></a></p>
<p>Drivers for Windows XP:</p>
<p>You should first find out if your computer is compatible with Windows XP. A lot more modern computers are phasing out support for Windows XP.</p>
<p>Create Partition</p>
<p>In order to do that, use Easeus Partition Master Home Edition - <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Manager-Home-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<u>http://download.cnet.com/Easeus-Partition-Manager-Home-Edition/3000-2248_4-10863346.html</u></a></p>
<p>Proceed to install Easeus:</p>
<p>Click Next, follow the easy on screen instructions.</p>
<p>When the installation is complete, click Finish</p>
<p>Click Go to main screen</p>
<p>Select the drive you want to resize in the partition window</p>
<p>Drag the knob until you have a desired amount of disk space to install Windows XP, then release it.
</p>
<p>Click apply to apply the changes you just made. </p>
<p>Click Yes</p>
<p>Click Yes</p>
<p>Your computer will restart a few times and changes will be made to the partition layout, this process is hands free, so no interaction is required.
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Install Windows XP</p>
<p>In order to install Windows XP on the partition you created, you will need to boot into your BIOS and set the hard disk mode to IDE.
</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have set the hard disk IDE mode, you can proceed to install Windows XP on the partition you created;</p>
<p>Insert your Windows XP CD, then restart your computer.</p>
<p>When prompted to boot from the CD, do so. This requires pressing any key on your keyboard.</p>
<p>Windows XP will go through its setup process. </p>
<p>Once you arrive at the Welcome Setup, press Enter on your keyboard to begin the setup process</p>
<p>Press F8 on your keyboard to accept the license agreement</p>
<p>Select the partition </p>
<p>Select Format the partition using the NTFS file system</p>
<p>Press F on your keyboard to begin the formatting.</p>
<p>Installation files will now be copied to your hard disk</p>
<p>Your system will be restarted, Windows XP setup will continue</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After Windows XP installs successfully, you will not be able to boot into Windows 7. This is where the recovery disc for Windows 7 comes in.</p>
<p>1. Put the Windows 7 Recovery disc installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.</p>
<p>2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.</p>
<p>3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.</p>
<p>4. Click Repair your computer.</p>
<p>5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.</p>
<p>6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt.</p>
<p>7. Type sfc /scannow, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>--------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After you have repaired your Windows 7 installation and try to boot it, you will notice that Windows 7 does not boot.
</p>
<p>Boot into the BIOS again and set the hard disk mode to SATA. You will now be able to boot into Windows 7 again.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------</p>
<p>After doing that, download EasyBCD and add a boot entry for Windows XP to the Windows 7 boot manager;</p>
<p>EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windowsboot manager.
<a href="http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://neosmart.net/dl.php?id=1</u></a></p>
<p>------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The next step now is make it possible for Windows 7 to boot in IDE mode. </p>
<p>Here are the instructions for doing that:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><u>http://www.vistax64.com/general-discussion/271218-switch-ahci-ide-tutorial-howto.html</u></a></p>
<p>Welcome all , so let me explain I installed Windows 7 With AHCI set from Bios , but after that i wanted to use ide (becose it boots faster) and when i set Ide from Bios , the windows 7 loading screan camed upp and BSOD (Blue screen of death) with an error
 code 0x0000005B , i tryed the regedit trick by setting in the "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESystemCurrentControlSetServicesMsahci" and then in the right pan the START value from 0 i set it to 1 and it supposed to be working but it was a failiure , it still did the Bsod
 and i was so pissed of , i wanted to make it work ... AND I DID IT !<br />
<br />
Here are the pases :<br />
1) I assume u have installed Windows Vista or Windows 7 with AHCI set from BIOS !<br />
2) Download my registry fix (to add the ide keys to regeditor) simply apply the key
<br />
3) Now the manually regedit part Go to : <br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_Msahci <br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStor<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_iaStorV<br />
<br />
And in thease three keys in the right pan u will find a key named "START" change at all three (Msahci,iaStor,iaStorV) values from 0 To 1
<br />
Now navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE_System_CurrentControlSet_Services_PciIde<br />
,then change the start value to "0" <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
4) Now u are allmost done , restart your computer/laptop , and go to Bios and set from AHCI to IDE !!! , save settings in Bios and restart<br />
<br />
5)Windows will be loading , and VOILA !!! NO BSOD !!! , windows Vista/Seven will install new Ide drivers and u will see in windows device manager that you dont have AHCI drivers anymore , u have Ide drivers !<br />
6)It will prompt for another restart , just restart it and u will be happy </p>

<h2>            Password change in Windows Live Mail.</h2>
                    I am trying to change my password in&nbsp;Windows Live Mail without success, I have gone into properties then servers and changed my password, then hit send/receive, a login box appears where I put in my new password, this is when&nbsp;Windows Live Mail doesn't
 accept my new password. If I change everything back to my old password it works again. Do I need to go somewhere else as well as where I have been to change my password?

</p><blockquote>Windows Live Mail doesn't accept my new password. &nbsp;</blockquote>
<p>Windows Live Mail doesn't accept or reject your password: it passes it to the server concerned. If the server is happy, the program will go ahead with what it was trying to do - receive or send messages, for example. If the server isn't happy with the password,
 it will tell Windows Live Mail so, and the program will then ask you to enter it again so it can try submitting it a second time, and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To <em>change</em> the password for any account, you have to visit the account's website and find the 'change password' option there. For example, if the email account concerned belongs to a Microsoft Account (i.e. the address is e.g. @hotmail.*, @outlook.*,
 @live.* or @msn.com), you change its password here: <a href="https://account.live.com/password/change" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://account.live.com/password/change</a>. For a Gmail account, here: <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/intro/signinoptions/password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://myaccount.google.com/intro/signinoptions/password</a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you've done that, you then change it in Windows Live Mail.

<p>no this is my first surface, which is the surface pro 2017(great naming scheme by microsoft- this is a sarcasm by the way).</p>
<p>the problem i am having is that when i plug in one of the following situations happens</p>
<p>1. the battery indicator(from the icon on the taskbar) shows plugged in charging and the percent slowly increases, but stops after a period for example if it was 35% when i plugged it , it will go to 56 and then stop. it will still show plugged in, charging
 but the percentage stay the same for the next hour or so.</p>
<p>2. it will show an icon of plugged in and charging(means the battery indicators starts moving) but it will stay at the same percentage. Sometimes i switch off and it still stays at the same percentage even after plugged in for next four hour or even overnight.</p>
<p>3. it will show an icon of plugged in but it will say not charging although the percentage is probably 12% or maybe 27%, and after i unplug it, the amount of time it takes to discharge also varies, sometime it will discharge very soon , sometimes it'll take
 really long to discharge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also i dont think that my connector is dirty - as i have cleaned it</p>
<p>i dont think my charger is faulty as i have run my laptop now for a week, although it has spontaneously stopped</p>
<p>
</p><p>regarding your question whether it is second surface- no it is new surface pro for 2017(pixelsense)</p>
<p>no it is my first surface that i have bought</p>
<p>i live in birmingham united kingdom(england)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have bought it from curryspcworld - should i return this or should I contact microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. When i said saw this problem with previous surface I meant going through the forum before asking a question and try to go through its solutions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Zamknięty NAT i Problem z MTU - XBOX ONE</h2>
                    
<p>Witam,</p>
<p><br />
Po ostatniej aktualizacji na konsoli Xbox One wystąpił u mnie problem z MTU (poziom 510) oraz notorycznie zamknięty NAT. Jeżeli znacie rozwiązanie tych problemów proszę o info.
</p>
<p>PS: jeżeli chodzi o NAT to robiłem już praktycznie wszystko tzn. Upnp otwarty / zamkniety, DMZ wł/wył, Porty wł i wył, Wyłączanie konsoli poprzez przytrzymanie przycisku przez 10s i reset routera i nic z tego NAT zamknięty.</p>

<h2>            Unable to access Start menu, Search bar, notification buttons on Task bar after install the Update KB3139907 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Ever since update KB3139907 was installed I am unable to use my left click my start button, the search option on the taskbar, and the new notifications button. I have tried uninstalling it from windows updates menu in the programs and features, from windows
 safe mode windows updates menu in programs and features, by using a batch file that loads at start up, using a restore point and by cmd line. In uninstall updates it doesn't give the option to uninstall (in safe mode too), no response from batch file there
 is no restore point offered except for one from about 3 months ago and cmd line (as administrator) says that KB3139907 is important for running windows and will not uninstall it. If it is so important to running windows why am I not able to actually use these
 functions after this windows update installed it. What are my options? And don't tell me to do a fresh install that is simply unacceptable.</p>

            Ok ran the three apps suggested in command prompt admin. The first pass sfc / scannow found and repaired one corrupted file. Rebooted and tried start button and still no go. Ran the apps again in command prompt admin this time cleanup image / restorehealth
 found and repaired a corrupted file. Rebooted, still a no go on the start button, the search box and notifications button now work though. Ran apps again in command prompt admin and got no errors. Rebooted and still cannot use start button (with mouse or keyboard).
 With no errors showing what is my next option.<br />

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When you are running the PowerShell command, I recommend you to close all the apps on your system and try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists,</p>

            Ran above code in powershell admin, it didn't say it had done anything. Ran it 3 times typed and copy pasted, rebooting each time with the same results no start button working. I was able to create another admin account and the start button worked on that
 account. So I tried changing account type of original and tried start button, no go, changed it back to admin account and still no go on start button. They make doing this option sound so blasse "oh just move your files to new account" That doesn't even take
 into account all the settings for the different programs and some of them like to store their files somewhere other than my documents. This is a nightmare, if you are going to ask people to make updates automatic as default, try not to screw up their machines.
 This is 3 days lost fighting this and if I am to use the other account I am looking at probably another couple of days to set things up the way they were and transfer files. My machine was running great until the update messed it up.<br />

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding and apologize for the delay in response to your issue.</p>
<p>
I suggest you to perform a system restore to the earlier point of this issue and check if the issue persists. When you perform a System Restore the time and date would be changed on your computer.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>System Restore:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted
 while system restoring. </span></p>
<p><span>During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead
 to loss of important files as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to refer to the Microsoft article to perform System Restore:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Recovery options in Windows&nbsp;10</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>Section: <strong><span>Restore from a system restore&nbsp;point.</span></strong></span></p>

            <p>The Mail/People app in Windows 8 is bare-basic functionality designed for phones and tablets, and doesn't include that functionality.&nbsp; You can certainly ask for it (go to Settings and click Feedback to let the product team know you want it).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>For the most functions and features, use a full program rather than the tablet app.&nbsp; Microsoft Office Outlook for example.&nbsp; Or if you don't want Office,&nbsp; Microsoft provides a free full-featured mail program as part of the Windows Essentials package, and
 also includes group lists.&nbsp; It syncs with your email just the same as the Mail/People app, so you don't even have to use it day-to-day, just when you want to edit or create these groups.&nbsp; Give it a try at

            I have been getting errors on xbox daily challenges most recently on Mahjong.  It times out while trying to reward the challenge and then says I am not connected to the internet, which I am.  Then I get no reward.  This lack of reward has happened in the past with solitaire,, etc  On the calendar it says I have not completed the challenge but when I go to replay, it says I have already completed.  What's up with this?   Microsoft needs to get off their duff just like they've always done which puts Apple in the " I like you best"catagory and fix one of the draw features to windows 8. I dropped Microsoft Pardner after 14 years and I;m letting my MSCE certs run out. I don't even have it on my resume` anymore. I'm fed up with the "we're the best "attitude and do nothing except "build a service pack" within 1 month of a new OS, build **** like NT 4.0 (couldn't get drivers), Windows 98 1st Edition (UGH), or Windows ME (Try to find those words on the website).

            <p>I got no satisfaction from the Xbox forum.&nbsp; They are talking about their games and not the Microsoft Arkadia.&nbsp; Yesterday and today I bet I spent 20 mins just trying to convince Microsoft that I really was connected and did finally get to play the games I
 enjoy.&nbsp; Soon I will give them up if this continues.&nbsp; Just NOT worth it,</p>

            I posted for just what you said. I've programmed, networked and everything else for Microsoft for 23 years. I was typing 500-7500 lines of code in Y2K (Remember?) 28 hour days, 4 hours sleep and right back at it with a stress heart attack in October 1999
 just over Foxfire DB., however it did need to go...I DO agree with Microsoft with that one but they are falling down a cliff of no return unless another Gates clone comes in and gets them off their duff and this "do no wrong" attitude! You know it! Everything
 MS has put out has actually been a BETA product! Way too many fixes. Windows 8 seems like it's working better and the architecture IS better but look at your installed fixes and you'll see they are just hiding way too many fixes that is a result of an IT Director
 hovering over your programmers shouting, "is it done yesterday?" I was an IT Director for almost 2 decades before I recently&nbsp;moved away into Security and Design. (Thank God...5 heart attacks is enough) Less pressure because y

<p>Please help me someone!&nbsp; I have been trying to install my Samsung SCX-1150F printer with Windows 7 and nothing is working.&nbsp; I have tried the Vista drivers, the XP drivers in compatibility mode and even looked on the MS site to see if it is compatible.&nbsp; According
 to MS the SCX-1150 is, but there is no mention of the SCX-1150F.&nbsp; I have come to a point where I don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp; Could anyone be of assistance?</p>

<h2>            Skype Connect Call Length of time</h2>
                    <p>I have a Skype business Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to call my Skype landline number from my mobile and it takes at least 11 rings before it appears on my Skype desktop as an incoming call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like a very long time for a call to connect to my desktop considering in the past it has connected instantly.</p>
<br />
<p>I've checked my settings to see if there are any options there but nothing that seems to address this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10.</p>
<p>
Decent/fast broadband connection with no issues on other applications.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you found a solution to this issue ?</p>
<p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>Each time, it rings almost 10 times before the call appears on my Skype desktop.</p>

<p>I tested this from 2 mobiles:</p>
<p>
</p><p>One on the Three (UK) network and one on o2 (Telefonica UK) network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three (UK) took 4 dial-tones to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>o2 took 3 dial-tones to connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the matter seems to have resolved on my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tested it from a landline number though.</p>

<p><strong>Running: WinXP SP3</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have been getting random reboots for a while now (several months) and have been unsuccessful in trying to fix it. It has been getting progressively worse until this week. Here's what I've done in that time and the results:</strong></p>
<p>1. Uninstalled my AV at the time (McAfee) and replaced it with a different one (AVG). (McAfee was sucking and managed to let in a virus my first day of owning my brand-new machine. I got that sorted out.) This seemed to help a little bit for a short while,
 but I think that was a fluke.</p>
<p><strong><span>2. Run multiple virus and spyware scans (AVG and Spybot S&amp;D). I am clean. I have continued scanning on a regular basis. I do update frequently as well.</span></strong></p>
<p>3. Checked my BIOS to make sure I was not overclocked.</p>
<p>This week:</p>
<p>4. Tracked down one particular error message I'd received and read that it was a ZoneAlarm error. I subsequently removed it from my system and I have gone from increasingly frequent reboots (reaching a peak of almost once every 45 minutes or so) to rebooting
 an average of once per 24 hours. This is an IMMENSE &nbsp;improvement, but obviously still not ideal, particularly as I work from this machine.</p>
<p>5. Adjusted my virtual memory (initial) from its previous setting to the recommended setting. I powered off, powered on, and it seemed to boot fine -- but I had an error as though I'd rebooted randomly, as well as an error message. It did not reboot during

<p><strong>Actions recommended but not yet taken:</strong></p>
<p>1. RAM test. I have downloaded the .iso but have not tracked down my CD-Rs. All of my belongings are packed from a recent move.</p>
<p>2. Booting from CD to see if it's a hardware or software problem. Again, my belongings are packed and I have not tracked my CD-Rs so I cannot burn Ubuntu to disk yet.</p>

 it's a new power supply, so those shouldn't be the cause. The guy who built my machine said he experienced no reboots. I am not sure if the reboots could be the result of a sudden hardware failure, as it seems unlikely, or possibly the virus picked up before
 these problems began. My system is clean and I received professional assistance in removal so it *shouldn't* have had anything to do with it, but I'm including the information just in case because ... let's face it ... I am stumped at this point. Just way
 out of my league.</p>
<p>It does not seem related to any programs I am running. It does seem to reboot more if I am playing games (Flash and Shockwave are mostly what I'm playing because ... my belongings are still packed so I haven't installed my games on this computer.) It will
 sometimes reboot DURING a reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have any questions for me, ask away. I am desperate to get this thing in full working order.</p>

<div>&gt; Running: WinXP SP3</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; I have been getting random reboots for a while now (several months) and </div>
<div>&gt; have been unsuccessful in trying to fix it. It has been getting </div>
<div>&gt; progressively worse until this week. Here's what I've done in that time </div>
<div>&gt; and the results:</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 1. Uninstalled my AV at the time (McAfee) and replaced it with a different
<div>&gt; one (AVG). (McAfee was sucking and managed to let in a virus my first day </div>
<div>&gt; of owning my brand-new machine. I got that sorted out.) This seemed to </div>
<div>&gt; help a little bit for a short while, but I think that was a fluke.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 2. Run multiple virus and spyware scans (AVG and Spybot S&amp;D). I am clean. </div>
<div>&gt; I have continued scanning on a regular basis. I do update frequently as </div>
<div>&gt; well.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 3. Checked my BIOS to make sure I was not overclocked.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; This week:</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 4. Tracked down one particular error message I'd received and read that it
<div>&gt; was a ZoneAlarm error. I subsequently removed it from my system and I have
<div>&gt; gone from increasingly frequent reboots (reaching a peak of almost once </div>
<div>&gt; every 45 minutes or so) to rebooting an average of once per 24 hours. This
<div>&gt; is an IMMENSE improvement, but obviously still not ideal, particularly as </div>
<div>&gt; I work from this machine.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 5. Adjusted my virtual memory (initial) from its previous setting to the </div>
<div>&gt; recommended setting. I powered off, powered on, and it seemed to boot </div>
<div>&gt; fine -- but I had an error as though I'd rebooted randomly, as well as an </div>
<div>&gt; error message. It did not reboot during startup.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; Actions recommended but not yet taken:</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 1. RAM test. I have downloaded the .iso but have not tracked down my </div>
<div>&gt; CD-Rs. All of my belongings are packed from a recent move.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 2. Booting from CD to see if it's a hardware or software problem. Again, </div>
<div>&gt; my belongings are packed and I have not tracked my CD-Rs so I cannot burn </div>
<div>&gt; Ubuntu to disk yet.</div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt; 3. Adjusted the memory dump from a minidump to a full dump (this seemed </div>
<div>&gt; questionable?)</div>

<div>Have you run the specialist cleaner tools to remove the last traces of </div>
<div>McAfee and ZA? </div>
<div>http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507</div>
<div>http://download.zonealarm.com/bin/free/support/cpes_clean.exe</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There's often rubbish left behind by major apps such as these.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I'd set your VM to be between 1000MB and 2500MB - or fix it at 1500MB. (you </div>
<div>didn't say how much physical RAM you have). Since you say you have a Ubuntu </div>
<div>disk - it may be worth booting to that, and deleting the pagefile.sys to </div>
<div>force a rebuild of the page file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Random Reboots are a b***r to isolate and fix, unless there's an entry in </div>
<div>Event Viewer - you didn't mention anything. Is this because there's north </div>
<div>there, or have you not looked?</div>

<p>Can you please<span>&nbsp;upload
 the contents of c:\windows\minidump to your&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>&nbsp;and

<p>For dealing with Blue Screens,&nbsp;general guidance follows (you may already have seen some of it):</p>
<p>Consider running chkdsk on all partitions. &nbsp;Let chkdsk complete on each partition and see if that helps.</p>
<p>Also consider running SFC /SCANNOW.</p>
<p>Other common suggestions include ensuring drivers are up to date (including video drivers), as well as ensuring that you're &nbsp;using the latest BIOS.</p>
<p>Consider testing memory with Windows Memory Diagnostic or memtest86.&nbsp;<em>Note
 that memory that passes tests is not necessarily &nbsp;good memory - it just hasn't failed a test.</em>&nbsp;&nbsp;Consider systematically eliminating RAM from the system - run with a couple of &nbsp;modules for a while, and see how things go. Then try the other modules.</p>
<p>If you boot into safe mode, do you still experience bugchecks? What about if you do a&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316434" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean
 boot</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprohardware/thread/6115cb34-2890-46b5-8c1e-c934c56ecfe4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">device
 clean boot</a>?</p>
<p>It can be helpful to use Driver Verifier. &nbsp;To enable Driver Verifier... start-&gt;verifier.exe-&gt;OK-&gt;Create standard settings- &gt;Next-&gt;select driver names from a list-&gt;Next-&gt;sort by Provider-&gt;select all non-Microsoft drivers-&gt;Finish, and OK your way
 out &nbsp;of the dialog.</p>
<p>Then, reboot and use the system as you normally would, and wait for a problem. &nbsp;In the event that the system does not boot &nbsp;completely after enabling driver verifier, boot into Safe Mode and run driver verifier, and tell it to delete the changes.</p>
<p>Wait for a bugcheck to occur after enabling verifier as described, and then upload it to your&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SkyDrive</a>,

<p>No.Compromise -</p>
<p>c:\windows\minidump is full of a TON of files. If I need to upload all of them, it will have to wait until tonight as I have ridiculously strict data transfer limits (I'm on satellite internet due to living in a rural area -- we don't even have a phone.)
 If I reboot before then I will upload the newest dump file and link you.</p>
<p>Ran chkdsk in read-only mode and when it was done there were no results and I was unable to find any correlating event viewer events for it. Is there a file saved somewhere?</p>
<p>Do not have a SP3 disk onhand. Will need to borrow one if I want to run SFC /SCANNOW</p>
<p>I read that I need to have a boot disk if I want to use Driver Verifier -- true? False?</p>
<p>With regards to whether I get bugchecks in safe mode, I have not checked yet. I am not constantly rebooting anymore after the removal of ZA so it could take a full day of just waiting around in Safe Mode and I just plain don't have the time to do that at
 this point. I work online. I will try testing that tomorrow if all else fails -- I can leave it running in Safe Mode while we go do the Mother's Day thing. It can and does reboot when absolutely nothing is going on so it should be a reasonably effective test.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inexperience on my end. This is a level of technicality I'm just not used to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I seem to be running a 32-bit Windows on a 64-bit processor. Could that be a problem? AMD's website says to make sure all drivers installed on a 64-bit processor machine are 64-bit.</p>

<p>You can ZIP the minidump folder so the files are compressed, and you have less work to do, at your convenience of course.</p>
<p>No boot disk is needed for verifier. &nbsp;It would be goot to test that you can successfully boot into safe mode before enabling verifier, but if you can't it would seem that there may be larger problems with the system...&nbsp;</p>
<p>There should be no problem running a 32-bit (x86) version of windows on a 64-bit processor. &nbsp;On a 64-bit OS, all kernel mode drivers are required to be 64-bit - that is likely what the website was making reference to.</p>
<p>Chkdsk (when run with /f or /r) records interesting details to the Application event log with a source of winlogon, event id 1001.</p>

<p>Went all that time without another reboot, too. So close, but another one happened this evening. Haven't yet had a chance to test in safe mode.</p>

<p>Have you turned verifier on? The dumps indicate memory corruption is occurring and verifier can help with that - it can cause a bugcheck when the corruption takes place (catching the corruptor) rather than when the corruption is detected (at which point
 the corruptor may be long gone).</p>
<p>You have the problems with McAfee as well as AVG? It would be interesting to note the behavior with yet a different AV / security product installed in place of AVG - e.g. Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>Checking in safe mode and with a clean boot would be good to do as well - may help determine if the behavior is related to faulty hardware, or software...</p>

<h3> patrick58032  say:</h3>
<h2>            A hacker changed my administrative account password</h2>
                    <p>i have had a trojan on my computer which makes MS Security Essentials appear to be
</p>
<p>protecting me but real time protection is turned off. Any other AV real time protection is</p>
<p>&nbsp;continually turned off 3-5 seconds after I turn it on. None of my AV scans are finding the trojan.
</p>
<p>daily, they are disabling toolbars and hacking into all my on line accounts, my bank account etc</p>
<p>My e mail accounts and constantly making changes on my computer only some of which I can visible see.
</p>
<p>I bought a router and have been waiting to reinstall my OS, to clear the trojan befor hooking up the router for use as a
</p>
<p>type fire wall to hide my MAC address. In the meantime, they changed my administrative account password.
</p>
<p>Now I am totally screwed without any control over my computer. i had been doing sytem restore to temporaily clear some
</p>
<p>of the trojans additional malware which is continually being added/. But afterwards had to reinstall a lot of my software</p>
<p>such as my printer etc, So now I cant do anything or install printer software to use my printer etc as I have no administrative access.
</p>
<p>neither can I reinstall my OS or do sys restore anymore either. </p>

            <p>A decent password is 15+ characters long using at least three of the following four things: uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.&nbsp; Since you should not be repeating passwords, you will probably need some sort of application to help you keep up with
 all the passwords you will be using - that way you remember one and can get to the rest.&nbsp; I like
<a href="http://keepass.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KeePass</a>.&nbsp; It allows you to store additional information about the account, the link to the web page is clickable, etc.</p>
<p>Backup whatever is important to you (include product keys for software, contact lists, documents, music, pictures, etc.)&nbsp; I would not backup *any* executables that you can download or have safely stored away elsewhere.&nbsp; I would make a list of hardware you
 have installed on your system so you can later download the proper hardware device drivers for them.</p>
<p>Disconnect the computer from the Internet, zero-write the hard drive and install everything cleanly - making sure you have the firewall on and a decent AntiVirus installed before connecting it back to the Internet.&nbsp; You *will* need external restoration/recovery/installation
 media for this for everything you want to keep on your system and you will need the product keys/serial numbers for everything you purchased.&nbsp; If you do not have this for the stuff that came with your computer - you need to contact the computer manufacturer
 and figure out how to obtain that.</p>
<p>Any passwords set on the computer itself should be at least 15 characters long and different than any other password you use.&nbsp; This is for every account.&nbsp; I suggest having at least two administrative level accounts on the machine, neither that get used daily.&nbsp;
 The built-in acount can be one with you creating another for you to use for installations and such.&nbsp; Your account should be a user-level only account.</p>
<p>Disconnect your home router from the Internet and reset it to factory defaults.&nbsp; Leave it (and everything) disconnected from your high-speed Internet at least 24 hours.&nbsp; Configure it so its administrative password is 15+ characters and different than any
 other password you use.&nbsp; Configure it so any wireless password is also 15+ characters long and different than any other password you use.</p>
<p>Connect to and change *every* online accounts password you utilize.&nbsp; All banking, credit cards, facebook, email, etc and so on accounts.&nbsp; Whenever possible, use&nbsp;a password&nbsp;that is 15+ characters long and different than any other password you use.&nbsp; That will
 not always be possible, do the best you can following this rule as a secondary to the original I gave - 8+ characters including 3 of the following four: uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols.&nbsp; Even that, unfortunately, will not be possible everywhere.</p>
<p>The longer you utilzie the corrupt system, the worse off.&nbsp; Partial cleaning for temporary purposes is likely hurting more than helping.&nbsp; You may think you cannot do all of this now - but the longer you put it off, the more damage could be done.</p>
<p>You may also want to keep close tabs on all of your credit card accounts, bank accounts and credit reporting agencies reports on you.</p>

<br />
On this point I disagree with Shenan Stanley. IMHO it is sufficient to perform a Factory Restore. I doubt very much that you have a motherboard issue. I have installed Windows 7 off a purchased DVD on several Acer machines, both laptops and desktops, and had
 no problem whatsoever (other than finding the drivers which can be a bit of a chore). They behaved like any other brand machine.<br />
<br />
My recommendation goes like this:<br />
<ol>
<li>Back up your data including your EMail files.</li><li>Perform a Factory Restore.</li><li>Install a good virus scanner, e.g. Microsoft Security Essentials. It is free.</li><li>Scan your backed up data for viruses.</li><li>Restore your backed up data.<br />

    <title>motherboard memory parity errors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> don_615  say:</h3>
<h2>            motherboard memory parity errors</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 2gb duo core laptop with Windows Vista. The computer will boot up in safe mode with no errors. Booting up in normal mode always gives a "memory parity error, contact hardware vendor for support, system halted" blue screen message.
 There is no memory address provided to determine if the memory parity is on the motherboard or the memory cards. I tested using only 1 gb memory card and both cards failed. Using new memory cards results in the same error message. Therefore, I&nbsp;conclude the
 failing memory is on the motherboard.</p>
<p>The warranty has obviously expired.</p>
<p>In the past, I have&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;the&nbsp;defective memory to a ram disk, and told the owner to not use the ramdisk. This technique&nbsp;WORKED under versions of Windows prior to Vista. I can not fine any reference to ramdisks under vista (at least definable during startup).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any known technique to define and bypass a defective block of memory on the motherboard? It seems that Windows operating systems should be able to bypass the bad memory; that is, detect the memory parity fault, determine a range of memory to declare
 unusable, and continue with the normal boot process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is&nbsp;EXPENSIVE to replace a motherboard just because of a parity error.&nbsp; I am assuming that the memory on the motherboard is NON-REPLACEABLE. If the memory parity error is on a replaceable card,&nbsp;then&nbsp;replacing the memory card is an acceptable expense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions other than buying a new computer or replacing the motherboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    I use an HP laptop to develop meter reading software and use an FTDI Chip USB to RS485 device that is mapped to a COM port (COM1, COM2, etc). It worked perfectly before upgrading to Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Device manager recognizes the port and says

</p><p>I think yes, it will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win10 on a Thinkpad T60, an old core 2 laptop. Win10 seems to run fine, and I installed FP2000 to see if it could edit, save, etc. a web page created in FP2000.</p>

            I have Office 2000 and successfully loaded it on my new Win 10 computer (i.e., it came with Win 10, and it recently upgraded to the Win 10 Anniversary edition). The only issue I have is that&nbsp;when I&nbsp;right-click a .htm or .html file and try to open it with
 Frontpage 2000 (which comes up as "Microsoft Frontpage Server Administrator" for some bizarre reason), it complains that two DLL files are missing: fp30utl.dll and fp30wel.dll. I found those files on the web (safe sites and scanned for viruses)&nbsp;and loaded
 them into my Win 10 system, but, nothing worked (FWIW, I'm a computer programmer with 30+years experience including handyman work&nbsp;with computer repair). However, it works standalone: I put it in the Win 10 "Start" box (after unpinning all the junk that MS
 threw on it!), then clicked it, then selected the desired HTML file. I've had no problems using it like this.

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p><span>You want to know more about Aero glass feature in Windows 8. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Aero Peek featured is disabled by default in Windows 8. This is because, in Windows 8, moving the mouse cursor to the upper or lower-right corner of the screen brings up the charms bar, the bar that allows you quickly open Start, share, search and
 other settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here is how to enable Aero Peek feature in Windows 8:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Switch to <b>desktop</b>, <b>right-click on the taskbar</b> and then click
<b>Properties</b> to open <b>Taskbar Properties</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Under <b>Taskbar tab</b>, tick <b>Use Peek</b> to preview the desktop when you move your mouse to the
<b>Show Desktop button</b> at the end of the taskbar checkbox to enable the feature.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Click Apply button. You are done!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note that the Show Desktop button may not appear on the right of the taskbar even after enabling the feature but the feature will work. Just move the mouse cursor to the extreme right of the taskbar to peek the desktop. Also note that the Aero Peek
 keyboard shortcut (Windows + Spacebar) doesn’t work in Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps.</span></p>

            No Aero Glass is an absolute deal breaker for me.&nbsp; There is no way I'm installing those ugly flat windows on my desktop.&nbsp; The transparency that is there which lacks blurring is an ugly joke.&nbsp; On a scale from one to ten of how upset I am over this... I'm
 like 1000000000 seriously considering buying a Mac out of pure out-of-my-mind crazy spite.&nbsp; I cannot even express in words how upset I am over this.&nbsp; There is absolutely zero chance that I will ever install Windows 8 or Blue or any another Windows operating
 system onto my computer until Aero Glass is returned or something more beautiful is included.<br />

            <p>It was a cool feature which took up too much resource, and was not available to all machines.</p>
<p>The Windows 8 flat look is a new start and only requires that a minimum resolution of 1366 x 768 is set. Apart form early netbooks, and older machines generally which should NOT be upgraded to Windows 8 anyway, the new look works for a much wider user base..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that it is a little ugly, but you have to trade something for the more sprightly performance which Windows 8 offers..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that buying a Mac is a little over the top, but if that's what you want .................. :-)</p>

<div>How did you switch the subject from Aero glass to Aero peek? Clearly the man is talking about aero glass, not aero peek. You acknowledged "Aero Glass" but you purposely changed the subject to "Aero Peek" which has nothing to do with anything!!!!&nbsp;</div>

            Rather short-sighted move in my opinion, but unfortunately seems to be the trend at Microsoft these days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Admittedly it's a resource saver to remove Aero Glass, but why not make that an option rather than spoil it for desktop users who really shouldn't
 have to worry about resources anyway?<br />
<br />
The matter is really rubbed in when that tantalizing semi-transparent task bar is still there on the desktop.<br />
<br />
The same with the Start Menu and Button, they should also be an option.<br />
<br />
How about an "Enhancement Pack" ??<br />

            Hi! I'm sorry, that you can't use Aero in Windows 8! Well, no can use Aero in Windows 8. Personally, I'm upset that Microsoft removed this Windows Features. They might have removed it, because of battery life (I heard), and I think that they wanted to
 take away the attention to the Desktop, so Metro has all the attention. Which, I don't really like Metro, I like Windows 7 better!!!
