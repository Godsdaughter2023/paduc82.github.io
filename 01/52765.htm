<h2>            Why does Malwarebytes Premium keep getting removed from my system tray every time I have a Windows update, even though it&#39;s still checked in taskbar settings&#63;  How can I stop this from happening&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I have a Windows Update lately (since I had a complete system upgrade in December), it removes the icon for my Malwarebytes Premium program.&nbsp; The program is still checked in my taskbar settings, but I can't get it to show up in my system tray
 area with my other start-up programs.&nbsp; Does anyone have any ideas on how to fix this problem and to get it to stop happening?&nbsp; I'd really appreciate the help!

            Hi Lynn.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does it remove Malwarebytes Real Time protection or just the System Tray icon which signifies that it's starting with Windows?
<br />
<br />The reason I ask is that Defender may disable itself if another Anti-Virus is present, but in the past Malwarebytes was not classed as an anti-virus but instead as anti-malware which allowed it to run alongside Defender.  In fact this is what I recommended for those who were chronically infected while using only Defender.  
<br />
<br />However Defender has become good enough now that I rarely make that recommendation any longer, instead just recommend Malwarebytes for it's one-demand scanner, along with the other best-in-class scanner for adware, AdwCleaner.  
<br />
<br />Microsoft may have changed their view of Malwarebytes after it's real time protection causes serious issues awhile back.
<br />
<br />What I would do is uninstall Malwarebytes, restart PC, then reinstall Malwarebytes from it's latest download:  <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br />
<br />If you're willing to do this, I would turn off the Premium Trial in Account settings and run with it that way for awhile before turning back on Real Time because you may not need it since Defender is fully capable and from Microsoft who now how to protect their operating system best.  
<br />
<br />I make this recommendation having spent every day for ten years in forums, helping over 100,000 consumers directly, and writing tutorials that have helped millions do the best installs of Windows there are.   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            It just removes the icon.&nbsp; I don't want to have to go through uninstalling and reinstalling it again.&nbsp; I just did that back in January the last time it removed my icon.&nbsp; Am I going to have to do this every time Windows updates my computer?&nbsp; So annoying.&nbsp;
 It does not interfere with my Windows Defender at all.

            If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.

            since the Intel HD Graphics is generic, can you tell me your intel processor model? then I can determine the exact chipset and have this looked at, presuming in can get this black screen.

<p>
</p><p>As many customers are also writing about this topic, I have been facing the same problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, my request to gain access to my Skype account was refused and I received the&nbsp;final advice that I better to create a new account on Skype from Microsoft Support Team. So now I'm writing this from another account.</p>
<p>However, I have to use my former account due to an importance of my contact list... and I charged money to it.<br />
I just realized I still can access to it from my smart phone.&nbsp;<br />
Of course, I don't remember my password yet I would like to know whether there is any idea I can take it back.<br />
I am wondering that I provided some proper information to gain permission but it was not working. I have no idea I can manage it.</p>
<p>If you have any idea, please let me know...</p>

    <title>Cheap OEM copies of Windows 10 Pro on eBay&#58; are these - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cheap OEM copies of Windows 10 Pro on eBay&#58; are these legitimate&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On eBay, I see supposedly legal, full version, English-language copies of Windows 10 Pro, complete with valid license keys, for as little as $10.&nbsp; Most are on DVD in unopened boxes, but a couple are offered as downloads, and at least one is on a flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a scam? Or could these copies possibly be legitimate?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, they’re all OEM copies. Is there any kind of downside to that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<p><span><span>Lately there have been several reports of instances of blocked MSDN keys packaged with legitimate looking media. I can't stress enough to save your packaging, media and reciepts, if
 you purchase software such as this seek recourse with the store you purchased it from and report it to
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">www.microsoft.com/piracy</span></span></span></span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have purchased a key, with or without DVD's or packaging from EBAY or any other person or vendor and believe it may be an MSDN key because your key has been blocked you can
 check a few things yourself, if you received your key with the physical product go to
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">www.microsoft.com/howtotell</span></span></span></span><span><span>and verify your product however some counterfeit
 software is so convincing you may not be able to spot it as such.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>About MSDN or TechNet Product Keys
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>They are genuine Microsoft product keys, they are actually retail licenses, but it is intended for a particular product channel either the Microsoft Software Developer Network (MSDN)
 or TechNet for IT Professionals who pay a subscription fee. The main purpose is for evaluation purposes. The great thing about them, unlike trial Microsoft software, MSDN or TechNet keys don't expire. Because the agreement under which the subscription is provided
 is a single license, none of the software should be distributed outside of it. Even though its $50,000 worth of licenses, it is for one person only to use and no one else. Unfortunately, regardless of the licensing terms, persons still abuse the program, either
 giveaway product keys or resell it on auction sites. Microsoft licenses it in good faith that customers won't do so, but I guess human nature wins out.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In your case, what probably happened is, you bought an MSDN licensed key, which carries up to 10 activations unlike full packaged retail licenses which only carry 1 activation. The
 person who sold it to you probably sold it to 10 other persons. Somewhere along the way, one of those persons might have installed it on a second system, activated it, because it went past 10 activation threshold, Microsoft detected it that it was being abused
 and blocked the key from further use.</span></span></p>

<p>Actually, I didn't buy it yet, I was asking about it <strong>BEFORE </strong>buying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But these offers <strong>CLAIM </strong>to be "full" versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And they say they are the complete product, not just a license key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you must be right; these must&nbsp;have&nbsp;Technet, MSDN or Volume licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at least at $10, you don't have a lot to lose if you can't even activate the product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you ever <strong>DID </strong>need tech support from Microsoft, and you were persistent enough to actually get them on the phone for free, wouldn't they know from the license key that this was a pirated product (unless it had not already been activated
 10 times)?</p>

<h2>            How do I review my child&#39;s chat history using parental controls&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently found out that my 15 year-old child is chatting inappropriately with adult men that are part of mine and my husband's social group. She refuses to give me her password on Facebook, and they protect her due to privacy issues, because she
 is a client over the age of 13. I also believe she has used Yahoo to chat and possibly even our webcam at home on-line as well. How can I, as the Administrator of our home computer, A) retrieve a "forgotten" password to an account belonging to my minor child?
 or B) View her chat history from my own account??

<br />
</span></span><span>About the recovering of a forgotten password, we need to verify if you are referring to her Microsoft account or Windows user account locally in the computer?<br />

            <p>I have a similar issue.&nbsp; I have a small office network with 4 computers.&nbsp; The problem I am experiencing is just with one computer, which I'll call Computer A.&nbsp; Computer A is a Dell Desktop work station that has been running Windows 10 for several weeks.&nbsp;
 Computer B is an off brand PC that was originally running Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; When Computer B was running Windows 7 Pro, there was no problem with sharing select files &amp; folders&nbsp;back and forth between the 2 computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week, I upgraded Computer B to Windows 10.&nbsp; I used File Explorer and advanced settings to allow access on both Computers A &amp; B.&nbsp; Computer B can read the select files/folders on Computer A without any problem.&nbsp; However, the reverse is not true.&nbsp; On Computer
 A, whenever I click on the Computer B icon I receive a request for a password to access Computer B files.&nbsp; Designated Computer B files cannot be viewed or accessed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions on how to correct this situation?&nbsp; I could probably consider using a password, as a last ditch measure, but I do not know how and where to set the password on Computer B.</p>

<h2>            Free Windows DVD Player not working so uninstalled, now i can&#39;t get it back without paying &#36;15</h2>
                    <p>I received the free DVD player when upgrading from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 10 Pro. It has worked in the past,&nbsp;the other day&nbsp;it would not stay open when launched. I would launch it and it would
 immediately close. I thought, it's an app, I will uninstall it and re-install it. Well I uninstalled it, but now I can't get it back without paying $15.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to get this back without paying? The program stopped working through no fault of mine and uninstalling and re-installing Windows Store Apps is one way of getting them to work
 again. That has worked for other WS apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It does not show up in my owned apps either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried a system restore back as far as I could go and the restore would not complete due to error with Windows Store Apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After uninstalling and trying the restore, I thought to run Windows Troubleshooter on the Windows Store Apps. It did find a problem<span>&nbsp;</span>but did not restore Windows DVD Player.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anybody else have this problem?</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Errors in Windows 7</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On start up I get three different messages.</p>
<p>1,&nbsp; ETDCtrl.exe - Application error. Application unable to start correctly (0xc0150004)</p>
<p>2,&nbsp; RAVCp64.exe - System Error. Programme unable to start because DCIMAN32.dll is missing from your computer.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; PmmUpdate.exe - Application Error Application unable to start correctly (0xo1500004)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know very little about computers, but can follow instructions if they are clear to novices.</p>
<p>I have tried to get assistance from computer experts online but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried restoring to an earlier date but that didn't work because the restore points didn't go back far enough.</p>

            Hi Piinaki,
<div>I did everything. Went through the maze of cleaning and clearing. All the problem notifications seemed to disappear and when it came to resetting the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting they all returned again. &nbsp; I also get the Microsoft Management
 Console isn't working message. &nbsp;In order to do it all I printed everything out so I didn't get it wrong. But perhaps I still did. Thanks for all your advice. Perhaps it's not recoverable. &nbsp;I have a disc, which I think may be the recovery disc. &nbsp;It has on it
 the words: Images Folder; &nbsp;Patch Folder; RCD3 &nbsp;DAT and Restore DAT. &nbsp; Not sure if it will help and what to press when it opens. Sorry to sound so dim, but I am.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for an update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, you have mentioned that the issue does not occur in clean boot state, were you able to determine the application or service that was causing while troubleshooting the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, you can try the section "<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>" to enable each service or application and check which is the exact one that is causing the issue. For this, you would need to follow
 the steps from the link that was suggested earlier to perform clean boot. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still does not gets resolved, rather than doing the recovery, try to restore the computer to a point prior to this issue by doing a System restore. Refer to the link to do so:</p>

Thankyou for all Your help. I eventually went for remote assistance because I felt incompetent at following your generous advice and now am totally stuck, although still trying. Latest problem is that when using the restore discs I created when I got this laptop
 the third of five discs failed. Now we seem to be in a place of no return because the computer keeps asking for it! &nbsp;I am grateful for your help but perhaps it is now beyond repair! Typing this on a tablet, which I find a poor substitute.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps, you need to change the boot priority under BIOS and set it to DVD drive (primary drive).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you check if the boot priority is set to CD/DVD drive as a primary drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If not, refer to the manuals provided by the manufacturer of the computer and then change the boot priority to DVD drive and then try doing a system restore prior to this issue.</p>

    <title>How do I boot 32-bit Windows on an ASUS VivoBook Max X541SA&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arthur durand  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I boot 32-bit Windows on an ASUS VivoBook Max X541SA&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a brand new&nbsp;<strong>ASUS VivoBook Max X541SA</strong> notebook which came preinstalled with&nbsp;<strong>Microsoft Windows 10 Home Single Language
</strong>(<strong>64-bit</strong>) version&nbsp;<strong>10.0.17763 Build 17763</strong>.<br />
<br />
The technical specifications of the notebook is as follows<br />
Processor&nbsp;<strong>Intel</strong>(R) <strong>Celeron</strong>(R) CPU <strong>N3060</strong> @
<strong>1.60GHz</strong>, <strong>1601Mhz</strong>, <strong>2 Cores</strong>, 2 Logical<br />
BIOS Version/Date&nbsp;<strong>American Megatrends Inc</strong>. <strong>X541SA.301</strong>,
<strong>2016/09/14</strong>&nbsp;<br />
BIOS Mode&nbsp;<strong>UEFI</strong><br />
Installed Physical Memory (RAM)&nbsp;<strong>2,00 GB</strong><br />
<br />
I completed the&nbsp;<strong>OOBE</strong> and got so frustrated with how slow the notebook PC was! So I figure that it was due to the&nbsp;<strong>OS</strong> being 64-bit on a system with only
<strong>2GB</strong> of <strong>RAM</strong> as well as all the <strong>bloatware</strong> that came preinstalled!<br />
<br />
I downloaded&nbsp;<strong>32-bit</strong> <strong>Windows 10</strong> from <strong>Official Microsoft</strong> using the
<strong>Media Creation Tool</strong> and burned the image to a disc. I booted from the disk, but it simply wouldn't boot&nbsp;<strong>UEFI</strong> so I enabled
<strong>Legacy</strong> boot mode and booted from the disc! While booted from the disc I created a
<strong>backup</strong> folder on the hard drive and moved all of the folders in the root of the drive to the
<strong>backup</strong> folder and applied the appropriate Windows image&nbsp;to the <strong>
OS</strong> partition using&nbsp;<strong>DISM</strong>, then I formatted the <strong>SYSTEM</strong> partition to create boot files. The hard drive is obviously formatted
<strong>GPT</strong> so I had to create <strong>EFI</strong> boot files on the <strong>
SYSTEM</strong> partition.<br />
<br />
I am unable to boot with a <strong>32-bit</strong> <strong>EFI</strong>! however I am able to boot&nbsp;<strong>64-bit EFI</strong> successfully! After several failed attempts to boot&nbsp;<strong>32-bit EFI</strong>, I booted&nbsp;<strong>64-bit EFI
</strong>from a <strong>64-bit Windows 10</strong> installation disc, deleted all the files and folders of the new installation and moved all the folders back to its original location and recreated the boot files! The laptop is in the same state it was before
 and its working! I would still love to install&nbsp;<strong>32-bit Windows 10</strong> to get better performance!<br />
<br />
I believe the reason why the notebook fails to boot <strong>32-bit EFI</strong> has something to do with the&nbsp;<strong>Secure Boot Key Management</strong> in the
<strong>BIOS</strong> setup on the&nbsp;<strong>Security</strong> page, I'm just not sure what to do there!<br />
<br />
I am unable to ask for any advice from <strong>ASUS</strong> as the suggested <strong>
MyASUS</strong> app keeps on crashing on launch!

<p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to let you know that as per the
<a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/ASUS-VivoBook-Max-X541SA/HelpDesk_Download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 on the device. </span></p>
<p><span>Note: Since the websites are not hosted by Microsoft, the links may change without notice. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy of this information.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, I would like to let you know that changing the architecture from 64 bit to 32 bit does not solve the performance issue on this device.
</span></p>
<p><span>To improve the performance on this device which has Windows 10, you may want to refer to the steps from this article ‘<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Tips
 to improve PC performance in Windows 10</span></a>’.</span></p>
<p><span>Important: Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a restore point manually. Restoring
 won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re using other antivirus or anti-malware software, see the documentation for that program to learn how to scan for viruses. Also, make sure multiple
 antivirus programs aren’t running at the same time. If they are, choose the one you want to run, and then disable or uninstall any others.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have another antivirus program installed and turned on, Windows Security will be turned off by default.</span></p>

<h2>            Audio Services not responding</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I've been having trouble with my laptops's internal speaker for quite some time. I can adjust the volume but no sound is coming out of it. Same goes when I plug in my headphones. Whenever I try to run a trouble shooting, two problem shows up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. audio services not reponding : despite saying that my windows audio and windows audio end point builder is not running, I've tried multiple times to restart the service but the same problem keeps popping out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. audio service not set to default : this is yet another problem cause whenever I tried to ' restore default' on my speaker, it says "format not supported by the device (weird right?). It can only run at other format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a lot of thing, updating all of the drivers, updating windows, restore to the previous point before it became like this but nothing changed. Kinda panicking now cause I need the audio especially at this crucial time.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi there. Thank you again for your reply.</p>
<p>Unfortunately nothing has changed. There is still no sound coming from my speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the methods several time in these few days and made sure that the Windows Audio and all other dependent services are running (I restarted them a lot of times) and I tried it again today, following step by step. I even made sure that my speaker
 (Conexant SmartAudio HD) is the default device But whenever I trouble shoot the problem , it keeps popping up the two same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glen</p>

<p>If you are still experiencing issues launching Forza 7, we suggest that you<span> click on this
</span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>link</span></a></span><span> for the steps to perform a clean boot. This process will start Windows by using
 a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also <span>reset the game from the Settings menu. This process can help restore corrupted game installation files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>System</strong>, and then select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></li><li><span>Find the game, and then click on <strong>Advanced</strong> options.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</li><li><span>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, </span><span>remove temporary files from your PC.
</span><span>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Clean&#47;Reinstall Windows 8 on Win8 Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Clean&#47;Reinstall Windows 8 on Win8 Laptop</h2>
                    I bought a new computer with Windows 8 Pre-installed.  Of course, it has the manufacturer's crapware on it.  Is there an effective way to clean/reinstall Windows 8 WITHOUT the manufacture's software (as if I bought a new hard drive and just installed windows for the first time)? 



Please note that the typical Refresh and Resetting are ineffective because the Microsoft has given manufacturers access to those options, and performing either of those will just reset the computer back to the same **** that was installed on it in the first place.  Because one doesn't receive a Windows disk with computers anymore, is there a way to just get a windows 8 ISO for backup and recovery purposes? 



Additionally, I want to get the pro version, but research indicates that product keys are now stored in BIOS.  Apparently, because of this, regardless of what version one installs doing a clean install, the original BIOS key'd version will install.  Is there a way around this? What if one purchases the "P

            &nbsp;Hi KT,<br />
<div>Thank you for coming up with the issue on Microsoft Community Forum!<br />
<div>According to the description, you want to get rid of the software that comes preinstalled along with Windows 8 when the OEM provides Windows 8 preinstalled in the computer. This is not possible unless a clean installation of Windows 8 using a different
 media downloaded from Microsoft.<br />
<br />
You will have to uninstall all the unnecessary programs from the computer and that is the only feasible way to get the computer free&nbsp;from the programs the manufacturer has provided. The other way is to do a clean installation using a Windows 8 DVD bought from
 Microsoft store.<br />
<br />
<div>I would suggest you refer the links given below:<br />

            Thanks Pavan!
<div><br />
<div>That was helpful. &nbsp;However this raises a few more questions. &nbsp;Does buying the "Pro Pack" that you led me to change the BIOS key for clean installations of the Pro version? &nbsp;I have seen and understand that if the key written to the BIOS does not match the
 version trying to install, windows won't install.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, does buying the pro pack allow for a download of an ISO media that I can burn to a USB (my ultrabook doesn't have an optical drive)? &nbsp;Ideally, I'd like to just boot from a USB that has Windows Pro on it and clean install. &nbsp;Is that possible given
 the methods outlined above?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again.</div>

    <title>Microsoft Changed my Child&#39;s Gamertag - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Changed my Child&#39;s Gamertag</h2>
                    It was a Microsoft assigned default gamertag. I didn't even create it. The kids liked it, and when we turned the Xbox on today, and it changed. No emails, or account notifications, it's just changed. Can someone look at this and tell me why it was modified
 without notice? 1) We're all disappointed that it was changed, 2) At first glance it looks like the account was compromised because we didn't authorize the change and we weren't notified that Microsoft was doing anything.

<p>The only time Microsoft changes gamertags is if the enforcement team issued a forced gamertag change for a gamertag that violates the code of conduct.

            <p>You can Google how to get rid of everything Windows 10 - some IT folk call it a Trojan and that, to me, is what it is.&nbsp; It is an invasive and persistent little pest that just doesn't seem to go away even though we make our choice not to have it.&nbsp; After you
 do all the things required to go back to Windows 7 or 8.1 - whatever you had before - you need to then do some pretty shifty things to get rid of the trigger; you need to get rid of the app and the icon as well as all the folders that have been installed on
 your computer without you knowing (which is why I agree that it is like a trojan). I found a most informative and helpful site - this is the link. I hope this helps you it is the one I used -</p>
<p>http://www.askvg.com/how-to-remove-get-windows-10-app-and-its-icon-from-taskbar/<br />
This one is good too but I ended up using the above but this one might suit you better.</p>

<p>REMEMBER: It is vital to get rid of all the files because it will keep popping up and try and download and reinstall it.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
