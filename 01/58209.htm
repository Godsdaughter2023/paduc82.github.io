                    I have a Brother printer. Sometimes when I try to print, the computer automatically&nbsp;restarts! Is there any reason why this is happening?

            Hi Joey
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />When you mention expire do you mean that the invitation expires?
<br />As per Microsoft "The invitation is valid for 7 days. If they do not accept before then, the invite will expire, and you will need to send another one."
<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-are-skype-private-conversations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34824/what-a...</a>
<br />
<br />The 7 days is related to the technology (handshake) used for the encryption of the conversation.

            If you said that it expires within 7 days then why is it that every after 5 to 10 mins. shuts me off then I have to invite again every now and then?

            Hi Joey
<br />
<br />You are correct, it should not do that every 5 ou 10 minutes.
<br />
<br />I would recommend a clean reinstall of Skype.
<br />
<br />May I ask in which operating system (mac?windows?) and version of it are you using Skype?
<br />
<br />Thank you
<br />Margarida

            Thank you. 
<br />
<br />There is a specific Skype version for windows 8. To solve this I would recommend:
<br />- Uninstall Skype
<br />- Restart you device
<br />- Download from here the version for Windows 8 : <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/updating-to-the-latest-version-of-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA34841/updati...</a>
<br />- Install that version
<br />- Try again to log in
<br />
<br />Thank you!

    <title>&#38;quot&#59;Cone NAT&#38;quot&#59; issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Cone NAT&#38;quot&#59; issues</h2>
                    
<p>So I've spent the better part of the past week in an attempt to get a clean, open NAT for my Xbox One. It initially was almost constantly showing up as "strict" with the MP test describing the network as being "behind a port preserving, port symmetric NAT".
 I've since bought a new router (and the problems persisted initially) and had my ISP bridge my DSL modem to avoid whatever double NAT issues may have been present. Now the NAT shows up as "open" when I run the connection test, but when I do the MP test and
 then hit the shoulder buttons for the specifics, it still says it's behind a "cone NAT". The main symptom I seem to be encountering is no incoming sound from the majority of other players when I'm playing something on Live. I'll see the name and mic pop up
 that indicate someone is talking, but there's no sound through to my headset. I'll have a few people's voice that comes through, but others in the same session give nothing.</p>
<p>I've tried every trick in the book. Forwarding ports, no good. Always get a "port not open or reachable" message when I try the port check tool.</p>
<p>uPnP enabled/disabled hasn't seemed to make a noteworthy difference.</p>
<p>Putting the Xbox in the DMZ hasn't seemed to do much, either. It sometimes seems OK, but then the same issues reappear.</p>
<p>There's one "enable NAT" setting in my router that is checked as on, but if I disable it, I'm unable to connect to the internet at all. I'm not sure if that's the final thing i need to find a workaround for, or if I'm just getting some bizarre conflict.</p>
<p>My router is an Asus RT-N66R (from what I've gathered, it's largely identical to an RT-N66U). If anyone has any experience with similar issues, some advice would be appreciated. I'm at my wits end with this, and I'm hoping there's some dumb, simple solution
 that I've overlooked to this point. Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Greetings xo5N47CHF4C3ox!</p>
<p>If you haven't already, please go ahead and start a fresh new thread with a detailed description of your situation, along with any error code you are getting and any troubleshooting steps you have tried so far.</p>
<p>In order to save yourself some time, please read: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4267/t/1621667.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../1621667.aspx</a> and post back in full detail (the bits in bold), so that people trying to help can have a better understanding of your situation.</p>
<p>FYI: When you held down triggers and bumpers all together after you'd run the Multiplayer Connection test, what you console is actually doing is that it send out information to delete the existing PortMapping for the required ports for Xbox traffic and add a new PortMapping. If you simply were to run the Multiplayer Connection test, you wouldn't see the same results through a debug process, because these values are actually cached values.</p>
<p>If your console is getting diagnosed with NAT beaviour of a Cone NAT, that would mean it's diagnosed with the least restrictive form of NAT behavior, which is where you want to go.</p>

<p>A cone NAT is a good thing. Per Microsoft, cone NAT works best with and is recommended for Xbox Live.
</p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/5/5b5bec17-ea71-4653-9539-204a672f11cf/Xbox-Live.doc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download.microsoft.com/.../Xbox-Live.doc</a></p>
<p>So, that is not your problem. &nbsp;Getting a "port not open" etc. message with port check tools is normal because the Xbox isn't actually listening on the ports you likely checked. Despite what many here recommend under the mistaken belief it is needed (largely
 due to misleading information on the MS support site), these are the only ports you need to forward:</p>
<p>88 UDP</p>
<p>3074 TCP and UDP</p>
<p>and if you have COD Ghosts, also:</p>
<p>3075 TCP and UDP</p>
<p>3076 TCP and UDP</p>
<p>With your router, you should not even have to forward ports, just enable UPnP (pretty sure that router has a good UPnP implementation even with stock firmware). &nbsp;Just delete all port forwards and DMZ (it is rarely a good idea for home users to use DMZ) and
 enable UPnP. &nbsp;If you are somewhat adventurous, you can flash your particular model router with superior third-party firmware. I use Tomato, but you may want to start with RMerlin, which is just an improved version of the stock Asus firmware (Asus even incorporates
 some of his changes into the official firmware, which is open source). &nbsp;Even if you stick with the official Asus firmware, do make sure it has been updated to the latest version (via the web interface).</p>

<h2>            Possible to force enable tablet mode in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is it possible to force-enable tablet mode in Windows 8.1 on a touchscreen laptop like the "Tablet Mode" in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe a registry edit/add or a small software add-on of some kind? I am having trouble with a laptop's touchpad and until I get it fixed, I need an easier way to be able to work with the laptop than having to use magnifier, or plugging in a mouse every time
 there is a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the touchscreen is built in to the laptop, it is multi touch (10 point I believe), and all the drivers are updated and working correctly. And please do not suggest it because, no I do not want to upgrade or buy anything new or different.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest following these steps to enable Tablet Mode in Windows 8.1:</p>
<p>1. Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
2. Navigate to option "<strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>", then expand to find "<strong>HID-compliant touch screen</strong>"&nbsp;or "<strong>HID-compliant device</strong>".
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE:</span></strong> If you cannot find these options, click View -&gt; Show hidden devices.<br />
3. Right-click "<strong>HID-compliant touch screen</strong>" or "<strong>HID-compliant device</strong>"&nbsp;to click "<strong>Enable</strong>”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly check this registry as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ImmersiveShell\TabletMode</li></ul>

            Hi Eeva,
<br />
<br />Not sure about that first one, but I can tell you the second is added whenever you use any Windows Live apps. You can delete this if you wish, but it will just be re-added the next time you use the app.
<br />
<br />There is certainly no harm in leaving any passwords there that were generated by Windows, as the first appears to be also.
<br />
<br />Kind Regards,
<br />Ryan

<p>Rob. In fact, after upgrade to build 17133 the problem has disappeared and I don't see it anymore. So obviously it's MS problem: I recall that happened on early days (from time to time) with first Insider Previews of Win10&nbsp;</p>

<p>121003. I knew what it meant when I first saw it and why MS will NEVER tell you the truth about it. It means they've lost your data. If fact it momentarily connected yesterday. My daily challenges for the whole month were gone. Period. Zip. And it wouldn't
 load the events at all. How could it be MY system when it's reading and sending and doing 100% with everything else? Including another XBox live game. I can access my XBox Live account just fine.&nbsp; I uninstalled, reinstalled, same 121003 code. My data got eaten
 and their cloud or the game has a glitch. So having the ethics of most modern business they blame it on YOU.</p>
<p>NOT OUR FAULT. NOPE. So they are jerking US around rather than fixing THEIR problems.</p>

    <title>Terms for Extended Service Plan for Xbox One, only apply for Xbox 360 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> webworm360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Terms for Extended Service Plan for Xbox One, only apply for Xbox 360 and Kinect of Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>I was trying to purchase Extended Service Plan(ESP) for my Xbox one from https://myservice.xbox.com/en-GB/pages/billing.aspx.</p>

<p>After I input my credit card information, the LEGAL AGREEMENT states that only Xbox 360 and associated accessories are covered by the plan. I am supposed to agree to this by ticking a check box if I want to purchase the above ESP for my Xbox one.</p>

<p>What are you playing at Microsoft??</p>

<p>Full terms are below, copied from the above website. You would only see them after you enter your payment information but just before you confirm to buy.</p>

<p>XBOX AND ZUNE SERVICES TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</p>
<p>February 2013</p>
<p>1. INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>If you submit a request for service (the “Service”) for your Xbox or Zune product, you accept and agree to these Xbox or Zune Services Terms and Conditions and any other applicable terms, conditions, policies or disclaimers found on xbox.com/support (the
 “Agreement”). We encourage you to read these terms carefully. These terms apply to Services for Xbox consoles, Xbox accessories, Kinect for Xbox 360 Sensors and Zune devices (“Xbox or Zune Products”).
<br />
<br />
<b>PLEASE DO NOT SUBMIT A REQUEST FOR SERVICES IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THESE XBOX AND ZUNE SERVICES TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
</b></p>
<p>2. MODIFICATION OF XBOX OR ZUNE SERVICES TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>
<p>At any time, Microsoft may update the Xbox and Zune Services Terms and Conditions without providing you notice. You are responsible for understanding these terms and conditions before requesting a new repair; if you continue to use the website and/or submit
 a Service order, you will have agreed to the amended terms.</p>
<p>3. WARRANTY AND EXTENDED SERVICE PLAN COVERAGE</p>
<p>In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Microsoft-issued limited warranty, guarantee or extended service plan for your Xbox or Zune Product, the terms of the Microsoft-issued limited warranty, guarantee or extended service plan will apply
 to the Service for your Xbox or Zune Product. Be sure to keep a copy of your proof of purchase for your Xbox or Zune Product. We may require you to provide proof of purchase to us if there is any question as to your Xbox or Zune Product’s eligibility for free
 of charge warranty service, or extended service plan coverage.</p>
<p>4. LIMITATIONS ON USE BY MINORS</p>
<p>You must be at least 18 years of age to submit a service order for your Xbox or Zune product on this site or any related sites; if you submit an order, you are responsible for complying with this age requirement.</p>
<p>5. USE OF INFORMATION ABOUT YOU</p>
<p>Microsoft takes care of information about you and your order history according to the terms of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>6. ACCURACY OF BILLING AND ACCOUNT INFORMATION</p>
<p>When you submit a Service order for your Xbox or Zune Product, you agree to provide current, complete, and accurate payment, account and contact information and to promptly update that information, so that we can complete your transactions and contact you
 as needed.</p>
<p>7. PAYMENT</p>
<p>Unless service for your Xbox or Zune Product is covered by the Microsoft-issued limited warranty, guarantee or extended service contract, you agree to pay the estimated Service charges at the time you submit an order (either by phone through our customer
 service agent or online). The estimated charges include all parts and labor required for Service, shipping charges, plus applicable tax. For Advance Exchange orders, please review the terms below.</p>
<p>8. LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE DURING SHIPPING</p>
<p>If you send in your Xbox or Zune Product for Service, you are responsible to have it properly packaged to prevent damage while in transit for service. You are also responsible for insurance coverage for any loss or damage to the Xbox or Zune Product while
 in transit for service. We will notify you if the Xbox or Zune Product is damaged in any way in transit for service; you will be responsible for any damage incurred before we receive your Xbox or Zune Product.
<br />
<br />
After we have shipped back your Xbox or Zune Product to you, if it arrives in a damaged condition, you must notify Microsoft of the damage by calling us within two (2) days after you receive it (at the customer service number listed on Xbox or Zune.com/support
 for the country where you purchased the Xbox or Zune Product). If you fail to contact Microsoft regarding any damage to your Xbox or Zune Product within two (2) days after you receive it, you will be responsible for any damage.</p>
<p>9. DATA TRANSFER OR SOFTWARE INSTALLATION</p>
<p>Before you send your Xbox or Zune Product to Microsoft for Service, you are responsible to back up all existing data, software, and programs, and to remove or erase all existing data or remove any storage device. Microsoft is not responsible for loss, recovery,
 or compromise of data, programs or loss of use of equipment resulting from service of your Xbox or Zune Product.
<br />
<br />
If Service of your Xbox or Zune Product involves transferring information or installing software, you will only submit an order if you have the legal right to: (1) copy the information, including verifying that your Xbox or Zune Product does not contain illegal
 files or data; and (2) to agree to the terms of the software license; you authorize Microsoft to transfer the information and accept those terms for you in performing the service.</p>
<p>10. ABANDONED PROPERTY</p>
<p>Microsoft will ship your Xbox or Zune Product to the mailing address submitted when you authorized Service, unless you give us alternate instructions in writing. If your product is returned to Microsoft because delivery could not be completed at that address,
 Microsoft will attempt to contact you for an alternate address. If you do not provide an address where Microsoft or its agent may deliver your product within sixty (60) days after the original delivery attempt, Microsoft will notify you that it considers your
 product abandoned. If your product is abandoned, Microsoft may dispose of your Xbox or Zune Product (in accordance with applicable law); specifically, Microsoft may sell your product at a private or public sale to pay for any outstanding service. Microsoft
 reserves its statutory and any other lawful liens for unpaid charges.</p>
<p>11. LIABILITY FOR OTHER PROPERTY</p>
<p>When you send your Xbox or Zune Product in for service, do not send any personal property or other Microsoft products with that Xbox or Zune Product (this includes Xbox or Zune accessories for which you did not request Service, games, books, etc.); you are
 responsible for the loss of any personal property that you send to Microsoft. Other than the items that were required for the service of your Xbox or Zune Product or its replacement, Microsoft does not guarantee that any personal property will be returned
 to you.</p>
<p>12. REPAIR OR EXCHANGE</p>
<p>When you send your Xbox or Zune Product to Microsoft for Service, it may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same functionality rather than being repaired. New or refurbished parts may be used to Service your Xbox or Zune Product during the repair. Any
 part or product replaced during Service will be Microsoft’s property, and the replacement part or product will become your property.</p>
<p>13. SPECIAL EDITION OR CUSTOM XBOX OR ZUNE PRODUCTS</p>
<p>If you send a special edition or custom Xbox or Zune Product to Microsoft for Service, Microsoft will use best efforts to return the same or similar special edition or custom Xbox or Zune Product to you; this will depend on its availability at the time of
 service (special or custom editions may be out of production or inventory). Microsoft does not warrant or guarantee that we will be able to do so, as it may be commercially impracticable.</p>
<p>14. EXCLUSIONS FROM SERVICE</p>
<p>Microsoft reserves the right to refuse Service on Xbox or Zune Products that are: (1) damaged by use with products not sold or licensed by Microsoft (including, for example, games and accessories not manufactured or licensed by Microsoft, and “pirated” games,
 etc.); (2) used for commercial purposes (including, for example, rental, pay-per-play, etc.); (3) opened, modified, or tampered with (including, for example, any attempt to defeat any technical limitation, security, or anti-piracy mechanism, etc.), (or its
 serial number is altered or removed; (4) damaged by any external cause (including, for example, by being dropped, used with inadequate ventilation, etc., or failure to follow product manual instructions for the Xbox or Zune Product); (5) sent to Microsoft
 without requesting an authorized repair by phone or online; or (6) that were repaired by any third party other than Microsoft or its authorized repair providers. In such event, we may return the Xbox or Zune Product to you without service.</p>
<p>15. ADDITIONAL TERMS FOR ADVANCE EXCHANGE PROGRAM</p>
<p>In certain countries, Microsoft offers an Advance Exchange Program, under which you can receive a console prior to shipping back your console to Microsoft for service, with certain conditions. If you want to participate in the Advanced Exchange program,
 Microsoft will send you a replacement Xbox Product (the “Advance Exchange Product”) before you send your Xbox Product to us, under the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>• Your Xbox Product must comply with the terms of the warranty, guarantee or extended service contract;
</li><li>• Your Xbox Product will not qualify for this program if, after we receive it, there is evidence of physical damage, tamper, abuse, etc. or other exclusions from your Xbox Product’s warranty, guarantee or extended service contract;
</li><li>• The Advance Exchange Product will be shipped to you in a box that includes a prepaid shipping label; and
</li><li>• You must use the prepaid shipping label to return the Xbox Product for which you received an Advanced Exchange Product and are requesting service. You will need to return your original Xbox Product in the same box within 14 days of receiving the replacement
 product. </li><li>• To guarantee that the original Xbox Product is returned, we will need to take your credit card number. YOUR CREDIT CARD WILL NOT BE CHARGED, provided you return the original Xbox Product (with the serial number you have provided to us) within 14 days
 of receiving the Advanced Exchange Product. </li><li>• A pre-authorization for the full replacement charge and handling fee may appear on your card from Xbox Service, verifying that funds are available in your account (the full amount will be refunded); this is not a charge. We will only charge you the replacement
 and handling fee indicated below if: (1) we do not receive the original Xbox Product back within 14 days from the date you took delivery of the replacement product as indicated by the carrier’s tracking system; (2) if the product is not under warranty; and/or
 (3) if the product is excluded from warranty or service (has indication of tampering or physical damage).

<p>16. LIMITED POST-SERVICE WARRANTY</p>
<p>In servicing your Xbox or Zune Product, Microsoft warrants (1) that Service will be performed in a workmanlike manner and (2) that all parts or products used in the Service will be free from defects in materials and workmanship for either the remainder of
 the term of your Microsoft-issued warranty, guarantee or extended service contract or ninety (90) days from the date of Service, whichever is greater. This post-Service warranty is an express limited warranty. If non-conforming Service is provided or a defect
 arises in a replacement part or product during the ninety (90) day warranty period, at its option, Microsoft will (1) repair the part or product, using new, used or refurbished replacement parts, or (2) replace the part or product with a new, used or refurbished
 equivalent part or product, or (3) refund your payment for the Service. <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
(b) opened, modified, or tampered with (including, for example, any attempt to defeat any technical limitation or security), or its serial number is altered or removed;
<br />
<br />
(c) damaged by any external cause, whether by You or someone else using Your Xbox or Zune Product, including, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• by being dropped; </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• misuse (including use outdoors), abuse, negligence, or accident; </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• mishandling or damage during shipment, except from Microsoft to You; </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• exposed to liquid; </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• used with inadequate ventilation; </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• scratched, dented, etc. or shows other cosmetic damage; </li><li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• failure to follow installation, operation or maintenance instructions; or
</li></ul>

THIS WARRANTY AND REMEDY ARE EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES, REMEDIES, AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE AND PARTS OR PRODUCTS PROVIDED. MICROSOFT SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ITEMS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. Some states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential
 damages or exclusions or limitations on the duration of implied warranties or conditions, so these limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. The post-Service warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary by state,
 province or jurisdiction. FOR CONSUMERS WHO ARE COVERED BY CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS OR REGULATIONS IN THEIR COUNTRY OF RESIDENCE, THE BENEFITS CONFERRED BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE IN ADDITION TO ALL RIGHTS AND REMEDIES CONVEYED BY SUCH CONSUMER PROTECTION
 LAWS AND REGULATIONS.</p>
<p>17. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</p>
<p>IF ANY PRODUCT SHOULD BE DAMAGED OR LOST WHILE IN MICROSOFT’S CUSTODY, MICROSOFT’S LIABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE COST OF REPAIR OR REPLACEMENT OF THE AFFECTED XBOX OR ZUNE PRODUCT. OTHERWISE MICROSOFT’S ENTIRE LIABILITY TO YOU FOR DAMAGES ARISING FROM
 ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICE OF YOUR XBOX OR ZUNE PRODUCT, WHETHER DUE TO MICROSOFT’S NEGLIGENCE OR TO ANY OTHER REASON, IS LIMITED TO DIRECT DAMAGES UP TO THE GREATER OF: (i) THE COST TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE XBOX OR ZUNE PRODUCT; OR (ii)
 THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU PAY TO MICROSOFT FOR THE SERVICE. MICROSOFT HAS NO LIABILITY WHATSOEVER FOR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SUCH AS LOST PROFITS OR REVENUE. MICROSOFT HAS NO LIABILITY FOR LOSS OF OR DAMAGE TO DATA OR SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS
 WHILE PERFORMING SERVICE. YOUR ONLY REMEDY UNDER THE REPAIR TERMS AND CONDITIONS IS TO SEEK RECOVERY OF DAMAGES AGAINST MICROSOFT IN AN AMOUNT NOT TO EXCEED (i) THE COST TO REPAIR OR REPLACE THE XBOX OR ZUNE PRODUCT; OR (ii) THE TOTAL AMOUNT YOU PAY TO MICROSOFT
 FOR THE SERVICE.</p>
<p>18. SUBCONTRACTORS</p>
<p>Microsoft may subcontract with other service providers to Service your Xbox or Zune Product.</p>
<p>19. CHOICE OF LAW AND LOCATION FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES</p>
<p>If you live in or your business is incorporated in the United States of America then claims for breach of this contract will be subject to the laws of the State of Washington, without reference to conflict of laws principles. All other claims, including
 claims regarding consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort, will be subject to the laws of your state of residence in the United States. If you live in or your business is incorporated in the United States of America you consent to the
 exclusive jurisdiction and venue of state and federal courts in King County, Washington, USA for all disputes relating to this contract or the Service.
<br />
<br />
If you live in or your business is incorporated outside of the United States of America all claims, including claims regarding consumer protection laws, unfair competition laws, and in tort, will be subject to the laws of the country in which you reside and
 the courts in the country in which you reside will have exclusive jurisdiction over all disputes arising out of or relating to this contract.</p>
<p>20. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; SEVERABILITY; FORCE MAJEURE</p>
<p>This is the entire Agreement between you and Microsoft for Services for your Xbox or Zune Product. Microsoft does not authorize any variance or modification of this Agreement. If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
 then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of the Agreement will continue in effect. Microsoft is not responsible
 for any failures or delays in performing Services that are due to events outside its reasonable control.</p>
<p>21. NOTICES FOR CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS</p>
<p>An estimate for repairs as required (Section 9844 of the California Business and Professions Code) will be given to the customer by the service dealer in writing, and the service dealer may not charge for work done or parts supplied in excess of the estimate
 without prior consent of the customer. Where provided in writing, the service dealer may charge a reasonable fee for services provided in determining the nature of the malfunction in preparation of a written estimate for repair. For information, contact the
 Bureau of Electronic and Appliance Repair, Department of Consumer Affairs, Sacramento, CA 95814.
<br />
<br />
A buyer of this product in California has the right to have this product serviced and repaired during the warranty period. The warranty period will be extended for the number of whole days that the product has been out of the buyer’s hands for warranty repairs.
 If a defect exists during the warranty period, the warranty will not expire until the defect has been fixed. The warranty period also will be extended if the warranty repairs have not been performed due to delays caused by circumstances beyond the control
 of the buyer, or if the warranty repairs did not remedy the defect and the buyer notifies the manufacturer or seller of the failure of the repairs within sixty (60) days after they were completed. If, after a reasonable number of attempts, the defect has not
 been fixed, the buyer may return this product for a replacement or a refund subject, in either case, to deduction of a reasonable charge for usage. The time extension does not affect the protection or remedies the buyer has under other laws.</p>

<h2>            WindowsImageBackup - Not Recognized by Restore Process</h2>
                    I have "WindowsImageBackup" on external HD and copied to the desktop of my HD--but when I try to do a restore, it does not find the system image or recognize the external HD in the list.&nbsp; How can I get this system image to be recognized?<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the external hard drive detected in the Device manager?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps provided in the following Microsoft article to restore the image backup and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Restore your computer from a system image backup:</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-your-computer-from-a-system-image-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-your-computer-from-a-system-image-backup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer if your hard drive or computer ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it
 is a complete restoration; you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced. The restore option should only be used when needed.</p>

<p>You have to get an endorsement by the Jordan company. You get endorsement deals by playing well, but mainly, how you answer your press conference questions. A few endorsements come before the one where you can create your own Jordans so it will take some
 time.</p>

<h2>            Boot error windows 10, unfixable, reverted to windows 7 again, every thing is f&#39;d now</h2>
                    <p>Basically everything is barely working, or not at all and i was going to try and re upgrade, i never made a back up image cause its literally been a week since i upgraded to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know what the heck happened shut completely down before going to a friends house, when i came back to boot up my system it... didn't, got stuck in some sort of infinite loop where it would beep but never quite make it to even the boot sequence (as
 in i didn't even get to see the first screen where it asks you if you want to edit bios ect.)<br />
</p>
<p>I hard reset the system, after wards it went into start up repair, subsequently failing, and afterwards it felt like despite "attempting" after the initial failure that it wasn't really trying anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As said in the title i eventually was forced to revert back to windows 7, main thing right now it seems like anything that accesses the internet besides my browser seems to fail at some level, none of my online games can boot, the windows trouble center
 can't look up my issues because im "not connected" (and btw im making this post from this not connected computer...) and currently windows update keeps failing with a error code that supposedly means there is a time disparity between me and microsoft update
 servers (even though my computer is set to sync with Microsoft and is currently accurate) the specific error code is: 80072f8f<br />
</p>
<p>And finally i cant even reupgrade to windows 10 because the update launcher fails to open. the specific failure message when i try to launch it is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a problem running this tool:</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're not sure what happened, but we're unable to run this tool on your PC. If you continue experincing problems, reference the error code when contacting customer support. Error code: -0x80072F8F - 0x20000</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it looks like it may very well be the same issue was the windows update anyways any assistance on this matter would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<p>Hello all!</p>
<p>I recently tried to log onto xbox live and I've been prompted to enter my relavent email address and password. The issue is that I made my xbox live account 3 years ago and no longer remember the password to the account. Ive followed the steps online in
 an attempt to verify myself including providing alternate email addresses, going through the automated process of sending relavent billing information and so on. Ive exhausted the resources I could find online and am now stuck. Have I lost my account forever?</p>

<p>For both: the only choice you have to call Support and once again go thru the account verification process. &nbsp;You cannot get any help from us. &nbsp;I suggest you go thru the email version. &nbsp;I did this myself once and it took me six forms and just about as many
 months to answer their questions. &nbsp;If you satisfy them, they will send you a password-reset link to any email you suggest. &nbsp;If you don't then your account is gone until such a time as you answer the questions to MS' satisfaction or they purge your GT from
 the system. &nbsp;As said, I have had this problem myself and going to thru Support is your only solution.

<p>Support requires you do to that form at least twice, its tedious and feels stupid but really that's the fastest and correct way to get a WLID reset so they make you do it. Then only if you can verify all the info on the account with support can they escalate
 your case to get a password reset which can take a few days. Are you sure your using the correct WLID first? Also WHEY ISOLATE what are your options for resetting? Do you have an email reset link option? If you no longer have access to that old email try resetting
 that, working backwards. THEAWAKER777 unfortunately used an ISP which is the worst, ISP/SCHOOL/MILITARY emails are the worst to use for the WLID because once you lose access you can't get it back. Also if anyone does know the password to their account, but
 when they sign into account.live.com and get the message "Your account has been temporarily blocked" or something like that you need to go to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/hotmail/hotmail-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
windows.microsoft.com/.../hotmail-support</a> that's for help with blocked accounts if anyone needs that.

<p>NOOO it's not lost!! Sorry I didn't want to give that impression, it's just harder to verify/recover. I meant you can't get the email back as opposed to like a gmail/yahoo/hotmail.
</p>
<p>If you can't use the security proofs, do the form for the password reset on account.live.com, it's "I can't use any of these options" (and that's really if none of the others work) fill it out a few times, keep the rejection letters, call support from home
 or at least get your console ID# (settings, system, console settings, system info) and if you can prove ownership with support they can send you an email reset link (IT WILL TAKE 1-3 DAYS). &nbsp;</p>
<p>After that you are still tied to that email however, at this point it's your login credentials only. You can see if they can escalate changing it for you, but most likely they'll help you reset the password then in 30 days (if you have to download your profile,
 if you don't and you haven't downloaded your profile in the last 30 days) you can change the WLID on the console. The password is required as well as a new WLID created on account.live.com. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO CREATE A HOTMAIL/OUTLOOK/LIVE email for this.

<h2>            &#34;Your PC does not support Miracast&#34; despite driver update</h2>
                    <p>We recently purchased the Microsoft Wireless Video Adapter (v2) and I have been able to successfully connect to it from a number of laptops and tablets of varying ages. &nbsp;However, when I try to connect to it from my desktop, I receive the error "Your PC or

 all drivers are updated, using both the Windows Updater as well as going to individual manufacturer websites and updating manually.</p>

<p>Thank you for the reply--everything checked out (though, there is no specific area to advise on Miracast). &nbsp;Both display drivers are WDDM 2.0, which should be fine. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the error is on my computer saying my computer itself doesn't support Miracast, it can't be the external device. &nbsp;However, I did notice the manufacturer installed Windows in Legacy BIOS mode instead of UEFI. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Additional information re; Miracast:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC was originally designed for W7 / or W7 was installed and you upgraded to W10, even though W10 now supports Miracast / mirroring, the original graphics card and/ or Wireless Adaptor may not be WiDi certified, some adaptor manufacturers have issued
 patches for some of their adaptors, this needs to be checked at their websites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Intel website they have discontinued support for this technology, because of W10 native support.&nbsp; Nvidia appear to still support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, there are Miracast Transmitter (not receiver) dongles available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other option (if possible) is HDMI connection between devices!!!!!!!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same problem as above where my PC does not support Miracast.<br />
<br />
Via the "<span>dxdiag" also learned that miracast is not supported.<br />

 finding this?<br />
<br />
<span>Is there another solution to this problem -&gt; I have tried to unsert a USB wifi, which didn't help anything (reading around and above it also sounds like it's a graphics problem?)<br />

Thank you in advance for assistance.<br />

<p>Hello Quebec Exile: If you don't mind me asking do you have any type of error code when you can't download anything? Also you may have a billing issue on your account what you can do is go to
<a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> and enter your account credintials there and check for any issues to see if that was the problem. Hope this helps!</p>

<p>did you migrate the account?</p>
<p>you will need to do so to use a quebec creditcard </p>
<p>creditcards don't work internationally for longterm unless you talk to your bank for an international one</p>
<p>but with most online services you need a valid billing addres that matches your account region</p>

<p>account in the process of migrating, they tell me i could be up to a month without being able to use my gamertag wich is pretty darn annoying for something that should be pretty simple, problems since to start happenning after i got a new xbox bought in
 canada, before that it was fine for 3 years after i moved here. Also i noticed looking everything over that last auto-renewal of gold kicked in january first, i got the email like usual that it got renewed, bbut i never looked in my bank account (i have been
 using paypal for a while now) if the money was gone, it wasnt. On my paypal account (wich is in good standing and still works on e-bay) the payment never even tried to go thru so its not their problem obviously. Asked for migration yesterday &nbsp;and a couple
 hours after that i lost gold, wich is fine i guess since it turned out i never paid it, but why 2 weeks after? Also i bought an add-on for a game from a pc and when i got on the xbox it said that the download was assigned to a different console, im thinking
 something happenned when i switched console. Also i put a month gold card (that i got with the new box...) in from a pc (easier to enter the code...) and now on the xbox on my tag i can see the subscription when &nbsp;i check on my account but still not connecting
 to live, it prompts me to upgrade still. I wonder if i should have entered the code on the console straight up, maybe somehow my gold is waiting for me on a different console. I'm not getting any of this, its pretty frustrating. Dosent make sense that it worked
 like this for years and now nothing, all im trying to do is spend money for crying out loud lol. Never had such a hard time trying to give a company my money, maybe its a sign that i should not anymore, heck they dont seem to want to figure this out quick
 after all a spent as they are totally useless on the phone, still telling me to check with paypal. I'm getting into pc games again in the meantime, maybe thats where my money will go instead (and i just bought a new console last month because my other one
 (the 3rd one i had mind you) died of what is starting to look like natural causes to me, just doing what they are meant to do and break after a couple years.

<p>i dont mean to rant, i know there can be some kinks like that sometimes, but the support on the phone is friendly but completely helpless, i dont feel like my problem matters at all so i have little confidence its going to get resolve painlessly like it
 should, so i am a very frustrated at this point. im gonna be without my tag for a month and frankly im not too sure this will fix this as it worked fine for years before and people without the moving factor seem to have had the same issue and from these posts
 it seems like a pretty quick fix just as long as someone takes action and fix this, im pretty sure that telling me to contact paypal anymore at this point is not going to fix this. i tell them i checked with paypal and they are baffle a little and then the
 all tell me to check with them again?!? No one on the phone yet recognized that the problem is on Xbox side so i wonder how its supposed to get fixed, unless maybe if i contact paypal 25 times about this it will magically fix itself lol. That seems to be the
 course of action suggested by phone support lol maybe there is more i need to do or &nbsp;that they could do but the conversation never gets to that, i wish they would at least make me feel like they are looking into this or something when i call support but so
 far no one was willing to look into it more or even try anything and there is only so many hours that i am willing to spend on this, they should listen to me and spend time trying to fix this, i didnt do anything to cause this to happen i dont feel like i
 would have to spend much more time on this that i already have... &nbsp;suppose i'll try once in a while to see if it fixed itself seems to be the best i can do at this point because i cant take anymore of the phone support and seems pretty pointless to call again
 at this point, would just waste more of my time. (i spent MANY hours on this already and im still at square one)</p>

<p>GDN smp91 &nbsp; No no code, just saying that it cant verify payment option, everything seems to be blocked, credit cards dont work either anymore. it systematically decline all payment options i put in, always says that it cant verify it. if i do need to migrate
 the tag i still dont get why it worked fine for 3 years after i moved</p>

<h2>            What is the Least intrusive&#47;free anitvirus software.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I see several posts out there about this issue but I'm going to beat on it one more time - sorry.</p>
<p>Have an old P3 laptop which has been stripped down to basically the OS (XP Home) /&nbsp;the wireless manager &amp; Norton 360 (free from Comcast).&nbsp; No Office, not even a word processor.&nbsp; Just use this PC for email &amp; internet.</p>
<p>Still Norton seems to always keep this PC busy.&nbsp; Looking for a free antivirus/anti-spyware (anti-malware?) that won't be such a resource hog.&nbsp; Are Antivirus' still avail that don't have real-time protection?&nbsp; Should I use one?</p>
<p>Can I for instance use Avast basic (free) with Windows firewall &amp; Windows Defender?&nbsp; Do I really need anti-malware (eg. Malwarebytes)?&nbsp; Isn't the Malware that runs with Windows update once a month enough?</p>
<p>Just want my old PC to run faster.</p>
<p>thanx</p>

<p><br />
You're right--Norton is a poor choice, one of the poorest available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet
</span><span>NOD32</span><span>, if you are willing to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus,
 I recommend one </span><span>(do not run more than one)
</span><span>of the following three:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Avira AntiVir<br />
</span><span>Avast<br />
</span><span>Microsoft Security
</span><span>Essentials<br />
</span><span>&nbsp;<br />
You also need anti-spyware software </span><span>(even if you run a program like Microsoft Security Essentials, with anti-spyware capability built into it)</span><span>.
 I recommend that you download and install (freeware) </span><span>MalwareBytes</span><span>
 AntiMalware </span></p>

    <title>External Hard Drive Issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External Hard Drive Issues</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using a WD MyBook 4TB hard drive with my Xbox One for almost a year now. &nbsp;Just today I thought my xbox was broke because it was stuck on the green loading screen. &nbsp;I starting unplugging cables to see what caused the problem and as soon as I unplugged
 the HDD, the xbox would load properly. &nbsp;As soon as I plug the HDD back in, the xbox goes black(Actually, it's the default picture from my AV Receiver on the screen that shows up, but for arguments sake the screen is black.) . &nbsp;Then I unplug it, the xbox will
 reboot and come to it's main menu without a problem....</p>
<p>...so something isn't working with my HDD. Whether it's the hard drive itself or the Xbox I don't know. &nbsp;Any thoughts on how to fix this?</p>

            <p>Disconnect the hard drive and perform a power cycle (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../power-cycle-console</a>) with the console. Then reconnect the hard drive and see if it begins behaving.</p>
<p>If that's not working, you may wish to try a factory reset on the console with the external drive disconnected. This will delete the contents of the internal drive and you will need to redownload them, but it's probably less content than would need to be redownloaded onto the external hence why I suggest this first. Game saves on the internal will be deleted, but they are backed up to the cloud if you play while connected to Xbox Live, so they will be resynced to your internal drive next time you play each game.</p>
<p>If even that is not working, can you reformat the hard drive either with the console or a PC? This will delete all its contents and you will need to redownload games.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on or if you have further questions about anything.</p>

            thanks for the suggestion, but I'm left with much the same problem: if I go to a folder such as itunes,my music,documents I do get the properties tab but when I clear the read only box I get the error message:an error occured applying attributes to the
 file C:\documents and settings...\itunes library.itl access is denied.&nbsp; I am running XP pro. as far as I can tell I have administrator rights but am not absolutely sure about this being not very tech savy.&nbsp; if I clear read only from other folders I dont get
 an error message, though when I go back to the folder after clicking OK they remain read only... what should I do?
