<h2>            How to find out what my laptops motherboard is&#63; Does windows have an app&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>Is there a way to find out what the motherboard in my laptop is?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have PCWizard 2010 and can install it onto there, but was wondering if a windows application or command does it too. I looked in directxdiag, but I found nothing.</p>
<p>Is it the same in XP?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<h2>            wasn&#39;t thinking and slammed laptop shut-sleep&#47;hibernation issues</h2>
                    I wasn't thinking and slammed my laptop shut. Now when I open up my laptop it doesn't wake up from sleep unless I turn it off and back on. I know I can change the setting in the control panel to "do nothing" when the lid is closed but I'm worried I messed
 up other stuff, usually I can just press the space bar and the screen comes up. Other than that it turns on just fine, only an issue with sleep or hibernation. I have a Lenovo Yoga&nbsp;

no recent changes to registry or drivers though i did install software for my joystick but after the install it didn't affect the audio at all even after restart<br />
audio drivers seem fine as it would give an error log in the events viewer<br />
but today it seems fine i didn't change anything i can talk and hear people at the same time i didn't change a registry file or anything was just a restart but i tried that when the problems started happening and it didn't work.<br />

if anything changes i will update this thread, but currently every thing is fine, i don't know what happened in the first place or how it happened.</p>

We're getting more curious how your font went weird after installing the Fall Creators Update.<br />
<br />
That being said, can you provide us a sample screenshot of this weird font on your PC?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />

            Hi Jacob,<br />
<br />
There are several reasons as to why you're unable to play online and use your Xbox live in your account. Do you have an Xbox live Gold membership? This happens if there's something wrong with your current Xbox live Gold membership in your account. You may check
 it online through <em><strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a></strong></em> and go to
<strong>Services and Subscription</strong>. This will help you to validate if it's still active or not.<br />
<br />
If you have billing related issues with your Xbox live membership, you may contact Xbox Chat Support or request a call on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us#4:0:6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em>.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

<h2>            Wiped HP computer with OEM Windows 7&#47; Upgrade to Professional - and need download to reinstall Windows 7 Professional</h2>
                    <p>I had to wipe my HP computer because of problems and I did not want to copy the system information first and reinstall it back into the computer for fear of copying the virus, or whatever the problem was straight back into the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had HP OEM Windows 7 Home Premium with Microsoft downloaded upgrade Windows 7 Professional which I paid for separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download Windows 7 Professional from Microsoft - no luck. &nbsp;I tried to download Windows 7 Home Premium - no luck. &nbsp;I do have product keys for both the Windows 7 versions. &nbsp;Microsoft would not provide a download for either version and told me to
 contact my computer manufacturer. &nbsp;HP ask me to fill out a complete form for my request, and then dumped the request as soon as I clicked on the 'send' function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were no DVD Windows discs or recovery discs of any kind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was purchased with good money. &nbsp;The Windows 7 professional was purchased with good money. &nbsp;The software is legal. &nbsp;It is all real and honest but I have no way to redeem the software. &nbsp;I have worked for 12 to 18 hours trying to find a way out
 of this frustration but no luck. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the horrific problem with theft, but I am not one of the problems and I would really appreciate some kind of understanding and help with this.</p>

 another Windows 7 Install DVD. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi JWStuart,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your post. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I wiped my computer, everything was wiped including the recovery partition. &nbsp;I tried to get my Win 7 OS back but it was not available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a friend with a retail version of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to get through to HP twice using their contact instructions on their website to order recovery media, but was not successful with that endeavor. &nbsp;Nothing seems to be available for OEM purchasers of Win 7 . &nbsp;I finally purchased a DVD through Amazon
 that promises to provide the needed data to reinstall Windows 7. &nbsp;It does not have a product key, but I do have a product key. &nbsp;I hope it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again. &nbsp;I appreciate your caring.</p>

<h2>            Computer freezes when deleting a file</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Image File Execution -- DLL - Registry Problem </p>
<p>Hello! I have recently started having problems with my laptop, both stemming from internet explore and search protocol tasks. Before I even worry about that, I have a current problem that I feel is heavily related to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem removing a file. The problem, though, is that when I attempt to move this file, it freezes up my Internet explorer process (Explorer.exe), sending my CPU usage through the roof (95 - 100% cpu). The only way for me to stop the extreme
 cpu usage is to restart explorer.exe in task manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is happening with two files in particular. I have tried all the options outside of downloading a secondary program (like Unlocker), but the truth is, I believe that it stems from my explorer.exe process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on an Asus Laptop.</p>
<p>OS: Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>If more information is needed, I will gladly give it.</p>
<p />

<p>VB.Net 2013 program running in 64 bit mode DGV functions correctly in Windows 10 and loads data readable in full screen area as well as with/without scrollbars depending on amount of data loaded</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same program running in 32 bit mode - problem with the DGV. If I maximize screen DGV shows data partially correct to a reduced screen area then the &nbsp;balance of data to far&nbsp;to rigtt and bottom edges text is unreadable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I minimize control form displays ok with scroll bars Until it once again displays unreadable text as scroll moves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Created a brand new target x86 platform program and still had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having similar problems with crystal report vewer</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the graphics driver using Device Manager and it was OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also checked the AMD site and ran their driver check.&nbsp; What I have is correct and the latest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some further checking on my part:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ran program&nbsp;&nbsp;x86 version on a 32 bit&nbsp;laptop windows 10 &nbsp;and the&nbsp;DGV works ok. Full screen is correct as well as reduced area with scroll bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also checked Net Frameworks &nbsp;2-4 same problem in each case on 64 bit developer machine running x86&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crystal Report Viewer is working but the data is being cut off in viewer, i.e., the viewer paper outline is shown full size but the data which should fit inside outline extends past it.&nbsp; When printed it looks just fine so the viewer binding to data (report)
 is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link to post you gave me is the link where it is currently posted</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since driver is ok and both the DGV and CRViewer are experiencing similar problem I suspect the problem lies with the upgrade</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any further advice please le me know</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Desktop Folder not updating with File folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For ease of access I copied one of My Documents folders to desktop. Now, if I add files to this folder, I have to add it to both, the folder on the desktop and the folder in My Documents (not doing this, one of the folders is missing the added file). Is
 there any way to ensure that adding a file to only one folder also adds it to the second folder. Example, If I add a file to the folder in My Documents can it automatically be added to the same folder on the desktop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any advice.</p>

            Hi Peter
<br />
<br />It is not possible in Windows to set things up so when you add a file to a folder, it will also be added to another folder, you would need to use some sort of backup software to do that . . .
<br />
<br />What you can do is put a shortcut on your Desktop to the actual folder in your Documents folder, then you can access that folder from your Desktop and drag files to the shortcut, to put them into that folder . ..

<p>As you are not facing the issue with on-screen keyboard, this must be an issue with the keyboard that you use.

    <title>DLC &#47; XBLA Downloading Problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            DLC &#47; XBLA Downloading Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there, Okay as of 28/05/2011 I cannot download any content at all...</p>
<p>This started to occur after the 13xxx kernel update, Not only did it mess up my DVD &nbsp;drive, It seems to have caused issues with my marketplace too, Don't bother explaining troubleshooting stuff such as Port fowarding, Region, etc I know all of this and am
 fluent in this...and it's not the issue here. When the Escalation map came out for example, I downloaded that. and it downloaded straight away, No problems, However i moved it to my USB storage device for portability and to free up space on my HDD, Today the
 USB got the infamous malfunctioning error, and will not work on anything, PC, Laptop, MAC, PS3, Xbox..none so I think it's safe to say the USB went to the great heaven for flash drives..</p>
<p>So my friend wanted me to come play Black Ops with him, Meaning I would need to download the maps. So I did, However when it gets to 99% gives me the notification that the content can't download. I tried messing about after that, Clearing cache, wiring myself
 up to my router, my main connection, Neighbour's connection etc. Same issue, I really think, the update has caused beef with my console, I tried calling Xbox Support...and i must say, waste of time, I mean how do they even get their job? Are they qualified?
 I know it's scripting they read from, But it's pathetic, I find myself telling them about WHAT SHOULD BE support, and how to deal with the 360 structure, STFS, LIVE/PIRS, Container files etc. I'm sick to my head of wasting time calling up "support" agents
 that really don't know anything.</p>
<p>So i figured I would come and get a response here, Surely some members of the community here have suffered this issue, and can possibly shed some light on my reign of terror? Anything would be great resolving this issue, Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p>Regards Mike</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freezes requiring a switch off and restart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 freezes requiring a switch off and restart</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to windows 10 I have had many system freezes. This means I have to restart by using the on-off button. Screen is frozen, mouse and keyboard inoperable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I thought that the Nvidia video driver was not up to date and made sure I had the latest version as updates arrived each month but the frequency of freezes appeared to get worse. Nvidia didn't have a solution stating that their drivers had been rigorously
 tested with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scoured the web to see if I could find a solution but not found anything that helps me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have remembered the old adage "you get what you pay for" which as windows 10 upgrade is free means it doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't roll back to windows 7 which worked very well as apparently there is a 30 days limit which has expired as I was on holidays for 3 weeks. I didn't want to be beaten but now am thoroughly demoralised.

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to highjack this thread :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also experiencing freezes. A lot of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is <a href="https://www.asus.com/Notebooks/N71Jq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ASUS N71jQ</a>. I did a clean install of Windows 10. A friend of mine also has the same computer and experiences the same freezes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot up a computer it freezes in about a minute or two. The mouse cursor doesn't move, keyboard input is not functioning, if the sound is playing (youtube, movie player, mp3 player) the sound will play the last tone (very annoying). The only sollution
 is hard reset (pressing the power button for 5 seconds).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a workaround that let's me use my computer. And it is as follows (and it's a bit annoying):</p>
<p>Start the computer.</p>
<p>On login screen pres Shift and click Restart (if it doesn't freeze until then - it usually doesn't).</p>
<p>You get to a Recovery GUI. Choose safe boot.</p>
<p>When computer starts up again I press 4 on safe boot.</p>
<p>I boot to windows.</p>
<p>On start screen in safe boot I do a Restart (nothing else).</p>
<p>I boot to windows normally.</p>
<p>I login. Now it doesn't freeze untill I shutdown. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And the next day I have to repeat the procedure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this gives you some insight on the bug. It definitely includes something that is done differently at boot time after you restart in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            And issue is the same for me. &nbsp;You can run sfc, chkdsk, all this random stuff. &nbsp;disable everything in msconfig and start-up, remove your nvidia gfx card, unplug all your devices and disable all non essential services and it still happens... &nbsp;if you can
 manage, disable/break Windows update and Windows defender (install a different antivirus) and watch the freeze go away... &nbsp;They are fully aware of this issue and its because of their mandatory protection service antimalware running during an automatic definition
 update at startup Or Windows update freezing. &nbsp;Trust me it's the only solution. &nbsp;

            <p>Thanks MaxAxtion for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At 70 I like the simple life. I have dumped windows 10 and reinstalled W7 which was stable and worked well with all my installed software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have known better than to fall into the trap that something for free would have any real value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem reoccurs under W7 then all points to Nvidia driver updates so maybe I will dump that card as well if I can't find an old driver from 6 months ago somewhere and disable automatic updates. We shall see!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the previous century I trained beginners in MicroCadam and my student made some quite weird moves during the lessons which caused the software to crash. I had the opportunity to spend some time with the software people in Burbank who said that "no one
 makes those moves normally" and new to our list of bugs to solve. If a bug comes in the top 100 we solve it and the major users (corporations) get the priority.
</p>
<p>I won't hold my breath that my W10 problem will get solved and probably never know if it has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers Opa Don </p>

            <p>Hi, I'm not 70, little over half of that and I also enjoy simple life. I'm back to W7.</p>
<p>I installed it, then updated it to about 1st July 2015, and ignored all updates after that (the new telemetry stuff that came from W10 down to previous versions). Now I have windows update disabled and it works fine. No Win10 for me in this lifetime, still
 I don't like the idea of installing Linux, so that's it for me.</p>

            <p>I made the mistake of doing the 10 upgrade on 5 August, on my brand new Surface Pro 3. After finding one major issue after another I used the facility provided with Windows 10 to roll back to Windows 8.1. I then did a system restore to get rid of major errors
 that 10 left after uninstall, like that no program would stay running once opened! Now my Surface is running beautifully again on 8.1. The fact that Microsoft put the wind-back within 30 days option into W10 is a bit of a give-away; you guys knew W10 is extremely
 faulty, so why release it before it is worth installing?</p>
<p>I had every one of the Microsoft-identified issues; loss of sleep function, degraded wifi connectivity, delay in browser scrolling, complete inadequacy of the Edge browser, so I didn't get as far as checking if my business files on OneDrive were still accessible.
 I also objected strongly to the amount of Microsoft control I would take on if I did the recommended installation. Almost all of my computing activity would have been reported to Microsoft and my interface would have been modified and controlled directly by
 Microsoft. No Thanks. I unchecked&nbsp;around 15 options in order to do an install which would leave control of my computer to me.</p>
<p>I even had to go into Settings after the W10 uninstall and the system restore, to stop the W10 installation from beginning again! It's like trying to kill a centipede by chopping it up - almost impossible.</p>
<p>I will not install 10 until Microsoft goes through its own list of major faults and fixes them then tells the world what has been fixed. I can't run a business on Windows 10.</p>

<p>No, it’s impossible to create a static hyperlink for Skype for Business meeting request. &nbsp;Most of these meeting requests hyperlink are like: https://meet.lync.com/companydomain/username/<strong>G1R1SDKM(this is a random string</strong>) &nbsp;</p>

<p>It really sounds like the files are corrupted. Do you know how they were created originally?</p>
You will probably have to re-download or re-rip the files. If that's not an option, you can search the web for an MP3 repair tool, but there's no guarantee that the repair will work.

                    Alright, So, I have&nbsp;a laptop I recently upgraded to Windows 10. Everything was fine, until I started getting this error (-1073741819) every time I tried to open up an .exe file, like, whenever I tried installing Steam, it showed up. However, here's the
 mind boggler, whenever I disable the windows audio process in task manager, "audiosrv", everything worked fine! I was able to open .exe files without problem! But then I don't have any audio.. When I enable the process again, I no longer can open .exe files.

I tried all three suggestions, none of them worked. I can't even run anything as administrator, because a millisecond after the window pops up that makes me confirm opening it as administrator, it closes and the error pops up once again. This bug is really
 annoying me.

</p><p>I've find out that my new bought Surface Book i7/16Ram/512SSD can't detect any of external HDD's connected via usb 3.0 HDD Docking station. I've used Inateck USB 3.0 Dual Sata docking station which works on another 3x laptops without installing any of additional
 drivers running window 10,8,7. Please advice is there are any update exists to update my surface book to be able to recongnize an external storages ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-gnomik</p>

            <p>Hello <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/b59bce83-f0e6-4b84-b13d-632b97cb1ded" title="gnomik">

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When did this start happening?</p>
<p>Are you getting the same results with all USB devices?</p>
<p>Do you have better results using the USB ports on Surface?</p>
<p>Have you tried different hubs/docks?</p>
<p>Can you confirm that Surface is fully up to date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards&nbsp;</p>

            <p>This sounds a bit like the problem I am having with a Thermaltake BlacX 5G Duet USB 3.0 hard drive Dock.&nbsp; It can only occasionally read a drive properly and writing to the drive does not work at all.&nbsp; I have other systems in which this dock and any plugged
 in drives read and write just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do attempt to write to the drive, the copy dialog pops up but sits at 0%.&nbsp; Meanwhile, my System event log fills with multiples of the following errors:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Source: disk&nbsp; Event: 153&nbsp; (IO Operation retries)</p>
<p>Source:&nbsp; UASPStor&nbsp; Event:&nbsp; 129&nbsp; (Reset to device issued)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>1)&nbsp; Factory resetting the surface</p>
<p>2)&nbsp; Uninstalling all the USB Hub devices from Device Manager -&gt; USB Controllers</p>
<p>3)&nbsp; Uninstalling the USB Attached SCSI Mass Storage Device from device Manager&nbsp;</p>
<p>4)&nbsp; Trying to update the drivers on the above devices through Device Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer some of John1F's questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When did it start? - I honestly don't remember how long, but I know I had troubles&nbsp;using external HDD docks with my surface book before - I originally attributed it to the device itself&nbsp;</p>
<p>All USB devices? - USB flash thumb drives and other USB devices seem to work just fine.&nbsp; I have an older USB 2.0 HDD dock that exhibits the same problems.</p>
<p>USB hubs on the Surface?&nbsp; Same problem whether the HDD Dock is plugged into the Surface book itself or the Surface Dock</p>
<p>Other Hubs / Docks?&nbsp; I did try this and, amazingly enough, the HDD Dock did work fine when I routed it through a USB hub on my monitor that is plugged into the Surface Dock.&nbsp; This is hardly an ideal workaround, though.</p>
<p>Latest Drivers?&nbsp; I have not gotten to the 2/17/2016 firmware updates.&nbsp; I will respond again if the issue is resolved by the update</p>
