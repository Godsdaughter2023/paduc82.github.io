    <title>Xbox Replacement Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> g0ing ham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Replacement Problems</h2>
                    
<p>Hi im posting here because i have exhausted all other outlets without any help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had purchased a day one console after preordering the first day after E3. I waited in line for hours to pick this up and upon coming home and setting it up, i started noticing many problems.
 The console it self was making a weird 'whizzing' noise as was my power brick. I then noticed my day one controller had loose rb,lb and both trigger buttons, as well as the dpad being springy. I called support the following day and was told mistakenly by an
 employee to send out my entire console with all accsesories and limited edition box, and that microsoft would replace everything. I found this quite suspicious, because after reading the email they sent for shipping it said not to send the box. I had even
 asked the employee about it and he said "its fine, just send it all back."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few days passed, and i had eventually received a package from microsoft. I opened it up to see my xbox one day one box (mangled, with all accessories inside loosely packaged) They had taken
 only the console and sent back everything. At this point i noticed that the kinect which was fine when i purchased the console was severely scratched due to shipping and packaging processes. I eventually received a console, although scratched and clearly refurbished.
 I found it very upsetting that I had console that i had sent in pristine condition and in return they give me a scratched up mess of a console.</p>

<p>I then called microsoft again and after waiting countless hours and talking to managers, software and hardware specialists, supervisors, i was finally able to speak to a manager of hardware specialists
 who instructed me to again ship out each damaged product which now included the kinect. I had to individually package and ship and pay for each package. I requested the manager on the phone to send me reference and packaging emails for each item, just to make
 sure that they know which products i was sending in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After shipping out the three accessories (powerbrick, controller, kinect), I received notices that all three packages had been sent to microsoft, however i only received conformation emails for
 the kinect (from microsoft). I called support yet again asking about the status of my controller and my powerbrick, and to put it bluntly, they had basically lost the other two items. I find these situations ridiculous! I have been waiting to play this console
 for over two weeks. Not only did i pay 499 plus tax for a new console, i also had to pay shipping for items that were broken out of the box, and in return i received a scuffed console and kinect, and two missing accessories. I had called again last week and
 customer service said they have escalated this matter to higher up people, but for some reason they can only contact me by email, and that it takes 3 days for that to happen. It has now been 6 days without any info. I called again today and the service agent
 told me the same thing and made another ticket for the higher up people to contact me.</p>

<p>This has been an extremely frustrating situation for me. For a company of this stature, I find it shocking to see that such matters are not taken more seriously. Im posting on here to see if any
 of you guys can help me out.</p>

<p>At least you got your accessories back im still waiting for mine. They screwed up twice. I don't understand how hard it is for these people not to even follow their own instructions. If I get my replacement back and its defective im buying a ps4. I will
 definitely never buy anything from Microsoft ever again. NOBODY know what the hell is going on. Seriously everything in that company is a big cluster ****</p>

<p>First off I want to apologize for what you are going through. &nbsp;I too spent countless hours going through exactly what you are. &nbsp;Eventually, however, I did receive a working system. &nbsp;I am going to give you my best advice, you may or may not like it. &nbsp;Give
 it a few more days and then contact the support team through chat. &nbsp;It seems to be much faster...I do know that once you get your system, eventually you will forget all of this happened to you. &nbsp;Best of luck</p>

 of bubble wrap and surrounded by crumbled newspaper packed tight, i treated it with love and care. but when the sent it back it was in a *** box and only protection it had was a paper thin fom wrap and 2 fomethings on the sides. they dont care so i just kept
 there box they sent mine in and when i had to send it in again i put in the same box with the same fom sides and paper thin wrap.

<p>I have had much the same problem.</p>
<p>I bought two XBox ones - one for upstairs and one for downstairs. &nbsp;One controller is messed up. &nbsp;The right thumbstick won't move to the bottom right. &nbsp;First I was told I would be sent a replacement, then they wouldn't do that and I have to pay to ship my
 controller in, but would be given 6 months of Xbox live for free for the confusion (two phonecalls and one disconnect). &nbsp;Then I never received my confirmation emails, called again and was told I could only get 30 free days. &nbsp;This has been a nightmare.</p>
<p>Now I am out more of my own money and time, wasted half a Saturday on the phone.</p>

<h2>            Reliability Monitor shows no data, no stability index - Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>Task Scheduler (Local) - RacTask configured as follows:</p>
<p>General: Run whether user is logged on or not, Configured for Windows 7...; Triggers (enabled): At Startup and On an Event; Actions: Custom Handler; Conditions: Start the task only if the computer is on AC power; Settings: Allow task to be run on demand;
 History: Many information items, 5 warnings (Event 135) since 4/23.</p>
<p>In spite of this setup, Reliability Monitor has no data or dates. No stability index is calculated. Sometimes I will get a yellow pane. Once it said "Need to turn on or reconfigure RACTASK" but the link was to the wrong Help page.</p>
<p>Task Scheduler shows that RacTask is running. What am I missing?</p>

<p>======================</p>
<p><strong>History of Windows 7 Ultimate x64 computer problem and its resolution</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Prior History: </strong>For the past year (2009-2010) this computer was plagued by frequent (as many as 5 or 6 per day or sometimes none for a week or so, very erratic) hang-ups. These were in IE8, Word, Excel or Access and required a reboot. Occasionally
 there would be a black screen and automatic reboot. <span>&nbsp;</span> I seldom lost data except in Access form design.<span>&nbsp;</span> When first purchased, I installed Kaspersky as an anti-virus and followed this about 6 months later by AVG.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong></p>
<p>Uninstalled AVG</p>
<p>Installed Microsoft Security Essentials</p>
<p>Uninstalled Spybot because it caused a hang-up after about 75% of scan completed</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Current Configuration:</strong></p>
<p>(Computer runs well with no hang-ups)</p>
<p>AMD Athlon(tm)II x4 620 processor 2.60 GHz</p>
<p>ATI Radion HD 5700 Series</p>
<p>Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit OS</p>
<p>IE8 or Firefox</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From 15 October 2010 through 4 December 2010 no problems with hang-ups, etc.</p>

<h2>            Is Windows 10 Still going to be Supported until late 2025</h2>
                    <p>There are 2 major updates in 2017 and 2018 and the next LTSB is released in 2019 but the codename is still Redstone. The time Feature Updates for Windows 10 would have to Stop is when Mainstream Support ends on October 13th 2020 and then they should have
 Security Updates from 2020 until then the Extended Support end date for Windows 10 (according to all Windows Versions) is 14th October 2025 for All Editions of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is killing off Windows Phone after the end of Mainstream Support for Windows 10 Mobile after October 2018, according to Microsoft Windows 10 Mobile and Mobile Enterprise have no end of extended support date. But Windows 10 PCs will have End of
 Extended Support for all editions?</p>

<p>Hi Jonathan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as the machine is operable, Microsoft will continue to support it with updates. So, if the machine still works 5 or 10 years from now, revisions and updates to Windows 10 will be made available to it. Please note that Windows 10 uses the same life
 cycle policy of 5 years mainstream support and 5 years extended support.</p>

    <title>RPG games and wireless routers&#63; Oh, my&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ragedmx47  say:</h3>
<h2>            RPG games and wireless routers&#63; Oh, my&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So i'm always looking to expand my gaming horizons into new and broadened areas. And one genre i've for some reason had an affinity for is RPG games. For some reason whenever I played one, it really made me use my intellect and had me use strategic thinking
 a lot, which I like to do. My problem is that I know of very few: Final Fantasy 13, Fallout (to an extent), Mass Effect (to an extent), Elder Scrolls. So i'm essentially looking for a few recommendations on a few RPG games to give a spin with via Gamefly.
 I already saw a game called Resonance of Fate at Gamestop and got my interest peaked by it and got that, so I suppose that's a starting point, eh?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, i'm looking to acquiring a new wireless router. If I said my connection wasn't next to crap, i'd be lying. Mainly, the ISP my parents have (SBC Yahoo or whatever) isn't reliable, and the wireless router we have now does the job, but it prevents me
 from doing a lot on LIVE. So I also need recommendations on wireless routers that can not only partially compensate for the crap ISP thats been burdened on me (if a router is capable of that, but I think it can), but also give a solid connection for when the
 fam wants to use the computer and such.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For referencing purposes, I have a Belkin N 150 wireless router, and i'm aware they're...not good for gaming.</p>

<p>I'd recommend Dragon's Age, because as an RPG it can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be (you can put everything on default and just play through the game, or you can customize tons of spells and items if you want to be strategic on hard-modes).
</p>
<p>I have a cheap Belkin wireless router that works well enough, but if your ISP sucks, no router is going to fix that.</p>

<p>While it's not an RPG, I'd recommend Bioshock since it's just a classic game. As for RPGs, I'd recommend LA: Noire, Lost Odyssey (A JRPG from the creators of Final Fantasy), and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and then a close look at The Elder Scrolls V:
 Skyrim, which is probably the most anticipated game of the year. Other games that aren't RPGs that I'd suggest: The Orange Box and Portal 2.</p>

<p>@Moxie (not to sound like a creeper, but I strangely like that name): I played Dragon Age and traded in Origins after owning it for almost 7 - 8 months, traded in 2 ironically after owning it for 2 months. I preferred Origins, that felt more RPGish.</p>
<p>@Cru: I've been waiting awhile for Gamefly to send me The Orange Box, but they sent me Killer 7 instead. But I want to get a look at Noire and i'll definitely look into Lost Odyssey.</p>

<p>Since you already said your internet isnt very good, a router really wont help much at all. &nbsp;But if you want a good router I highly suggest the
<strong>Linksys WRT54G2</strong>. You might even be able to have your parents contact your internet provider and see if they can double your speed. Sometimes its only about $10.00 more a month and well worth it.

<p>Indeed, but what's the pricing for it? I need to be cost effective with what I get, i'm trying to maintain financial balance (as are my parental units). But I shall look into seeing if they could bump the speed, but then they'd probably tell me to pay for
 it since I work.</p>

<p>Its only $50.00 and can be used wireless or wired.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its really the best router out there for the money. In fact the xbox tech forum suggested that one to me a couple years ago when my other router was not working very well.&nbsp; Now we can run anything we want
 on all 4 ports at the same time with no problems at all. Usually we have 2 360s, a PS3, and&nbsp;a PC all going at the same time.&nbsp;

<p>Very well then, if tech support suggested it, then it must be good. I shall scour the interwebs for pricing and probably end up going to Amazon again as I usually do.</p>

<h2>            Windows Error&#58; 2352&#58;  Installation unable to complete.</h2>
                    I frequently get an Error Notification telling me that the installation process which had been going on had encountered an difficulty and could not complete.&nbsp; Error 2352.&nbsp; It also suggests that the problem might be with the package I was trying to install.&nbsp;
 I doubt that is the case because it has happened with many different applications from a wide variety of (researched, certified and trusted) sources.&nbsp; What does Error 2352 relate to and how can I correct the problem?

            I found a way programmatically. Before starting WMP, make sure all registry keys under HKCU\Software\Microsoft\MediaPlayer\Health are deleted. That will tell WMP upon the next startup that it was properly shutdown even if it wasn't.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Is your computer connected to Domain network?</p>
<p>2) If it's connected to Work group then is it connected to private/public network in the network and sharing center?</p>
<p>3) Have you formatted the Hard drive using NTFS file system and checked?</p>
<p>

                    I have just reinstalled Windows 10 Pro for the 6th time in a month. Every time updates get installed I get blue screens with error that the thread stuck in device driver. I have a set of drivers that are stable and every time it updates it breaks. Recovery
 has not worked. The drivers I use it old (Nov 2015)&nbsp;but the new ones are crap and are not stable, and your updates for the system to update it from your site which is even worse. I use this machine for amongst other things for crpto. I&nbsp;have 4 MSI RX 470 cards
 in and they work absolutely fine. So while the machine does not get updates it works.&nbsp;I have read around and&nbsp;a few trends have&nbsp;popped up, one being the driver signing. My drivers are from Radeon but MS and your device driver sign enforcement is making my life
 hell. How do I stop these updates from breaking my PC?

Using Windows 7, cannot print from HP Business Inkjet 2280, previously this printer worked fine with Windows XP.<br />

Suspect a problem with USB Host Controller - gives error message "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems (Code 43)".<br />

            Hi, <br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873%28WS.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a> is what I found on that specific code. One of the troubleshooting steps is to check the the documentation of the device, so have you double checked all the
 settings on the printer and read the instructional manual? Keep in mind that you may need to make changes to the printer itself in order to work with the new OS.
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725873%28WS.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&lt;CODE 43&gt;</a><br />
<br />
Also, I would suggest running the Fix It tool in the Fix It center linked within that thread.
<br />
<br />

<p><span>Hope this helps. Please reply with results. </span></p>

<p>This error arises because you tried to send a message&nbsp;including a photo album. This feature no longer works as a result of changes at OneDrive, where the photo album would have been stored had the changes not taken place. This means that the message is now
 stuck in your outbox and&nbsp;may be&nbsp;preventing subsequent messages from being sent. The outbox is below the account folders in the folder pane:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Remove any unsent messages from the outbox, then compose a simple test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself. Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Tips on how to get better and recipe for winning - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Tips on how to get better and recipe for winning</h2>
                    
<p>Here are some tips on how to get better at this game and a recipe for winning:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Know the map and the spawn points -&nbsp; Just like any other shooters map and spawn knowledge is one of a key to success. People think that the spans are random but in reality it isn't. It's doesn't matter what game mode you play.
 Also, learn the "christmas noob" spots those are spots where most players use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Know your limitation or your team limitations -&nbsp; when you or your team goes into the room take the time to see if players are in a party and check stats i.e w/l to k/d to points/per/min ration it will give you a sense on their
 skill level. As you all may know "stats don't mean anything" but if a team of six or four have w/l over 5,10,20 that usually mean that they as a team is good........if stats don't bother you play them in a game but is loose let's say tdm and your team looses
 by 30kills there will be no "we will get you next map" know your limit and look for a new room that is the same level as you or your team and enjoy. There is no joy in losing</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Play with a team - There are a lot of people looking to play with players with the same skill level as they are. When you see a player that is good try sending them a FR most of the game modes in here rely on team work. Playing
 with a team that communicates goes a long way</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Use your perks and equipment accordingly to the type of match you are playing - don't be that person that uses Flak Jacket and LMG and be the Flag runner on CTF lol</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Choose your Party Host wisely - choose a person with the strongest connection to host your party. I'm sure most of you guys are sick of playing a match and when you are about to win then the host dashboards not only you got cheated
 out of your kills it also gave you a LOST. Tip on how to pull host: make sure you have a good upload and good ping. When you launch the game make sure you and your team are the only people in the lobby 95% of the time you will pull host.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Check you sensitivity - who knows maybe the default setting is to fast or to slow form your game style......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7. Be aware - be aware on what is going on around you....i.e where gunshots are fired, who is dying, how enemies are dead and where your teammates are in the map etc...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8. Accept what you have in front of you: If get in the room and there is lag stop complain and just play it or just leave. Complaining about lag will just mess up your game play and also annoy your teammates. I know lag sucks but
 nothing you can do if your in a middle of the game accept leave and find a diff. room. Good players adjust to what they have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9. Accept that there is/are always someone or some team better than you or your team</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, these are just my opinion yours may vary. If anyone has any comment or something to add feel free.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>**I no longer play GB but I still do MLG variant scrims, Team Comp, or HCTDM...if anyof you guys are interested or just looking for someone to fill a spot pm me w/ the game mode you wanna play. As far as creditability on my advise
 above Im a player that likes to win...I don't care about k/d my goal is my team to win and having fun.</p>

<p>Why are you mad? I think you miss read what I wrote......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. You don't have to have host it's just nice to have host or someone on your team to have host. This eliminate the annoyance of people dashboarding when game is about to be over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Spawn trap? you act like it's an easy thing to do. It takes a good team to spawn trap and also it take a good team to get out of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Where did I say do not go for objective?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. In regards to backing out of room I believed I said "know your limitations" - face it nobody likes to loose if your facing a team that clearly in a full party and say you played them a couple of matches or so and keep loosing why stay in the room? it's
 just mean that you or your team is not ready for that type of competition. </p>

<p>Wow.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Having spawn knowledge doesn't mean you will spawn camp. Do you think you can play Team Comp CTF without knowing where the enemies will spawn and expect to win? Also, on any game mode you think just because you know where the spawns are you think you
 can spawn kill?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. In regards to the objective I have explained on my original post I said "If you use Flak Jacket with a LMG don't run the flags" I DID NOT say don't do any objectives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. I said " these Tips" and my opinion on how to win and get a good win ratio. I did not say if you don't have host you will loose. LOL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Why stay in the room if the teams are completely unbalance? Tell me that....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, these are my tips and opinion. With these things I have shared/learned from Friends that I played with whether it's pubs, MLG scrimz, Team comp ro LAN comes in handy. Up to now I have a win ratio of 25.50 with 5558wins and 218 losses K/d of 3.41 -
 96272kill</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand why you cannot comprehend on what the point this post is. This is to help NEW and casual gamers to step up their level a bit. If you still think differently well go make your own Post then LOL.</p>

                    <p>I used to be able to get to the control panel in windows 10 by right clicking the start icon. When I right click I have a menu of choices but none are the control panel. Is there an easier way to find it?</p>

            "Settings" replaces Control Panel. &nbsp;Eventually the old "1980's style" Control Panel will be removed entirely. &nbsp;But for the time being, you can still reach it by running the command "control" (or "control.exe" if you like) from the Run box, or by making
 a shortcut to it.

<h2>            I am no longer administrator on my own computer</h2>
                    While trying to make my computer more user friendly and stop it from asking permission from administrator to do certain things, I accidentally turned off my administrator rights. I know the admin password but every time it says to enter the admin password
 there is no place to enter it. I have reset my system which deleted 30 apps from my computer, but to no avail. I am still not an administrator. Do I have to reformat the hard drive and start from scratch? Literally everything I have read on how to regain your
 admin rights requires you to log in as an admin. Well even though I have the admin password I have no way of logging into that account. MS Should seriously begin make these admin passwords a non default item. MOST end users do not care about admin rights nor
 do they have an administrator. Self important IT coders feel the need to have these privileges built in and set as default and they only end up screwing people out of days and weeks of computer time. In the few days I have bee

<h2>            Windows 10 pro is installed but have a windows 10 home license.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, yesterday I started my laptop (who was running on windows 10 home) only to see that I somehow installed windows 10 pro.</p>
<p>It is not activated and it says that I need to activate windows pro.</p>
<p>I don't own windows pro, when I bought the computer it was preinstalled with windows 10 home and the computer says it have a windows 10 home license on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the trouble shooting guide (with the Media Installation Tool and "clean install" to get windows home back but it did not work. It only showed me one option: "Install windows 10 pro".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>

<h2>            Trying to print using lpr lpd, works when printing to a network printer but does not work to a usb or paralel printer</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to print from&nbsp;a VMS system to a printer attached locally to an XP, sp3&nbsp;system, using the unix print services.&nbsp; I set up things on the VMS system to print to the IP address of the PC, and then set up a printer on the PC.&nbsp; If the printer is connected
 directly to the network (and therefore has a seperate IP address) the print services for unix recieves the request and sends it to the network printer.&nbsp; (I'm just doing this for testing, I know it's simpler to print directly in that configuration)&nbsp; but&nbsp;if
 I change the printer&nbsp;connections to where it is directly connected by usb or paralel it does not work.&nbsp; It does work printing from the PC, so I know it's configured correctly.&nbsp; What&nbsp;am&nbsp;I missing to get a print job to go to an attached&nbsp;printer from a unix type
 system?&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any info.</p>
