<h2>            Can&#39;t stop the Automatic Repair - Windows 10 -</h2>
                    Turned my computer on and it went directly to Automatic Repair. (windows 10) It shows two messages. One says Drive C: is being repaired. This procedure can take over a hour. The other says; Drive C is being proofed and repair. Then shows the level it has
 achieved in percent, 52%, then reboots and starts all over again. I have tried to stop the process, with no reaction. Pulled the plug for 5 minutes, but when plugged back in, it starts the process all over again. It is currently running with the same results
 as I have just described. Does anyone have an answer?

    <title>How to reset default font size and appearance in Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reset default font size and appearance in Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    During the last few days, I installed font pack software called Win-Innwa Unicode. I'm from Myanmar. I faced some inconsistency with the software and I uninstalled it. However, the fonts and my UI experiences are remain unchanged with what the software
 did to them.<br />
<br />
How can I reset the fonts and all UI settings to Microsoft default values?<br />
<br />
Is there any Fix-it solution available for my problem?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<h2>            Mad Max pre-order incentive and box art revealed</h2>
                    
<p>I've got to be honest, I honestly thought this game was canned altogether so I was pleasantly surprised to see this article.<br />
<br />
<br />
<em>Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment today revealed new pre-order bonus details for Mad Max.&nbsp;</em><br />
<br />
<em>All those who pre-order Mad Max&nbsp;will receive an additional Magnum Opus car body called “The Ripper,” which packs a powerful V8 engine, upgraded exhaust with custom off-road tires, a ramming grill and a tuned suspension so it can take on a variety of Wasteland
 surfaces. Also revealed today was box art for the game.</em><br />
<br />
<em>Mad Max&nbsp;is set to launch 4th September in the UK for PlayStation®4, Xbox One, PC and SteamOS</em></p>

<p>Unless I'm mixing it up with another game, when it was first announced it was advertised as an Open World Driving Adventure game, some even saying it was a Driving MMO. It will be interesting to see how it actually turns out.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of the Mad Max films so will be keeping a close eye on this now.</p>

<p>I've seen the original Mad Max - it was God awful... SPOILER ALERT: According to the description I read on Netflix, it's about a cop who loses his family and as a result he seeks vengeance against those who wronged him and his family. The thing was, they
 didn't even kill his family until the END of the movie! The rest of it was just waiting for something exciting to happen. How Mel Gibson went from that to Braveheart, I'll never know...</p>
<p>For me, personally, I can't wait to see the new film - it looks absolutely raw.</p>

<p>What?! How can you write such terrible things? Mad Max &nbsp;and the second film The Road Warrior are classics...at least from what I remember...which was a very, very, long time ago...and I was very young. Used to think Starsky And Hutch was a great series too;
 reruns proved I had no sense of taste when I was young. Lmao.</p>

<p>Netflix just discibe the last 20 min .</p>
<p>It's more about the end of oil reign and how "our" world falls apart and turns into anarchy.</p>
<p>I like the original and 2nd movie (less story,more action) but the third....was a mess,with the children and old (wack) legend,"Spielberg style".</p>
<p>But nice to see George Miller bringing a reboot,let's hope for the best.</p>
<p>I really need more infos and gameplay,Mad Max as an open world is a good idea.Can't wait to learn more about it.</p>

            Your Sierra USB dongle seems to be a 3G / 4G wireless Internet modem.&nbsp; It would probably provide wireless Internet access.&nbsp; It does not seems to offer any cellphone style calling features for voice calls.&nbsp; Since you need toe go from your PC to voice /
 landline telephone, you would probably need to use a software like Skype.&nbsp; Skype offers a feature of calling voice / landline telephones.<br />

<h2>            How can I highlight text in an email or a newspaper article&#63;</h2>
                    From time to time I want to highlight a portion of an email or a newspaper article I've found and want to forward. I've received copies of&nbsp;old archived newspaper articles from others where this option is available but can't figure out how to do it from
 current material. Any suggestions?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've just noticed that the&nbsp;documents I've received and partially &nbsp;"highlighted" in yellow have come in as PDF documents. These seem to allow the "highlighting". Don't know if this yellow highlighting option should be available in other types&nbsp;documents or
 not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've&nbsp;noticed&nbsp;this option in&nbsp;old newspaper pages&nbsp;sent to me&nbsp;containing specific articles of interest. The yellow obviously &nbsp;makes them stand out.</p>

<h3> jasonmurray3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Opening Office 365 causes screen to dim &#47; apply blue light filter</h2>
                    <p>When I open any Office 365 application on my PC running Windows 10, the screen automatically dims as if a blue light filter has been applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be independent of the blue light filter settings in Windows 10 (Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Night Light), and I am unable to find anything in the settings in Office 365.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it only affected the displayed Office 365 windows (e.g. Outlook, Word, Excel), I would have no problem with it, but it affects the colour display of all other applications that are running (i.e. web browsers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to turn this feature off/on?</p>

            Hi Jason
<br />
<br />See if the following helps.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<h2>            No Media Players in Windows 10 will play dvd structured movie folders&#47;files</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;On top of all the other problems... CorelDraw X4 Menu Bar Blanked out Text and Background same color and no apparent fix yet. Also the Forced updates, can't creat your own custom Themes nor set how long the background stays on your screen before rotating.
 And the Privacy Policy, (Which Means "NO" Privacy)&nbsp;and on and on....</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I even had to remove the AMD Catalyst Manager and Control Center and Video drivers that were installed in my system as Nero Video 2014 and Nero Recode 2014 crashed every time I started them (in Windows 10). Then Windows 10 reinstalled the drivers and programs
 back some time over night from their site and now Nero is working with the AMD Catalyst installed. I've got another 10 to 15 programs I have yet to thoroughly check out and I am&nbsp;scared as to what else I'll find and&nbsp;what more troubles I'm in for.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Problem Now:</strong><strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My "DVD Structured" Movie's/Files will not play with Windows 10 DVD Player, Windows Media Player, nor&nbsp;Nero ShowTime or any other player installed in Windows 10.&nbsp; Any help would be appreciated.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>They all play just fine on Windows XP MC, XP Home, XP Pro, Windows 7 Home Premium, 8.0, 8.0 Pro, 8.1, 8.1 Pro systems... But not Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I see others have had trouble in 7 and 8 but noting they found out worked for me in 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>One more week and I'm dumping this Windows 10 I believe. I've got 7 systems in my shop and Home Office, 3 For home and another&nbsp;12 systems that I maintain for clients and so far I have recommended they do not upgrade. Going to take it off the 3 systems I
 have it on and&nbsp;wait a few months myself I do believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do Graphics design, Wed design, Video editing, Video design and layouts, etc. etc. and Windows 10 Home nor Pro can match the work we still do with good old fast XP machines "Not Connected" to the network nor our Win 7 and 8 machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why Windows 10 Microsoft??? You Fell The Need to control us all? My computer is not a big phone and I do not want it to be!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry. Just a bit ticked off.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft lx-3000 microphone doesn&#39;t work for me.</h2>
                    
<p>Speakers work great, but my microphone worked for a month, then stopped. Frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, I look at other thread about some lifechat device, uninstalling it.... But This where my problem lies:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong><span>Remove
 and reinstall Lifechat device</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>1. Go
 to&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>-&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;(Classic View) -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>System</strong>&nbsp;icon, and click&nbsp;<strong>Device</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Manager</strong>&nbsp;on the left.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Expand
 the&nbsp;<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. See
 if the first or second entry is "</span><span><span>Lifechat
 Lx-3000 Microphone</span></span><span>&nbsp;".</span></p>
<p><span>4. Right-click
 on&nbsp;</span><span><span>Lifechat

<div>
<br />
</div>
<div><span>Number 2 onwards, my headset isn't in the Universal Serial bus controllers, (infact no audo bus controller thing, isn't in here...) and I can't figure this damned thing. Please help, I really do miss

<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000">Based on the description provided, it looks like you are facing an issue while installing Java on your computer.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">“Error 1316” A Network Error Occurred While Attempting to Read From the File. This occurs due to previous installer left files from the old install behind and those files prevent the new install from proceeding.</font></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000">The fix to this issue ensure that you have a fully functioning Windows installer and also download the latest version of the installer from Microsoft's website and add it to your computer.</font></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000">Check the Windows Installer Service.<br />
<br />
a. Click Start, in the start search box, type Services and press Enter.<br />
b. Scroll down and find the Windows Installer.&nbsp; Double-click “Windows Installer” in the Services list.<br />
c. On the General tab, make sure the service is started under “Service status”.<br />
d. If the service is not already running, under Service status, click Start, and then click OK.
</font></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000">Unregister and re-register the Windows Installer <br />
<br />
a.&nbsp;Click Start Orb, in the start search box, type MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER, and then click OK.&nbsp;
<br />
b. Click Start Orb, in the start search box, type MSIEXEC /REGSERVER, and then click OK. After you run this command, the operation is complete.
<br />
c. Now, try your installation again.&nbsp; </font></span></p>

<h2>            Browse Camo</h2>
                    Since I upgraded to Windows 10, I have pop-ups that are non-stop and make it next to impossible to do anything on any website. I think it is due to Browse Camo being downloaded with the upgrade. I have turned my pop-up blocker on and they still constantly
 pop up. I have tried uninstalling the Browse Camo app and it won't let me uninstall. Has anyone else had this issue? The pop-ups are driving me crazy!

            Browse Camo is NOT part of Windows 10 and was Not installed by Windows 10 !! It has been either installed by a website you have visited or has come bundled with a piece of software you have downloaded and installed.

<h2>            WiFi icon missing from &#34;Network &#38; Internet&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My MSI Laptop is now missing the WiFi icon within "Network &amp; Internet", using Windows10. I've tried the following:</p>
<p>* Reinstalling drivers (this has previously resolved the problem), including restarting laptop</p>
<p>* Disabling and uninstalling via device manager, including restarting laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can only get Internet connection via ethernet cable. There have been no windows updates and according to windows (and separate searches), the Wireless device is up to date. Device Manager says that the Killer Wireless device is "working properly."</p>
<p>
</p><p>My phone and secondary laptop can connect to the router without issue, which means that the issue is with the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wireless Device: Killer E2400 gigabit Ethernet Controller (v9.0.0.48)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hello Scott_CM,
<br />
<br />If the icon is missing probably this more related to the system issue.
<br />
<br />Try the steps below:
<br />
<br />1) Restart your device / turn off and turn on and check Wi-Fi settings. 
<br />
<br />1) Run SFC and DISM -&gt; <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Be sure that OS is updated
<br />
<br />3) Regarding network side
<br />-  Run the Windows network troubleshooter
<br />- Verify that Wi-Fi is available in Device Manager
<br />
<br />4) Create a new windows user profile and check Wi-Fi settings. 
<br />
<br />5) If you know when issue appeared use a restore point.
<br />
<br />Let me know how it goes

<p>Hi Mark,<br />
<br />
Many thanks for the speedy response.<br />
<br />
On your points:<br />
1a) Problem still occurs after restarting etc<br />
1b) Ran DISM/SFC as per the post, and this response was returned:<br />
<br />
Beginning system scan.&nbsp; This process will take some time.<br />
<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
Verification 100% complete.<br />
<br />
Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.<br />
<br />
2) According to windows update "You're up to date"<br />
3) Windows troubleshooter makes no difference, as it can't seem to find the wireless drives at all...<br />
4) Sorry - not tried this.... I don't want to create a new account - i want the existing account to work!!<br />
5) I restored to the last time the WiFi option worked, and the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other options??</p>

            Hi.<br /><br />Noone forces you to use a new account :)<br />You can do it just as an experiment to see the issue is related to system in general or only profile. After this you can delete it.<br /><br />Anyway we still can use in-place upgrade <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install-winpc/how-to-perform-an-in-place-upgrade-with-windows-10/7f0b236e-3c6c-4913-9691-c4baa2a6190a">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a><br /><br />It would help to update system files and fix some errors if they were found.<br /><br />Try this

<p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try creating the user account, but when I logged into the new account, the original issue I noted still occurs. So that option hasn't worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confused about the link, I'm already on Windows10, why would I need to reinstall??</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />An in-place upgrade install involves using the Windows OS installer to replace all the operating system files for Windows 10 on a PC. It is a way to fix most issues avoiding clean installation.
<br />
<br />If you’re using the setup.exe program to reinstall the same OS back over itself, this leaves user files entirely alone, retains many settings and preferences and, best of all, leaves already-installed apps and applications unchanged. It does overwrite operating system files more or less completely. And in so doing, it often repairs a balky or misbehaving OS and returns it to normal, working condition.
<br />
<br />Try it.       
        </p>

</p><p>I did the inplace install, but that didn't work. I also tried:</p>
<p>* updating BIOS driver</p>
<p>* discharging laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of those options worked. Is there any other options?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Default Sound Device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nescio268  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Default Sound Device</h2>
                    <p>I am having trouble outputting the sound from my computer to the correct device.&nbsp; I often switch between the sound being outputting to my TV (connect to my computer via HDMI) and my headphones, but almost every time have issues switching between the two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I open up the default windows "Sound" application that can found by typing "sound" into the search bar or by right clicking on the sound icon in the lower right-hand side and then selecting "playback devices".&nbsp; See picture below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cbd4957-8f70-4779-9fc7-9071d249ce46?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5cbd4957-8f70-4779-9fc7-9071d249ce46?upload=true" height="822" width="650" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I right click on the correct output, and then click "set as default device."&nbsp; As shown above, the headphones are set as the default device in this case.&nbsp; However, this has little to no effect on where the sound is actually output to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, at this very moment, the sound for some applications correctly goes to the headphones, but other applications continue to output to the TV (SONY TV&nbsp; *00-C from above, the previous "default device").&nbsp; This is not a driver issue nor are the headphones
 broken, as some applications do output to the headphones and I can hear with them just fine for these applications.<br />
</p>
<p>I am trying to play a game with a friend.&nbsp; I am using Discord (voIP) which correctly outputs to the headphones and I am able to talk with my friend.&nbsp; However, when I run a game in steam, it keeps outputting the sound to the TV, not the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, how can I set where the sound output for ALL applications goes to?&nbsp; Instructions online point to the application shown in the above picture, but this certainly doesn't appear to be working.&nbsp; All I want is a simple way to set the sound output
 for my computer.&nbsp; I don't understand why every time this is so hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting steam/the game I am playing multiple times but it continues on outputting the sound to the TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            Hello Nescio268, <br />
<br />
I'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.
<br />
<br />
Any recent changes made to the system that might have caused the issue?<br />
<br />
Was this always the case when you try to play a game or this issue just recently started after a certain configuration?<br />
<br />
Confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation.
<em>(Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)</em><br />
<br />
Check for any pending updates on both software you're using. <br />
<br />
Make sure all drivers are all up to date. I recommend manually downloading the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website to make sure the one installed on your PC is updated. Outdated or incompatible drivers could cause issues such as this one.<br />
<br />
Moreover, best to also check with the community forum of Steam regarding this issue as some had the same experience with the audio.<br />
<br />
We will keep an eye out for your response.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />

<p>
</p><p>No recent changes to the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe this is a new problem.&nbsp; I recently began switching between sound outputs more often, so have noticed the problem more, but have had similar issues for quite some time (1 year or more).</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS Info: version 1709, build 16299.248</p>
<p>
</p><p>All related software up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are up to date as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any specific steam forum discussions you are referring to?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I just want to clarify something, to make sure I am understanding the windows "sound" app correctly.&nbsp; If I have set the headphones as my default device (as shown in the picture above) this means that all output from the computer should go to this device,
 correct?&nbsp; The fact that this is not happening makes me think it is not a problem with specific programs (steam, etc.) but with the system itself (windows).&nbsp; Similarly, since some apps successfully output to the headphones, I don't understand how this could
 be a driver issue, as I would anticipate a driver issue to more of an all-or-nothing bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know some apps allow you to customize sound input/output within the app itself, as opposed to within windows.&nbsp; I suppose it is possible that some apps (like the game) defaults to the TV for sound output while others default to the headphones, which would
 explain why different apps are outputting to different outputs.&nbsp; If this is the case, how do you tell windows to output all sound to one source?&nbsp; I thought that was the point of the "sound" app?</p>

            Noting that you've been experienced this for more than a year, looking on all possibilities would need to be confirmed, this includes verifying for driver issue.<br />
<br />
That being said, taking into account the software you're using, please be advised that each program or application with their own audio settings will have an option to select playback device.<br />
<br />
Have you considered configuring the audio output of Steam or the actual game?<br />
<br />
Your headphones are using Realtek (High Definition Audio Device) and Sony TV is using NVIDIA High Definition Audio; connected through HDMI. This would set it as default unless configured through system, which you did. But do note that it could still interfere
 with the functions as these two are separate or independent sound drivers required for each component.<br />
<br />
Moreover, you may also try to disable Sony TV on the Sound app <em>(right-click &gt;
<strong>Disable</strong>)</em>. See if that would do any changes.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />

<p>I have all the cables connected, but I only got one audio optical cable to connect my PX5 receiver to my XBOX 360. I can hear chat through my headphones but not gameplay. Don't I need a 2nd audio optical cable to connect the receiver to my TV to hear gameplay
 in the headphones too?&nbsp; If so, is the PX5 supposed to come with 2 optical cables?<br />
<br />
<br />
I got a refurbished unit that did not come with instructions.</p>

<p>Have you tried this?</p>
<p>Optical cable from reciever to xbox.</p>
<p>Or if possible optical from TV to Reciever if this isnt possible i think the px5s have analouge inputs, Try that straight into your tv, (rca cable)</p>
<p>The second optical port on the reciever is a pass through input. (like the hdmi in and out on a xbox one)</p>

<h2>            Games app keeps asking to confirm identity</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, I keep having to enter my password every single time I open my games app. It usually prompts for this right after a restart. I've tried uninstalling, reinstalling, but it prompts to confirm my "identity" every time.&nbsp;This was recent,
 too, maybe coinciding with an update to the app... not sure, though.&nbsp; Any ideas? This is extremely frustrating to have to enter the password every single time.</p>

1) No, I'm using the same Microsoft account for everything.<br />
<br />
2) It is now, but wasn't the only app prior to a complete reinstall. The mail, calendar, messaging, and people apps were doing this before the reinstall. I tried just using the refresh feature, but it would result in the same issue with all the apps, which
 is why I opted for a complete reinstallation of Windows 8. Those apps seem to be fine now, though.<br />
<br />
3) Not that I'm aware of. The only thing I did change, but has been changed for a good while, is 2 factor authentication. I already trusted my computer once and it has been syncing, etc. since. Do I need to do something beyond this for certain apps to work
 correctly? I've reinstalled my machine a few times before and never had this issue with the games app. Something new is amiss, either with my account or with the updated app.<br />
<br />
I will try the methods you posted above and see if that resolves anything. I will post any results here.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            I ran the app troubleshooter and attempted to look for updates (there were none), which worked briefly. About 30 mins later, the app asked to confirm my identity by entering my password again. This is getting frustrating, since it wasn't happening before.
 I should note that the started happening on another machine at a relative's home and is in no way connected or networked to my PC or microsoft account.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I can't help but suspect a faulty update or something similar. A windows update a while back actually corrupted my component store, which I had to use the DISM function to restore--others had the same issue with this update, too. I don't know if that would
 affect anything with the games app, though.</div>

            <p>I actually tried a complete reinstall of Windows, which resulted in the same thing. I attempted a refresh before that, too. That's why I'm trying to figure out what is causing it and why I don't think it is an issue with my installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing to note that I did do was to download a new app and&nbsp;link one of the games I have on the Games app to my account. It seems to stay logged in, for whatever reason, at least for now. The only other thing I did was to open both the Xbox Music and Xbox
 Video apps (which never experienced a problem). I haven't had the error after several restarts. However, if a fix involves downloading a new app and/or linking a game every time I need to stop this, it is not very practical.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: spoke too soon. The app just prompted me yet again to confirm my identity before trying to play a game or enter the Games app.</p>

            Now all store apps are doing it!!! What is going on? I'm about ready to just install Ubuntu or just downgrade to Windows 7. I really don't want to have to enter a password every single time I open one of these apps. I don't mind entering it while purchasing
 something (I prefer it that way, actually), but just to open one is ridiculous.

    <title>windows 7 reinstalling gs wavetable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john e. lawton  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 7 reinstalling gs wavetable</h2>
                    A virus--downloaded in software from a "world-giant"--wiped out parts of my registry. Restoring from backup or system restore points wasn't possible. Part of what the virus did was to break all the programs connections to the MS GS Wavetable. I've managed
 to fix Media Player and most other software, including those that play *.mid files. But, Noteworthy Composer won't play sound as the GS Wavetable is still "missing". How do I restore it?

            Yes, Srimadhwa,
<div><br />
<div>To begin with, it is a "problem" and not [just] an [associated] "issue". In my awareness, Microsoft, back around '96, allegedly started this misuse of "issue" when "problem" is required. I believe it goes back even further to when Microsoft fixed the problems
 with the Office suite after telling WordPerfect it would fix the Windows 95 problems that were preventing WP 6.0 from running properly after MS had fixed the competing Office's/WIN 4.0 problems (4.0 = 95). &nbsp;WordPerfect was struggling to move from the very
 commercially successful WP 5.x, which ran on DOS, to the very unsuccessful 6.x versions. 6.0 would not run because of too many bugs on Windows 95 which MS was reluctant and slow to fix for WordPerfect's, an MS competitor, benefit. In effect, what Microsoft
 did was tell WordPerfect, "6.0 not running on WIN 4.0--AKA Windows 95--is your issue, something we will discuss. But, it's not our problem and we won't fix it until we want to, when we've gotten a competitive advantage." Sadly, the US Justice Department failed
 to fix that largest problem--Microsoft competing unfairly--in the anti-trust law-suit. Now, consumers, like me, are forced to deal with a monopolistic behemoth that is irresponsible and--in terms of expeditious-effectiveness--unresponsive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A problem is a situation that requires rectification--something that needs to be fixed--for someone's or something's benefit. An issue is a topic for discussion. They are not synonymous. While there is almost always an associated issue--"What exactly needs
 to be fixed and how does one go about fixing it"--that corresponds to any problem, problems and issues are not synonymous.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>The larger problem is that Microsoft has failed</b>, with Windows 7 and presumably with Windows 8, to: (a) provide adequate support for other programs (other than Windows Media Player) ability to play MIDI files equally well as they did in prior versions
 of Windows, and (b) Microsoft, all too often, offers some relatively useless "support" like, "Did you run a virus-scanner?" (Now, in MS's defense, I should have stated above that a virus-scanner told me that the computer had a virus, that the virus had been
 removed, etc.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>The smaller problem is--to begin with, to start to identify the issues that need to be discussed along the way to a problem-solution--that the
<u>M</u>icrosoft <u>GS</u> <u>W</u>avetable <u>S</u>ynth is not working for all programs. For example, it works fine (after some of my own "repair-work" on top of that performed by ASC U6, repeatedly running Microsoft "FixIt" to uninstall affected programs--see
 parenthetical comments below, at end) with Windows Media Player 12.0.7601.17514, which plays *.MID (MIDI) files correctly. MuseScore Ver 1.3 Revision 5702 will also play *.MID files correctly, with its output mapped to "<u>M</u>icrosoft
<u>S</u>ound <u>M</u>apper", when using MME; MSM uses--as far as I know--MS GS WS to play MIDI files. NoteWorthy Composer (and NoteWorthy Player)--my primary program for practicing drumming and for composing and arranging--using Microsoft MIDI Mapper (MS GS
 WS does not appear as an option) for output, will not play MIDI files. MMM, as far as I know, uses MS GS WS. I don't know whether "<u>M</u>icrosoft&nbsp;<u>S</u>ound&nbsp;<u>M</u>apper" is a "misspelling" of "</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>The Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth still appears to still be on the compute</b>r (Dell Studio XPS 9100, 18 GB RAM, 0.45 TB internal RAID drive with 3 TB external RAID drive, used for live recording, mixing, and production of audio (and occasionally video)
 recordings). For example, when the audio output device is set to the M-Audio Delta Audiophile 2496 (my primary, "Good!", sound-card, capable of 96 kHz, 24-bit recording), Sonar Home Studio 6.0 shows "Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth" as an available output for
 MIDI files, but won't play through it. (When I change to the HDMI/Sony TV as output device, the MS GS WS disappears as an output in SHS 6.)</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Prior to submitting the above, and based on the info from the scan, I scanned the computer with Advanced System Care Ultimate 6
</b>which found, under "Items Detected:" &nbsp;"C:\Program Files\Harman pro\Audio architect 1.00.0\Explorer.dll", with a partial "Threat Type" description of "Gen:Heur,M...". I didn't expand the ASC U6 window before capturing the screen, thus, I cut everything off
 after the "M". But, as I recall, it's a "Gen"eral, "Heur"istic (self-learning) malware. &nbsp;(The Explorer.dll malware was 1 of 3 "Items", all of which were duplicated on a backup drive, all of which ASC U6 reported as being "fixed". So--as it was duplicated on
 the backup drive, it was actually 2 of 6 items, all of which ASC reported as fixed later. 2 of which were all old--15-20 years old, "dead" (unused) *.exe-s which prior scans using everything from McAfee to Norton to AVG to ASC didn't find previously, 2 were
 IDed as "C:\Windows\Softwaredistribution\Download\2e92169c8c3dcce..." and "E:\9100Backup\Memeo\C_\Program files\Harman p..."--both were cut-off at the ellipsis when I "copied" the ASC U6 window for forwarding to Sweetwater.com.</div>

<div><b>Furthermore, restoring the registry from backup wasn't possible</b> as the system had backed up too many times and no good registry was available. Nor was restoring from restore points possible (with which I've only, very rarely had any "luck") as--on
 the advice of Sweetwater.com, to optimize the performance of Pro Tools (first MP8, now 10.3.6 and 64-bit 11.0), I've disabled (and won't reenable, due to the past lack of success) restore points. I've got an old system-image on DVD--made when the computer
 was new and only had factory-installed software on it, but, I hesitate using it as I'd have to reinstall everything that I've since installed (which is essentially what I'm having to do anyway, see parenthetic paragraph below).</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>I have downloaded Windows Defender</b> and will run it from a CD--once I get one made, later. I'm assuming, given the brevity of the instructions, that I'm supposed to disconnect from the Internet (and any other network, thus, from my LAN) and run the
 program from CD which will reboot the computer. Unless I'm incorrect, simply burning an *.exe to a CD will not make it a bootable CD and the WD directions are typically "Microsoft vague".</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>An interim step will be booting to Windows 8</b> and seeing if I can install
<u>N</u>ote<u>W</u>orthy <u>C</u>omposer/Viewer there to see if it runs correctly, if Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth is present in Windows 8. (I need to spend more time using 8, anyway.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll post the results of the WD run, and of the WIN 7.1 (Windows 8) NWC installation/test, later.</div>
<div><br />
<div>(<u>This is just FYI--please don't address this additional, greater problem here.</u> The Harman Pro/Audio Architect embedded malware--I seem to remember ASC U6 describing it as a 'virus', but, I may be mistaken--also "broke" most of the major program-/suite-installations
 on my computer, apparently by corrupting the Windows Registry. Rather than those programs/suites starting normally as they did in the past, MS Win7 would pop up an error window stating that the program wasn't installed properly because installation files couldn't
 be found, wanting me to locate them on the drive. I'm still in the midst of what will probably be a 6-month process to "fix" the computer--it'll never be the same--by uninstalling, using FixIt or Advanced System Care Uninstall--or both as has been necessary
 on occasion, and reinstalling all the affected programs/software suites, including, but not limited to, Microsoft Office 2010 (home/3-pk version), Alibre Design, Pro Tools 10 and 11, several Visual Studio Express 2012 components, and many other programs used
 on a daily to weekly basis. Those programs that rarely get used, those that get used once a month or so, I have yet to even test to see if they'll start. The partially fixed computer still has a problem whereby installations stop, popping up an error window
 which states that a missing installation file needs to be found--often "VCred.exe" or some such--but, the path below the textual message points directly at the missing file and I simply have to open the file dialog, and click OK to get the installation to
 proceed normally.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sign me "extremely aggravated . . ."</div>
<div><br />
<div>PS Audio Architect has been uninstalled and won't be reinstalled until Harmon "gets its act together" and publicly addresses the fact that they "e-shipped" software with embedded malware. JEL</div>

            <p><strong>To (Whomever:</strong> My apologies, Hotmail--as it so often does--put your e-mail in my deleted folder rather than my junk-mail folder&nbsp;and then failed to move it to the inbox. Fortunately, I was able to "skim" it before&nbsp;Hotmail&nbsp;lost it. (Hotmail--as
 it so often does malfunction--regularly puts e-mail from senders in my contact list into my deleted folder, instead of my inbox--but those are a&nbsp;separate set of associated issues/problems that need to be addressed elsewhere)):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yes. I ran a virus scan.</strong> <strong>Actually, I ran three,</strong> one--before I wrote the original request for help--using Advanced SystemCare Ultimate, then two (quick and full) with Windows Defender Online, afterward. All three scans were
 negative (all AVG scans, since the discovery of the Harman-/Audio Architect-installation of that now removed malware, have been negative). That doesn't necessarily mean that I don't have malware on the computer; I have something that occasionally keeps popping
 up a browser window, when I hit the space bar and other keys accidently/simultaneously, trying to get me to reinstall a media player that isn't installed&nbsp;and won't be installed. (I have yet to go through all the browsers and disable and uninstall all add-ons
 to see if that solves that particular set of associated issues and problems. It appears that the various agencies, ioBit, AVG, Microsoft are yet unaware of that particular problem and associated issues.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The good news</strong> is that I have moved NoteWorthy Composer over to Windows 8 (actually, WIN 7.1 for those interested in such things) where it runs fine, where Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth, along with Microsoft MIDI Mapper and Delta Ap MIDI are
 all shown as options for playing MIDI. Thus, since all my NWC "practice" files (to which I play along with, using a pair of drumsticks and a practice pad) are on a server (tho', I could read them off the Windows 7 "drive" from Windows 8, if I desired), I can
 now practice again (tho', I need a--free--spreadsheet for&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;to record my practice as my Office 2010 suite is on the&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;SP 1 installation/"drive").</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The bad news</strong> (which I'm hoping you'll immediately rectify) is that&nbsp;Microsoft has yet to tell me:</p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the Windows 7.0&nbsp;*.dll which implements the Microsoft GS Wavetable Synth functions.</li><li>The normal location of that *.dll.</li><li>How to reinstall that *.dll if it appears to be missing or corrupted (both unlikely or the other programs probably would not be capable of using the MS GS WS).</li><li>The "usual" type and content of registry entries that programs use to point to the MS GS WS as their default MIDI player.</li><li>Anything else I need to know, in order to:</li><li><strong>REINSTALL THE MICROSOFT GS WAVETABLE SYNTH,</strong></li><li>and clean up my registry. (The fact that other programs on the Win 7 SP1 installation/drive can see and use the MS GS WS implies that cleaning/fixing the NWC registry entrees--where reinstalling MS GS WS might not clean/fix those entrees--where uninstalling
 and reinstalling NWC hasn't fixed those entrees--is necessary.)</li></ol>
<p>Thank you.</p>

 as an option for MIDI playback&nbsp;in NoteWorthy Composer 2.5.5. I'm looking forward to an answer so I can post it on the NWC forum, in abbreviated form, as the above "Question" and "Replies" are obviously too long for most other NWC/Windows users.

            I'm with you, No Freaking consideration that many, many people use their product not as a fetish device for getting Uncle Fudlo's E-mail and pictures of the Kids at the&nbsp;Cannibal&nbsp;Soccerfest in whatever, but as a device for actual WORK in the Media Arts,
 MIDI, Just celebrated it's like 40th anniversary, and I keep "Losing " my MIDI drivers and to top it off, theres no one to even&nbsp;acknowledge&nbsp;one of the most&nbsp;thorough&nbsp; most stable, and frankly when working , useful and iron solid pieces of code that's why it's
 still used. Even Creative, which used to be a decent company IMO, I paid extra for a new sound card when I decided to&nbsp;get&nbsp;new desktop, 64 bit, windows 7 12 gb ram ssd/hdd, all the mod cons, with room, because the way the trend seems to be is these little masturbatory
 phlobletputers, which a far too overpriced, and etc.. But this&nbsp;super&nbsp;cool&nbsp;card Didn't&nbsp;come with any midi&nbsp;functionality&nbsp;or ASIOs, I realized after the fact that all it's for is for fat lazy Video game playing folk to have great surround sound and be able to
 talk to others of their kind in Klingon or whatever while they play...Un fortunatly, I don't care for the condescending attitude of Mac folk, their nerd fascist policies and their over priced nonsense, If had the means to build some uber awesome pro studio,
 then yeah maybe money wouldn't be an issue, but Artists and musicians need to have stable machines not etch&nbsp;a sketch&nbsp;tablets, and to "Lose" MIDI and have no Care or remedy for what, being like i said that even the earliest computers used midi, is just insulting
 to the Musicians that ditched mac to come to windows or have never used them. easiest fixes this is the second time, once on another machine, that this has happened with Win 7
<div>Windows folks....MIDI...It's&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;it should be simple to have a patch. you actually do have a bug here...I'm not going to use Windows 8, I care not one bit for touch, I hate the interface, Windows 7 is a good platform that could be better, IF YOU
 ACTUALLY LISTEN TO YOUR END USERS...If it comes down to it and all you and MAC want is a bunch of hunch backed squinty drones looking at your stupid products on stupid small devices &nbsp;I&nbsp;guess&nbsp;I'll&nbsp;have to go with Linux or something, The Trend toward smaller
 portable devices is a&nbsp;joke&nbsp;of disposable toys, when you need to create high quality content... what am I saying Microsoft, you don't care...But the Surface or anything with windows 8 will not be in my&nbsp;possession. I really wish That TEAC Or Studer Or Revox
 would start manufacturing reel to reel Machines again, I'd dump all but the most&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;Computer recording stuff, and go back to analog, And If I come across an unbeatable price for an 8 track rtor deck I might use that and then get a new outboard hardware
 Multitrack (Thank you Tascam,Zoom for still making those)... FIX The MIDI&nbsp;</div>

 so I'm trying ever so hard to see the good but it's like the slower brother of 7 who goes force them to joinhome on the other buses....I tried to help out with windows 8. Now firmly convinced I do Not want it... It's Ever present in your face. Somebody make
 a good os that stays out of your way, is ultra stable, doesn't have JAck or some other unexplained linux what not, and when touched by an Apple head It emits Waves of stupid that get people to join a UFO cult. So Still Kinda suckin here windows, N<span>ot

 they're not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether one loves it or hates it, Windows is here to stay. I'm in the process of replacing WIndows 7 with Windows 10 ((Windows 9 was soooooooo buggy, SleepySteve, that Microsoft didn't release it)). I"m keeping WIndows 7 on one computer just for fun, but
 mostly because I need a "relatively stable" 7 setup to run stuff that won't run on 10 as I can't afford--to Microsoft's chagrin and minisculely lower profits--to buy Office and everything else over again every time MS changes the OS number.</p>

 from Recovery Mode Console. None of this worked so I also copied the ntdll.dll from the laptop and it still didn't work!</p>
<p>

<p>-scf /scannow which said that there was another repair pending or something.</p>

            <p>Hi wmanikowskki,<br />
<br />
<span>This issue <span>
may occur when you have other </span>Windows Live programs on your computer that conflicts with the installation you are attempting to complete. To further troubleshoot this you might need to perform a Windows update, uninstall using CMD line parameter, delete
 the Windows Live folder, disable third party firewalls and reset browser to factory settings. Please follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Perform Windows update<br />
a. Visit </span><a href="http://www.update.microsoft.com/microsoftupdate/v6/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>Windows Update</span></b></a><span><br />
b. Verify if the computer requires updates, and install updates if necessary <br />
c. Restart the computer after you install updates for the changes to replicate<br />
<br />
<strong><span>2.</span></strong> Uninstall Windows Live Essentials programs that are currently installed on your computer.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/messenger-wlinstall/how-to-uninstall-windows-live-essentials-via-cmd/3d26c7ea-faf0-437a-88b0-c5bdd3dd31ec"><strong><span>How
 to uninstall Windows Live Essentials via CMD line parameter</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>3.</span></strong>&nbsp;Browse your computer to C:\Program Files then delete the Windows Live folder if available</span></p>
<p><span>C:\Program Files\<strong><span>Windows Live</span></strong>
<br />
C:\Program Files\Common Files\<strong><span>Windows Live<br />
<br />
</span></strong><b>Note</b>: If there is more than one Program Files folder upon opening C drive, then double click on
<b>Program Files x86</b> instead.<br />
<br />
<b>4.)</b> Temporarily disable 3rd party firewall programs (i.e. McAfee, Norton, ZoneAlarm, etc.)<br />
<br />
<b>Note: </b>Disabling the firewall may make your computer or your network vulnerable to attack by malicious users or by malicious software such as viruses. Please make sure that you do not have any other Internet Explorer window open or any other programs
 running while trying to install Windows Live products. Once, you are able to install the Windows Live programs, please turn your firewall back on.<br />
<br />
<b>5.)</b> Reset browser to factory settings:<br />
<br />
<b>For Internet Explorer: <br />
</b>a. Open <b>Internet Explorer</b> <br />
b. Click <b>Tools</b>, and then click <b>Internet Options<br />
</b>c. Click the <b>Advanced</b> tab <br />
d. Under <b>Reset Internet Explorer Settings</b>, click <b>Reset<br />
<br />
</b>If you are using other browsers, please look for steps on how to reset your browser to factory settings via
</span><a href="http://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>Bing</span></b></a><span><br />
<br />
<span><strong>6.)</strong></span><span> Run this Fix it:
</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall</span></a></span><span>
 which helps with fixing problems with programs that couldn’t be installed or uninstalled.<br />
<br />
<strong>7.)</strong> Download and install Windows Live Essentials from </span><span><a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials?os=other" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>Windows
 Live Essentials Version 2011</strong></span></a><br />
</span><span><br />
</span></span><span>Let us know what happens afterwards.<br />
<br />

            Hi Abby, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Windows is pretty good at managing your battery settings based on your PC's needs. You can click the Battery icon in the bottom right corner of your screen to change the slider to better performance or better battery life, depending on how fast you need your PC to perform.
<br />
<br />There isn't really any better settings for battery life, as the best settings depend on what you're doing with your PC at the time. If you want to maximize battery life, you can move the slider all the way to the Better Battery end. Otherwise, the other side of the slider will improve PC performance.
<br />
<br />If your laptop's battery is going flat while it's plugged in, the charger is probably faulty. You might need to get it checked out by the manufacturer.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

    <title>Training Windows 10 speech recognition with display language that is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelosiecki  say:</h3>
<h2>            Training Windows 10 speech recognition with display language that is not supported</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am actually using Voice Attack software to use voice commands in computer games. This software uses windows speech recognition software. The speech recognition is really easy to install in Windows 10, so I installed another language (English - US) in Region
 and Language settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I do not like the accuracy and I know I can train the voice recognition in windows 10. The problem is that according to the internet, I need to get past the "Voice recognition" application, but instead of letting me train it, it says that speech recognition
 is unavailable with my current display language (it is Polish actually).<br />
<br />
So why can I install English speech recognition, but I cannot get past training it? Is this some kind of a bad interface design, so nobody from MS thought of letting people train a language recognition software they allow to download?
<br />
<br />
Maybe there is some cool command line way to run the speech recognition training, bypassing the "unsupported in current display language" message?<br />
<br />

            Hi Michael
<br />I am a windows user and member of this community. I am not an employee or representative of Microsoft.
<br />I have been looking into this issue for you in an effort to help you find a solution. I wonder if the solution found here might work for you <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fix-speech-recognition-shows-change-recognizer-language-error-in-windows-vista-and-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fix-speech-recognition-sh...</a>
<br />This tutorial applied to Windows 7 but I would think that it should still apply to the Windows 10 system. Of course it is entirely up to you if you wish to give it a try. If you do try it please let me know if it helps.

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I tried all of those :)</p>
<p>This one is a different error, and they can access the Speech Recognition app, when for me it only shows that I cannot use it.
<br />
The error is exactly like that one:<br />
https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-desktop/i-have-no-advanced-options-for-speech-recognition/99eaab45-d419-4d7d-b7a0-00c62969cb04<br />
<br />
But all solutions I was able to find always solve the same problem : the message appearing for owners of english windows, when this should be obviously allowed for them. Not for non-english (and no speech engine) windows who since they are allowed to install
 english speech recognition want to train it :)<br />
<br />
But thank You for the trouble anyway :)</p>
