<p>Here's the procedure to change the default path for installing software in Vista:<a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/03/23/how-to-change-default-windows-installation-path-to-your-desired-path/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/03/23/how-to-change-default-windows-installation-path-to-your-desired-path/</a>.&nbsp;
 In this case, you would choose a location on C: drive (perhaps C:\Program Files if that is still there - or create that folder if it isn't).&nbsp; Make it a new folder from the root directory - don't bury it in some other folder or even deeper.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Unable to uninstall Citrix XenApp Web Plugin file - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to uninstall Citrix XenApp Web Plugin file</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everyone.<br />
I am having difficulties trying to remove an existing Citrix XenApp Web Plugin file.</p>
<p>I have looked at the previous thread that was discussed here some time ago which had a link to this site -<a href="http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX121917" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.citrix.com/article/CTX121917</a><br />
Now the issue is that I require Windows Installer but it appears it has been removed from the Mircosoft site due to corruption&nbsp; of other files.</p>
<p>So my question is, how can I uninstall this program and reinstall a new version, when the old version will not allow me to uninstall it?</p>
<p>I have located the entry within the registry editor. Is there a way to remove the Citrix Program from the Registry?</p>
<p>Appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Lee</p>

<p>Are you able to see this plugin in the Manage Add-ons section of your browser, can it be disabled or removed via that?&nbsp; In IE, see Tools/Manage Add-ons.</p>
<p>Does this program have its' own uninstall .exe that you can right-click on and select the "Run As Administrator" option?</p>
<p>Have a look at some of the third party uninstallers such as "Revo" that are on the market.</p>

            Yes, this is completely annoying. When the sign in method is PIN, why doesn't W10 give me a numeric keyboard with just 10 numeric keys, a backspace and NOTHING else?

            <p>I am having the same issue and I am perplexed by the nature of this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously had a Surface Pro 3 and I started using the PIN feature at around November 2016 and it worked great. One thing I noted in particular is that the keyboard was actually a NUMERIC NUMBER PAD ON SCREEN KEYBOARD instead of a full QWERTY keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is so perplexing is that when I got my Surface Pro 4 in January 2017, and I set up the PIN feature, the keyboard remains a full QWERTY keyboard no matter what I try to press. There is NO NUMERIC NUMPAD OSK! I don't have the SP3 anymore so I can't produce
 any screenshots, but just ask any SP3 owners to set up their PIN feature and you'll be able to see what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is a bug, unless it's some kind of configuration I've done differently on the Surface Pro 3 than on the Surface Pro 4 which I doubt so (both are clean installs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a product manager seeing this, please get someone to look into this.</p>

            Yes I find it interesting how Microsoft employee's can act so dumb when asked a simple question regarding their interface, they need screen shots and more information when the problem was well articulated. If you have a touch screen and have no choice
 but to log-in, then choose to use a PIN for log-in, a numeric key pad should be provided for the log-in. This mandatory step Microsoft introduced with Windows 10 is awful for those of us who are the ONLY users of the computer but are required by the Microsoft
 software to log-in (to protect us from ourselves apparently). Look, we are already unhappy having to use Microsoft products as it is, you're just making the experience worse with your lame requests for more information. The problem is real and obvious (to
 all except the expert Microsoft employee, wink), just read the other comments to this inquiry. Funny how Microsoft does not reply to Scott X's problem.

<h2>            Lifecam HD-5001 not recognised after latest Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I have just updated to the latest Windows 10 build this morning and my LifeCam HD-5001 is no longer recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft site indicates that there is no driver download for higher than Windows 7 because it should be recognised.</p>

            Doing some research it looks like the webcam (I assume) is a Microsoft product. Try installing the firmware update
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-gb/d/lifecam-hd-5001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Lifecam drivers etc">
on Microsoft's page </a>for it. If that doesn't work right click the start button (in the taskbar) and choose Device Manager, it might be under Imaging Devices, open that and select your camera name then right click, "Update Driver Software". Typically this
 is the problem when devices stop responding. Is it connected to your computer via USB or built in?

            <p>Yes, it is a Microsoft product and in device manager shows up in the USB section as 'Unknown USB Device (Port Reset Failed) but prior to updating the OS had been working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already tried the firmware update option but the software&nbsp;checks for the correct device being connected and fails because it is not recognised.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Yes, I have gone through the process of trying to uninstall or update the driver but the driver details state 'No driver files are required or have been loaded&nbsp;for this device'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I uninstall the deriver or delete&nbsp;the device and then reconnect to re-detecting, I&nbsp;get the same problem of the device being just an unidentified USB device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The page you provide the link to is no use because as originally stated it only references drivers up to Windows 7 and states that for higher versions no driver is required.</p>

    <title>Sculpt Comfort Mouse behaving weird - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dustinbalentina  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sculpt Comfort Mouse behaving weird</h2>
                    I have a bluetooth Sculpt Comfort Mouse connected to a HP Probook 5330m with Windows 8.1 that is up to date.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have been using the mouse good for some weeks until last week when it started behaving weird: Without pressing, touching the blue Windows key, the swipe up command (Switch between Recent apps) is executed. I can feel the rumble going off.&nbsp;<br />
I have Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard installed and disabled the gesture.&nbsp;After doing this I randomly get the swipe down gesture executing. After turning this one off, I still feel the rumble but nothing happens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now I can live without the gestures, but the rumble is making me crazy. When I touch the mouse to start using it, the issue may appear. Just moving the mouse will give me random shakes and vibrates.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Is there a fix for this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks

            Hello,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the response.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The information you asked for:<br />
1. I don't have a second mouse right now to try it.&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. This PC is a development laptop, so I install and uninstall a lot.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Issue reasons:</div>
<div>1. I uninstalled and re-installed and same issue. (More on this later)</div>
<div>2. Maybe, but I am a little skeptic about that</div>
<div>3. Could be</div>
<div><br />
<div>Methods:</div>
<div>1. Haven't tried that</div>
<div>2. Tried some different ways to uninstall the mouse, first in PC settings -&gt; PC and devices -&gt; Bluetooth (Couldn't remove it). Second by removing in Control Panel -&gt; Hardware and Sound -&gt; Devices and Printers -&gt; right mouse, remove device. Both failed.
 Thirdly in Device Manager -&gt; Bluetooth I removed the drivers, removed Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center restarted. After this i re-installed the Center and went to connect the mouse in PC settings, but it was already there.</div>
<div>3. Think I did that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will try to explain the issue a bit better:<br />
I have a Sculpt Comfort Mouse, which has a blue windows button that can be pressed and touched (swipe). When swept up by default it shows the "switch between recent apps" bar. When swept down it shows the "Open Recent Apps" bar. Every time I do this, I can
 feel the mouse vibrate from inside, giving feedback.<br />
<br />
Now the is that when using the mouse without touching the blue button: moving, left clicking, scrolling, the command that is executed when you swipe up is randomly executed. So the Switch between recent apps bar is shown, mouse vibrates. In the Center I disabled
 the gesture and it started doing this for the down gesture, so I disabled that one also. Now I don't get the bars showing up anymore, but I do get the vibrates. And that is what has been bothering me.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the side note, from the first day I bought the mouse it lost connection repeatedly for about 6 secs. After some online research I got it fixed. But not it has happening again, but for a shorter time of about 2 secs.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Normally I would just re-install Windows, but I can't do that right now.</div>

            <p>Hi Dustin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As re-installing Mouse drivers did not resolve the issue it could be a hardware issue.

            <p><strong>UnInstall Bluetooth drivers and re-install Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 7 or Windows 8.0 in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried all suggestions and troubleshooting steps including disabling power saving options, doing a factory reset and clean install of Windows 8.0 / 8.1 but I continued to have problems with Microsoft Bluetooth mice (w/o USB dongles) randomly disconnecting.
 The ONLY solution that worked for me was un-installing existing Bluetooth drivers from Control Panel as well as Device Manager and re-installing Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 7 or Windows 8.0 in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode".
<strong>The key </strong><strong>here is installing Bluetooth drivers in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode" by right-clicking the Bluetooth EXE file &gt; Properties &amp; selecting "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode". Avoid Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 8.1</strong>.
 Luckily, my touchscreen laptop manufacturer (Acer) had both Windows 7 &amp; Window 8.0 Atheros Bluetooth drivers for my model on their support website. Additional side-benefits I noticed after doing this:</p>
<ol>
<li>All three models of built-in Bluetooth Microsoft mice (Microsoft Scuplt Touch, Sculpt Comfort &amp; Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000) started working perfectly without any sudden disconnects or freezing;</li><li>The overall mouse operations also became lot smoother and predictable;</li><li>Windows Power Management started working perfectly with the laptop going into sleep / standby nicely and waking up instantly without any lockups or WiFi issues</li><li>CPU / Fan noise is much quieter-- it seems the Bluetooth drivers installed as I suggest are more "in harmony" with the rest of the system.</li><li>Everything including the Bluetooth mouse is working great for almost a week since I made these changes. I promptly updated my complete system image backup with the new setup.</li></ol>

<p>I have the same problem happening with windows 10 and an MS Sculpt Bluetooth mouse, where it randomly vibrates and goes back on a webpage, often causing serious loss of data and productivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a driver issue with Windows 10, or is this a bad mouse?</p>

<p>Hi SterlingKeele, I am having the same problem (vibrate when I touch and then browser goes back a page). There is Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center software (download from Microsoft). There is an option to turn vibrate off (Mouse &gt; Basic Settings &gt; Touch
 Settings). I think this has solved the browser going back issue when I touch the mouse after not interacting with it for a while.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 downgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sb_76  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 downgrade</h2>
                    <p>Good day Microsoft</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you do not answer more than once I need a proper answer now.</p>
<p>When I completed the Windows 10 upgrade from my Windows 7 Ultimate version I was told that it should be possible to bo back to Windows 7 within 30 days after upgrade. That is not true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>14 days after I upgraded I could see that windows 10 is a "play version" that should never have been released to the market.</p>
<p>First of all let me tell you about my system. It is an HP with Intel i7, 4 GHz processor, 16 GB RAM, 5 TB HDD two different discs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7 I had a lot of advanced software that is not possible to use with Windows 10, since you do not allow real software, just play software and cloud software. The win10 operating system is not made for advanced computers and software, no matter
 what you say. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have been looking to foran answer how to downgrade and go back to the only working OS you have had the past 10 years, Windows 7 Ultimate edition. But All my Windows.old libraries are gone including those backup files you claim win10 puts in the computer
 when you "upgrade" to win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is a huge problem. How to go back to windows 7?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon startup, the computer stays on the manufacturer screen for about 40 seconds before windows 10 is loading. Windows 7 never did that, it started within seconds after turning on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Softwares that do not work are advanced CISCO software and many other advanced software I have. This is not just a personal computer, It is a very advanced computer and software setup I have and 99,8% of my software is not made for junk as windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like you have let 10 year old kids develope your new operating systems and those who developed that system obviously cannot use their brain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are responsible for support for win10 and you claimed that it should be possible to go back to win7 after the upgrade and it is not, you are fully responsible to make a patch for this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is obvious that you never will make a better OS than win7 so windows is a dead product since the win10 is another win8 junk version. Learn from the past and stick to the system that are professional and work well and do not throw up junk like win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been waiting for a reply how to get my win7 back fully as it was before the "upgrade" for about 45 days now. Still not a word from you. Please, at least admin to the public that you do not have that function available for more than a few days and
 not the 30 days you promise. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And do not throw junk as you did before as, run this and that software to make win10 work fine. THERE IS NO SUCH SOFTWARE. Win10 is PURE JUNK and should be considered hazardous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get my question and you know that the only thing I want to know is HOW TO GET BACK TO WINDOWS 7 like you promised before the upgrade????????</p>
<p>

            At this point you have two options, 1) Reset to factory setting if still available or to do a clean install of Windows 7 from your media. one thing, be sure to backup all of your fi . Your best option is to work with Windows 10 to get it to the point you
 want it. I would be awful surprised if most if not all your software can't be installed and used if you just do a little research. Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be glad to assit you.

<p>NOTHING works in Windows 10, my computer gets the message "Windows has run out of memory" ALL THE TIME.</p>
<p>You do not know what kind of junk you have managed to release to the public. </p>
<p>Windows 10 is certainly not made for personal computers, maybe toys like phones or similar but NOT for advanced computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you want to steal my computer, and tell me to spend 10 days reinstalling all software even if you promised that it would be possible to downgrade within 30 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not interested in that but I would love to get you to court for this behavior since you lie to everyone who tries to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 does not find my printers aymore either, some kind of new STUPID update from you caused that.
</p>
<p>Yesterday it was possible to print as usual, today it is not even possible to install my printers that are very modern and new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GOD, I hate you play guys that cannot learn from the past.</p>
<p>What I wonder the most is WHY you cannot reply in time so it would bne possible to downgrade my system to the very nice and only working OS you have, Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you decide to shut windows 7 updates down, you will kill Microsoft. This version 10 is such a disaster and as I have said before, I have seen all previous windows versions and this version 10 is PURE JUNK and all developers should be fired for releasing
 such junk.</p>

            When you post to this forum you are not addressing Microsoft We are all volunteers who give of out time to try and help others when we can. I feel pretty sure that if you gave more particulars or did a clean install of Windows 10 we would be able to help
 you get a stable Windows 10. As to your memory and printer issues. When Windows 10 is update sometimes a device will need to have an updated driver- and this is the responsibility of the printer manufacturer. As to memory you may be at the point where you
 need to add for memory or stop any unnecessary processes from running. Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.

<p>Well, that is not the answer I am getting from Microsoft in other issues.</p>
<p>Amateur replies, please do not write!</p>
<p>My system is an advance system with more than enough memory for the most sophisticated software there is.</p>
<p>However Win10 is not a professional edition of Windows, it is more likely to be a follow up of Windows 2.1.</p>
<p>The advanced softwares I have never ever had a problem under Windows 7 Ultimate, but hardly runs at all, or gets a memory crash to desktop in win10.
</p>
<p>You guys who have not seen advanced software work, please learn first, speak then.
</p>
<p>Windows 10 is and will stay JUNK, that is just the way it is. As I said before it seems to be a version for mobile phones or similar since those are not capable of anything either.</p>
<p>My demands on a computer and operating system is extremely high. And with my experience since the first version of windows I must say, I have never ever seen such a bad developed version as 10, maybe 8 was even worse but 10 ranks as high as 8 or even higher
 on the junk list.</p>
<p>Since this seems to be an amateur forum I will shut down my activity here since I need professional replies, and Microsoft wants to hide as good as they can since they know what junk they have put on the market.</p>
<p>Really hope Microsoft with its absense of support will die with this version of windows.</p>
<p>For you guys reading and considering win10, do not go anywhere close to this operating system, its a vital and venomous system that only will make you angry and annoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about win10 never understands a simple keyboard action such as AltGr+2, its takes seconds before the&nbsp; @ appears and when being a fast writer it will look like thi@s simply. It ends up anywhere in the text and not when expected. This ONLY happens in win10,
 never happened in any version before this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good bye forum and good night microsoft, I hope you will die ASAP so the market will stay clean of your junk!!!</p>

            Well funny thing is that there are over 500 Million computers world wide running Windows 10 and most are people seem to be happy as you hear no complaints from them.&nbsp; Maybe that is because they are too busy working on their windows 10 computers. You don't
 even appear to want to get your computer running right - you just want to complain. If you decide you want our help we will be here if not...........

<p>And where do you get that info from, 500 million.&nbsp; Hahaha that is your fantasy.</p>
<p>It is not allowed to complain cause you must accept microsoft junk thats it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Private messages her wont stop complain from me I only tell the truth and people are not used to that. They say thank you to anything that you need to learn.</p>
<p>Scrap win10 that only causes problems if you read other forums than your own, but you do not want to see that either sad enough.</p>

            That right check it out and those figures were 6 months or so old. Whether you like it or not your opinion is in the minority. People like you want everything their way right from the git-go they don't want to have to do anything for themselves.

<p>Because of my line of work, I have an "advanced system" too.</p>
<p>I am a software developer, so having a computer that is a bit more on the beefy side is useful for building and testing the software. Until recently I was using an Intel Core i7 3820 (this is a high end desktop processor), with 32GB of RAM and 4.5TB of hard
 disk space. I recently updated to an AMD Ryzen 1900x with 32GB of RAM.</p>
<p>Windows 10 only gets to around 4GB usage just after boot. Right now it is about:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aade3c76-f03b-4997-8ed8-f813dfb35de5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/aade3c76-f03b-4997-8ed8-f813dfb35de5" /></a></p>

<p>There are a few applications running in the background doing some light things.</p>
<p>When I am at the heaviest usage due to work, then I can get 100% CPU usage, and RAM gets to between 16GB and 24GB. This is doing advanced software development with advanced software development tools. They all work perfectly fine on Windows 10 too.</p>
<p>And so there is a problem, my advanced system is working fine where yours isn't. So shouldn't you first question your system before blaming Windows?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
The screen issue usually occurs due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hardware failure<br />
</li><li>Corrupted/incompatible hardware driver<br />
</li><li>Corrupted/incomplete Windows updates<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better assist you with this, we'd like to know if were there any changes made to the computer prior to this issue (e.g. Windows updates)?
<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, please boot your computer in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> for us to troubleshoot the issue.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your reply. </p>

In this case, we suggest performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System Restore</a></strong> to get your computer back from its previous state.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.<br />
<br />
We would appreciate an update about how it went.

            Why would I do that? This issue has been present since before any major updates. It's
<em>always been,</em> and I haven't even had any updates in awhile.<br />

<h2>            Error Code 8007274D</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing this morning, and my Xbox was working fine and everything. About two hours ago I tried to log on and it wouldn't connect to Live. So I tried resetting my Xbox, router, and modem, and I get the same message telling me I couldn't connect. I then
 proceeded to recover my gamertag and it stopped half way through and said "XBox Live Profiles can't be downloaded right now. Please try again later. 8007274D" I tried to log in and play offline and my profile was completely removed from my Xbox. I tried recovering
 it again and it gave the same error message. I reset my internet and everything again, and changed my password. The same message popped up again. I have been continuously trying to log on, but it still isn't working. Anyone know what's going on or how to fix
 my problem?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey guys, if you're using a wireless connection try using a wired connection instead then redownload your profile. If that doesn't work you can always use a flash drive formatted as a memory unit to recover your gamertag to then transfer it back over to
 your hard drive. </p>

https://login.live.com</a> and see if there have been any notifications or alerts on your account recently? Also you may want to visit accounts on your console and see if there are any corrupted profiles, delete those and then try to download your profile again.

            Hi,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two quick things, first no need to bump on these forms...especially on someone else's thread. I normally would advise to start your own thread so everyone in the community can see it.<br />
Which brings me to my second point.<span><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Answers is a peer to peer forum where the majority of community members are not Microsoft employees, but rather part of a knowledgeable computing community dedicated to helping each other find solutions to computer issues. So posting here doesn't
 constitute speaking to a Microsoft employee.&nbsp; </span><br />
I would suggest in this instance you contact Microsoft tech support directly to resolve this issue:<br />

    <title>I really would like to uninstall Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackie1b  say:</h3>
<h2>            I really would like to uninstall Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>i Have suddenly encountered Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Before this morning I had never really heard of it or thought about it.&nbsp; I was trying to send a photo from Picasa3 as I always have done for the many years I have had Picasa.&nbsp; This morning this Windows Live
 Mail dialog box popped up (never seen it before).&nbsp; So it was the only option available so I clicked on it.&nbsp; Then I get an error message telling me that I couldn't use Windows Live Mail to send the photo.&nbsp; I ended up saving the photo to desktop and then attaching
 it to the email.&nbsp; Stupidest thing I have ever seen.&nbsp; I don't know what I have done to make this Windows Live Mail dialog box suddenly start appearing on my computer.&nbsp; I would like to get rid of it and go back to the gmail way of sending photos from Picasa3.&nbsp;
 Any solutions from any one?&nbsp; I really would like to uninstall it but I am afraid that it might affect other things.&nbsp; I am not very computer savvy so I have done nothing yet.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.&nbsp; Jackie1b</p>

<p>
</p><p>That said, the article referred to explains only how to uninstall one version of the program (2011) on one operating system (Windows 7). Jackie may be lucky and find her way to the equivalent commands on other OSs for other program versions. If not, I expect

<p>I did, however, wonder how Windows Live Mail was never "suddenly encountered" prior to now.</p>
<p>Just what did get installed, what was needed, and what was the mail program in use?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the future, I will carefully check information on all supplied links: in this case, how to uninstall Windows Live Essentials 2011, not Windows Essentials 2012. May Jackie find her way back if there are problems with version and operating system since
 neither were specified by her.</p>

            Thank you.&nbsp; I apologize that I did not give you all the information you required.&nbsp; My OS is Windows&nbsp;7 &nbsp;and my email program is Hotmail under Outlook.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is Windows Essentials 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don't know why one day this started popping up on me.&nbsp; I looked
 to see when it was installed and it was installed in August 2016.&nbsp; I don't recall installing it, but maybe.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also do not remember installing One Drive either.&nbsp;I am not even sure what One Drive is.&nbsp; &nbsp;It was installed in September 2016.&nbsp; Apparently I did
 something that installed both these programs to my computer.&nbsp; As I said, I really don't know what I am doing with computers.&nbsp; I have very little technical knowledge.&nbsp; so please bear with me when I ask stupid questions.&nbsp; Now that &nbsp;I see what programs it contains
 I don't want to uninstall it.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your reply.&nbsp; It has helped me.

 my initial question on what mail program you were using was unclear and could have been interpreted in one of several ways. You provided clarification (Outlook) and you don't owe me an apology.</li><li>Individual programs can be uninstalled from the Windows Essentials 2012 suite. Whether or not you want to is another question. Some of these programs you don't want to uninstall until after you've created a backup. You always want the reinstaller program
 at hand prior to uninstalling anything.</li><li>I don't use OneDrive. My understanding is that it is a vehicle for moving information to the cloud for later access.</li><li>I don't use Outlook anything (MS Office or Outlook.com); I don't know if Outlook will run in parallel with Windows Live Mail, nor do I know if you have Windows Live Mail accounts configured.

 Live Mail.<br />

            <p>OK, here goes. Picasa&nbsp;is a now-discontinued Google application that had a special relationship with Gmail. That relationship is now a bit dodgy, and you'd have to ask Google how to ensure that Gmail is invoked when you elect to email photos from Picasa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The normal process when you select a <em>send image by email</em> option anywhere is that Windows looks for an email program to use to send a message with the image. Gmail isn't a
<em>program</em> - it's a webmail <em>service</em>, but Google managed to fool Windows into thinking that it
 the image file on its way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, there's a bug in the program. This bug means that it assumes that you want to send a so-called 'photo email'.&nbsp;Photo email&nbsp;is a very neat feature of Windows Live Mail; instead of trying to send large image files by email, it only sends thumbnail copies
 of the pictures. The real full-size picture files are in fact uploaded to the website called OneDrive. The message the addressee receives gives a link so that the recipient can view the pictures and download them if he wants to, avoiding all the problems with
 using email to send large files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most likely reason why you received an error message when this process was underway is that the photo email feature no longer works, because of changes at the OneDrive website. To work around this, then, next time you send a photo from Picasa, you should
 see a Windows Live Mail message window with a 'photo album' in the body of the message. Click on the picture; a new tab appears on the ribbon. Click on this tab, then on the paperclip.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d609c9b-a27f-4952-97c6-8dff49767ea5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d609c9b-a27f-4952-97c6-8dff49767ea5" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This should get rid of the photo album and attach the picture file to the email in the traditional way. Try it out by sending a picture to yourself and tell us what happened.</p>

            Noel, Thank you so very much.&nbsp; You have explained this in language that even I can understand.&nbsp; Now I see what is happening with Picasa.&nbsp; I did see the album screen that you included as a screen shot.&nbsp; I just didn't know what it was.&nbsp; I do know that Google
 is no longer supporting Picasa.&nbsp; It makes me sad because I have literally thousands of pictures in Picasa.&nbsp; What to do now?&nbsp; Guess that is a problem for another time.&nbsp; Again I thank you so much for a very detailed answer to my questions.&nbsp; I am sure it will
 also help other people who have the same questions I did.&nbsp; I am not going to uninstall Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; Apparently it has files I do want to keep.&nbsp; Does One Drive come along with Windows Live Mail?&nbsp; I don't know what it is, so I just ignore it when I can.

<h2>            Synaptics Pointer scroll fix.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all I also had the Synaptics error, I now have scroll enabled by using the Vista home premium driver, this also worked in windows 7.</p>
<p>Driver to look for is as follows. Synaptics pointing device v12.1.0 04dec08.&nbsp;&nbsp; Driver version 12.1.0.0. Check HP site for drivers. The driver file is 47mb, my scroll is working perfectly except no scroll in Microsoft Edge (typical). I also used GODMODE to
 stop windows updating drivers automatically so it wouldnt install the latest version. This fix would be for the more experienced users. I dont have two finger scroll option but single scroll works well. Hope this helps some of those with the same issue. Sad
 how such an old driver works so well.</p>
<p>Here is a link <a href="http://driverzone.com/%7Bd4c319d6-c055-45a1-b3b3-2a09e92256ed%7D?id=2414947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Can&#39;t play music from smartphone through PC audio via bluetooth&#58; why does Windows 10 not support &#34;A2DP sink&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Back in the Windows 7 days, I used to play music on my smartphone and listen to it from my PC's headset at work. This was great because I could store the audio files on the phone or stream music through my cell provider and not use my work's network at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I merely paired the phone to the PC and then it "just worked" whenever I connected to the PC from the phone. It was a nice seamless experience to listen to music in my car using the smartphone as the source and then continuing listening at my desk after
 connecting to the PC-- all wireless through bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This capability is called "A2DP sink".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see now that it has been disabled since windows 8, and there is NO word from Microsoft on why this feature has been disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would this be disabled? It is a useful feature. Usually as operating systems advance, we get more features, not less. What's the deal with this? Even car dashboards have this capability, why not a PC?</p>

<p>Hello Angelo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon researching about your concern, Microsoft's A2DP sink functionality connects but doesn't actually produce audio while the Broadcom drivers that has A2DP sink but suffers from a serious memory leak. I've also come across this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware-winpc/does-or-doesnt-windows-10-support-a2dp-and-if-so/d28b2565-adc7-4d4c-848a-d65f66d9a6c7">thread
</a></strong>that relates to your concern. Celestrion stated that <em>"Microsoft's Bluetooth stack presently supports only the "source" role of the A2DP profile, which lets it send audio. It does not support the "sink" role of the A2DP profile, which would
 let it receive audio"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, Microsoft allows the implementation in Windows 10; yet the OEM/Device Manufacturer has to
<br />
produce compatible hardware and drivers. You may submit this item through the Feedback Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to submit new feedback, please follow these steps: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for Feedback Hub in Cortana search, then launch the app.
<br />
2. Navigate to Feedback in the left menu, then press + Add new feedback. <br />
3. Select the Problem, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.
<br />
4. Important: If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking Begin monitoring (or Start capture) near the end of the form; Stop monitoring when you’re done.
<br />
5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click Submit. <br />
6. Click Continue using Feedback Hub. <br />
7. Click My feedback at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).
<br />
8. Open the item you submitted, then click Share. <br />
9. Click Copy link, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like https://aka.ms/ link&gt;).</p>

</p><p>Thanks MQ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will submit something in feedback hub. It seems that no one actually knows why the A2DP sink feature is disabled in Windows 8,10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hear things about the Broadcom memory leak problem from back in windows 8, but the A2DP sink feature is disabled even if one doesn't use Broadcom bluetooth hardware.&nbsp; Moreover, one would think that Broadcom could have updated their driver by now to correct
 the memory leak issue.&nbsp;</p>

                    Alright, I am not sure what is going on with settings. I can be fairly certain that asus' left the configuration of the pen up to windows 10. The pen has a couple extra buttons, one is right click, one is (allegedly) 'erase' - I would like the erase button
 to be middle mouse.

<br />There you should see options for what you want each shortcut to be. Options will vary depending on the make and model of your device. I have a Surface, so, I see several options for: click once, double click, press and hold.

<p>I see options for a shortcut button - NOT for the two buttons I have on the pen. The shortcut options itself seems fairly useless, with choices being the default 'windows ink workspace', nothing, one note, launch a classic app, launch a universal app. What
 do I want that for, I can launch an app just fine.</p>
<p>Nowhere is there the option to make the button a middle click. Do you understand what a middle click is? Do YOU have the option to set a button to a middle click?</p>

<h2>            windows 10 home - decryption of external drive using BitLocker</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought recently the notebook with Windows 10 Home. I plugged in the external drive to copy some data. Later on I realized that&nbsp;the external drive was somehow encrypted using BitLocker and currently I can see the data on this drive&nbsp;using only my new notebook.&nbsp;The
 same happened with my second external&nbsp;drive.&nbsp;When I am trying to connect the external drive to the other notebook (Windows 10 Home, upgraded from Windows 7), I am asked to insert BitLocker recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my new notebook I have option device encryption set to on. I do not see any option related to BitLocker, because I have Windows 10 Home. On Microsoft account I see only the recovery key to my main C drive.</p>
<p>On my new notebook I was never asked if I want to have external drives encrypted or not. I was never asked to type any password or provide a location to store the key. External disks somehow were encrypted automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you tell me, where can I find keys to decrypt the external drive or how can I decrypt it permanently to see the data on the other computers as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your quick&nbsp;help.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mateusz</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a different question than other people do I would say. So I got Windows 10 and I LOVE it. But I have one problem with it. When I try loading in Google or YouTube the webpage doesn't load in. When I tried Google Chrome it doesn't load in the webpage
 to install. It works fine on my laptop though. When I try Mozzila Firefox I can install it, but it doesn't work at all. The webpages don't load in. Thank you for answering and this is my first question I put on Microsoft. Thank you very much.</p>

            Thank you for replying. Troubleshooting did not fix it but I don't know how to reset Microsoft Edge. I went through the references&nbsp;but I couldn't find it if you put it there for resetting edge.&nbsp;I already did a&nbsp;computer&nbsp;refresh&nbsp;a while ago but that still
 did not fix the problem. I have a pretty good internet connection. 4.0 MBs&nbsp;when downloading something. I am connected by Ethernet. I know that there is no malware. I used Avast for regular full scan then used a boot time scan. It found nothing. Then I use
 Malware Bytes for extra protection. Thank you for replying.

<h2>            Syncing multiple folders to OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my pictures library set up across multiple folders. If i enable sync as described in&nbsp;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/sync-your-documents-pictures-and-desktop-folders-with-onedrive-d61a7930-a6fb-4b95-b28a-6552e77c3057 only those that reside
 in the standard path for the picture library are being synced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the desired behaviour or is there any way i can sync my whole pictures library without moving it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following folders added to my pictures library:</p>
<p>
</p><p>%USERPROFILE%Pictures</p>
<p>D:\Pictures</p>
<p>E:\Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>only files in %USERPROFILE%\Pictures will be synced by OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>
<p>

            This is most commonly caused by virus/malware infection so start with the basics:<br />
<br />
Go through these general malware removal steps systematically - <a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a> <br />
<br />
Include scanning with David Lipman's Multi_AV and follow instructions to do all scans in Safe Mode. Please see the special Notes regarding using Multi_AV in Vista.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Multi-AV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Multi-AV</a> - instructions<br />

<br />
When all else fails, get guided help. Choose one of the specialty forums listed at the first link. Register and read its posting FAQ. PLEASE DO NOT POST LOGS IN THE MS FORUMS.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the work yourself (and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea), take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).&nbsp;Please be aware that not all local shops are
 skilled at removing malware and even if they are, your computer may be so infested that Windows will need to be clean-installed. If possible, have all your data backed up before you take the machine into a shop.

            Thanks. But. If you didn't read, explorer.exe doesn't open so I can't even get into internet on her computer to download stuff. Anyway, I used a bootable disc to change the privelleges of the other users so one of them was administrator, as the virus only
 infected her user. I did a system restore and it seemed to work like normal however after a few hours the virus redid it's thing. I used MalwareBytes Anti-Malware but it didn't remove it unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Anyway, symptoms of the virus: (I actually think it's viruses/trojans/etc.)<br />
On startup it says "Surabaya in my birthday" and then some stuff in Thai or some other language. Anyway, I was going to follow a tutorial to remove it but it also blocks task manager, regedit, msconfig and a number of other things (which is why I think it's
 more then one because no other user with this virus has found that to be the case). It also makes three shortcuts on desktop all for "____" but they all link to somewhere inside the Internet Explorer Folder. (Which is odd because she uses firefox.) Anyway,
 any other ideas? The computer is back to where it started. I'm currently using Microsoft's Malicious Software Remover Tool. However if this doesn't work I think I'm going to do another system restore and download and install Spyware Search &amp; Destroy (?). But
 after that... I really don't know.

            Okay, I think it's definitely more then one. I used Spybot Search &amp; Destroy and for about 5 minutes I could open regedit and taskmngr but it seems it's one of those pain in the ____ bugs which reinstalls itself. The "Surabaya in my birthday" no longer
 occurs and before anything is set after startup the computer I can quickly open up taskmngr. However this doesn't help as I've been through all the things open on google to see if any of them are known viruses. It does have explorer now but there's not much
 I can do. The virus seems to block sites like www.microsoft.com and won't let me open Spybot Search &amp; Destroy anymore. It's also infected the Guest account.<br />
<br />
God :(. Any ideas?

            Bullshit virus. &gt;_&gt;. Okay, I decided to restart to see if I could try and run Spybot Search &amp; Destroy again. This time it's back to the old problem, explorer.exe doesn't start and task manager is disabled. Far out. And I know the obvious idea here is to
 format but there's files on there that my friend needs so I've been trying to get them off for her but we don't have an external hard drive here. So my only hope is to fix it at the moment. Anyway, does anybody know what this virus might be? It's a real pain...

            Oh and in response to using Safe Mode. Whenever I try and start in safe mode it blue screens and restarts. So, that's out of the question.

            Programs can be run even if you can't use explorer.exe but you need to be comfortable with the command line and in your case work outside of Windows. However, I believe it is probably time for your friend to take her machine to a real computer tech. I
 don't recommend using a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. I'm not saying this to hurt your feelings but her computer is quite severely infected and your actions won't get the job done. For instance, doing a System Restore on an infected machine can
 have very bad consequences so that wasn't a very good choice. The alternatives to taking the machine to a tech are to:<br />
<br />
1. Have your friend (or you) get guided help at one of the specialty forums listed below (not here):<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#HJT-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#HJT-links</a>
<br />
<br />
2. Back up her data by booting with a Linux Live CD and copying the files to an external hard drive. Then do a clean install/factory restore of Windows. Make sure you scan the backed-up data before copying it onto the clean machine.<br />

            Ben,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I am not referring to sky drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am referring to files on local network drives.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason I used 8 Pro was because it allowed me to make my local network storage sync with the laptop &nbsp;for when I am out of the office with no internet connection. Has the function been removed from 8.1? Or has the upgrade broken something?</div>

</p>
<p>You may just need to re-enable the functionality for Offline Files.&nbsp; On the desktop in Windows 8.1 right click the start button and select Control Panel.&nbsp; In the search box in the top right of the Control Panel search for "Sync Center". Click on the Sync
 Center and then on the left menu click on Manage offline files.&nbsp; The Offline Files dialog will be displayed.&nbsp; Click on the Enable offline files button and click OK. Now restart your computer and you should be good to go.</p>
