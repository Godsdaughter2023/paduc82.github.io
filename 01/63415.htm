    <title>Cross Platforming - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cross Platforming</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft’s investment in PC gaming has felt half-hearted over the past several years. It locked Halo 2 and Gears of Wars into the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/08/20/games-for-windows-live-may-shut-down-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">now waning Games for Windows Live</a>&nbsp;ecosystem,
 and it’s become abundantly clear that Microsoft is leaving video games up to the Xbox division. However, a recent interview between Microsoft and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ausgamers.com/features/read/3362615" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AusGamers</a>&nbsp;reveals that Corporate Vice President of
 Microsoft Studios Phil Spencer is open to the idea of cross platform play between the Xbox One and PCs.</p>
<p>“I’m not allowed to leak things,” Spencer said. “But I think what you’re talking about makes a lot of sense.”</p>
<p>Spencer pointed to 2007’s Shadowrun, an online FPS that featured cross-platform play between the Xbox 360 and PC. Spencer admits that the cross-platform experiment didn’t go very well, but that he learned a lot from the experience. Those problems aside,
 Spencer said he’s confident that playing games across different platforms through cloud saves (Spencer used&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcgamer.com/tag/skulls-of-the-shogun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skulls of the Shogun</a>&nbsp;as an example) is the future of gaming.</p>
<p>“This connected ecosystem across all the different devices is definitely where I think the future of gaming is going; you don’t have to do it as a developer, but you have the capability and I think a system like Xbox Live across all those screens where you
 know who someone is and who their friends are, what their Achievements are and their progression is really critical to that,” Spencer said.</p>
<p><span>I think cross-platform play has a future on single-player or co-op games, where you don’t have to take competitive advantage into account. I don’t believe PC gamers are inherently better at video games than their console
 counter-parts, but there’s an obvious advantage control-wise. Mouse and keyboard controls will always be more accurate than a joystick, and it’s never fun to lose when the other team is on a different playing field.</span> But playing games on a PC and picking
 up where I left off somewhere else on a console—that’s a different story. Microsoft working with Valve or EA to make cloud saves compatible between systems doesn't sound like a particularly plausible scenario, but I'd be more than happy to see it come to fruition.</p>
<p><span>This, in theory, is a great idea. I have had a few idea on how to go about doing this without jeopardizing competitive multiplayer experiences. How about if we do want to go with cross platforming, why not make it so
 that if a PC Gamer wants to play with the Xbox One community he/she has to buy a Microsoft controller specifically designed for the PC to hook up to that persons PC in order to play on an even playing field with the Xbox One community. I got with PC Gamers
 and Xbox Gamers alike and discussed this with them. Both parties went on to say that it is a great idea and they are both perfectly fine with the idea.</span></p>

<p>That's always been the case with cross-platforming games from console to PC. Mouse and keyboard will always have the advantage and exactly the reason I don't play on PC. I have a disability that limits me from being able to use a mouse and keyboard combo
 and I'm certainly not going to play on PC with a controller because I will be at a disadvantage. But yes, if they could find a way to level the playing field, it would be a great idea.</p>

<p>Why cant they just start cross platforming between the Xbox One and the Xbox 360? &nbsp;It shouldn't be hard. I have read people say it has something to do with them being built differently but if you think about it, it all has to do with the online servers.
 If Microsoft can just switch the 360 to the Xbox one servers; online gaming will erupt with competitiveness more than it already is. Gamers will be satisfied and want this feature, but then again Microsoft does not listen to us much. They wont add this feature
 or even cross platform party chat because they want 36o owneres to get an xbox one all they want is money.</p>

<p>^^ Happy Wars is supposed to be cross platform with the 360 and the ONE.</p>
<p>Shadowrun is still going strong between the 360 and PC. I've destroyed many a PC player with my 360 controller.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im going to assume you're talking about Battlefield.</p>
<p>What exactly is unbalanced about Battlefield? I've never called something out for being unbalanced unless it be a weapon that I feel is taking me out too quickly but Call Of Duty is also known for having those "go to" weapons.<br />
<br />
I'll give you the servers weren't to great at first but like always the servers were ready to go in a few days like usual.<br />
<br />
The whole talking to your team thing I'm not entirely sure why people argue this especially with the option of party chat. Also 12 people talking all at once about what's happening on the battlefield would be a little too much. I've had full rooms of Call Of
 Duty teams talking&nbsp;and theres no way I could handle double that, Also the new system they have with the Back button in BFBC2 works really well. To be honest though I guess I wouldn't mind the team broken up into 2 squads of 6, so you could talk to atleast
 half your team but of course that would ruin the squad system they have.<br />
<br />
Team killing? Wouldn't know about that because I do not play Hardcore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Although I'm a fan of both games, I have to say that BF3 is clearly on top when you compare these two right up next to eachother. Especially after seeing that MW3 demo at E3, yikes. I was bored just watching the video. The way I see it BF3 is taking a step
 forward while MW3 is going with the same old formula that they know will sell.&nbsp; The only thing that bothered me about the article is how he went with the 60fps arguement, like really&nbsp;MW3 probably won't even have maps half the size of the maps that will be
 in BF3. Now put map size, building destruction and actually all kinds of enviroment destruction, and vehicles. Pfft I'd give up 60fps for all of that any day.</p>
<p>Then again you also don't have to compare these two and just enjoy both FPS titles.</p>

<p>Battlefield bc2 just didn't have the same feel as bc1 did.. If bc2 is anything to go by battlefield 3 will be horrible..with broken servers from day 1 .. As per usual with bf games..

<h2>            Help&#58; System Recovery error 0x0000003 recover image failed</h2>
                    Computer: Toshiba laptop L50-A<br />
Windows 8 upgraded to 8.1<br />
<br />
Background info: PC was running slow so backed up all data and did a system restore.<br />
&nbsp;PC was still running slow so figured I would do a system recovery from disks I made when I first got the pc. PC was still running slow and it didn't seem to wipe everything so figured it must of kept whatever virus with the other things it didn't delete.&nbsp;<br />
Then I used the disks and did a full deletion of data and partitions and override all sectors (I regret this since I wasn't sure what partitions were.)&nbsp;<br />
Now thinking I have a clean slate I go to do system recovery with disks again and I get&nbsp;<br />
<br />
error: recover image failed 0x0000003 or sometimes 0x00000002.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The system won't go to any windows os at all and I've tried every possible thing through the disk restore/recovery/repair to no avail.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>Hi Lukets,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Windows 8 installation disc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have already&nbsp;wiped out everything&nbsp;on the system, I suspect you have also deleted the recovery drive partition. The recovery discs that you have help you recover the System health as long as you have recovery drive partition on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you can still reinstall Windows 8 on the system from a Windows 8 installation disc.
<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you do not have Windows 8 installation DVD, you may have to create one using another system.
</span></span></p>
<p>To create installation media, you may refer to the article given below:</p>
<p><strong><em><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>Create installation media for Windows 8.1</span></span></a></span></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Having created the installation media, you can boot your system from the installation medium and install Windows 8. In order to perform clean installation of Windows 8/8.1 from the media, thoroughly refer to the steps provided in the following article.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/clean-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean installation of Windows</a></em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You might need to contact your system manufacturer to get the Windows activated or you need to purchase a new Windows 8/8.1 product license to activate your operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Do let us know if you need any further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            Profile status</h2>
                    <p>I have recently updated my skype to 8.15.0.4 </p>
<p>I work remotely so I had setup skype to launch automatically, and my status remained "green" showing I was active whenever I was logged on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the new version, I only remain "green" or active for 5 minutes and then i have to click in the skype window to keep refreshing my presence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot find anywhere an option to change the time before it goes yellow (like never!), as was possible in previous version.</p>
<p>I have tried downgrading back to the older versions, but can't so I'm stuck with this version.</p>
<p>Can anyone help?&nbsp; I don't want people in the office to think I am not available when I am!&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  Lâm 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />There are several ways you can delete it. Personally, I recommend waiting the 10 days and let it delete itself automatically.
<br />
<br />Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
<br />
<br />Then hit Enter
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
<br />
<br />Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
<br />
<br />Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
<br />
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
<br />
<br />As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didnâ€:tm:t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
<br />
<br />
<br />Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
<br />
<br />Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
<br />
<br />Another way you can try removing Windows.old is using the following commands:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />First, you will need to take ownership of this folder, so at the command prompt, type
<br />
<br />takeown /F C:\Windows.old\* /R /A
<br />
<br />and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Next, in the command prompt, type
<br />
<br />cacls C:\Windows.old\*.* /T /grant administrators:F
<br />
<br />Hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Then type:
<br />
<br />rmdir /S /Q C:\Windows.old\
<br />
<br />Then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Exit then restart.  	
<br />
<br />If this does not work, try using a free third party utility such as TreeSize to remove it. Learn more about how to download, set it up and use it:

<h2>            Unable to use mouse and keyboard on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: PC Ports</p>
<p>Hello, </p>
<p>I recently backed up my PC which is an IBuyPower ne641 fx. After the starting up process was complete and I was allowed to insert my time zone, my home country, and language, none of this things I was able to interact with because my mouse and keyboard were
 unresponsive, but my mouse still light up. After messing with it a lot I noticed that it all works in the BIOS and CMOS menus, but nowhere else. Please, if anybody knows how to fix this, let me know.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi BarbaraFaust1 ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />This issue may be due to the fact that caller ID is not setup. . If this is not setup, set it up.
<br />
<br />What is caller identification and how do I set it up? - <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is-caller-identification-and-how-do-i-set-it-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1248/what-is...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Does this happen in other browsers or just Chrome?
<br />If just chrome reset the browser.

<h2>            Unwanted files in &#34;My PIctures&#34; are Multiplying. I cant get rid of them.</h2>
                    "My Pictures" file has duplicated hundreds of my images dozens of times &nbsp;and I can't get rid of them. &nbsp;I highlight them, hit "delete" and while they are moved to the Recycle Bin, they are also copied so I end up with the same overwhelming files that i
 don't want. &nbsp;Now Picasa is also importing them and copying them. &nbsp;Please help.

            Do the unwanted copies have filenames with<br />
the prefix "copy of"?<br />
<br />
Example: Copy of IMG_1455.JPG<br />
<br />
Maybe the following info will shed some light...<br />
failure to completely release the mouse button<br />
when moving from one selection to the next is<br />
the cause of the unwanted copies.<br />
<br />
Here's how to reproduce the unwanted<br />
copying...<br />
<br />
Hold your Ctrl key and select several files...<br />
<br />
Place your pointer on the selected group<br />
(still holding the ctrl key) and left click / drag<br />
the group even just the slightest bit...now<br />
release the mouse button.<br />
<br />
Ooops! More copies.....<br />
<br />
Maybe the following info will help:<br />
<br />
It happens occasionally to most anyone who<br />
is trying to multiple select by holding the Ctrl<br />
or Shift key while left clicking to select the<br />
image files.<br />
<br />
The copies are created when you fail to<br />
completely release the mouse button before<br />
you move the pointer to another file. If a group<br />
of selected files is dragged...even the slightest<br />
bit...releasing the mouse button will produce<br />
copies of all the previously highlighted files.<br />
<br />
It's somewhat easier if you have your Folder<br />
Options set to Single Click...this way you can<br />
select/deselect a file with just a mouse over<br />
and you don't have to click. For multiples you<br />
still have to hold...Ctrl or Shift.<br />
<br />
No click...no drag...no copy...maybe that's<br />
your solution. To adjust for single click...<br />
Open a folder and go to...Tools / Folder<br />
Options / General tab...tick..."Single Click<br />
To Open An Item" / Apply / OK.<br />
<br />
If you wish to delete all the files in a folder<br />
you could try the following:<br />
<br />
Go to...Edit / Select All...or type...Ctrl / A...<br />
<br />
With all files selected...go to...File / Delete...<br />
or press your Delete key...or...right click the<br />
group and choose "Delete".<br />
<br />
How to search for and delete unwanted "copies"<br />
of your image files.<br />
<br />
Open the folder that the images are saved in and<br />
left click the "Search" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
(If you are viewing the files from within an editing<br />
program and do not know where the folder is...right<br />
click one of the image files and from the menu...<br />
choose...Properties. The path to the folder will be<br />
on the "General" tab at "Location".)<br />
<br />
In the search pane...select..."All files and folders"<br />
<br />
In the "All or part of the file name" field...enter...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copy of<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Search" button.<br />
<br />
When the search is complete...go to...Edit / Select All...<br />
<br />
Then go to...File / Delete.<br />
<br />
You will see a dialog box asking you if you are sure<br />
you wish to delete the files...click Yes.<br />
<br />
Now...left click the "Back" button on your toolbar.<br />
<br />
Now the remaining files should be your originals.<br />
<br />
If you deleted the wrong files...recover them from<br />
your recycle bin now.<br />

<h2>            Vista Disk Repair not working and cannot fix disk error</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Hi. i have a disk error and my vista disk repair is not working and i don't know why. &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have tried the "disk repair" from the F12 boot menu and it also will not work.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Does anyone know an alternative solution for fixing the windows disk repair?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anyone know why it would stop working?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Also, i have a mysterious RED GLOW all over my screen and don't know if this is related to the disk repair not working?</strong></p>
<p><strong>It is causing system "black" screen. &nbsp;My main screen simply fades out to black and i have to restart computer and go through it all again and agian; checked the Direct X (up-to-date) and run hard drive diagnostic, but the diagnostic crashes because
 of hard drive error (related to disk repair?) &nbsp;what is the "RED" glow on my screen? &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks!!! for any input/advice!&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><span>Hi Nansye,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we troubleshoot the issue we need more information about the problem you are facing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>What is the exact error message you receive about the disk repair?</span></li><li><span>Since when are you facing this issue?</span></li><li><span>Did you make any changes to the computer before this issue started?</span></li><li><span>Are you able to boot to the desktop?</span></li><li><span>Do you have a Windows Vista installation DVD?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may receive the red glow due to various reasons like the Display drivers failure, Hardware problem
 in the Monitor or if there are any electronic gadgets interference.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to update the display drivers by download the latest drivers from the Computer
 manufacturers website and check if it helps to fix the red glow issue on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may access the link below and follow the steps to update display drivers on your computer and
 check if it helps. </span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that you do not have any other electronic items kept around the Monitor and try to keep
 them bit away from the computer. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If updating the drivers does not help, you may contact the Computer manufacturer to check if there
 are issues with the Monitor hardware and if it needs to be replaced. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also run Memory diagnostic tool on your computer and check if it helps.</span><span>Access
 the link below and follow the steps to run Windows Memory Diagnostic tool from WinRE.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>The limit is there to stop spammers.</p>

<li><span>Press <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Esc
</strong>and locate for <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> and click on
<strong>End task</strong>.</span></li><li><span>On top of the Task Manager click on
<strong>File</strong> and click on <strong>Run new task</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type <strong>explorer.exe</strong> inside the box and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the issue still persist try the below method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disconnect the external devices (printers, scanner, USB (universal serial bus) drives, etc...) except mouse and the keyboard and then boot up. Close all folder windows that are currently
 open and follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 loop of auto recovery- not working&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so the other day my laptop decided to do a new update- automatically! Which took over 9 hours to do. After it has finished its never been the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first time I turned the laptop on after the update I couldn't click on anything all I got was a loading curser. So I turned the laptop off. Ever since then it keep coming up automatic system repair. Which doesn't repair. I've literally tried everything on
 the troubleshooting page. The c drive is not a c drive instead an X drive which I cannot change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i don't have a recovery usb or dvd or anything like that and I don't know what to do!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone help me please&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            MOD XBOXS CHIPPED XBOXS AND GAME RELEASES</h2>
                    
<p>Hello x box community i am here to talk about a topic that has come to my attention in recent days</p>
<p>Should we all get modded boxs should we all buy early game releases&nbsp;from auction sites.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just to compete with other players on xbl i purchase my games from the shop and i buy a lot of em. I pay monthly membership and BUY&nbsp;games from marketplace and have sky
 player on my box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; i HAVE BEEN ON X BOX FOR YEARS BUT WHAT IS THE POINT.</p>
<p>&nbsp;When we run out in the bad weather &nbsp;buying games&nbsp; to compete with other xbl players.&nbsp;We got to midnight release say for a game like mw3 get them home and theres some cheating scum all ready prestiged. Why have a worldwide release if others on here are going
 to get chipped boxs and play the games 3 days earlyier than everybody else or game or gamestation amazon send the game out 2 days early there is no point in having a worldwide release theres no point having leaderboards why are we evening paying for xbl for
 the so called microsoft police to just sit there and do nothing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got banned for swearing and saying the word r**e but its ok to brake copywright laws or for shops to sell games early why do i bother.&nbsp;I have made 6 complaints just today will they fall on death ears. I know loads of people with chipped boxs thats&nbsp;there
 choice but if microsoft refuse to do something we may as well join em.</p>
<p>Why should we get slaughtered by people all ready unlocking all the perks guns and killstreaks when we are the ones paying all the money to microsoft and the game shops and standing in the cold&nbsp;&nbsp;i would like some kind of acknolgement from microsoft they
 even read the message cause i know nothing will get done</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got freinds on me list who have been playing mw3 for days not 1 ban but i get banned for swearing swearing aint against the law copywright is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Loads of my mates are all ready rank 50 some rank 28 we are all rank 1 it aint even out yet this
 is a joke microsoft need to do something or we should all go out and get modd boxs it only cost 70 bucks for the new slim line is that what microsoft want me to do</p>

<p>Hi sdanko,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p>This issue may occur if your game's installation is damaged (corrupted).</p>
<p>This error also comes up if we try to run 64 bit game in 32 bit Operating System.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Microsoft Windows XP</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, point to Settings, and then click Control Panel.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Double-click Add/Remove Programs.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of installed programs, click the game, and then click Add/Remove.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to uninstall the program, click Yes.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the removal process is complete, click Start, point to Find, and then click Files or Folders.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Named box, type "DungeonSiege.exe", "fs2002.exe", "train.exe", or "zoo.exe". Include the quotation marks.</p>
<p>Note The name of the executable you type in will depend on what game you have installed. The executable names match the following games:</p>
<p>Dungeon Siege = "DungeonSiege.exe"<br />
Flight Simulator 2002 = "fs2002.exe"<br />
Train Simulator = "train.exe"<br />
Zoo Tycoon = "zoo.exe"</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Look In box, click the hard disk where you installed the game, and then click Find Now.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the list of found files and folders, right-click the game executable file, and then click Delete.</p>
<p>If you are prompted to confirm the deletion, click Yes or click Yes to all.</p>
<p>Method 2: Empty the Temp folder</p>
<p>To empty the Temp folder and the Temporary Internet Files folder, use the Disk Cleanup tool. To do this, follow the steps for the operating system that you are using.</p>
<p>Windows XP</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, point to Programs, point to Accessories, point to System Tools, and then click Disk Cleanup.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click C: or click the drive where Windows XP is installed, and then click OK.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click to select the Temporary files check box.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK, and then click Yes to confirm the deletion.</p>
<p>Method 3:Restart the computer by performing a clean boot procedure</p>

<p>It isn't desktop manager as that doesn't control that function.</p>
<p>Right click on a blank spot on the desktop and select view and then make sure show desktop icons is checked.&nbsp; If not, check it and see if that resolves the problem.</p>
<p>Boot into safe mode and see if the icons are still missing or if they now appear.&nbsp; If they appear, that's a good sign.&nbsp; If not, it still helps us narrow down the cause.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, go to Start / &lt;username&gt; / Desktop and see if it contains any icons or files at all.&nbsp; If so, they just aren't reaching your desktop.&nbsp; If not, then we have a bigger problem because they have somehow disappeared.</p>
<p>Login as a different user and see if you have the same problem.&nbsp; If so, then there is probably some system problem.&nbsp; If not, your user profile may be corrupt.&nbsp;<span>To
 fix this use </span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></p>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with burning
 software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD
 (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></p>
<p><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption
 or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;desktop (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install,
 and run the following two programs:</span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;and</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span>
 and Avast at:</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span>. &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want
 to try the free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the
 options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, 
<span>try a clean boot&nbsp; </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's
 the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>My account was supposed to be unsuspended on the 7th of October. I can no longer apply for a case review and it no longer says the end date of my suspension because I am no longer supposed to be suspended. I still cannot play online and I can not get an
 answer from anyone else on this matter. If you are going to suspend me for something that I didn't do saying I was glitching in NHL when I was not and don't even know how I would, do not put a date and then don't un suspend me. Can my account please get fixed
 and un suspended. This is ridiculous now.</p>

<p>My account is supposed to be unsuspended so I can't make a post here with that account. It said on the enforcement website that it was to end on the 7th, now its still not unsuspended. I called xbox and they told me it was suspended until the 20th. I can't
 even submit a case review or I would as I was suspended based on someone who reported me for cheating in a game of NHL, when I was not. Its ridiculous how I can get suspended just like that because someone was mad I beat them in NHL. Still nothing has been
 done about this issue and Microsoft support just sends you in directions to get rid of you and doesn't actually help at all. Loyal customer for 8 years and now wondering why I still am.
