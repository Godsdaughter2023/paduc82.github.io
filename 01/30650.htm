<h2>            Keep uninstalling and re-installing network adapter</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a very annoying problem. My network card wasn't always finding connection so i tried to manually reset it. I found different answers on the web and tried uninstalling it and re-installing it which refreshes the visible networks in the bottom right
 corner. The silly thing is, i have to keep doing this every time my pc goes into sleep-modus and/or boots or i won't find any network connections...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have a suggestion how i can fix this permanently? I hate installing/re-installing the network adapter and looking for the wifi-password every time i close my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ps. Working on an Asus K-73S laptop with 802.11n wireless card and an Atheros AR8151 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet (N.DIS 620)</p>

            <p>Hi Robin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on the Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are experiencing issues using the network adapter. Let me try and assist you with the issue you are facing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are facing this even when you restart the computer, then, sometimes it could be a corrupt network adapter that is causing this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you tried installing the latest wireless network adapter driver from Asus website after you uninstall it?</p>
<p>2. Do other wireless devices stay connected?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should help you for wireless connection issues waking up from Sleep Mode:</p>
I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b. And go to <strong>
Network adapter </strong>and expand it.&nbsp;<br />
c. Right-click on the wireless device and choose <strong>Properties.&nbsp;</strong><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">d. Click on the <strong>
Power Management </strong>tab.</span>
<p>e. Uncheck<span style="color: rgba(15, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;the option </span>
<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the article:</p>

            <p>Hi Robin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have caused due to corrupted Network Adapter drivers. I suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and then try install the Network Adapter driver and check if the issue persists. Make sure that you restart your computer after
 installing the Network Adapter drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the following Microsoft Support article to place the computer in clean boot state.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> After clean boot troubleshooting step, refer to the section "<strong>How to reset the computer to
 start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong>" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
Please reply with the status of the issue so that we can help you better.

<p>When I had the original windows 10 and it was all there like it has been for decades. Now all of a sudden I get the newest update on windows 10 and networking went to sh88. NO other computers. Been sharing between computers and now they are gone. By by.
 Apparently Microsoft in all of their wisdom decided to just eliminate file sharing and networking. I have not been able to find a work around.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
There is a definite known issue with peer networking in Windows 10 and there has been ever since HomeGroup Support was removed.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>Here are a couple of tricks that might help. </span><br />
<br />
<span>In File Explorer - Right Click on This PC - Map a network drive - map each computer's Z: drive to C: drive on that same computer.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>Z: </span><br />
<br />
<span>\\Computer1's name\C: </span><br />
<br />
<span>\\Computer2's name\C: </span><br />
<br />
<span>Then map the other computers drive to each computer as needed. </span><br />
<br />
<span>Such as : </span><br />
<br />
<span>M: drive on Computer2 to Computer1's C: drive </span><br />
<br />
<span>\\Computer1's name\C: </span><br />
<br />
<span>then M: on Computer1 to Computer 2's C: drive <br />
<br />
<br />
<span>M: drive on Computer2 to Computer1's C: drive </span><br />
<br />
<span>(You usually can map all the drives you have.) </span><br />
<br />

    <title>How to reduce the size and frequency of Windows updates. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reduce the size and frequency of Windows updates.</h2>
                    <p>I have noticed it seems about once a week there is over 900MB of "important" updates released for windows 8.1. I am wondering why they are so large and so frequent. I am a volunteer at an NGO nonprofit in Africa and my internet is over the Vodacom Cellular
 network. These massive updates take me days to fully download and eat up huge chunks of my available data. I&nbsp;installed 8.1 Pro and Office 13 Pro while I was in America and it was troubling to download over a measured Satellite Internet service due to the limited
 bandwidth allowed, but it is a major problem here in Africa.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that can be done to reduce the size and frequency of updates? At least the size. It seems i am downloading enough to completely install windows every two weeks to a month.<br />
<br />

</span><span>Windows Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience. We keep an update
 history in Windows Update so that you can check which updates were installed and when. You can also use this list to remove specific updates, but it's usually not a good idea to remove them unless you have a specific reason. Windows Update helps keep your
 PC safer—and your software current—by fetching the latest security and feature updates from Microsoft via the Internet.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

    <title>Mouse does not appear in Mouse and Keyboard Center - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david__l  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mouse does not appear in Mouse and Keyboard Center</h2>
                    <p>I have a Microsoft Natural Wireless Laser Mouse 6000 that worked with no problems in Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I recently upgraded to Windows 10 and now the mouse no longer appears in my Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center (MKC). &nbsp;The MKC shows my Microsoft Sculpt Keyboard
 just fine, but not my mouse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried every option I found listed in other threads in this forum, but none worked. &nbsp;This includes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;Plug the device into another port</p>
<p>2) Uninstall and Reinstall MKC</p>
<p>3) Uninstall the drivers from Device Manager and restart.</p>
<p>4) Restart and Restart and then Restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few important notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The Mouse functions perfectly in the OS, but it doesn't show up in MKC so I can't change the settings and button options. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2) The mouse appears in Device Manager twice which I thought was odd. Both are just called "HID-compliant mouse" but when I open the properties, one has Location "on Microsoft Hardware USB Mouse" and the other one has location "on Microsoft Hardware USB
 Mouse"</p>
<p>3) Every single post I came across on the Microsoft forums told the user to "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;update to the latest Keyboard drivers from the manufacturer website" but the manufacturer in this case is
 Microsoft, and when I tried download drivers for it, all that was listed was the "Mouse and Keyboard Center" software (</span>http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/natural-wireless-laser-mouse-6000).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know what I need to do to get my mouse to show up in the MKC. &nbsp;Thanks!<br />
<br />

            Hi sambay,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Forum.<br />
<br />
When you mentioned slow, is it the Internet connection that is slow or the performance of your machine?<br />
<br />
I would recommend you the below methods:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the computer performance has improved. These options load a minimal set of drivers. You can use these options to start Windows.&nbsp; Steps to boot the computer in safe mode environment are<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart the computer<br />
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start tapping F8 key<br />
iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get advanced boot option window<br />
iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using the arrow key select the option “Safe mode”<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> <br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the performance has improved then some third party software might be causing the issue, boot the computer in clean boot and check which third party software is causing the problem. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows
 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
Steps to perform clean boot and check if you have the issue.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or&nbsp; click Continue.<br />
iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then click Disable All.<br />
vi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click OK.<br />
vii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
viii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party is causing the problem, referring the link given below: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135 &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong> <br />
<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
iii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
iv.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Turbo C++ is a DOS application and such an application can't be run in a 64Bit Windows. This is a limitation of the CPU mode.</p>
<p>Run Turbo C++ with DOSBox [1].</p>

    <title>Windows Store Apps have been frozen at installing for the past week - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Store Apps have been frozen at installing for the past week</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try to install an app from the windows store it starts installing. Then the bar gets to about 75% of the way there and freezes at installing. It has been frozen for the past week and I have cleared the windows store cache and troubleshooted it,
 but they never seem to fix anything. Then I restarted my PC but that didn't help. It was fine before because before I was downloading minecraft for windows 10 and it loaded in 30 seconds. Then I deleted it recently for space and now it's stuck on installing.
 Is there any other ways I can fix this because it has been stuck for a week.</p>

            Hello Arham.  I'm Greg, an 8 year Microsoft Windows MVP, here to help you.

In Windows 10 everything depends on the  quality of the install, which is the reason most enthusiasts won't ever run an Upgrade or Factory install.  Please work through the Windows 10 Performance and Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs are done:  http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00

If any steps cannot be performed then try whichever method works to enter Safe Mode with Networking at http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html which may work better to perform all of the steps, or from the Advanced Startup Options listed at  https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html use the Command Prompt at boot to run Repair Commands in the Che

            Hey there, Arham!
Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. I'm Nathan, one of the community experts, and will try and help you with your question. 

I would recommend removing the app packages. You can do this by following these instructions below: 
1.Right click onto Start menu Icon, 
2.Select PowerShell Admin - or search PowerShell Admin in Cortana, search bar near start, 
3.Enter the following text: Get-AppxPackage *windowsstore* | Remove-AppxPackage
4.Restart your computer, after it has removed the app packages, 
5.Go back into Windows PowerShell Admin again, 
6.Enter the following text: Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers| Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
7.Wait for the packages to be added again
Note: Don't panic when you see red writing. This means they are already on the computer and can not be added as they will be duplicates :), 
8.launch the Xbox App again once everything has finished loading and being added. 

Let me know

            Hi , this is Andre from the Microsoft Community. 

Lets see if we can get your problem resolved.

Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.

Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
Scroll down to the bottom
Click Windows Store Apps

Click Run the troubleshooter

When complete try opening the Store again.

Also check if the Store works in another user account. 

Press Windows key + R
Type: wsreset.exe
Hit Enter

Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.

Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 

Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update. 

Best,
Andre

            <p>No. None of the steps suggested by Amit were useful. However, I myself did some research and found out this is usually an issue with Killer Wireless Modems. My bluetooth keeps disappearing and appearing on its own. What I've noticed is, once I unplug my
 laptop from all peripherals (including power adapter) and restart it a few times, the bluetooth reappears. Try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And oh, this method only works with default Razer provided bluetooth drivers. I don't know if it will work with other drivers from Killer networking website itself.</p>

            <p>Hi Amit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I tried installing the driver in compatibility mode. However it gave the exact same results as when it is installed without compatibility mode. The Bluetooth would appear and then disappear (this means from everywhere, device manager, control panel,
 action center etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now as of writing this reply, it has disappeared again. I know that once I restart my PC after disconnecting all peripherals etc., it will appear again. However this means that I can never use a bluetooth device for long because it will end up getting
 disconnected in the middle. This issue, as I know it, only happens on Windows 10 with Killer Network Modems.</p>

            <p>I have found a solution to this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Install Windows 10 Anniversary Update</p>
<p>2. Go to Device Manager</p>
<p>3. Right click on Qualcomm Aetheros Bluetooth Driver</p>
<p>4. Go to Power Management Tab</p>
<p>5. Uncheck the option to allow the computer to power off this device</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, my bluetooth hasn't disappeared even once.</p>

<p>I bought a Razer Blade Signature Laptop (2016 version with pre-loaded Windows 10) from the Microsoft Store. Bluetooth was working fine on it till some updates took place and it complete disappeared from the system. It's not there in device manager, settings,
 action center etc. I completely reset windows 10 using the recovery tool and bluetooth started working again (thus it is not a hardware issue). However, again it disappeared after a few updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. This is highly upsetting considering signature laptops are supposed to work the best right out of box!</p>

<p>I strongly suggest you go to &nbsp; www.broadcom.com/support/bluetooth &nbsp; , pick the appropriate driver from the list,download and install. I'm fairly confident this fix will work for you but fingers crossed anyway.</p>

<p>No - No Man's Sky on Xbox One, and here's why.<br />
First Class Treatment. AKA&nbsp;Microsoft's strict launch&nbsp;parity&nbsp;policy,<br />
So I will start by explaining what this means.<br />
<span>Microsoft's strict launch&nbsp;parity&nbsp;policy, which means that Xbox must have first or equal rights to a game’s release date or no Xbox release at all.&nbsp;which means that Xbox must have first or equal rights to a game’s release date or no Xbox release at all.<br />
<span>Microsoft's strict launch&nbsp;parity&nbsp;policy, which means that Xbox must have first or equal rights to a game’s release date or no Xbox release at all.&nbsp;which means that Xbox must have first or equal rights to a game’s release date or no Xbox release at all.<br />
Which I think is redundant. If you wanted us to feel like first class you would not care when the game is&nbsp;released on your console, but you would make sure that these awesome games are released on your console period, knowing it would bring more player's back
 to your console.<br />
Now I have to buy either&nbsp;a PS4 or new graphic card for my PC, and I'm thinking of buying the PS4. Because my PC simply just suck's and I think it needs more than a graphic card, so the cheaper route&nbsp;is to buy the PS4.<br />
<br />
So here is some more info on the matter at hand, about why we won't get No Man's Sky.&nbsp;<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
"There may be a chance for&nbsp;</span><a href="http://gamerant.com/tag/no-mans-sky/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>No Man’s Sky</em></a><span>&nbsp;to make it to Microsoft’s flagship console, however. Chris Charla, the director of&nbsp;</span><span>ID@Xbox, has recently said the he “would love to
 see”&nbsp;</span><em>No Man’s Sky</em><span>&nbsp;on the Xbox One. Charla was speaking on&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XpChhfWBIc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em>The Inner Circle</em>&nbsp;podcast</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/4XpChhfWBIc?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/4XpChhfWBIc?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div><span>, and revealed that a workaround for the launch parity clause
 could be found if Hello Games&nbsp;wanted to discuss a Xbox One release."<br />
<span>"The comments seem to contradict the previous Microsoft party line, particularly when&nbsp;</span><a href="http://gamerant.com/tag/hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hello Games</a><span>&nbsp;has made&nbsp;</span><em>No Man’s Sky’s</em><span>&nbsp;release schedule well-known for some time.

 Charla did explain a little further about how the space exploration title could make its way onto the Xbox One. He stated that</span><span>ID@Xbox is willing to find a middle ground with developers who would find sticking to the launch parity policy difficult.
 “When we talk to developers, we try to be really transparent,” said Charla."<br />
<br />
<span>"Charla’s comments continue the trend that sees Microsoft’s launch policy grow softer and softer.

Apparently, Microsoft is more than willing to
 reach a compromise when developers are struggling with either time or financial constraints. It appears that a situation with resource management will not cause a game to lose out&nbsp;on an eventual Xbox One release."<br />
<span><br />
<span><br />
A link for, this article ^ : http://gamerant.com/microsoft-no-mans-sky-xbox-one/<br />
<br />
So I thought of a way to give&nbsp;<span>Phil Spencer and&nbsp;Chris Charla, well all of Microsoft a better understanding by making this forum for you the players of Xbox.<br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span>I'd like you all to reply with how you feel about Microsoft's&nbsp;strict launch&nbsp;parity&nbsp;policy, which means that Xbox must have first or equal rights to a game’s release date or no Xbox release at all. By you commenting
 No more first class treatment and maybe some detail as to why, if you feel like it. Or yes first class treatment and maybe some detail, if you feel like it.<br />
Hopefully, Microsoft will learn this is a tearable policy, and that we Xbox&nbsp;gamers don't like it.<br />
I hope you agree and have a nice day.&nbsp;<br />
For all, I won't be replying to any comment this is my opinion.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I don't think this is really policy anymore. There are plenty of indie games that aren't strictly on Xbox One at the same time as their PS4 launch, or PC for that matter. And there's no way a "must-have" title like Rocket League would be denied.</p>
<p>As for No Man's Sky, well it is more cerebral as a game so even if it did get an Xbox One port I don't think that it would find a big audience here. Plus, for some people they are learning that they are more in love with the concept of the game than the
 actual game itself; It is a technical achievement and a landmark game, but it's not fun for everyone.</p>

    <title>Xbox One will not stay synced with controllers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidt87  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One will not stay synced with controllers</h2>
                    
<p>Ever since I bought my Xbox One In June of 2015, it has had controller connectivity issues. &nbsp;At first I thought it was the controller that came with the system (the old style of controller that came with a 500 GB Master Chief Collection Bundle), so I went
 out and bought a new controller with the 3.5 mm jack on it. &nbsp;That same day, the issues happened with the new controller.</p>
<p><strong>The system "forgets" my controller while it is off and then the controller can't start the system. &nbsp;Even if that doesn't happen, the controller will come disconnected during the game. &nbsp;Batman, Halo MCC, Halo 5, Rare Replay... it doesn't matter.</strong></p>
<p>I have tried every step in this link multiple times:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-disconnects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/accessories/wireless-controller-disconnects</a>. &nbsp;I am now on my second
 replacement Xbox One and the issue persists. &nbsp;In addition to the steps in the link above, I have switched routers, router distance form the system, and have changed my internet connection to the system from wireless to wired. &nbsp;I even moved from an apartment
 into a house one city over! &nbsp;I can only conclude that nothing external is interfering with my controllers and that it must be the system's WiFi Direct board.</p>
<p>What more can I do? &nbsp;I've sent in my system twice and the problem isn't fixed. &nbsp;Why isn't Microsoft being more proactive in fixing this issue, especially when it seems like many others are experiencing it?</p>
<p>The below is from the "Misses Joust" thread where she specified including this information in new posts.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>What exactly is happening with your controller?</strong>&nbsp;Disconnecting, won't connect, shutting down? Tell us what's going on and how frequently.
</li><li><strong>Does it happen during a specific activity?</strong>&nbsp;If the issue only crops up while playing a certain game or app, include that in your post.
</li><li><strong>Does it happen with multiple controllers?&nbsp;</strong>If you have a second controller or if you can borrow one, try it on your console and see if it behaves the same way.
</li><li><strong>What have you tried so far?&nbsp;</strong>Please be specific and list the steps you've done. Saying "everything" may result in us asking you to repeat stuff you've already tried.
</li></ul>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 does not lock when closing LID, screen does not turn on when opening LID</h2>
                    <p>I have exchanged my SP3 and type cover 3 times. &nbsp;The issue remains. &nbsp;I have also reset multiple times and repatched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I close the LID and wait 2 minutes and reopen the lid my device is not locked. &nbsp;It goes right back to Windows. &nbsp;This is not right. &nbsp; I have checked my settings and my device is set to sleep on lid close or button press. &nbsp;My power settings say to lock
 and request password on wake up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when I open the LID after it has been closed for awhile nothing happens. &nbsp;If I press a key the keyboard lights up but the screen stays dark. &nbsp;If I then press the power button the screen finally comes on. &nbsp;This doesn't appear right either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what to do here. &nbsp;I've got a stack of these that my company wants to deploy but the two I have unboxed are a mess after multiple resets and replacements. &nbsp;The firmware updates from yesterday did not resolve anything other than I can finally
 connect to 5GHZ networks at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my sleep settings are normal, triple checked, and the defaults on an SP3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have HyperV installed. &nbsp;I have no software other than Office 2013 and a few other simple apps.</p>

<h2>            Win 8.1 Boots to black screen w&#47;cursor only</h2>
                    <p>I have been having multiple problems lately with my Windows 8.1.&nbsp; It started when I would click on Windows Explorer and it would start and I would get a message saying that it had stopped working and was restarting.&nbsp; Then the screen would change back to
 the desktop and no Windows Explorer.&nbsp; If I go to the windows 8.1 graphical screen and start Win. Explorer it would start, but if I used the right mouse key it would stop again and try to restart with no success.&nbsp; Then I started to get a blus screen with the
 message of a dump and driver power state failure.&nbsp; I would retart the computer and it would be OK until a little later, when it would go to sleep the dump and blue screen would appear again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, when I boot up, all I get is a black screen with a cursor.&nbsp; I used a system restore to fix the black screen, but now it has happened again.&nbsp; I have tried several restore points, but none of them will work.&nbsp; I tried to refresh the system, but do not
 have any Windows 8.1 installation disk to use when asked for in the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea hoe I can get my desktop working again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a home&nbsp;made system using an Asus motherboard, Intel 4 core processor, 8 GB ram, Nvidia Video card (1 GB).&nbsp; I upgraded fron Windows 7 to Windows 8 to Windows 8.1(with a download from Microsoft).</p>

            <p><span>Hi David,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>What was the full error message displayed in Blue screen?</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue occur due to some corrupt driver of system files, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since you are unable to boot to the desktop now, we will need a Windows 8.1 repair disk or installation disk to perform any troubleshooting steps. If you don’t have a Windows 8.1 installation disk, then you can use the Windows 8 disk which
 will reset the computer back to windows 8. Once we troubleshoot the issue, you can again update to Windows 8.1.
</span><span>If you don’t have a Windows 8 disc, I would suggest you to download the Windows 8 installation files from another computer through this link and choose to create an installation media when the upgrade assistant prompts.
</span></p>
<p>

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After you have a Windows 8 installation disc, follow these steps: &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>When your computer starts, wait for the manufacturer logo to&nbsp;check the option for boot menu, it will usually be F12.
</span></li><li><span>The boot menu key might differ with each manufacturer. If you&nbsp;are unable to find the boot menu key, you may refer the user manual.</span></li><li><span>Restart the computer, when the manufacturer's logo is&nbsp;displayed, keep pressing the Boot menu option key to enter the boot menu&nbsp;and change the boot option to CD\DVD ROM.
</span></li><li><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair&nbsp;Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot&nbsp;from CD or DVD". Press any key.
</span></li><li><span>Select the correct time and Keyboard type. </span>
</li><li><span>Click Repair your computer in the lower left corner
</span></li><li><span>Click on Troubleshoot and then select ‘reset your PC’.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persist in Windows 8, you can once again update to Windows 8.1 by downloading the update from Windows store. Try these steps and let us know the results.</span></p>

            <p>Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the sugestions. &nbsp;I have been able to get 8.1 back, but I'm still having problems with receiving a blue screen and a dump with the note "Driver Power State Failure". &nbsp;I can then restart my pc and it comes up OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also facing a problem where when I click on Windows Explorer on the task bar on the Desktop, it tells me that explorer is shutting down, then that explorer is restarting but nothing happens. &nbsp;If I go the the graphical Windows 8.1 page and select Windows
 Explorer from the Start Page, it comes up and I can use it, but if I right click on anything it shuts down again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can offer any help on these problems, I would appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>The error message </span><span>DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE is displayed when is in an inconsistent or invalid power state. This could occur of a driver is corrupt or incompatible. I would suggest you to boot the computer in a
 clean boot state and check if the issue persists. If the issue doesn’t occur in a clean boot state, then it means that one of the third party services that was disabled in clean boot state caused the issue. Refer to this article to boot the computer in a clean
 boot state:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: If the issue doesn’t occur in clean boot state, refer to the ‘More info’ section to identify the driver causing the issue. After troubleshooting, reset the computer to start as usual. Refer to the step
<em>How to set the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting</em> under more information.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue occurred in clean boot state, then we will need to check the dump files to find out more information about the driver causing this issue. You can refer to this article for collecting the DUMP files:</span></p>

<br />
<br />It depends, can you please explain more about the corruption you are experiencing in Windows 10 that is requiring you to re-install Windows - what are the symptoms you are seeing . . .

            Hi.
<br />
<br />You have to check the Hard Disk and the Ram memory, for that you have to create USB to boot with the USB and be able to make the diagnosis.

            Well symptoms like blue screen error and sometimes black screen error. A few months ago my system was in same conditions then i changed my hdd then everything was fine and my windows didn't get corrupted for like 4 months and then suddenly it's in the
 same condition. And a new problem i have faced for a couple of times reinstalling Windows is it gets very slow at getting started. I don't know what's the problem.<br />

            Hi Kevin, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<p>What you describe are the results of things you are doing incorrectly on the computer. Windows doesn't produce blue screens or black screens by itself. I have two suggestions for you:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Find out whether or not your hardware is supported on Windows 10. If the hardware manufacturers have decided
<em>not</em> to support their hardware on Windows 10, it's only a matter of time before the hardware stops working properly, and there's nothing that you or Microsoft can do about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes there is a work-around that can keep unsupported hardware working for a while, but first you have to find out which hardware component(s) are unsupported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- [If all your hardware is supported,] backup all your personal files and do a clean install of Windows. This gives you a fresh start. Going forward&nbsp;<em>don't make any changes</em> until you have done thorough research on the internet to be sure that you
 are doing the right thing and in the right way.</p>

<br />you may run memory test (built-in or third party), you may check drive smart using third-party programs e.g. CrystalDsikInfo.
<br />I hope you do not use any programs for Windows "cleaning" and "optimization".

            Try entering Safe Mode with network function.
<br />
<br />Interrupt the normal boot process of your Windows 10 PC
<br />If Windows 10 fails to boot normally three times over, the fourth time it enters by default in an Automatic Repair mode. Using this mode, you can boot into Safe Mode. To trigger the Automatic Repair mode, you must interrupt the normal boot process three consecutive times: use the reset or the power button on your Windows 10 PC to stop it during boot, before it finishes loading Windows 10. If you use the power button, you might have to keep it pressed for at least 4 seconds to force the power off
<br />Then you proceed to repair the computer:
<br />With a reset, all of your Installed applications are lost, but you get an option to save your files if you want. If a system image from the OEM exists-called a recovery partition, then it also gives you an option to restore it. It would make your PC load to default factory settings.
<br />Navigate to Troubleshooting section, again.
<br />Select Reset.
<br />If you select keep my files, your files would be kept. You might also get the third option-restore to factory settings-which isn’t applicable on the PC.
<br />After selecting the desired options, you are presented with a confirmation, something like this- This indicates what you have chosen. 
<br />Click on Reset and the resetting should begin.

If the video hardware is not supported by the manufacturer under Windows 8... You could be out of luck.&nbsp; Given you say you went from Windows XP to Windows 8 - there is a distinct possibility that is an old enough machine for this to be the case.<br />

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>I moved this thread to our Xbox One support forums for better visibility. This update error was likely due to our service interruption we had yesterday.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, turn on your Xbox One consoles, give the first time set up another go, and post back to let us know how it goes! :)</p>

    <title>my msdos program used to run full-screen in Windows XP. Now it - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            my msdos program used to run full-screen in Windows XP. Now it occupies the top third of the full screen with the rest scrollable and black.</h2>
                    My old MS-Dos program ran full-screen in earlier versions of Windows, including earlier versions of Windows XP. Due to something in one of the updates it now occupies the top third only in full-screen mode, with the rest of the screen black, blank, and
 scrollable (like the Windows XP version of the command prompt has always been). How do I get back to a usable full-screen version (i.e., the previous version of MS-Dos)?
