<h2>            This is supposed to be free&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK, here's the story, I bought a PC in 2009 from Cyberpower PC with Windows XP on it. About two years later I bought a perfectly legit copy of Windows 7 and installed a clean install of that on a new hard drive, keeping my Windows XP too. Then in 2013 I
 decided to upgrade to all SSD drives. I cloned the Windows 7 and XP using cloning software onto SSDs. Then only about a month ago, I decided to upgrade Windows 7 to an even newer and much bigger Crucial SSD, so I cloned Windows 7 again.&nbsp; So my copy of Windows
 7 ended up being a clone of a clone of a clone copy. But still that's perfectly legal since this was only on one desktop PC all along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I go to upgrade to Windows 10 and now cannot activate it and it wants me to pay $199.00 to activate. Here's the story on my upgrade, I originally got the little update tray icon for the update but was impatient and went to a Microsoft webpage that
 allows you to download and copy the Windows 10 installation to either a USB drive or a DVD. This is also supposed to be free, just another way to do it is all. I decided on the DVD ISO image since I had dozens of DVD-Rs from years back that I never used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, when I tried to boot into the DVD it would not allow me to do the regular upgrade over the top of the Windows 7 for some reason. Then I tried to do the fresh install but even that did not work at first. I finally was able to get that to work after
 it allowed me reformat the entire SSD. Of course that meant curtain for the old Windows 7, so I can't go back to that. But now my copy of Windows 10 is not activated even though my entire path over the years was buying legit copies of Windows software!!! My
 ex-wife apparently took that old Windows 7 DVD with the activation license product key as I can't find it anywhere. So that further complicates everything naturally.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both the tech support call back where you give them your phone number and also the chat with a rep. but I never get a response since MS is apparently inundated with Windows 10 support problems. What to do??</p>

<h2>            I have the black CMD box flashing on the screen every few minutes</h2>
                    whilst browsing I get the black CMD box flashing for a micro second in the top left of the screen, this happens on my Dell laptop and my wifes Acer laptop, both run windows 7.......the box flashes every few minutes.......I googled it and there were lots
 of references and youtube videos...but none helped, I have tried a scan with Malwarebytes, adw/malware, Rkill, and AGV, and they find nothing....I looked at all my installs and there is nothing there that shouldn't be.......I looked at the task manager/sceduler
 and again nothing there ....if you put this..............

Black "command prompt" windows keep flashing open &amp; closing immediately
<p>into google you will see some discussion......all of it useless......all the cures I have found simply do not cure the problem....I would love to hear from someone who has cured the problem......thanks Alan</p>

            <p>This can be many things that may cause this. Sometimes the legitimate program apps loads on through the use of the CMD. in other cases, since you mentioned that it occurs not only on your laptop but your wife's laptop too. If this occurs when you are browsing
 online, then I suspect that there is an undetected malware on it. It could possibly be installed. A snapshot of installed apps would be very helpful in determining the cause of the CMD box showing up in split seconds. A file may still exist in the 'Program
 Files' folder as well. A snapshot of that would be helpful also. If installed, go into the 'Control Panel' and click on 'Programs and Features'. It will show you the list of installed apps. One or more could be illegitimate apps which needs to be uninstalled
 or&nbsp;to get rid of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to do a snapshot, look at your keyboard and at the top row, find this key, 'Prt Scr'. Make sure you have the 'Programs and Features' box appearing on your desktop to show the installed apps. With this image, I can tell you what shouldn't be on your laptop
 and same with your wife's laptop. Do the same with the 'Program Files' folder. Get into your 'C:' drive and look in the list for 'Program Files' and open that up. Keep it opened and do a snapshot. Then upload your snapshots here. Click on the icon towards
 the right side of your response box. (Second icon from the right side.) Then upload your images to here. I will then&nbsp;determine what is there that is causing the CMD box to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will receive this notification once you respond and I will work with you in resolving this problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi I tried to take a snapshot but the text did not show.....BUT.....I had Dell remotely access my Lpatop, and uninstall 2 programs, they just said they were unnecessary but not harmful, Dell maintained it was that my laptop did not have the required Windows
 updates there were 197 !!...I installed all of them, and its still doing it....I have to say that I have looked at all the programs etc, and both Dell and I say there is absolutely nothing there other that totally acceptable ones.....I also ran malwarebytes,
 Rkill, and AVG, and they found nothing.....interestingly mine Dell flashes the CMD box up only once maybe in an hour and very fast indeed......on the other hand on my wifes Acer, the problem is much worse, again I have done all the check as on my Dell, and
 nothing has helped, that laptop flashes its cmd box up every 5 minutes and for a bit longer maybe a fifth of a second, still cant read whats there, I have 3 other laptops in the house and they all work fine.......There are lots of entries on both youtube and
 google about this problem....and many fixes, I have tried them all.....and none work, this is not an uncommon problem....on my wifes I even did a factory reset and the problem is still there.......where can I go next ?????</p>
<p>thanks again Alan</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I forgot to mention that after you do the snapshot, you would need to open up 'Paint' from the 'Start' menu. When you open up 'Paint', you right-click on the blank area and select 'Paste'. The snapshot will appear. Then you choose 'Save as' from 'File' at
 the top of the 'Paint' app&nbsp;and name the images. They can be saved to your desktop by directing them there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for giving more details so that I can understand it a little better. There seems to be a little "program" that is hidden in the 'Program Files' folder that can cause the CMD to pop up. That would need to be deleted out of there. It could reside
 somewhere else. One little question to ask you, does it occur only when you open up your browser to surf online or does it occur every time when you use your laptop? This will help me determine where this little 'software' might be. There are other possibilities
 that this&nbsp;might be resolved.</p>

            <p>Hi thanks for your kind reply......it happens while using the internet, say I am using ebay, for no good reason it pops up, you dont need to be doing anything specific, you will be using ebay, and anthing from 2 minutes to 30 minutes the CMD box will pop
 up...its impossible to make it pop up....ie I tried by loading say 10 windows open, and then cancelling them one by one and all in one go, nothing you do actually makes it pop up, it does it purely at random, for no reason, I have 2 other laptops and they
 do not have the problem, and on my wifes I did a full factory reset and that did not help, I was wondering if a virgin new copy of windows 7, the SSD wiped clean of everything, and then all the drivers put back in, might that work, or maybe ???? its a hardware
 problem. but then its odd its in 2 laptops and we dont share them....all very odd ?????</p>
<p>thanks again</p>

            Just a thought, if one wiped the SSD clean, and put back in the operating system (Win7) and all the laptop drivers, would that get rid of the problem, or could it be more deep rooted ????

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, you shouldn't have to go through all that process. What you have described was that it appears that the undetected malware is affecting the Internet Explorer browser. It is a simple matter of cleaning it up. What I can help you with is to do a step-by-step
 process to clean up the Internet Explorer. This also involves resetting the Internet Explorer as well. Follow these steps and you will be on your way to having a smooth Internet Explorer without that CMD box pestering you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1.) Go to the 'Control Panel' and click on 'Internet Options'. In the 'Internet Properties', go to 'Browsing History'. Make sure the following are check marked, then&nbsp;click on the 'Delete' button:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Temporary Internet Files</p>
<p>*Cookies and Website Files</p>
<p>*History</p>
<p>*Download History</p>
<p>*Tracking Protection, Active X Filtering, and Do Not Track.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2.)&nbsp; There are tabs at the top of the 'Internet Properties', click on the 'Advanced' tab.&nbsp; At the bottom, you will notice a section that says 'Reset Internet Explorer Settings'. Click on the 'Reset' button. It may tell you to restart your laptop. Do
 that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 3.) Do only if the CMD box is still persistent. &nbsp;Go to the 'C:' drive. Look for the 'Program Files' folder and click on that. Next, look for the 'Internet Explorer' folder. Open that up. Look for 'iediagcmd'. This is a diagnostic tool for Internet Explorer.
 Click on that. It will start the diagnostic to check for any errors and issues. It then perform the repair. (Make sure that the Internet Explorer is closed before you run this diagnostic tool.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure that there is no foreign 'software' files sitting in the 'Internet Explorer' folder. If so, delete it. I will show you a snapshot of the legitimate files belonging to Internet Explorer so that you can match them up with what should be there
 and what should not be there.</p>

            If this still does not resolve that problem, the issue&nbsp;would be the 'Internet Explorer' shortcut being affected. You would need to delete that shortcut and create a new one. While in the 'Internet Explorer' folder, look for an icon "iexplore". Right-click
 on it and a small menu appears. Select 'Send to' then 'Desktop' (Create shortcut). You may have the Internet Explorer icon in your taskbar and you can right-click on it to remove it. (That icon in the taskbar would also be affected.) Your created shortcut
 on your desktop can be pinned to the taskbar simply by right-clicking on it and select 'Pin to taskbar'. Hopefully that should do the job for you in getting rid of the pesky CMD box if only still persistent. &nbsp;

            I have at last found the page of your screenshot, and clicked on the iediagcmd...and all I get is an empty box....and cannot write anything in the box....and the box just disappears after 3 seconds.......I did the reset as in your step 2.......I also did
 an AVG scan of my files and nothing shows.....but so far today I have not seen the pesky CMD box, but it has a bad habit of disappearing for hours then starts popping up again...we will see...tks Alan

<p><strong><span><span>Hi dave1coleman,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>a. Does the issue persist with other players (media center)?</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong><br />
Let’s run Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter that checks for common issues, such as making sure you have both a DVD drive and the correct DVD decoder installed on your computer.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the search box, type troubleshooter, and then click Troubleshooting. Click View all, and then click Windows Media Player DVD.</span></p>
<p><span>Access the below link for more information on Windows Media Player DVD troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-DVD-troubleshooter</span></a></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>I also suggest that you check Event Viewer entries to find the faulty module that could be causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools, and then
 double-clicking Event Viewer.‌ </span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click an event log in the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Double-click an event to view the details of the event and let us know the faulty module that is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Access the below links to know more about Event Viewer:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</span></span></a><br />

<p>I've been using the above version on my previous computer running Windows 7. I've now upgraded to a new computer running Windows 10 and it will not load with an error message that states that my IE Version is incorrect.</p>
<p>How can I trade the above version of Picture It for a newer version that will work with Window 10.</p>

<h3> daniel_h212  say:</h3>
<h2>            File System Error &#40;-1073741521&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have been having issues with my laptop (a Dell Inspiron using Windows 10 Home), so that whenever I try to open certain .exe files (I do not know the distinction between files that return errors and files that open properly), a file system error&nbsp;(-1073741521)
 pops up. As far as I know all installers have stopped working on my laptop, taskmanager and regedit also pop up with similar errors, photos and movies do not work, though mspaint and windows media player can still play the same files. The taskbar functions,
 but I cannot type anything in the search bar, nor any wifi passwords. I cannot type anything in settings, either, though all settings that do not require typing still functions.</p>
<p>Android studio IDE installer in particular returned an error after the file systems error stating that it aborted the installation because it could not request administrator privileges.</p>
<p>Any idea how to fix? The only thing I seem to be able to start at the moment is command prompt and powershell through the use of control R or shift right clicking in a folder, but I do not appear to have admin privileges with those either.</p>
<p>When I attempted to reset my PC (without erasing files), it aborted at around 32 percent (maybe higher, I wasn't playing attention) stating that it encountered an error (not specified).</p>

<p>I tried to reset my laptop without erasing files, but it encountered an error and failed. Secure boot failed saying a boot drive could not be found, but I could boot again once I switched secure boot off.</p>
<p>The tool you mentioned didn't help because I could not seem to obtain administrator privileges in any way whatsoever. If you have any ideas please let me know.</p>
<p>This is what happens when I try to open command prompt with admin privileges:<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>With the issue description, I understand that the maps app and maps do not work after installing<em> Windows 10 operating system</em>. I will certainly help you with the query.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue might be occurring because of </span><span>any corruption in the system/program files. To diagnose the issue let’s try the below steps
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">and check if the issue appears there as well.</span></p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>The <strong>app troubleshooter</strong> can automatically detect and fix most of the incorrect settings and errors that could cause issues with applications. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter.</span></span></p>

<p>I have the same problem. Tried to add friends, using xbox.com, but get this message: "Sorry, we can't add this friend right now. Try again in a while. You might also want to check your privacy settings."</p>
<p>I'm not using any Xbox console, only playing some games on my Windows phone. </p>

<h2>            Attributed Quotes About Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Here is a list of attributed quotes and interview summaries from major blogs regarding Xbox One features, arranged by subject. Will be updated from time to time with new quotes.<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Backwards Compatibility</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Business Insider"][The Xbox One] won't be able to play older Xbox 360 games. According to Todd Holmdahl, [MS Corporate Vice President, Interactive Entertainment], the move was necessary to push the Xbox platform forward and enable more advanced
 games.</p>
<p>"We created a new architecture," Holmdahl said in an interview. "It was too much of a burden for us to develop for both sets of games." (May 21,

<p>[quote user="Business Insider"]He also said it wouldn't be possible for future software updates to add backwards compatibility. (May 21,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Buying/Selling Used Games</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Major Nelson"]While there have been many potential scenarios discussed, today we have only confirmed that we designed Xbox One to enable our customers to trade in and resell games at retail. (May 21,
<a href="http://majornelson.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-and-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>[quote user="Albert Penello, MS Senior Director of Product Planning"]It's going to be different than (sic) the way we currently do it ... We'll get into more specifics later. (via Engadget, May 21,
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote user="Phil Harrison, MS Corporate VP"]We will have a system where you can take that digital content and trade a previously played game at a retail store. We're not announcing the details of that today, but we will have announced in due course. (May
 22, <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-05-22-phil-harrison-tries-again-to-clarify-game-ownership-second-hand-sales-and-always-online-in-xbox-one" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Game Sharing/Licensing/Playing On Someone Else's Console</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Major Nelson"]Another piece of clarification around playing games at a friend’s house – should you choose to play your game at your friend’s house, there is no fee to play that game while you are signed in to your profile. (May 21,
<a href="http://majornelson.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-and-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote user="Engadget"]You will, [Albert] Penello says, have "the ability to go over to your friends house, download your save game, or even download your game to his Xbox and pick up where you left off." So, not only will your game saves be stored in the
 cloud, your entire game library will be and you'll be able to download it from anywhere. (May 21,
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote user="Phil Harrison, MS Corporate VP"]So, think about how you use a disc that you own of an Xbox 360 game. If I buy the disc from a store, I use that disc in my machine, I can give that disc to my son and he can play it on his 360 in his room. We
 both can't play at the same time, but the disc is the key to playing. I can go round to your house and give you that disc and you can play on that game as well.</p>
<p>What we're doing with the digital permissions that we have for Xbox One is no different to that. If I am playing on that disc, which is installed to the hard drive on my Xbox One, everybody in my household who has permission to use my Xbox One can use that
 piece of content. [So] I can give that piece of content to my son and he can play it on the same system. (May 22,

Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote user="Phil Harrison, MS Corporate VP"]I can come to your house and I can put the disc into your machine and I can sign in as me and we can play the game. The bits are on your hard drive. At the end of the play session, when I take my disc home - or
 even if I leave it with you - if you want to continue to play that game [on your profile] then you have to pay for it. The bits are already on your hard drive, so it's just a question of going to our [online] store and buying the game, and then it's instantly
 available to play. The bits that are on the disc, I can give to anybody else, but if we both want to play it at the same time, we both have to own it. That's no different to how discs operate today. (May 22,

Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Installing Games on Hard Drive</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Engadget"](After interview with Albert Penello) Just pop the disc in and start playing and the game will start installing while you play. No need to hit the Y button and go through any other theatrics. (May 21,
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Playing Games Without Disc in Drive</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Engadget"]"That feature, the ability to play games off the hard drive, was one of the first things we wrote down when we started to talk about next-gen," said [Albert] Penello. So, yes, once you install the game, you can put the disc on the
 shelf and forget about it. But, presumably, you can't just sell the disc and still keep playing the game. So, how does that work? At a minimum, each game disc must have some sort of unique ID associated to your account. "Your Xbox account will tie you to your
 game," said Penello. That ID must, therefore, be somehow <em>disassociated</em> from your account before you can sell the thing. Unfortunately, this is where things start getting murky. (May 21,
<a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Playing Games Offline</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Engadget"]Games will work offline without an issue and game saves will sync transparently when you reconnect, [Albert] Penello told us. However, some games that make use of Microsoft's online services may not be playable offline. That will be
 up to developers. (May 21, <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-used-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Link</a>)[/quote]</p>
<p>[quote user="Phil Harrison, MS Corporate VP"]For single-player games that don’t require connectivity to Xbox Live, you should be able to play those without interruption should your Internet connection go down. Blu-ray movies and other downloaded entertainment
 should be accessible when your Internet connection may be interrupted. But the device is fundamentally designed to be expanded and extended by the Internet as many devices are today. (May 22,

<p>[quote user="Phil Harrison, MS Corporate VP"]I think the key point to make is that Xbox One requires an internet connection, but it does not need to be connected all the time. (May 22,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Family Accounts</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Albert Penello, MS Senior Director of Product Planning"]<em>(When asked by Engadget specifically about playing a game on multiple family accounts)</em> Certainly we've accounted for family members in the household being able to play games. (May

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Kinect Requirement</strong></span></p>
<p>[quote user="Jeff Henshaw, Group Program Manager for Xbox Incubation"]It's not the case where you'll be able to remove the camera altogether. But you'll be able to put the system in modes where you can be completely secure about the fact that the camera
 is off and can't see you. (May 22, <a href="http://www.techradar.com/us/news/gaming/consoles/xbox-one-kinect-isn-t-an-owellian-spy-tool-1153505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>So, if my son wants to play a game that I am playing on my console on his console he would have to pay at the online store for the game.&nbsp; I mean, his Xbox One would be a separate unit from mine.&nbsp; He is 15 but planned to buy his own unit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No problem. I put a reply on it and apparently that opened it up to replies. I think if you have a family account and your son is a child account of it, he might be able to use your license. We have to wait to hear more on that though.</p>

            <p>The Phil Harrison quote from today is relieving, surely it's not much different than how it is now, only with installation in the way. I suppose an underlying factor would be accessing your profile on another system (USB 3.0 should make that quick) and installation of Blu-Ray games.</p>

<p>Depends.&nbsp; Today I have 4 consoles in house.&nbsp; My 3 oldest sons, my wife, and I use them.&nbsp; I have 1 copy of Skyrim.&nbsp; If the game was to be tied to one console and one account there is no way that we could share the game.&nbsp; My oldest son have finished the game, complete, twice.&nbsp; I am only into it a little.&nbsp; My other 2 sons have played it on their consoles and my wife has played it.&nbsp; If, and this is if, the game is tied to the console and account then that would not work.&nbsp; Well, without going to the online store first to unlock the bits I guess.&nbsp; That also means that I could not (although I never do) loan a game to a friend for him to use at his house.&nbsp; I never do this anyway but it seems a lot of people do.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Just seems like when you read these things they are talking a lot so that some things get lost in the words.&nbsp; Like when you say that used games are not blocked and such but only mention in a single sentence or something about how it would require a game purchase from the online store to unlock the game.&nbsp; Or how online is not required but then talk on and on about the clouds power to help with game processing.&nbsp; Or mention how a connection is not always needed and just passingly mention some like only connect every 24 hours.&nbsp; Hey, and you do not need Kinect but then they talk on and on about how integral it is to EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>And I am not trying to be negative.&nbsp; It is just that I have seen so much sidestepping and partial answers it is amazing.&nbsp; The only place you see this much of this stuff is in politics.&nbsp; And most of the time&nbsp;those guys&nbsp;are not being completely honest.</p>

<p>I re-read the quote a couple times. I notice when he uses the 360 example he talks about the usage of discs on multiple consoles, with the X1 example, he talks about several accounts on the same&nbsp;singular&nbsp;console. I see why families would get the short end of the stick here with separate systems.</p>

            This was caused by a live essentials update - if you have live essentials the next time you update back to square 1. I tried system restore just prior to update and it was fixed until Windows update re-installed KB 2520039 - thanks
