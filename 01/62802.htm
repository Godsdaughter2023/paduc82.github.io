</p><p>A lot of times an issue like that is an electrical connection on the motherboard for the LED light system.&nbsp; Usually easy to fix but only the factory can do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other times, you can accidently shut off the backlighting of the keyboard with a key sequence.&nbsp; Check your reference guide on the laptop to see if there is a key sequence or even a key on the keyboard that turns on/off the backlight.</p>

<h2>            bluetooth usb module</h2>
                    <p>bluetooth has not been functioning for several months, I though the problem lay in my cell phone. &nbsp;Just discovered my phone bluetooth works. &nbsp;Did some digging and found this; device manager&gt;bluetooth&gt;bluetooth usb module&gt;bluetooth usb module properties&gt;events
 (2 time stamp entries (device install requested)) and Information:&nbsp;Device USB\VID_04CA&amp;PID_3006\5&amp;2879ae0d&amp;0&amp;7 requires further installation. &nbsp;All 3 bluetooth device management items require attention within the bluetooth enumerator the event information reads;&nbsp;Device

</p>
<p>I have no idea what is meant by this, &nbsp;but the first screen of the properties reads "this device is working properly". &nbsp;Somehow I do't think so!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any knowledgeable help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Jennifer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We were paired to my &amp; my daughters cell phone. &nbsp;However during my feeble attempts to repair, it was suggested I remove the device. &nbsp;I removed mine and could not reestablish a connection (pairing). &nbsp;After checking (just now) we attempted and failed to reestablish
 connection, also my daughters phone has disappeared &amp; is no longer paired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, your link failed to make any improvement. &nbsp;Please address my concerns regarding the original posting i.e. bluetooth&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">device management items require attention.</span></p>

<p>when I put in my product key of my Win 7 Ultimate (I originally bought my disk from Amazon), it takes me to a screen to select the correct language to start download. I do not find English as available. There are European languages but not English, French

<p>
</p><p>I wish to download ISO image in a USB key to install back my Win 7 Ultimate on the same computer that is now running Win 10 -after automatic update to Win 10 last year.</p>

            <p>system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently,
 Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? See article for details:</p>

            Yes. Since the restriction is on their game, they would have to be the one to lift it if it is possible.&nbsp;

    <title>mouse horizontal or vertical lock - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zian92  say:</h3>
<h2>            mouse horizontal or vertical lock</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,<br />
<br />
I am using win 10 education n and I am experiencing two wired problems:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Sometimes while working with my mouse something strange is happening: from one second to another I am not able to to move the mouse (in most cases, but sometimes the orthogonal direction) vertically (y axis). That means I can normally move it horizontally.
 After some seconds everything is back to normal.<br />
<br />
To tell in other words, I can move left and right, but not up and down for some seconds.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
The second problem happens only in combination with the one told before, but not every time and never without the mouse-"lock". And I only experienced this only while playing a shooter.&nbsp;<br />
In the time where I have that lock, the mouse resets its position. In the shooter I turn right for instance and after that I am turned back to nearly my old position (but not exactly the same)..&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Reinstalling my drivers did not fix the problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW: its not an insider build!</p>

<h2>            I&#38;&#35;39&#59;m having connection issues with a specific friend. </h2>
                    
<p>Hi, so for the past couple of days I have been having connection issues with a specific friend. I am not quite sure what triggered this problem and have not come close to solving it. I play with a group of friends on Destiny and we always talk in the Xbox
 Party chat.</p>
<p>For awhile, whats been happening is, either him or myself will join the party and we will be able to hear eachother for a couple seconds. Then it will, I guess disconnect us, and it will say connecting like so:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/J7875NB.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/J7875NB.png</a></p>
<p>At first it was limited to the party. To solve this problem either me or him would leave the party multiple times until it worked, but as of lately it will constantly try to connect us cutting out audio for everyone. Majority of the time when I join, I will
 be able to hear my other friends in the party, but not Admiral Tacos.</p>
<p>It was pretty manageable earlier but its gotten worse. We play Destiny together a lot and as that is a Peer to Peer game, the game doesn't specifically have dedicated servers to my understanding. So hosting does play a part. Anyway, when we play together
 with our parties we will see each other lagging but not the other party members lagging. Here is a clip of this occurence:</p>
<p><a href="https://gfycat.com/CarefreeEsteemedDuckbillplatypus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gfycat.com/CarefreeEsteemedDuckbillplatypus</a></p>
<p>In the Video both me and Admiral Tacos are pushing our friend who is sitting on the ground, but he sees me running in a straight line all the way to the other end of the courtyard, where I then teleport back and are pushing our friend on the ground like
 you see at the end of the clip. While all that is happening on his end, on mine I was just pushing our friend the entire time.</p>
<p>Now majority of the time, its just me and him teleporting on each other's screens and when we play we don't quite feel the lag. However, it some times escalates to where I'll be shooting the AI and their health will reduce but then go back up and they will
 teleport somewhere else. A desync of sorts. Admiral Tacos will see me running into walls and shooting nothing and I will see him doing the same thing. However, when we both play with our party separately and me and Admiral Tacos aren't in the same game there
 will be no lag for any of us. The lag only occurs when both me and him are in the same game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've contacted support, and we both have our NATs: Open. Support suggested that we remove our accounts from our Xbox One's and hard reset them and sign back in which we have done and there have been no changes.</p>
<p>We also both forwarded our ports to makes sure our NAT stays Open despite it already being open in the first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also Factory Reset my console to remove the preview program (which to me knowledge he hasn't done). I assumed the preview program was the problem because we both recieved updates recently and of our friends, me and him are the only ones with the program.
 I assume I am out of the program because I don't have the preview menu on my Xbox anymore and I opted out of the program as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also attempted this solution as well:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution</a></p>
<p>Nothing seems to work and every time I join the party with my friends we are back to square one, and me and Admiral Tacos find ourselves connecting back to the party not being able to hear each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry for the wall of text, I just find this situation incredibly odd, and I for the life of me can't figure out how to fix this problem.</p>

            <p>Hey there Riftzeh.</p>
<p>The issue you're describing definitely sounds like a networking issue. While your NAT types may be open, I'm interested to know what the other pieces of Detailed Network Statistics show up for both of you. Are you able to get that information from you and your friend's Xbox One and post it back here? Thanks! </p>

<h2>            Destination folder access denied. You need permission to perform this action.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, I am absolutely freaking sick of this. I am logged in as an administrator and there are certain files that I just can't delete. I get the "Destination folder access denied, you need permission to perform this action" message.</p>
<p>Why the heck do I need permission? I am an administrator and this is MY computer!!</p>
<p>I have been trying to fix this for hours now, searching through forums looking for answers trying all of the things that people suggest (like changing ownership of the files - didn't work).</p>
<p>I have tried to turn of UAC but it tells me I have to restart, which I do but then when the computer comes back on UAC is turned back on again!!!</p>
<p>Gaaaah!!!! This is driving me crazy - I am trying to delete files and folders that I don't need, they are taking up valuable space and they have nothing to do with the running of the system.</p>
<p>Now I know why everyone hates on Vista.</p>

<p>Many files and folders in Vista are blocked even from Administrators (unlike was the case with XP).&nbsp; To delete a file you need full rights to it and perhaps even ownership (and these can be inherited from parent folders or their parent folders so it's not
 just a simple matter of changing permissions for the file - unless you remove the inheritance rights in the Advanced section as well).&nbsp; It has nothing to do with being YOUR computer, it has to do with protecting the system files from being modified, moved,
 deleted, or otherwise changed by people who don't really know what they're doing and thereby causing significant harm. There are places called juction points<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968829(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968829(VS.85).aspx</a>&nbsp;which
 should NOT be accessed by anyone for any reason for example.&nbsp; Now there are places in your own profile to which you are denied access.&nbsp; That's how it works in Vista (and I don't think it's different in Windows7).</p>
<p>If you think you should have access to delete the files and know that doing so will cause no harm, then here's some information on getting permissions (you want full rights for yourself) and taking ownership (not always required but sometimes helps).&nbsp; Being
 the owner does not necessarily give you full rights permissions - you sometimes need to do both.&nbsp; Don't forget to go to the Advanced section to check the rights listed there as well as on the main page - they can block you just as easily if you don't fix them
 as well.</p>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
 add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ownership</span> of the folders or the drive (as an administrator) and give

 if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive
 and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>To
 add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>

 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly - but it helps if you resolve the permission problems first (even these programs may not work to override that).<br />

I hope this helps.<br />

    <title>Solitare game problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> judithboyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Solitare game problem</h2>
                    I have had Windows 10 for some time. This is the second time I have had a problem with things that would not stay up on the screen. The first time it was the start screen. It started right after an update and did not clear up until another update. This
 time it is the solitaire game panel. I click to bring it up, then click on any of the 5 games, no problem. But as soon as I click to one of the cards to play the whole thing disappears. If I click on a challenge it will let me play the game, no problem. But
 just play is not possible. This again happened after an update and hopefully will be OK after the next update. Any one else having this problem or know what is causing it???

            <p><span>Hi Judith,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The above issue might occur due to the following reasons:</span><span>&nbsp; </span>

            <p>Start screen problem started with an update and cleared only after another update. You clicked on the start button to bring up the start screen then click on apps . Apps screen would come up then disappear in about one to two seconds. The Microsoft tech
 could not fix the problem. This is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>I do have McAfee security on my computer if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>Now the problem is the solitaire games that came with Windows 10.&nbsp; When I click on solitaire the first screen comes up. When I click on any of the 5 games they come up, but as soon as I try to move a card the screen disappears as if&nbsp; I had click the screen
 to close.&nbsp; Do you have to rent the games after a period of time? If so this should have been disclosed at the beginning of the upgrade and I would have reverted back to my very trust worthy Windows 7.</p>

            Still have the problem. Ran Windows app troubleshooter did not find a problem with the solitaire app. This is the original app. that came with the Windows 10 upgrade. I now play my solitaire on my old windows XP computer.

<span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Since your Wireless network is configured to connect only a certain number of devices, the troubleshooting steps we are suggesting may not improve the situation. I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer
 of the Network Router/Modem or the party who had set it up to re-configure the network to add more devices wirelessly to your network.</span></p>
<p>
<span>You may temporarily unsecure the network, however I would suggest you to follow the steps in the links and check if the issue occurs:</span></p>

<h3> chrishodnicak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pressing F2,F3,F4 and similar keys does functions such as adjusting screen brightness....how do I disable this as I cannot play FSX&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi when playing FSX, I must be able to use, press, and hold keys such as F2, F3, F4, etc. However on my new computer, pressing these keys does things such as adjusting screen brightness and bringing up some weird screen, instead of carrying out the game
 function. I would like to know if there if there is a way to disable this or set it so that it will only perform the game function instead of these functions. I used to have a 2009 computer which had Windows 7, but the keys on top did not have these functions.
 The F keys on this computer appear to do things such as play, rewind, fast forward, go directly to the support center and as I mentioned before adjust screen brigthness and stuff. This is quite annoying and I need it to be disabled in order to play FS as well
 as other games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            The HP DV7 series uses the BIOS to control whether the <i>F1-&gt;F12</i>&nbsp;keys act as
<i>F1, F2, etc</i>&nbsp;or as the <i>Fn+F1, Fn+F2</i>, etc.<br />
<br />
Restart the laptop and start tapping <i>F10</i>&nbsp;as soon as it starts powering up. Enter the BIOS and select the&nbsp;<i>System Configuration</i>&nbsp;screen. There is an option for
<i>Action Mode Keys</i>&nbsp;that you need to change.I regret that I do not have more precise instructions, but your user manual should have specifics.<br />
<br />
Save the changes to the BIOS settings and restart the computer. Now the brightness, volume, etc will be controlled by a&nbsp;<i>Fn+F1-&gt;F12</i>&nbsp;key combination and your
<i>F1</i>&nbsp;through <i>F12</i>&nbsp;keys should work normally for programs and games.

                    <p>I accidentally applied the newest update to Skype on phone. &nbsp;Needless to say, Microsoft, you are going to have many many unhappy users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest complaint right now is regarding the inability to see/tell easily which of my contacts are online so that I may either chat or call them. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
This does not seem intuitive. &nbsp;I know you can click on a user and it will say "last seen in..." but I want to be able to see who is online now. &nbsp;I also want to continue to be able to change my status (busy, invisible, available, etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app is not intuitive at all and seeing as your users are NOT THE SNAPCHAT demographic you are going to lose some folks. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The "settings" and account info is deeply embedded. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im sure it will take some getting used to but along with your "new features" video you should have made a "this is where the old features are now" video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Angejr29, I just found where to go to sign out. When you get to the setup tutorial there is a symbol on the far right of your picture (it sort of looks like a sun) that is your settings and scroll to the bottom and that is where you can sign out.</p>

<p>Hi Lawrence</p>
<p>No i havent had a response to my question. I just dont understand why a new version is rolled out when it isn't fit for purpose. Surely before a new version is introduced it's tested first to make sure it fulfils its users needs? Do microsoft tend to reply
 to questions that are raised on here? Fisrt t ime I've used this. I would revert back to the previous version but i cant find the option when i search on Play Store on my Samsung. All i get is this version 8. Grrrrrrrr.</p>

<p>Now that they have removed contact statuses this basically renders Skype completely useless on Android, for me at least.</p>
<p>Statuses haven't worked properly anyway since the takeover as it seems no-one there can work out the relatively simple process of determining when Skype on a device should be labelled active or not and then referencing this across devices.</p>
<p>How can you possibly be expected to now guess whether a contact in online, offline, unavailable, or just simply ignoring you? The contact list itself is hard enough to find now as it is.</p>
<p>All of this alongside the completely dysfunctional interface as everything is all over the place and all of the new rubbish apparently only aimed at 8 year olds, while people over 8, business users, and those at retirement age who have enough problems understanding
 these sorts of things, are left with what is now a user-unfriendly, childish, broken Skype that is more ridiculous every single release.</p>
<p>As a programmer for over 20 years the constant mistakes that Microsoft keep making are on a fundamental level!</p>
<p>Microsoft seem intent at alienating their loyal users at every opportunity they can and at forcing their users away in every way possible, as also proven by the horrendous debacle that is Windows 10. I can't can't see any logic in it whatsoever. Unbelievable.</p>

            Skype says my contact is online and there is a green dot to his name. So I call and no answer later I found out that he wasn't online at all and has his computer switched off for about a week. I think Microsoft does it for sole purpose of advertising so
 they can b*******advertises into false pretense that there are millions of people online where in fact there are not. Latest update for Skype on Android makes this app a total joke , unusable app.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better assist you regarding KB2999226, it would be best to check the prerequisites information in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2999226" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am well aware that the prerequisites for this are Windows 7 SP1 but my question was if there was maybe another way to obtain these files on a Windows 7 without SP1, i.e. on a system that doesn't meet the prerequisites for KB2999226.</p>
<p>The problem that we have is that we may have to deploy our software which is made with VS 2015 on systems which don't have SP1 installed. In this case, in order to install KB2999226 we'd have to also deliver and deploy SP1. I was trying to find ways to avoid
 this.</p>

    <title>How to Turn Off Auto-Rotate - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnzeron  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Turn Off Auto-Rotate</h2>
                    <p>I have my screen orientation locked as landscape. I exclusively use my surface with the keyboard attached. I use my Surface as a passenger in a moving vehicle most of the day. Every time the vehicle makes a hard turn and often when going over bumps and sometimes
 when sitting still the Surface senses movement and tries to auto-rotate. The interrupts what ever input I was trying to make. Often times it stops the input from the keyboard, forcing me to disconnect and reconnect the keyboard to initialize it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can&nbsp; actually turn off auto-rotate? I do not really want to turn off gravimeters but that seems to be the only way to do this. I can't believe that at this late date Microsoft hasn't improved the logic of the feature.</p>

            Try this.
<br />First detach your keyboard from the surface.
<br />Then go into tablet mode... click notifications bottom right and you will see an option for tablet mode. 
<br />Then go to start - settings - systems - display.
<br />Then set the rotation lock to on.
<br />Attach keyboard.
<br />
<br />See if that works.

<h2>            Print Artist 4 Install to Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    Is there a way/fix to install Print Artist 4 to Window 7? I know that it is not naturally compatible and I have tried selecting and running in a previous version of windows (95) via the control panel, and program and features etc, but have been unsuccessful
 so far. It will not run/install.

            If Compatibility options dont help nothing else will, other than if you have win7 pro or ultimate, then you can install Virtual winxp and install the program in that environment which
<strong>may </strong>work

    <title>Windows 10 start-up log in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christopherty  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 start-up log in</h2>
                    Prior to windows 10 ( windows 8.1), I was using Microsoft account to log in to my laptop with no problems. After I installed windows 10, I could not log in. It keeps saying that my password is wrong.&nbsp; So I changed my password 3x already and they wont work.&nbsp;
 IF I keep trying to log in using my original password, it will eventually let me log in but not after many many tries.&nbsp; So now, i cannot use my laptop regularly since i have to get lucky for the laptop to accept the original password (none of the new passwords
 work).&nbsp; This needs to be fixed by Microsoft.

<h2>            BlacX se docking station is not being recognized</h2>
                    <p>This docking station has had its problems but always ended in being recognized.&nbsp; After two days and attempts to access the drive within, no access.&nbsp; The device manager show the problem as being device descriptor request failed.&nbsp; After numerous attempts to
 download a dated driver, windows 7 I believe this PNP has not really worked and had no problems with windows 8.&nbsp; Any suggestions&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have malware bytes and Mcafee but doubt that these two things are the cause since the docking station was working weeks ago, the latest update seems to have caused problems.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Ming,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say "latest update seems to have caused problems" could you tell us which updates were installed prior to the issue? You can check the Windows Update History to view the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Press <strong>Windows </strong>Key and <strong>
X </strong>Key when you are on Desktop.<br />
b) Select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
c) Select <strong>Windows Update</strong>, Click <strong>View Windows Update History</strong>.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that there are no BlacX se docking station drivers available&nbsp;for Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 on their website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to uninstall the (BlacX se docking station )device drivers completely from the Device Manager and re-install the device drivers in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Press the Windows logo key + R to open the <strong>
Run</strong> dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b. </span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> in the
<strong>Run</strong> dialog box, then press Enter. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow<br />
</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c. In Device Manager, expand </span>BlacX se docking station by click on the arrow beside it.</p>
<p>d. Right Click on the device drivers and click on Properties.</p>
<p><span>e. In the properties window, under <strong><span>Driver </span></strong>tab, click on
<strong><span>Uninstall </span></strong>button.</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re sure you want to delete the driver click <strong><span>OK.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> If you want the driver completely removed from the computer check “<strong><span>Delete the driver software for this device.”</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>The <strong><span>Delete the driver software for this device</span></strong> option removes the package from the driver store.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Download the drivers from the <a href="http://support.thermaltakeusa.com/Product.aspx?C=1434&amp;ID=1643#Tab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
manufacturer’s website</a>.<br />
b) <strong>Right-click</strong> on the driver and click on <strong>properties.</strong><br />
c) Click on the<strong> ‘compatibility’ </strong>tab and check the box "<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for”</strong> and select<strong> the available Windows operating system</strong> from the drop down.<br />
d) Click on<strong> ‘Apply’</strong> and click ‘<strong>OK’ </strong>and run the file to install it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Reference:</strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keeping two antimalware can cause conflicts I suggest you to remove one of the anti-malwares.</span></p>
<p>It might help in fixing the issue.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 black screen, but normal after sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> reaper-stan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 black screen, but normal after sleep</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to 10. The install went smoothly, but it booted into a black screen. Thinking that this was just a long process for the display driver, I let it go overnight. In the morning I came back and it was still black. Thinking
 that this was a frozen install, I reluctantly did a hard reset. After repeating this process a few times, it gave me the option to "reset windows" so I did, thinking that this would do a fresh install and fix whatever bug was causing the black screen. Windows
 was reinstalled but the black screen STILL came back. Frustrated, I shut the laptop and walked away. Apparently this put the PC into sleep mode. After cooling down, I came back and opened the lid and woke the PC up. Low and behold there was the initial prompt
 to set up the PC. I set it up and was brought to the desktop. Out of curiosity, I reset the PC. It booted past the Windows logo but then to a blank screen. Remembering that it came back after being put to sleep I repeated the sleep/wake process and it worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on here? The display driver is up to date and an SFC scan shows no errors. I have also tried the windows key +p trick thinking that it was seeing a "virtual" monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: This is Windows 10 Pro.</p>
