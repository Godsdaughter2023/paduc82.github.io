<h2>            Backwards compatibility wont work</h2>
                    <p>So i have tried to play assassins creed black flag on my xbox one. It is on the backwards compatibility list and i know friends who play it on their xbox ones. But when i put the disk in it says that the game is not playable and says to look at the backwards compatibility list for games that are. Any solution?&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the computer on a Domain?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue might have occurred due to corrupt user profile. As you are using Windows 8 now, you may try to upgrade to Windows 8.1 and check if you get the error message again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results. If you need further assistance, we’re here to help.</p>

            <p>I do not have time for this !&nbsp; Every time I log on windows 8 (64) finds another way to fail me that keeps me from using my non-touch-screen-laptop for work.&nbsp; And encourages me to&nbsp;spend more time doing&nbsp;another lengthy backup of my data in anticipation of
 another crash.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Windows 8 seems to be a (failing) attempt by Microsoft to integrate smaller devices and compete with Android.&nbsp; I have a lappy ... no touchscreen ... and have to disable almost all of the Windows 8 sliders, and touch screen
 accommodating stuff just to make my computer functional.&nbsp; Now I am having to deal with Jumping Cursors, and my touchpad keeps reverting back to the METRO settings that are totally incompatible with my laptop..Top that off with the fact that every time I so
 much as breathe on my touchpad it shoots the cursor to the moon.&nbsp; There is not even a sensitivity adjustment on my new windows 8 touchpad driver for sensitivity.&nbsp; Now I am getting this stupid error message at logon:
</span><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Group policy client service failed the sign in&nbsp;&nbsp;the universal unique identifier Group policy client service failed the sign in&nbsp;&nbsp;" and know it is just a matter of time before my computer becomes unusable ...AGAIN.
 Windows 8 (mine is 64 bit) is so unstable that I have had to reinstall it more than once, and recover my settings many times ... thanks to update crashes or just plain normal usage.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;I should be thanking Microsoft for encouraging me to explore other options in operating systems.&nbsp; Next time this thing crashes again&nbsp;... with all my date gone ... I am going back to windows 7 and will not buy a new
 computer until I can find another operating system that is NOT MS.&nbsp; I love that MS leaves it up to us to resolve problems with Win 8 on these forums&nbsp; for them.&nbsp;I appreciate that&nbsp;
<span>Microsoft</span> <span>Support Engineer: </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/73428910-e55d-42e3-b92d-137e3a26ebcd"><font color="#0072c6">Rohit Siddegowda</font></a>&nbsp;has responded at least to acknowledge this problem,
 but a solution would be nice instead of a salesman trying to sell an upgrade with a "canned response message" that I have found many times as solutions offered by MS. &nbsp;I suppose&nbsp;they no longer want to communicate with people to resolve anything.&nbsp;&nbsp;The constant
 failures in&nbsp;Windows 8 is just too much trouble and time to fix.&nbsp; And it looks to me as if Win 8.1 is still METRO touchscreen standard, so what would be the difference?&nbsp; It will take an huge amount of time to reformat my computer...please be more specific about
 the advantage of Win 8.1...is it more compatible with a NON_TOUCHSCReeN_LAPTOP or will I have to spend hours trying to disable all the functions that do not work for me after I install it ...again .... and pray to the GOD OF MICROSOFT that it might work?&nbsp;
 If I have to learn a whole new OP system, next time I will just switch to something other than Microsoft .&nbsp; I Give Up.&nbsp; Sorry to vent, I am sure&nbsp;the GOD OF MICROSOFT isn't listening anyway (no offense intended to Rohit Siddegowda - I am referring to those
 much higher than you).&nbsp; All I want is to be able to use my lappy for work without disruption&nbsp;... Luck to All</span></font></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 media Center program guide not updating</h2>
                    We have very little guide data &nbsp;Our Guide end date was 1/1/13 22:00 It comes from DVB S Astra 28.2 East, 250282 Im in the UK. We have a few bits of information the current and next programs on &nbsp;3 or 4 channels BBC1 Channel 4 etc but that's it.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've rescanned the TV signals, deleted the epglistings directory and the re downloaded, I've run the ObjectStoreRecoveryTask, I've run MC Update, Ive tried turning off the firewalls. The data seems to download but Media Center doesnt load the data. Nothing
 &nbsp;works. &nbsp;I now can't schedule new recordings or watch much live TV. I've spent hours trying to figure out what's going on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>UPDATE: I now seem to have the current and next program for most channels but nothing further than that. &nbsp;Does the guide update really slowly? &nbsp;If I leave it will it pick up the data eventually?</div>
                </div>

<p>Hi Hamtarix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That has been a known issue for a while now and is still being tested in the Xbox Insider Preview program. No estimated time or update has been posted at this time but since a solution has been tested in the preview program for some time now, a solution
 should get released soon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime you can report the problem through the<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Xbox Insider Hub app</a> and wait until a solution is released in a live update.</p>

    <title>Cannot disable wake-on settings with dock station - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> octo31oz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot disable wake-on settings with dock station</h2>
                    <p>I have a SB2 with USB keyboard &amp; mouse via dock station. Is there a way to disable the power wake-on functions for the keyboard &amp; mouse? Power management tabs have the setting "Allow this device to wake the computer" unchecked but the SB2 can still wake
 up from sleep via keyboard &amp; mouse. In fact, this setting is not only unchecked but also shadowed preventing any user input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi Ruz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this is going to be difficult to resolve. The Power Management tab doesn't show up at all for the Surface Dock&nbsp;attached&nbsp;mouse and keyboard via Device Manager properties. The Power Management&nbsp;tab is only visible for the&nbsp;Surface Dock itself but there
 are way too many sub keys/devices to determine which ones apply to the connected mouse and keyboard. If that all makes sense :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks anyhow.</p>

            There's nothing wrong with the SB2 or dock so I won't be returning it. I just wanted instructions for disabling the wake-on feature for the USB keyboard and mouse attached to the docking station. As Ruz has pointed out in a previous reply he suspects that
 the devices attached to the dock are not being recognised as plug &amp; play hence don't get a Power Management tab appearing when viewing the device's property settings. The only&nbsp;Power Management settings that I can find relate to the docking station's device
 properties for its USB ports but these are greyed out.

<p>Both SB2 and dock were purchased via the online MS Store. I won't be returning them for such a minor issue and that in my belief is totally related to some configuration or setting. I was hoping someone (especially at MS) has actually tested the dock with
 USB connected keyboard and mouse in order to advise what they configured to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disable</span> the wake-on setting for both devises. By default the wake-on feature is enabled and works fine out-of-the box, so either there is a way to disable it or there isn't. I just would like to clarify it somehow.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi RedRocky,<br />
<br />
You cannot directly upload PowerPoint slide directly to YouTube. In order to upload the PowerPoint slide you need to convert the PowerPoint slide to a video format and then you may upload the file to YouTube. There are many third party video converting software
 available in the market. Codec is not required for this action.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft BluetoothMouse3600 paired but wont work</h2>
                    <p>I have a HP x360 for a long time. And when I had previous Win10 version installed (1511) all my bluetooth devices worked perfectly incluing Microsoft BluetoothMouse 3600.
</p>
<p>Since I've upgraded to Creators Update (1703) I have had a lot of problems with bluetooth devices. Most of these problems I've handled and solved and this is the only last one.The problem is: my&nbsp;Microsoft BluetoothMouse 3600 paired but wont work. I tried
 to remove the mouse and pair again - it paired succesful but still wont work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to run&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting wireless and Bluetooth issues</strong>, but it did nothing for me.</p>
<p>Another suspicious thing: after pairing the mouse dispalyed in <strong>Other devices</strong> group.
</p>
<p>At the same time my Microsoft Wedge Touch Mouce works properly without any problems and displayed into
<strong>Mice and Keyboard</strong> group as it should be.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <u><b>CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION (109)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that the kernel has detected critical kernel code or data corruption.</i><br />
<br />
<i>There are generally two causes for this bug check:</i><br />
<ol>
<li>A driver has inadvertently, or deliberately, modified critical kernel code or data. Microsoft Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 1 (SP1) and later versions of Windows for x64-based computers do not allow the kernel to be patched except through authorized
 Microsoft-originated hot patches. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=50719" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Patching Policy for x64-based Systems</a>. <br />
</li><li>A hardware corruption occurred. For example, the kernel code or data could have been stored in memory that failed.
</li></ol>
<p>Before we go into that, let's take care of the SFC first. The file it could not repair:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Cannot repair member file [l:36{18}]"Amd64\CNBJ2530.DPB" of prncacla.inf</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>From what I have personally seen, this is related to a Microsoft-Windows-Printer-Drivers-Package, and sometimes specifically related to Canon printers. It's a hash mismatch, and to my understanding is not a significant problem. It's likely not the cause
 of your blue screens, just a different issue that again is not of high severity. However, don't quote me on this, it may still be possible given *109's provide very little info!<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To fix this however, you can grab the OS install disc (Windows 8 install media) and find the CNBJ2530.DPB file and replace it on your current machine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Onto the dump itself, as I said, it's a *109 bug check. We have very little to no information (as with most *109's). It's mentioning memory_corruption:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i>MODULE_NAME: memory_corruption<br />
<br />
IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; memory_corruption<br />
<br />
FOLLOWUP_NAME:&nbsp; memory_corruption<br />
<br />
MEMORY_CORRUPTOR:&nbsp; ONE_BIT<br />
<br />
FAILURE_BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_MEMORY_CORRUPTION_ONE_BIT<br />
<br />
BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; X64_MEMORY_CORRUPTION_ONE_BIT</i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i><b>This could imply a device driver is causing corruption or a hardware issue as I said above. To see if a device driver is causing conflicts, let's enable Driver Verifier:</b></i></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><u><b>Driver Verifier:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />

Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />

<p>I have enabled Driver Verifier as you have said. I will comeback once I have a BSOD. I suspect the cause of the&nbsp;BSOD to be Qualcomm Atheros AR9285 wireless network adapter driver. I&nbsp;had to install Wi-Fi driver from&nbsp;non-Toshiba site. More info about my query
 here: &nbsp;<a href="http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/Windows-8-8-1/Wifi-problems-with-Satellite-C655-S5061/td-p/494613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forums.toshiba.com/t5/Windows-8-8-1/Wifi-problems-with-Satellite-C655-S5061/td-p/494613</a></p>

            Great, please keep me updated (good or bad).<br />
<br />
All of the DMP files are of various bug checks and are not definitive or faulting a driver at all. This is why I am recommending verifier because if it's driver related, we'll hopefully be able to catch it. If nto though, as usual with most *109's, we'll have
 to do a little detective work.<br />

<h2>            Skype won&#96;t sync messages and makes contacts appear offline</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having issues with Skype for the past week now. Every time I connect to my account, everything loads properly but all of my contacts are offline, my icon says it is trying to connect but never does and my messages are not synced (I also use Skype
 on my phone - Skype for Android - and I can see that my messages are not catching up on my PC. I don't have any problems with my mobile app).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the regular version of Skype on Windows. I lurked around a bit and saw that people were recommending to log-in / log-out. I tried that, but it didn't work. I even tried to uninstall it and reinstall it (a few days later) to see if the issue was
 coming from my end of the equation or not. It didn't change anything. I am connected to the internet via Wi-Fi.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there has been some issues with instant messaging lately, but according to the status page, it was not mentionned that my version was affected by it. It is a bit frustrating since I rely only on Skype for my work and now I can't access anything when
 I need to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I can do to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot!</p>

            Your Skype is not connected to messaging server (Status: <em>NetStateConnecting.Backoff</em>). Try to sign out and then sign in to Skype with the same account. This might solve the connection issue.

<h2>            Maintenance in windows 8 gets always delayed</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have recently upgraded to windows 8 pro &nbsp;and was very much looking forward to the automatic maintenance feature. Maintenance starts but seems to be never complete as I always get the message automatic Maintenance got delayed even if I leave the Laptop
 (HP Envy) on with no interaction and on powers setting high so no shut down occurs. Any ideas what task maintenance&nbsp;wanted to run and did not complete?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help and tips are highly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best wishes</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>To solve it you have to lauch the task manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- With an administrator account, open task scheduler.</p>
<p>- Go to the task: Microsoft -&gt; Windows -&gt; TaskScheduler -&gt; Regular Maintenance.</p>
<p>- Right click -&gt; Properties.</p>
<p>- Configuration -&gt; Allow to run task manually (don't know the label in english, is the 1st one). If you click on Accept, it will fail, you need to change other thing.</p>
<p>- Conditions -&gt; Start task only...inactivity -&gt; and set it to 1 minute. By default is at 0 and this is a incorrect configuration for a task. Click on Accept.</p>
<p>- Right click -&gt; Run.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know why, but if you use the Activity Center to manually run it, the message "Delayed" doesn't go off, but if you run manually from task scheduler, it does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The "refused the request" is normal, you have to allow "turn on computer" for Regular Maintenance and do all the work manually. But really you have to configure this (turn on computer) in Activity Center and let the task "Maintenance Configurator" (you can
 only see it with an administrator account) to do all the work. It has different behaviours depending on computer, i.e. in my desktop computer it configures the Regular Maintenance task to turn on the computer, while in my laptop it configures the Idle Maintenance
 to enabled and doesn't set the "turn on computer" on Regular Maintenance task, so it runs (not Regular Maintenance, but Idle Maintenance executes the same process) when I close sesión and let the computer to turn off after 30 minutes via power management.</p>
<p>I have "refused the request" on my laptop because it really doesn't run the Regular Maintenance task (as it is&nbsp;powered off), but it executes the maintenance via Idle Maintenance task.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, do what I say before (run the Regular Maintenace manually) so the "delayed" message goes off, and then let the Maintenance Configurator task to do the work. I did this and no have seen the "delayed" message again, I suppose it is a rare case.</p>

    <title>Unable to Install Battery Driver Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kkrjones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Install Battery Driver Update</h2>
                    <p>I noticed a few hours ago that the battery was at about half, so I plugged it in and continued working. Then, some time later, I noticed that the power was lower than before. I looked, and it said "Plugged In, Not Charging".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some researching, I think the issue is that the battery driver is not working and needs to be updated. This surface, from what I saw, has never been updated since we got it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to check for updates after uninstalling the driver per Microsoft Support instructions, but I got another, different error. I can't remember exactly what it was, but I had to go into Command Prompt and reset something to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then restarted the computer and tried to search for updates. This time, it was able to find firmware updates. I tried to install them, but it gave me an error and said I needed to plug in and charge the surface to full battery, first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The battery can't charge, because the driver's broken. I can't update the driver, because the battery isn't charged. What am I supposed to do, now? Take it in to a computer repair place and have them charge and update it there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the model, I can't say for sure, but this is what it says on the back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows 8 Pro</p>
<p>Surface</p>
<p>[Serial Number]</p>
<p>256 GB"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked, but apparently the first model of Surfaces don't have 256, so it might be a Pro 2 or 3?</p>

            <p>Sorry, I just saw this. I've tried those steps already, and it didn't help. Right now, the surface is too low on battery to turn on again. I'm trying to let it charge overnight and see if it helps anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I think I should specify: I was in the process of trying to attempt reinstalling the driver, when this happened. I explained it in greater detail above, but I tried to update the drivers, only to find an error preventing me from doing so. Maybe that's
 what kept me from updating the driver in the first place, which led to this situation. The surface ran out of battery before I was able to actually install anything.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try this very specific step and see the outcome:</p>
Remove the battery driver, and then install and confirm updates
<p>You may be able to resolve this by removing the battery driver, and then installing Surface and Windows updates.</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>Note: If you don’t remove the battery driver first, when you install Windows and Surface updates, they may fail with Windows Update error.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p></div>
<p>Here’s how to remove the battery driver:</p>

            Thank you. I left it charging overnight, and I'm now using it again. I don't consider my problem necessarily fixed (even though it now says it's charging again) because I've yet to be able to install any updates, but progress has been made.&nbsp;

            <p>Right, that's what I was trying to do before the battery died. I made the original post because I felt the two problems were comorbid. I think the fact that I've been unable to install updates led to being unable to fix the battery driver in time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to install new updates, but kept getting an 80072F76 error. I fixed it somehow by using a command prompt entry, which reset something. But then, the battery was too low for me to install any updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

 update problem as soon as possible so I don't have this issue again.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the update. It seems the issue is partially resolved. We'll continue helping until fully resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked up the error code you've mentioned and it is referring to a connection interruption between your computer and the Windows Update servers.
</p>
<p>You can try and completely close Windows Update, wait 10 to 15 minutes, and then run Windows Update again. You can also wait for Windows Update to run at its next scheduled time and see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, you can run the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>More correctly there is nothing to stop anyone changing your computer if you leave it logged in to your user account on the computer. &nbsp;Especially if your account has is admin level.</p>
<p>To stop this you need to lock the PC when it isn't in use, ensuring the user account has a password associated with it.</p>

    <title>Black Screen issue due to dxgkrnl.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> svenler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen issue due to dxgkrnl.sys</h2>
                    <p>HI there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>please excuse my english as I'm not a native speaker.</p>
<p>Currently I am facing an issue when playing games. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the 26th. I am getting black screens ... sometimes, not always.</p>
<p>If I view the crash dump file I get 3 files which may be responisble for the crash</p>
<p>
</p><p>dxgkrnl.sys</p>
<p>dxgmms1.sys</p>
<p>nvlddmkm.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I thought it might be an issue with the graphics drivers.</p>
<p>Everytime i get a black screen the fans of my graphics cards rund shortly on 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reinstalled the nvidia display drivers without any success. (First removed all drivers and made a fresh install.)</p>
<p>My system isn't overclocked, GPU and CPU temps are in a good range (CPU around 50C max. and gpu max. 60C)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now trying to install an older version of the nvidia display drivers, if this helps I will let you know.</p>
<p>But maybe you got some hints for me what might help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your swift response.</p>
<p>The rollback of the current nvidia drivers were successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Nvidia WHQL Driver 344.11 is responsible for this error (in my case)</p>
<p>Now I am running <strong><a href="http://www.nvidia.de/download/driverResults.aspx/77251/de" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GeForce 340.52 Driver</a></strong> again and I'm getting no Blackscreens anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions Ramesh</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I had no Bluescreens, the monitor went black and after a short while the computer reboots himself.</p>
<p>2. Nothing special, most of my drivers are getting installed automatically. ...just drivers.</p>
<p>3. No specified name, home made. Gigabyte MB , xeon e3-1230v3, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the problem is fixed for me. In my case the problem just was an faulty nvidia driver.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>You could remove the updates, but most updates are bugfixes and security fixes.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't recommended to remove a Critical Windows Update unless the update is causing other problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By removing&nbsp;an update you&nbsp;could be&nbsp;making your computer vulnerable to security threats and stability issues that it was intended to fix.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optional Updates can be removed without having a big impact on the machine. Check what type it is before you remove it.</p>

            <p>In general, no.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the compcln.exe program to remove Service pack files and make a service pack permanent, as decribed here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2592038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=2592038</a></p>
<p>This program is in C:\Windows\System32</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can uninstall updates which have been superseded by a later update but I don't know of an easy way to identify them. I don't think there is any great advantage in doing this.
</p>
<p>If you uninstall an update that is still required, it will be re-installed the next time WIndows Update runs.</p>

<h2>            MS DVD Maker  missing after download of Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Good Morning,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 Pro.. The upgrade was a success. I am just a little upset that I&nbsp; have missing programs &amp; files... I am missing my MS DVD Maker...and stuck with the Windows Movie maker. I don't like the Windows Movie maker
 &amp; I very seldom ever used it. I created several DVDS with the MS DVD Maker &amp; now I cannot open any of them to make more copies if I need too.&nbsp; Does anyone know if there is a compatible program&nbsp; for the MS DVD MAKER with the new Windows 10 pro?&nbsp; I have seen
 the APPS store &amp; it is a great feature but I have not found anything that helps with compatible programs....&nbsp; Thanks for any help or suggestions.

</p><p><span>Make sure all your Windows update are up to date and install all the latest drivers from the manufacturer’s website, try installing drivers in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.
 Follow these steps to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if that helps.</span></p>

            <p>I did not even try to do what the previous suggested to fix it. It was Windows 10 causing the problem and they do not care if any programs or features work. &nbsp;All of my programs &amp; features were up to date &nbsp;along with all my windows automatic updates.... All
 They care about is the new Windows 10 &amp; the new APP store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I opted to go back to my Windows 7 professional &amp; every thing works just fine after I figured out how to keep Windows 10 from coming thru when I did my windows updates....</p>
<p>Thanks for your input... :-)&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>I agree that it is extremely frustrating that a useful and well liked application like DVD Maker was removed from Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I used it many times to make disks for friends and family, I have kept Windows 7 on a spare laptop for this purpose but it’s not a luxury most users have.</span></p>
<p><span>If Microsoft want to encourage users to stick with their software, then they need to take better care that they give customers new features that they actually want and also not remove functionality
 that added value and was well received.</span></p>

<p>Hello Varun,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's determine the cause of the issue. To get started, I'd like to get the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is this your first time to encounter this issue? If so, did you make any changes to your computer's configuration prior to this?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Can you also please confirm the current build of your Windows 10?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>
Enter</strong>.)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I suggest that you try starting the Task Scheduler through command line. To do so, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt (Admin).</li><li>Type this <span><em><strong>net start task scheduler </strong></em>and hit Enter.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>We're looking forward to your response. </span></p>

<p>Thank you for responding so quickly, here are my respective answers to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, this is the first time that I've encountered this issue. And I did tweak with Superfetch by stopping it and making it disabled in order to minimize memory leak.</p>
<p>2. No, I'm not getting any system errors or anything when I try to open Task Scheduler.</p>
<p>3. Current build: Version 1709 (OS Build 16299.248)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I tried opening it through Command Prompt as an admin, but it says that the "service name is invalid"?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business not &#34;hanging up&#34; microphone properly, causing audio issues for subsequent calls.</h2>
                    One of our users has been having issues with his microphone relating to Skype for Business. The first call of the day will work fine, but its as though the OS is not hanging up the microphone correctly after the first call and all subsequent calls will
 not work with audio. A restart will resolve the issue, but of course the user should not have to restart each time. We have tried everything down to reinstalling office and removing/readding all the audio devices/drivers without success. Anyone else experience
 this? Im almost to a point where I want to just restore the machine.&nbsp;

            Hi Emily,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update. However, according to the description issue is most likely to lie with the internal audio device
<em>(Microphone)</em> side. Make sure that OS and audio device driver are latest updated.<br />
<br />

<h3> xe4_  say:</h3>
<h2>            getting a 30fps cap&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So, ever since I turned off my pc, then I have been getting 30 fps. Constant 30, nothing more, nothing less. Before, I'd get 60 with nothing on, maybe sometimes 40-60 in games. But even when I have nothing running, I'm getting a solid 30fps? It's really
 frustrating as I'm used to 60 all of the time. Also I can't press the windows button, press the windows key or use cortana. Not sure if it's linked though. Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW I did a virus/malware scan and there was nothing there.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Data Recovery:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Listed below are a couple of very good FREE Programs for Data/File Recovery.<br />
<br />
Read their reviews, and make your choice with which one you are happy working with.<br />
<br />
1. Stop using that computer; as you will overwrite the deleted files, which are not&nbsp;deleted, until they are overwritten..<br />
<br />
2. Preferably Slave your Hard Drive in another computer, install one of the Recovery Programs in that computer, and read your Drive from there.<br />
<br />
3. Or put your Hard Drive in a USB External Hard Drive Enclosure, attach it&nbsp; to another&nbsp; computer, and do the same as in 2.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;</span>You can install the software and run it in your computer, but that risk of overwriting the “deleted” files<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>is still there.</span><br />

            You need to have Windows 7 Ultimate installed and download your appropriate language.

    <title>Unknown Profile Help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Profile Help</h2>
                    
<p>So back when I first got XBL I shared an xbox with my brother, then I got a Slim and he kept the xbox that we shared, since I got a new xbox and for some reason something happened with my account where I couldn't download it on other people's xbox, so I
 decided to go out and buy a flashdrive. I moved my profile over to the flashdrive and thought nothing of it, but when I moved my profile I left all of my old gamesaves behind. So, I had to restart on all of my single player campaigns on GTA, Red Dead Redemption,
 Borderlands and tons others. The only thing I moved was my Dead Island save. Since I moved my profile, those old saves became the new owner of "Unknown Profile". Every time I try to move the save over to my flashdrive it says "This content cannot be moved
 between profiles." or something along those lines. So the big thing I really lost was my level 40 something on Red Dead Redemption for Multiplayer, that took months to get and they have a way different system from Call of Duty, their system is Multiplayer
 Level is on your memory of your HDD while your Multiplayer Level on CoD is it is saved to their memory and will not get erased. So I tried tricking the server by making an offline profile called "Unknown Profile" and then try moving the content, it still didn't
 work. So I was wondering if there is anyway possible to change the owner's name from "Unknown Profile". Anything will help. :)</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately when a problem like this happens there's no way to simply get that saved data back. I've never heard of this issue happening when moving save files, but I have heard this happening a couple times when the person changed their gamertag and all
 of their old saved data turned to "Unknown Profile", there wasn't anything we could personally do for them.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think you can try is contacting phone support to see if they are able to help in some way as that was the suggestion that was given to those folks. You can do that by clicking this link

<p>Hello Thou TryHard, whenever you move a profile off a hard drive the save data doesnt know who it belongs too, so thats why its coming up as unknown profile. If you still have the original profile, you need to sign in with that profile and all the unknown
 profile data will recognize that profile. It has to be that profile though and it has to be signed in and then you can move the game save data.</p>

<p>@papercut73 As I said though, I moved my profile on my flashdrive and moved it to my new xbox, if I were to redownload the account onto that xbox and I am signed into it, if I go to memory I will be able to move the stuff? Or what?</p>

<p>@ Thou TryHard, Yes or just copy your profile back onto your flash drive, plug it in to your old console, sign in and the save data should recognize that profile. Then you can move your data onto the flash drive also and to your new console. you can also
 configure cloud on both consoles and have your profile on both consoles.</p>

<p>@papercut73 Yeah that didn't work, I guess there is no way to truly fix this. I was on the main account and I tried to move it and it still thought I wasn't the owner. Oh well, just gotta do everything all over again.</p>

<p>@Mister Gwyther When I download the account back on that xbox it does nothing really, the save still says owned by Unknown Profile. I am certain that it was as the account that I am using now is the account that I made back in 7th grade, which I am now in
 10th, so yeah...There is no other account that it may have been using.</p>

<p>Have you tried reseting the console after you downloaded your profile, if that works move the saved games to the cloud save to be able to access them from any console.</p>
<p>If that Doesnt work call support and they may be able to tell you how to transfer saves to other gamertags.</p>
<p>The if that doesnt work then unfortunatly the only other way is useing illegal means inwhich i will not discuss on here.</p>
<p>But doing so is against the Code of Conduct and if caught can get banned</p>
