<h2>            KB2506212 and KB2387149 fail to install</h2>
                    I have a Windows XP computer here that fails to install KB2506212 and KB2387149. No error code is given, it just says update failed and lists the updates that have not been installed. When either update is attempted, it dumps out of Windows Update entirely
 regardless of other updates pending. I had to manually install the other pending updates, these are the last two that refuse to install both separately and together. My other computers here have been completing their updates just fine.<br />

<h2>            xbox controller is faulty and do not have a console....</h2>
                    So i had bought a xbox one controller (the tactical one) from a retailer however after 5-6 months the analogue stick is drifting. i went online to check to see how i can get a replacement as it is under warrenty however i find out that i need to hve a
 registered xbox console to get a exchange? ive never owned an xbox one console just a few controllers which i use for the pc with games such as rocket league and fifa. I dont think its fair that i need to buy a console just to be able to return a faulty controller.
 I there any other way to get round this?

<p>Not sure which country you live in but I know some countries laws are different but I know in the US/Canada it would fall under this link for warranty&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/warranty-and-service/console-kinect-warranty</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing that I want to point you to in this link is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Warranty Period" for </span><strong>Xbox One</strong><span> means 1 year from the date You purchased it; and for Accessories, means 90 days from the date You purchased it."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Accessories only have a 90 warranty period on them&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The only thing that does not is the xbox one console itself, a Kinect, and the power supply on the original xbox one itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Like&nbsp;</span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/52577f9e-148e-4863-9182-de15bd330531" title="Smwutches">Smwutches</a><span>
 said xbox support does have a way to do a warranty replacement for people that do not have a xbox console itself but when you do contact them they will probably tell you exactly what I have told you that it is out of warranty. if you live in the US/Canada&nbsp;
 I can not say for certain other countries/regions of the world.</span></p>

<p><br />
Hi there,</p>
<p>I am using windows 8.1 and have recently formatted my PC and installed windows 8.1 again.</p>
<p>For my backup i put everything from my C drive to my D drive.</p>
<p>Now after installing my windows when i try to copy my backup from D drive to C drive, the copying starts with speed around 2 Mbps then it drops down to bytes/sec then it drops to zero within few seconds.</p>
<p>After that the PC hangs up and it freezes completely.</p>
<p>I have tried copying from my D drive to a removable disk and earlier it copied the songs and i copied from that removable disk to C drive i copied successfully and now i'm trying to copy a video from D drive to removable disk the PC freezes again.</p>
<p>I'm not able to find the problem.</p>
<p>Please help me find the problem and the solution to it.</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

<p>If the check disk is not completing, then, it could be an issue with the drive itself.</p>

    <title>Setting up a Windows 7 Homegroup - Are fixed IP addresses advised or - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> n8steve  say:</h3>
<h2>            Setting up a Windows 7 Homegroup - Are fixed IP addresses advised or necessary&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Excuse a long introduction. Trying to set up a Homegroup containing 2 new Windows 7 PCs on wired connections to the same ISP router hub, I could set up a Homegroup on either or both PCs but the other could not join it. Searching the trouble-shooting guides
 everything seemed OK, IPV6 set on the router – yes, other settings correct – yes. I eventually found a report which said that the PCs needed to be on the same IP address e.g. 192.168.1.x – where x could vary and it told you how to find out the IP address.
 Of course, the IP addresses were different 192.168.1.83 and 192.168.0.31. The settings showed that the IP addresses were allocated automatically rather than fixed and I was thinking about trying to set the PCs to fixed IP addresses. However, in changing around
 the network connections and re-booting the PCs I suddenly found they now had the same IP address and, lo and behold, I could now set up the Homegroup and I could share files. Result!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. If, with automatic IP address allocation, the 2 PCs could have different addresses at one time and, after some network event, change to having the same address, what is the likelihood that some future event on the network will change them to being different
 addresses again and the Homegroup will stop working? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Should I therefore change the PCs to having fixed addresses and, if so, is this the correct way to do it?
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19249/how-to-assign-a-static-ip-address-in-xp-vista-or-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/19249/how-to-assign-a-static-ip-address-in-xp-vista-or-windows-7/</a> I think I read in another article that before setting the new IP address in Windows you had to release the existing address from the Command line with an IPCONFIG(?)
 command and after setting it re-connect – true or false? Can someone please tell me EXACTLY what is necessary.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Why is this not explained in the Microsoft guides for setting up and troubleshooting Homegroups?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>Both PCs are set for automatic IP address allocation as you recommend. I have not changed the settings and so assume they have been set that way from new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However they were initially, and to use better terminology, on different subnets - only the first 2 elements of the IP addreses were the same. While this was the situation they could not join the same Homegroup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something caused the IP address of 1 of the PCs to change so that they are now both on the same subnet and the Homegroup works as it should.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can force the computer to renew its DHCP client lease (i.e. get the settings from the router again) by using</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">ipconfig /renew </p>
<p>
</p><p>at a command prompt (you may need to run cmd as Administrator to do that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems strange that the PCs would not have renewed their DHCP client leases when they were switched on - was the one with the 192.168.1.83 address in hibernation when you received it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On some network devices, you can assign different subnets to different ports, but if you had a router capable of that and you had done it I guess you would have remembered that.</p>

 my home TV.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems to be an issue others have encountered, but I can't find anything definitive here,and the virtual assistant is not helpful.</p>
<p>

            Microsoft / Xbox has its central certified service. It is not excluded that he might have some service in your state. If there is no service in your country, and you still have a warranty console, you will get the labels from technical support to send
 a package that you will not pay. Through UPC or another delivery service in your state, you will send your console to the nearest service. And within three weeks you should come back with a repaired or new console.

    <title>Why does Windows 7 keep deleting my desktop shortcuts to files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sue12m  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Windows 7 keep deleting my desktop shortcuts to files&#63; This happens often, even though it is logging me in as the same user. Virus checks are not picking up any indication of virus etc.</h2>
                    when I login to my computer, sometimes most of my desktop short cuts to files have been deleted? why does this keep happening?<br />
how do I stop this from happening again?<br />
<br />
i have screened for viruses but nothing like that is coming up.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to happen in relation to windows updates either.
<br />
I'm hoping someone will recognise this and let me know how to fix the problem.<br />
Many thanks in advance for your help.<br />

<h2>            windows 7 taking a long time to start up &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>dear sir,</p>
<p>i have a couple of questions here and i hope that some one could help me with them. my laptop at the first days needed only about 30 seconds to start windows, but now i need more than 90 seconds to start windows.&nbsp;i have SONY (VAIO) machine, model number
 is CPCCW2S1E. i need to know what is taking a long time for the machine to start. and i would like to know if the registry is incharge somehow about that. i work with video and photo editing stuff, i always install and deinstall programs, so i thought&nbsp;that
 might be effecting &nbsp;my pc speed. and if the regestry is incharge about that, is there any way or any software to clean the registry or do something about it? if there is any recommended program, just let me know please...</p>
<p>thank you</p>

<p><span><span>Is your system error free?</span></span></p>
<p>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click&nbsp; and select Filter Current Log.&nbsp;Check the box&nbsp;before
 Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports.&nbsp;Click on the Date&nbsp;and Time Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the top.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. In the window you will see a button resembling two pages. Click the button and close Event Viewer. Now start your message&nbsp;and<span>&nbsp;</span>paste into
 the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<span>I suggest you download Process Explorer.<br />
For further information about Process Explorer see here:<br />

<br />
This freeware utility performs a similar function to the Windows Task Manager but it goes much further.</span></span></span>
<p>&nbsp;<span><span><span>In Process Explorer please add a Column. Select View, Select, Columns,&nbsp;Process, Performance and check the box before Start Time. Next select "Show Processes
 from all Users" and click on the column header "Start Time". This will sort so that you can see start with the earliest first. You may need to click twice or three times.</span></span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<div>
<div><span>On my Windows 7&nbsp;box the first item I see is smss.exe =Session Manager. You should then see a long list of items loading over a brief period of time. The boot process ceases on my computer with
 the loading of two AVG files ( my anti-virus is AVG 10. Before these two files is a uns.exe file&nbsp;which loaded this morning 2 minutes 20 seconds after smss.exe. Usn.exe is an Intel file so it may not be on your computer.</span></div>
<div><br />
<span>Questions. How long does it take from smss.exe loading for the main files to load? What are the files arriving at the end and how long does it take&nbsp;for them to appear after smss.exe?</span><br />
<div><span>Can you also detail what anti-malware software is installed?&nbsp;</span><br />
</span></span></span>

                    <p>The problem begins with this error message, when I attempt to run a manual maintenance in the action center after seeing that the maintenance utility doesn't know when it last ran:</p>

<p>I searched through older posts in this forum, which mainly pointed at steps to run DISM and SFC for checking for system corruptions/mistakes/etc. These steps did not work: All they succeeded in doing was repairing a random corruption found in an AMD folder.

 people with this and related problems seem to cite a rolled-back Windows 10 installation - actually, I'm in the same boat, and rolled back from Windows 10 some time around last september. Now what I'm trying to figure out is where to get some backup files
 or otherwise get maintenance working again. </p>
<p>Reformatting could be difficult - for whatever reason, the people who built the computer for me actually sent it with a Windows 7 installation disc instead of the Windows 8.1 I've used this whole time, and I lack any peripherals that would let me copy and
 back up my files easily. </p>
<p>While I have found a utility that was specifically made to fix Windows 10 rollbacks for this exact reason, it seems to be made more for Windows 7, and it cannot solve the problems it picks up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Auf Xbox mit YouTube App im Hintergrund Musik h&#38;&#35;246&#59;ren.</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Hab grade meine erste Xbox Live Goldmitgliederschaft eingelöst. Dann hab ich mir mal die Youtube App runtergeladen und hab bissel Musik gehört. Nun ist mir aufgefallen das man mit der Youtube App nicht im Hintergrund Musik hören kann. Kann man das irgendwie
 machen, das man mit der App im Hintergrund Musik hören kann. Das mit Xbox Music will ich nicht weil es Geld kostet OBWOHL man schon Geld für Xbox Live Gold bezahlt. Was auch sehr schön wäre wenn man Filme angucken könnte ohne dafür noch zusätzlich zu bezahlen.
 Ich finde das irgendwie schon ziemlich frech das man nochnichma Musik hören kann.</p>

<p>Aber geht das auch mit der YT App das man beim zocken Musik hören kann ?</p>

<p>*MfG*&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kurz gesagt nein geht nicht.</p>
<p>Kopiere dir deine Musik auf einen USB Stick und mit diesem kannst du dann im Hintergrund Musik laufen lassen.</p>
<p>Man kann übrigens auch mit Xbox Music nicht im Hintergrund Musik hören.</p>

<h2>            Help me&#33; I&#39;m five years old&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I own a 5 year old Xbox live account that I made, when I first got my Xbox, that I've been using on again and off again. Being the casual player type, I wasn't aware of any issues until I started recently purchasing microsoft points and upgraded my account
 to Gold status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is when I realized that my account was set as a child account. That wouldn't be an issue, except for the small handicap that I'm 28 years old. Attempting to promote my account to an adult account wasn't working either, because the option wasn't available
 to me. Thus the only explanation is that the birth date on my account hasn't reached 18 yet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, before people start accusing me of putting in the wrong age, during the creation of my account, hear me out...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been talking to the Xbox Customer support for the past couple of weeks and just spent a good chunk of this day with them on the phone, trying to find out the current birthday of my account, to see what was wrong with it and I finally got to the point,
 where I was informed that the only thing I could do was to create a new account. That meant, sacrificing all of my microsoft points, prepaid gold subscription and lengthy gaming history. So I started doing just that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating the new account was a relatively simple thing, until I got to the point of needing to sign up to Xbox Live. I decided I wanted to sign it up to my old Microsoft live account so I moved my old gamertag off it so I could sign it up to the new one.
 And that's where it hit me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The signup process automatically collected all the information from my live id and used it to create my account; my live account carries my correct birth date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This prompted me to contact Xbox customer support to ask what gives. They informed me that this service wasn't available 5 years ago, during the creation of my old gamertag, which finally got us to understand what the problem was. 5 years ago, their account
 creation process was designed so that all fields that were left blank were automatically filled. In my haste to get my account set up, I must have ignored the birthdate and the generic info that was placed there was
<i>the current date.</i> Hence, as far as Xbox's concerned, I'm 5 years old today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That means, that if I want to be able to fully utilize my old account, I need to wait a whooping 13 more years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I understand one fact. I bungled up. Obviously, I should have put in my birthdate at the time but hindsight is always 20/20. But the fault is also on Microsofts part. Since their company policy is that once you put in your birthday, it's set in stone,
 they should have barred me from continuing with the signup, until I was done filling in the information; not assume that I was 1 day old. I'm also gonna assume that I wasn't the only one to have impatiently pressed the "next" button, at the time, promising
 myself that I was gonna fill all these details at a later date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that's where I get to my point:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I propose a new service for old accounts that are still in service, which were created around this time, where people are allowed to submit a proof of their birthday, in order to have their account information fixed. Whether it be credit card details or
 passport, I'm sure some of simple system can be thought of, where people can make such a submission. As long as the process includes some sort of feature, where it's not too easy for children to abuse it.</p>

<p>Ouch. Sometime during the lifespan of the xbox after the next xbox, you might be able to promote. :(</p>
<p>I agree something needs to be changed with this. If the reason you can't change your birth date is to stop kids from lying about their age, why are you allowed to make a new account?</p>

<p>Even still, seeing as how easy it seems to be to just initially to lie about your age and create a new account, it would be nice if they could offer a service to those with old accounts.</p>
<p>I mean, they offer to change your gamertag, for microsoft points and you can change everything else in your profile, yourself. It shouldn't be too hard to implement something.</p>
<p>I've now created a temporary account that I used to download the restricted content I was trying to get. Since it's registered to the same Xbox, my "underage" account has the same access to it. It's very easy to work around these restrictions, if your underage,
 so the point of this totalitarian "you can't change it, period" rule is rendered mute.

<p>It is definitely a good idea, but some documents like that may give Microsoft way more information than Microsoft wants to know.</p>
<p>I'm sure they have some certain procedure already in place for something like that. I would of kept asking for a supervisor. That's what I do when I call in.</p>

<p>I'll probably be calling them few more times to do just that, but the last person I spoke to was particularly informative, which is what brought us to this conclusion.</p>
<p>He also recommended that I brought this up over here, telling me that it might be brought to the attention of those who handle making recommendations for Xbox Live upgrades. So whether or not they're already working on it, here's my recommendation.</p>

<p>Telling me to pay an attention is not exactly a good answer. Did you even read my letter or just glance at the title?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a serious design flaw to create a registration system where key information, that cannot be altered afterwards is automatically filled, when left blank. Let alone the fact that we're talking about a birth date being automatically filled with the current
 date. How on earth can you assume that someone playing Xbox is 1 day old?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead the system should have warned me that I couldn't proceed with the registration unless I filled in the required data. There was nothing around that warned me about possible repercussions, should I leave this particular field blank. We stumble upon
 sites and forums and services, all the time, that ask us for our personal details and usually, when we're capable of leaving the various fields blank, it means that it's not required to be filled. Thus it's not exactly a far fetched scenario to imagine someone,
 who just got one of the first consoles with online capabilities and just wanted to be done with setting it up, speedily clicking the "Accept" button, telling himself that he'll fill this data at a later date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally "Just buying another one" is easier said than done. Had I created this account only couple of months ago, I would have just shrugged my shoulders and done exactly that. However, this is an account that carries my entire gaming history, all my savegames,
 purchases and points. I don't want to loose all that. Then again, had I created this account only couple of months ago, I wouldn't have found myself with this problem to begin with. The process would have still been automatic, only this time it would have
 fetched this data from my Windows Live ID (I confirmed this when I did in fact create a new profile, which I mentioned in my first post). Provided that you put in your correct birtdate there, you don't have to worry about this issue. That's a good system.
 However, it's a system that wasn't around back then. That's why I'm proposing a way to fix older accounts, for users who might have fallen into this pit.</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem as OP. &nbsp;Except I seem to be able to download anything from xbox live (mature or otherwise), and there are no parental controls on my console. &nbsp;I have had xbox live gold for 5 years, bought and paid for every year, spending microsoft
 points. &nbsp;However I have only recently gone to play online on the EA servers (trying to play battlefield bad company 2) and I cannot play online (on this or any EA sports title at all) because I am apparently too young. &nbsp;I am 22 (born in 1988) and I am certain
 I did not input a date of birth that would have made me underage when I signed up. &nbsp;Besides, what child under 5 has their own debit/credit card to sign up to xbox live, and what company accepts that?</p>
<p>I find it completely unacceptable that microsoft simply shrug you off by saying we have made the mistake. &nbsp;Xbox support told me my options were to create a new account or wait till my current one "comes of age". &nbsp;I'm sorry but I refuse to pay for two accounts
 because of a flaw in the service that I pay for. &nbsp;And as for waiting, I tried really hard not to laugh as the customer service rep said that to me.</p>
<p>I refuse to lose every piece of DLC I have paid for, every save game, my achievements, my friends list and everything I have put into my account over 5 years because of Microsofts flawed system. &nbsp;Any more you hear from Microsoft OP let me know I would be
 very intrigued to hear it. &nbsp;I intent to formally complain about the issue as Customer Support were very unhelpful.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth crashes other software</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some troubles with the Bluetooth device of my Thinkpad W530 where I am running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever I turn on Bluetooth any input with my keyboard will lead to a crash of the program I am using. This happens for every program (Chrome, Edge Words, ...). They will work fine as long as I use just my mouse for input. I then have to turn off Bluetooth
 and then log off and log in again for things to work properly again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't connect to any devices when Bluetooth is on. It will find the device and pair but doesn't connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device manager says my Bluetooth device is working properly. I have tried to update and reinstall the driver but nothing helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember having used Bluetooth successfully in the past, the problem started when I was trying to connect my Bose SoundLink Mini.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what the problem could be?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oliver</p>

<h2>            Security of Windows 10 password memory</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10, &amp; am frequently asked whether I want Windows to remember website passwords. How secure is this feature?
</p>
<p>1. When installed; 2. When I leave my computer (can anyone access my websites? )</p>

            <p>The saving password feature is generally safe, someone would have to hack into your PC device, then hack into the password saving feature, so if your anti-virus is doing it's job you should have no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want a more secure password saving feature you should install a 3rd party password manager such as 'Lastpass' which is considered one of the best, I have been using it for several years, with no hassles. Apps such as Lastpass have extentions for Edge,
 IE11, Firefox &amp; Chrome, again they are dependent on the strength of you AV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The inbuilt &amp; 3rd party apps require a 'password' to gain access, so unless a person knows the password it is secure</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a web search for 'password manager' and check out the results.</p>

<p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, only Windows 7 has and it's only a mode. Meaning it's not the exact Windows XP 2000 operating system but a view mode instead. We can only use virtual machines for Windows 10 as of the moment and you can only use it to have an XP experience while
 using windows 10. It would not be recognized as a formal operating system. Support for XP has been cut off a couple of years ago and we do not have a downloadable file on our official sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any other concerns, don't hesitate to come back to us.</p>

    <title>Shadow of Mordor Season Pass not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metzlerandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shadow of Mordor Season Pass not working</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased the season pass for Shad ow of Mordor. It installed and I started the game but it doesn't recognize that the season pass is there. No skins, no new missions, nothing. Just the "vanilla" game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already talked to WB games support and a customer representative of Microsoft but no solution yet. I tried deleting the cache, reinstalling both the game and the season pass, restarting the Xbox, well... I tried literally everything that is there to try.
 &nbsp;But the game still thinks there is no season pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Has as anyone had the same problem? This is really frustrating as I payed 25€ and I really want to play the add on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok, took me several days of chatting, mailing and calling support, but we figured it out:</p>
<p>When you buy the season pass, you still have to download the Haddon and other things itself. Just do it via the store and the everything works fine.</p>
<p>Didn't know this season pass behaviour and I'm still very grateful for the customer care rep I talked to on the phone who had the idea.</p>

<h2>            Media Player has red line down middle of screem</h2>
                    <p>Today when I tried to watch a streaming video a&nbsp; red line appeared on the screen, this line actually splits the movie in half, not just the screen.&nbsp; Searching found an old Vista post to run an sfc scan which I did, no results.&nbsp; MSE scans clean, manually
 deleted all tmp files and restarted computer.&nbsp; I just checked and found it also dose this to movies I have stored on my remote drive and locally.</p>
<p>Have not tried any other media players yet, want to post and see if anyone has seen this recently.&nbsp; Will update when I test the 3rd party media players</p>

            <p>Is it just this one streaming video thats doing it, or is the red line now there for all your videos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have WMCenter, can you stream it with that? - <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27329/complete-guide-to-windows-7-media-center/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27329/complete-guide-to-windows-7-media-center/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try running the WMP troubleshooter ( probably the settings one ) and see if that helps. &lt;start&gt; in 'search programs and files' enter "troubleshoot" ( no quotes ). In the program results click 'troubleshooting' then click 'programs'. Then run the reset WMP
 settings to see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, try uninstalling, restarting, re-installing and restarting WMP as per -

<p>
</p><p>Neither take long to try, and the second one especially seems to help with some weird WMP issues.</p>

            Hi ScarlettLi 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since apologies, as of now, custom greeting in a different language is not possible. This is a much demanded feature and under consideration.
