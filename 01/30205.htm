<div>I can't help with your problem, but I can give you a word of advice.</div>
<div>Under *no* circumstances take it to the Geek Squad. The Geek Squad, in</div>
<div>my view, and that of lots of others of us here, is about the worst</div>
<div>possible place for any kind of computer service or advice. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you need to get professional help with your computer (for this</div>
<div>situation or any other one), take it to a small local place, not the</div>
<div>Geek Squad nor any other big box store.</div>

<h3> sardar nawaz khan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft&#39;s customer service</h2>
                    <p>I tried to open Mozilla Firefox on my computer and it wasn't responding. There was a pop up that stated 'Mozilla browser is blocked to avoid theft in your computer. Suspicious traces found. Call immediately at: 1-844-692-6305'.&nbsp;It stated that it is&nbsp;Microsoft's
 support number. I called that number and a man who claimed that his name is&nbsp;'Clinton' said he's a Microsoft technician. His direct number is 1844-539-5786 ext 905. He took control of my computer and said that there's&nbsp;Trojan virus on my computer and I'd have
 to purchase three of the anti virus products from Microsoft. I told him to give me a few minutes&nbsp;to&nbsp;discuss with my children&nbsp;before making the decision and I'd call him back. To my surprise, he&nbsp;yelled at me on the phone and said, "You&nbsp;need to buy it now or
 else I don't have time for you. I am busy with so many other customers." Immediately after saying that, he hung up on me. I was shocked and disappointed so I called back to the same extension and told him to learn to treat his customers as he just lost one.
 Instead of apologizing, he said "We don't need you Pakistanis&nbsp;in&nbsp;Microsoft" and hung up on me again. What kind of customer service is this? I&nbsp;was a loyal customer of Microsoft but today,&nbsp;I am very disappointed with Microsoft and the kind of people that Microsoft
 is recruiting for customer service. If it is not Microsoft then this is a serious issue that Microsoft should look into.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was not Microsoft; they are scammers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the advice we normally give, <strong>BUT you gave them remote access so read second part of this reply.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft and/or their associated companies will never get in touch with you through "popups", phone calls (unless you made arrangements with them), etc.,
</p>
<p>And&nbsp;your Computer does not send out reports to anyone saying that it is infected with Malware or that it has problems.</p>
<p>________________________________________</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for you to even see that popup and that popup&nbsp;giving you various phone numbers to ring for assistance means that&nbsp;your computer&nbsp;may already be&nbsp;infected with Malware

            <p>For your convenience, here is the text of the privacy statement for the Microsoft Error Reporting Service.&nbsp; To see the latest version, please visit the online version of this privacy statement at
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190175" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=190175</a><br />
<br />
Privacy Statement for the Microsoft Error Reporting Service <br />
Last updated: June 2011<br />
<br />
Microsoft is committed to helping protect your privacy. This statement explains how the Microsoft Error Reporting (MER) service collects information and how the information can be used. This statement does not apply to other online or offline Microsoft websites,
 software, or services. <br />
<br />
Why does Microsoft collect information about errors and problems? <br />
<br />
The information helps Microsoft and Microsoft partners diagnose problems in the software you use and provide solutions. Not all problems have solutions but when solutions are available, they are offered as updates to install or steps for solving a problem you've
 reported. To help prevent problems and make software more reliable, some solutions are also included in service packs and future versions of the software.
<br />
<br />
How is information collected? <br />
<br />
Many third-party and Microsoft software programs, including some Windows operating systems, are designed to work with the MER service. If a problem occurs in one of these software programs, you might be asked if you want to report it. You can view the details
 of the report before sending it, although some files might not be in a readable format.
<br />
Some software also allows you to report problems automatically instead of requesting your consent each time a problem occurs. If you use automatic reporting, you’re not prompted to review the information in a report before it is sent. However, no information
 is collected unless you (or your system or network administrator) choose to report problems. You can choose to stop reporting problems at any time.
<br />
Enterprise customers can use the Microsoft System Center Desktop Error Monitoring (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=35327) to manage error reporting and data collection, and to choose the information that is sent to Microsoft. The System Center Desktop
 Monitoring privacy statement can be accessed at http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=85868.
<br />
Windows administrators can use Group Policy to modify many of the settings for the MER service. For more information see http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148428.
<br />
<br />
What types of information can be collected? <br />
<br />
The reporting service can collect information about problems that interrupt you while you work and information about errors that occur behind the scenes. It’s important to diagnose errors that occur behind the scenes because these problems, if left unsolved,
 might cause additional problems such as performance or program failures. <br />
Reports contain information that is most useful for diagnosing and solving the problem that has occurred, such as:
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where the problem happened in the software or hardware. <br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The type or severity of the problem <br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Files that help describe the problem. These failures are typically system or report-generated files about software behavior before or after the problem occurred.
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Basic software and hardware information. This information can include operating system version and language, device models and manufacturers, or memory and hard disk size.
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Possible software performance and compatibility problems.<br />
Information such as your IP address, operating system version, browser version, and regional and language settings are also collected because you’re connecting to an online service (web service) to send error reports. However, this information is used only
 to generate aggregate statistics. It is not used to identify you or contact you.
<br />
Reports might unintentionally contain personal information, but this information is not used to identify you or contact you. For example, a report that contains a snapshot of memory might include your name, part of a document you were working on, or data that
 you recently submitted to a website. If you host virtual machines using a Windows operating system, reports generated by the Windows operating system for the MER service might include information about virtual machines. If you’re concerned that a report might
 contain personal or confidential information, you should not send the report. <br />
After you send a report, you might be asked to complete a survey about the error you experienced. If you choose to provide your phone number or e-mail address in response to the survey, your report will be personally identifiable. Microsoft might contact you
 to request additional information to help solve the problem you reported. <br />
Starting with the Windows 7 operating system, MER generates a globally unique identifier (GUID) that is stored on your computer and sent with reports to uniquely identify your computer. The GUID is a randomly generated number; it does not contain any personal
 information and is not used to identify you. We use the GUID to distinguish how widespread the feedback we receive is and how to prioritize it. For example, the GUID allows Microsoft to distinguish between one customer experiencing a problem one hundred times
 and one hundred customers experiencing the same problem once. <br />
<br />
Who can use the information and how can it be used? <br />
<br />
Microsoft uses information about errors and problems to improve Microsoft products and services as well as third-party software and hardware designed for use with these products and services. Microsoft employees, contractors, vendors, and partners might be
 provided access to information collected by the reporting service, including survey responses. However, they will use the information only to repair or improve Microsoft products and services and third-party software and hardware designed for use with Microsoft
 products and services. <br />
For example, if a report indicates that a third-party product is involved, Microsoft might send that information to the vendor of the product. The vendor might provide the information to sub-vendors and partners; however, all parties must abide by the terms
 of this privacy statement. <br />
To improve the products that run on Microsoft software, Microsoft might share aggregate information about errors and problems. Aggregate information is used for statistical analysis and does not contain specific information from individual reports, nor does
 it include any personal or confidential information that might have been collected from a report.
<br />
<br />
Information storage, processing, and release <br />
<br />
Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft by the MER service may be stored and processed in the United States or any other country in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by
 the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland. Microsoft may access or disclose information about you, including
 the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary
 to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public. Microsoft occasionally hires other companies to provide limited services on its behalf, such as providing customer support, processing transactions, or performing statistical
 analysis of reports. Microsoft will provide these companies only the information they need to deliver the service. They are required to maintain the confidentiality of the information and are prohibited from using it for any other purpose.
<br />
<br />
Security practices <br />
<br />
Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, we store the information you provide
 on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.
<br />
<br />
Changes to this privacy statement <br />
<br />
We will occasionally update this privacy statement to reflect changes in our products, services, and customer feedback. When we post changes, we will revise the "last updated" date at the top of this statement. We encourage you to periodically review this statement
 to be informed of how Microsoft is protecting your information. <br />

<h2>            Unable to unlock and access the computer after Windows 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>*Original Title: <strong>NEED HELP ! Locked out my computer!!!! (and another one)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there is lot's of similar post but I've tried everything to regain access to my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is after upgrade to 8.1, I was asked to create an outlook account, not quite sure why I did that, but I only used fake information and a password, that I forgot a few days later. Since I've been trying to access my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Resetting my password is not possible as I only used fake information....</p>
<p>- I've tried multiple recovery password programs but none of them seem to boot up... Although my pass recovery usb key does work on my other laptop.</p>
<p>- I cannot actualise my PC, it asked my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose I can format and install a fresh windows, but i'll be losing all my data no?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest solution, would be a password reset on the email created after the upgrade.... It's an empty account, not a single sensitive data.... But there is no way I can prove anything as I used fake data while creating it.... I'm was dumb that day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate some help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Orion</p>

<h2>            Skype Camera Problems</h2>
                    Skype won't recognize the camera on my computer to let me video chat.&nbsp; I have turned my camera on for Skype in my privacy settings and updated my Skype version and it still says that there is no webcam available.&nbsp; I'm not sure what to do next, as those
 were all of the suggestions that the trouble shooting website gave. Do you all have any more suggestions?

            Hi ElaynaRender
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />1. You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work, Share with me your DirectX Diagnostic report
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type dxdiag and Enter &gt; Save All information (down button) to a Text file &gt; Upload text file to Onedrive and share the link here
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h3> dpm95  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#38;quot&#59;Memory Unit&#38;quot&#59; without Memory Card installed&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just bought a used Xbox 360. I bought a hard drive, which is plugged in. There are no memory cards or USB's connected. Under Store Settings, I see: Hard Drive, Memory Unity, and Cloud Saved Games. &nbsp; Why is the memory unity appearing there? There are no
 memory cards plugged in. &nbsp;It has 164mb left in it, with one item saved on it. that is "Content Cache" created on 11/22/05. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can someone please explain this all to me?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Remove ALL power and reseat the cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually<br />
remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the dust bunnies and ensure the vents are clear.<br />
Make sure the fans run after you put it back together. Those are for a PC and for a laptop about<br />
all you can do is reseat the memory and clean the vents.<br />
<br />
This sounds like a hardware issue and if the above does not help then you probably need the help of<br />
a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a Best Buy or other Big Box Stores) or the System<br />
Maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Be sure to check with the System Maker and Device Maker's Support. their on-line documentation<br />
and drivers, and with their forums (if any) for known issues.<br />
<br />
====================================<br />
<br />
After the above use these methods to update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers (at the System<br />
Maker - or Motherboard maker for custom systems) and the video device maker's sites.<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>This is my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video driver, BIOS, and chipset drivers)</p>
<p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :</p>
<p>DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a></p>
<p>For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.</p>
<p>Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.</p>
<p>Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)</p>
<p>Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.</p>
<p>Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.</p>
<p>Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.</p>
<p>Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (manually updating using the methods above are<br />
preferred to ensure the latest updated versions of the drivers are found at the system maker<br />
and device maker's sites)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a></p>
<p>If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.</p>

<h3> pinball-&#91;xboxvenue&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t send messages, tried everything.</h2>
                    <p>Let me preface that I have never had enforcement actions made on my account and enforcement.xbox.com says I have an absolutely perfect record, as well as reputation. So if you have something to say along the lines of "You're banned for talking trash!!!!" just save it to yourself, it's not the case.<br /><br /></p>

<p>So about 3 months ago, I re-downloaded my profile onto a new console and it seems I can't send messages. I can send messages through the app and through the website, just not on the console.<br /><br /></p>

<p>The message I receive states to go to account.live.com/reputationcheck and after verifying, it seems to just take me to my account settings. No further instructions.<br /><br /></p>

<p>I've talked to about 15 different service reps, and it seems they are absolutely useless in fixing this matter. (Big surprise.)<br /><br /></p>

<p>I've seen similar threads, and it seems Xbox Support is ignoring or avoiding&nbsp;the problem entirely, and seems to be refusing to admit something is wrong here, like they seem to do with the constant guide crashes, "games taking too long to start" and general non-sense that seems to pile after each update.</p>

<p>Let me preface that I have never had enforcement actions made on my account and enforcement.xbox.com says I have an absolutely perfect record, as well as reputation. So if you have something to say along the lines of "You're banned for talking trash!!!!"

<p>So about 3 months ago, I re-downloaded my profile onto a new console and it seems I can't send messages. I can send messages through the app and through the website, just not on the console.<br />

<p>The message I receive states to go to account.live.com/reputationcheck and after verifying, it seems to just take me to my account settings. No further instructions.<br />

<p>I've talked to about 15 different service reps, and it seems they are absolutely useless in fixing this matter. (Big surprise.)<br />

<p>I've seen similar threads, and it seems Xbox Support is ignoring or avoiding&nbsp;the problem entirely, and seems to be refusing to admit something is wrong here, like they seem to do with the constant guide crashes, "games taking too long to start" and general
 non-sense that seems to pile after each update.</p>

<h2>            After ending up in a hacked lobby, my game is messed up&#33;&#33; PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Last night 11/14/2013 after 2 of my friends and I played dozens of games, we ended up in a lobby that everyone had unlimited ammo and the ability to jump very high, so we left the game early. I noticed that after we left, any game that we entered was giving
 us lots of squad points (1 per kill/capture). We decided to separate and try our own games, but we were still getting many squad points. I then reset my connection and turned off my xbox and tried again, and I'm still getting the same amount of squad points.
 I don't remember the lobby I was in, but there were members there with thousands of squad points. I CAN NOT play like this. I despise &nbsp;cheaters, and I have been victimized! I've never had this problem before, and I NEED HELP!!</p>
<p>The Gamertags of the other players on the opposing team (One of which that possibly hacked this lobby) are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>[Mod Removed: name and shame]</strong></p>

<p>PLEASE FIX MY CONSOLE! &nbsp;Thank you</p>

    <title>Surface Book Battery life still unpredictable after almost 2 weeks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> auri rahimzadeh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Battery life still unpredictable after almost 2 weeks</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to figure out whether I really can get 12 hours / day of battery life from Surface Book. Maybe I should try a more scientific method than "<em>Can I go an entire day from off-charger at 8am to evening at 6pm?</em>".&nbsp;On a good day, I'm&nbsp;seeing maybe
 7 hours of endurance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows still seems to eat&nbsp;battery like crazy when the lid is closed. I've run powercfg -requests and there's nothing, but if I close my lid, the fan oftentimes stays on. The unit is often noticeably warm&nbsp;when I take it out. I've been careful to close Outlook,
 Visual Studio, and others to see if I can find a pattern. I have no server software on my laptop - I leave that in a VM I don't leave running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've attached a screen shot of my Book's battery estimate after using it for 90 minutes this morning.
<strong>2 hours, 20 minutes.</strong>&nbsp;I've <em>never </em>seen it estimate 12 hours of battery life. The highest I've seen is around 9. So, Microsoft - was that a real estimate with real production hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've noticed that removing the tablet top and then reattaching significantly affects my battery life. Is there a setting that's charging the tablet component when it's battery starts getting low? Haven't noticed such, but asking while I've got my stream
 of consciousness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a normal day, I'm using Visual Studio, and using the Suggested display brightness. This is an i7, DGPU, 16GB, 512GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it that Apple's hardware can manage battery just fine and Microsoft's can't? I can't blame it on the manufacturer not writing good Windows drivers, since, well, it's
<em>Microsoft's </em>product this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem here, of course, is I can't trust I can take this out for an entire day and not need my charger. That is, of course, why I bought the unit.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft, would you please deliver on your 12 hours of battery, or update your specifications to be truthful? Most people buying an almost $3,000 machine are not buying it to simply use Word and watch videos. Your battery estimate should reflect how
 the prosumer would use such a product, not the productivity-tablet-seeking consumer you appear to use as a battery test model.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After working on this post for 20 minutes, my Surface Book is at <strong>
68% battery and 2 hr 55 minutes remaining</strong>. OMG. 5% used in 20 minutes. The following applications are running, but were not being used: Edge, Firefox, Outlook, OneNote, Visual Studio 2013, Notepad++, Slack, SourceTree, Notepad, and Paint.NET.</p>

            <p>Fellow Book Owners -</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about we help Microsoft out by telling them what we're running. Those of us with 13 hour battery lives can see what those with 4.5 have, and compare. Just your primary apps, antivirus, and backup services will do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Visual Studio 2013 w/Telerik Extensions like JustCode</p>
<p>Adobe Creative Suite</p>
<p>Firefox, Edge</p>
<p>Office 365</p>
<p>Occasionally VirtualBox</p>
<p>Outlook is almost always running</p>
<p>Finally configured Windows Mail</p>
<p>Windows Defender</p>
<p>Carbonite</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did notice battery issues more often upon configuring Windows Mail (so I could share) and Carbonite (to ensure I'm backed up). Note sure which would have caused issues. Windows Mail also configures Windows Calendar and Contacts, and you get those darn
 notifications ALL THE TIME. I wish I could turn off the hybrid / multi-state sleep feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Auri</p>

            <p>Great post. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I'm running into..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have had my 256 gb i5 dgpu 8gb Ram SB for over a week now, and I'm averaging around 7 hours of use, too. What I'm running probably fits in with what 'most consumers' of this device may use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word</p>
<p>Mail</p>
<p>Edge (up to 5 pages open)</p>
<p>Store</p>
<p>Groove music app</p>
<p>and sometimes Adobe Photoshop CC 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still only averaging around 7 hours of daily use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night, I detached the screen and drew a picture for five minutes, and that battery reported 68% left after just five minutes. Don't know what's going on but that's not good!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, getting blue screens now and then, something about 'Watchdog', and while scrolling in Edge occasionally I'll get the 'Intel HD Driver' error thing, as well as a constant 'AutoRotate On' message that seems to come and go at will.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, 7 hrs of daily use only..</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO, the battery icon constantly changes the time left on the battery. For instance, one time it said 9 hours, 8 min, about a minute later it said 2 hrs, 3 min, and a minute after that it said 5 hrs, 13 min.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>WTH!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help or address these issues, Microsoft, or many of us early adopters will be asking for refunds pretty quickly here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thx</p>

            My battery life has seemingly got worse since the latest update. At one point after a November update&nbsp;I
<em>was </em>able to achieve an estimation of 12+ hours of battery life however as I write this I am now getting an estimated 2 and a half hours off 68% charge. My usage thus far has been very light. I've literally ran no applications since purchasing my surface
 book except edge.

            I have found a slight temporary workaround. You have to enable battery saver and use suggested screen brightness, this has made mine last 8-9 hours. Some people say disabling Cortana and Windows Hello also helps, but I love those features, and that didn't
 work for me. Many of us are having the same issue you are.

            I am having the exact same issue. Very poor battery life versus what was promised. Would like to better understand why the battery life is so different than MS has stated.

            <p>I've had my Surface Book for a week now (same specs as yours) and my battery life varies greatly. I've currently been running it for 4 hours and 5 minutes (that's 6 tabs of Chrome, SourceTree, Adobe CC, and DropBox when using, but it did sleep for about
 1.5 hours of that time). My battery is at 77%. The strange thing is that when I started this reply, it was at 78% with an estimated 10 hours and 23 minutes remaining. Now, when I check (5 sentences in ~2 minutes later), it's at 77% with an estimated 7 hours
 and 34 minutes. Wait, now 76% with 9 hours and 8 minutes.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This makes no sense and is absolutely unreliable for actual estimates. I work remotely and will be boondock camping heavily in the spring (I realize that puts me in a niche category and not MS's top priority, but I'm still a consumer of their high-end laptop).
 My hope was to have a machine that could make it a work day or two on a single charge, but as of now, who can say?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, yesterday I noticed variances between the tray icon's battery estimate and the Settings\Battery Saver estimate (though today, they seem to be synced). I suppose I shouldn't be complaining as my battery life estimates are coming in much higher than
 yours (though I highly doubt this charge will work for another 4 hours, let alone the estimated 7 - 10 hours). Still, estimates and actual work time seem to vary far too much to go unresolved or unanswered by Microsoft.</p>

            <p>For those who are experiencing battery drain or other issues after the latest firmware update, take a look at the following post and follow the instructions.</p>
<p><br />
<br />
It seems that Surfacebooks shipped with a corrupted system file and this is causing issues.
<br />
Using the above instructions I have fixed a corrupt system file on my machine, and it is behaving much more normally now (1-2% drain in sleep - most of the time).</p>

<h2>            Is it possible to re-use a Windows digital license key in a new device&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I just bought a laptop computer without any OS on it and I then bought a Windows 10 Professional 32 64bit Digital License Key. I downloaded Windows 10 from the Microsoft website and I activated it with the license key. However the laptop have some
 technical problems and it will be replaced for a new one by the seller. Is it possible to install and activate Windows in the new laptop without buying a new license?

<br />Select the Start  button, select Settings  &gt; Update &amp; security  &gt; Activation  &gt; and then select Add an account. You must be signed in as an administrator to add your Microsoft account; for more information, see Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10.
<br />Enter your Microsoft account and password, and then select Sign in. You’ll also need to enter the password for your local account if the Microsoft account you entered isn’t a connected account.
<br />After you add your Microsoft account, you’ll see Windows is activated with a digital license linked to your Microsoft account on the Activation page.
<br />
<br />note:
<br />If you changed your hardware, and Windows 10 wasn’t preinstalled when you bought your PC, and you have an existing Windows product key that was used on your PC prior to the hardware change, click Change product key in the Activation settings page to enter the key. For more information about product keys and digital licenses, see Activation in Windows 10.
<br />If you changed your hardware, and Windows 10 was preinstalled when you bought your PC, then you may need to purchase a new Windows license. Click Go to Store, and follow the instructions.

<br />If you have used that Windows 10 licence in the link you provided, that is not a legit Windows 10 licence, it is a volume licence
<br />
<br />While it will initially activate, after a while it will de-activate as that licence is meant to be re-armed in a company environment form their activation servers . . .

 helpful information on how to resolve this problem online.</p>

<h2>            Surface Hub doesn&#39;t charge the Surface-The Charging light flickers</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Colleague has a Surface Pro 4. The Surface hub that he uses can connect to other monitors but it doesn't charge the Surface. The charging light flickers constantly and it doesn't remain steady. He has no problem using the Surface Power Adapter that has
 got a different connector. The connector looks like <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Surface+Connector&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS768US768&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=Gr0fa2jP_GGQeM%253A%252CBHvO5aRAC-dkOM%252C_&amp;usg=AI4_-kTkTgYN2Zd_xDsmq-Cd3WPAs04I-g&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjhrcfD2oveAhUlhOAKHdaaBSIQ9QEwD3oECAMQBA#imgrc=Gr0fa2jP_GGQeM:" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this&nbsp;</a>&nbsp; . Do Surface Hubs come with those connectors?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Gpt crc corrupt&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 a few weeks ago. When the system was up and running, I noticed that I had two 3TB drives, I &amp; J. This was odd since my two 3TB drives were part of a RAID 1 mirror that was set up using the Marvell utility on my Asus motherboard.
 I had to rebuild the mirror using new drives. I wound up replacing both drives as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took out one old drive and replaced with new 3TB drive.</p>
<p>Rebooted and went into the RAID utility and rebuilt the mirror.</p>
<p>Took out the other old drive and replaced with new 3TB drive.</p>
<p>Rebooted and went into the RAID utility and rebuilt the mirror.</p>
<p>Rebooted into Windows 10 and verified health of the now single 3TB I drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The RAID utility reports that the mirror is healthy as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows reports that everything is fine with this mirror however, when I run my weekly backup using Acronis, I get the following messages in the results email:</p>

            <p>Hello Kristina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the steps given below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Add your BT device through the System Settings -&gt; Devices menu and make sure it is paired.<span>&nbsp;

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select "Send a file".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select the device you want to send to and click next; (this is why it needs to be paired FIRST, mentioned in step
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You will now be brought to the Select the file(s) window.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Browse for the file you want to send; click open, then click next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If your device is not yet set to Always Allow, you will have to approve/accept receiving the file on your device.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click Finish after send is complete.</p>

<p>Hi. I recently got a new laptop with Windows 10, have set up my Office 365 apps fine, but cannot start Skype for Business. I get an error message ' Cannot sign in to Lync because your computer clock is not set correctly'. When I first started the laptop,
 the clock was set to a very old date, I have corrected it but am still getting this message. Can anybody help. Thanks</p>

</p><p>After that you have to go to:</p>
<p>1-<strong>Control Panel</strong></p>
<p>2-<strong>Clock, Language, and Region</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2.1- <strong>Fix "Date &amp; Time"</strong>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2.2- <strong>Fix "Region"</strong></p>
