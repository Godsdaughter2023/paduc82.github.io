<h2>            wireless display adapter firmware update</h2>
                    I use a wireless display adapter with an Android device and would like to update the firmware. I have installed the wireless display app on an old Windows computer that is running Windows 10. I think the computer is too old to use the wireless display
 adapter, but can I update the firmware with it? I am trying, but so far can't get the app to see my adapter. If it's possible, please explain how it is done. Thanks!

            <p>Possible fix for Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter - Worked for me - From Windows 10 build 14295 for PC and Mobile Release</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saw the known issues list had this in it.&nbsp; So I thought I would try it on my released to public version and found the same .173</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to connect to Miracast will fail. The workaround to get out of this state is to go to this registry key
<code><span style="color: rgba(199, 37, 78, 1)">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\SharedAccess\Parameters</span></code>, select
<code><span style="color: rgba(199, 37, 78, 1)">StandaloneDhcpAddress</span></code>, and change the value from
<code><span style="color: rgba(199, 37, 78, 1)">192.168.173.1</span></code> to
<code><span style="color: rgba(199, 37, 78, 1)">192.168.137.1</span></code> (value type is REG_SZ).</p>

    <title>overrun stack-based buffer &#40;0xF7&#41; while attempting Vista - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            overrun stack-based buffer &#40;0xF7&#41; while attempting Vista install</h2>
                    
<p>I'm getting the following error when I try to install Windows Vista (basic home edition 32bit):<br />
<br />
a driver has overrun a stack-based buffer<br />
<br />
Technical Information:<br />
*** STOP: 0x000000F7<br />
<br />
The thing is, this is a brand new machine I assembled this morning.&nbsp; It has no drivers at all on it, so I'm doubting one of my drivers can be causing the issue.&nbsp; Likewise for viruses, as I haven't even formatted the HD yet.<br />
<br />
I get this error when trying to boot from my Vista install disk.&nbsp; This even happens when I try to boot into Safe Mode off the DVD as well.&nbsp; It loads all drivers off the disk (final one is windows\system32\drives\disk.sys), momentarily puts up the Safe Mode
 screen, then BSoD.<br />
<br />
System specs:<br />
Gigabyte GA-MA770T-UD3P M/B<br />
AMD Phenom II X3 720 CPU<br />
G.Skill DDR3-1600 PC3-12800 2GB memory sticks (two)<br />
Seagate Barracuda 7200 1TB H/D<br />
BFG Geforce 8800 GTS OC<br />
Pioneer&nbsp;DVR-A04 DVD&nbsp;R/W&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have tried swapping out another HD, using just one of the RAM modules, then just the other (in each of the board's 4 slots), all with the same result.&nbsp; I have searched numerous tech support forums for this issue but all the problems I've seen were with people
 who had&nbsp;a virus on&nbsp;a functional Windows install.&nbsp; I have been through my BIOS and could not find any memory features or settings that were incorrect.&nbsp; I have restored the BIOS to defaults.</p>

            Appears the issue is with the display driver (monitor).&nbsp; Hooked up my old 17" instead of my LCD &amp; am now installing Vista.&nbsp; Will update again if I have any difficulties switching back to my LCD after Vista is running.

<h3> sharing2011  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel&#40;R&#41;ICH8M Ultra ATA Storage Controllers-2850 drivers</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Windows Vista 32 bit to Windows 7 Premium 64 bit. My laptop Dell Inspiron 1525 was capable of handling a 64bit. I did the test prior to installing it and everything passed. However after doing the upgrade my Device Manager has a
 yellow ! on the PCI Bus and said there were no drivers installed. I have tried doing an update on the driver but keeps telling me no drivers available. I have went on the site for my specific ChipSet and tried downloading from there and it still doesn't work.
 Can anyone&nbsp; help me with this issue? Thanks

            <p>According to Dell site that model is not compatible with win7, either bit version, and only Dell would have drivers for that model.</p>
<p>You could try the Dell forums to see if anyone has successfully installed win7 on that model.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for an update.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
You can also enable the Modern User Interface keyboard on the desktop screen.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Here’s how you can enable and use it:</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Right Click on the taskbar and click on <strong>Toolbars.<br />
</strong>b) Navigate and click on <strong>Touch keyboard</strong>.<br />
c) Click on the keyboard icon that appears on the lower left corner at the taskbar.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if you are able to view the touch keyboard on the desktop screen.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp;</div>

            These Microsoft folks know what we're talking about and wanting.&nbsp;
<div><span><br />
</span>
<div>After reading similar forums, I realize that they just like to play dumb. There's no way they don't know what were talking about if they're charged with answering our questions. And especially if it was in a previous version.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But its OK micro$oft. There's a reason why PC sales are going down because of windows 8. You can keep playing dumb if u want. But we are telling you what we want, you just need to figure out whether you're gonna listen. Is it the money that's driving you
 or the needs of the ppl (that's giving u the money). Choose wisely or you're gonna open up a hole for new competition/better product.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I guess you have signed in to Skype Preview for Windows 10. If you're using the same Skype account - your contacts should sync. Do you have a Skype&nbsp;username/ID? Or&nbsp;are you&nbsp;using your email address/phone number to sign in? The best
 way to confirm this is to download <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/download-skype/skype-for-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Windows Desktop</a>&nbsp;&gt; sign in to your account &gt; compare the account you have on the

<h2>            Windows 7 fax and Scan sent faxes not showing up</h2>
                    Thanks in advance
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am using windows 2008 STD server &nbsp;for faxing.</div>
<div>My&nbsp;client&nbsp;is windows 7 Pro 32 bit</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Fax has been working fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had an error a while ago, where the faxes being sent did not go to outbox, and then did not show in sent either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I&nbsp;re installed&nbsp;the scan and fax interface and that fixed the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have that problem come back after about 2 months again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any fix for this issue?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

<br />0XC1900104	MOSETUP_E_PROCESS_TIMEOUT	The installation process did not complete within the required time limit.
<br />This is a very general error not helpful much indeed.
<br />
<br />Try updating to 1903 using Media Creation tool and if it fails let us know.
<br />
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

            <p>Hi Melvin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To isolate your concern, are you trying to send email messages when you receive an error message? Are you able to receive email messages?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>Error 0x800CCCDE</strong> together with <strong>Socket Error 10060</strong> is usually caused by a conflict with the
<strong>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)</strong> servers while using your email program. Make sure that your email account settings are correct, and that
<strong>Port 25</strong> or <strong>Port 587</strong> is the port used in the <strong>
SMTP</strong> area, unless there is another port to use provided by the <strong>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

</p><p>Looking at it in File Explorer, only the top 10% of the image is displayed, with the rest grayed out. Most of the fields in Detail tab are now blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I removed the image from an mp3 file using a third party tool, I am able to update file information without any problems thru the file properties detail tab.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The list you are requesting is a bit long, so just a few basic details...</p>
<p>This machine works quite well with Win 10 RTM 10240, whether from a upgrade of Win 7 SP1, Win 8.1 (have done both}, or a clean install of 10240...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It hasn't always been that way with some of the Previews, but is stable and performs well at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EP45_UD3R Motherboard x64</p>
<p>Core2 Quad Q9650 (OC'd) added recently, to replace Core2 Duo E8200 (OC'd)</p>
<p>HD4850 Gigabyte\Radeon HD4850 Graphics</p>

<p>
</p><p>The machine for the most part is running drivers installed by Win 10 RTM, or that were retained through the upgrade... Some were original Gigabyte drivers, but a lot were using the hardware manufacturers drivers.</p>

            <p>You request seems like a thinly veiled rant against Gigabyte.</p>
<p>Also your basic premise seems to be flawed (that because the hardware can support Windows 10, that if Gigabyte doesn't make work, Gigabyte is cheating you, no matter how old the motherboard is.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft can state that XXX is the minimum requirements to run Windows 10.</p>
<p>But it is the minimum, not a guarantee that Windows 10 will work on that machine, or if it will run into problems or not.&nbsp; In a nutshell the hardware is only part of the picture, and the BIOS, and drivers and such are the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have a 15 year old motherboard it might have all the specs needed to run Windows 10.&nbsp; But something that old you are not going to get new drivers.&nbsp; It just not economical for any manufacture to update drivers for something that old.&nbsp; Now it is very
 possible that the old drivers might work just fine in Windows 10.&nbsp; Good you are lucky (and in fact most will be lucky).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So we come to "force obsolescence", to you that seems to mean that if it is possible, Gigabyte should make it work for you.&nbsp; Well from a manufacture's point of view you paid for product/service for a certain period of time that they have calculated into
 price you paid for your motherboard vs how much it costs to make and support such.&nbsp; I have actually no idea of how many years that Gigabyte will update drivers for their motherboard, but I do know it is not infinite.&nbsp; And most likely if they are going to test
 and fix drivers, they will start with their newest motherboards and as time goes on work backwards test/fixing older ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that you request the spec's from other people's machines, but didn't do the same for yours.</p>
<p>And in the way you stated the question you neither want people to try to help you with your problem, or to use the information to buy a configuration that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For what its worth the machine I'm typing does have a Gigabyte motherboard in it, that frankly I really like.&nbsp; In fact I like it better than a similar Asus motherboard I have in another machines.&nbsp; Both machines upgraded with no real problems.&nbsp; I think there
 was a license problem on one of the AMD tools I don't use, and later I even found an update for it.&nbsp; I did do clean installs of both of them, but that was mostly because of the fact on one of them I had the classic upgrade problem.&nbsp; As in there a ton of settings
 that have to be transferred perfectly from one operating system to another, and doing so is extremely hard to do without any problems.&nbsp; Microsoft has got a lot better at it, but still problems can creep in, and they did on one machine.&nbsp; And I decided a clean
 install was the better approach then try to weed out these settings/install kind of problems one at a time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also run both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows 10 on this machine.</p>

<p>To clarify some things here.</p>
<p>I have been using gigabyte products for about 20 years, mainly motherboards going back to the AMD
</p>
<p>socket A.</p>
<p>Most of my pc builds have used there products, except for a few biostar, msi and asus boards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not feel it relevant to post information as to if I dislike a vendor's product or not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;This post was created to find other users that have their products in use on a win10 pc, not just for my&nbsp;</p>
<p>benefit, but assist others.</p>
<p>The info that was asked to be posted was not for one kind of gigabyte board but all that have had win 10 installed.</p>
<p>If enough system configurations where posted, it could have been possible to assist in helping all that had issues, as well as communicating with the &nbsp;OEM and AMD as to what works and what does not, or the best one to use at present time.</p>
<p>"The reason for this information is from my own experience with windows 10 &nbsp;that driver&nbsp;</p>
<p>support for some devices have been left out for the os or made so that the system&nbsp;</p>
<p>does not perform well to force obsolescence even though the hardware is more then</p>
<p>able to run it".</p>
<p>I have posted in other win10 forums as well as creating new ones for either asking questions or helping others.</p>
<p>One problem I see is that issues are limited to only one topic error and repeated many times, so here this post was set for specific hardware, but not just mine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a forum user clicks the users icon, it should display all of their post &nbsp; as well as followed ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have been &nbsp;a pc microsoft user from win3.0 and on up and beta tester from win8.0 and win10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Gigabyte did update drivers for windows up to 8.1 with only lan and audio drivers updated to win10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This pc win10 pro , 32 gig of ram, 7 sata hard drives, fx 9370 liquid cooled underclocked to 4.0 ghz,gigabyte &nbsp;ga-990fxa-ud5, gtx960 4gig rrd5, creative sb 24 bit. ,internal dvdrw, external usb blu ray burner.</p>
<p>The &nbsp;ga-990fxa-ud 5 is about three years old and can run a 9590 so I do not think the hardware is not capable of running win10,just that driver support is limited and no one has any answers, including AMD</p>
<p>because the chipset drivers &nbsp;for win10 do not work properly or at all.</p>
<p>In dealing with Gigabyte customer service and technical support the are one of the better ones.</p>
<p>The information I was asking for it was not needed to post my pc specs and even if it was to get a recommendation on a build, I would post it as such.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other pc runs vista 64 on gigabyte ga-m68mt-s2p, so know I am not a gigabyte hater.</p>
<p>Even if all the things you posted where true and they are not, what difference would it make &nbsp; ?</p>
<p>No personal information was asked and if I am correct it is up the the forum user to respond no one is
</p>
<p>forcing anything from anyone.</p>
<p>Have a niceday.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the forum is loaded with hardware and driver issues on devices the get windows 10 states there are no issues found.</p>
<p>Then through the process of upgrading or installing win 10 sometimes even fully completed.</p>
<p>The computer will not boot or is forever in a reboot state, that is an issue that has not been fixed</p>
<p>on the best of the best.</p>
<p>My issue as posted through the forum and other websites has been related to this topic.</p>
<p>What I had hope to get &nbsp;is listed in the topic because microsoft has not published a works with
</p>
<p>windows 10 devices or programs that was very helpful in the win8 &nbsp;program.</p>
<p>If it runs on win7 or 8 it should be ok on win10, but far too many people report that that is not the case.</p>
<p>With my issue of sata motherboard drivers on (A ) gigabyte motherboard causing hard drive issues, that is still unresolved.</p>
<p>As far as my real time experience from the basic &nbsp;microsoft sata driver to the amd driver having the same issue of boot drive instability.</p>
<p>Well then every pc that has the same motherboard as this system does should be seeing the same issue &nbsp;? and the driver will or will not work ? so what driver does work ?</p>
<p>Microsoft is not the hardware maker but AMD and gigabyte are, so if the driver from the OeM should work in win8 why does it not work on win10.</p>
<p>Because with forced updates and new &nbsp;insider builds broke many drivers that the rtm did not fix.</p>
<p>Hardware issues are, bad hardware or bad software ( drivers ) and in this case a new drive replacing the old one, now the drive has the same issue only a week old two days and 19 hours of on time.</p>
<p>Well I said one month to get the os patched to a working state and did not happen.</p>
<p>By BY win10</p>

            <p>I believe it is: "Bye Bye win10".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which by the way I think is the prudent thing to do if you can't get your configuration to work.</p>
<p>And I do agree that it is a mistake for Microsoft to basically force drivers updates.</p>
<p>I also think there are areas where Microsoft "marketing" gives the wrong impression.</p>
<p>As in they should never state that just because Get Windows 10 doesn't detect some incompatibility, that everything will go perfect.</p>
<p>Also they should warn people to back up their existing systems before updating to Windows 10 because there is no way you should rely on the ability to rollback to your old operating system.&nbsp; In a lot of cases the people doing these updates, are people that
 are complete novices, and Microsoft should have approach it that way, and give them the proper information before hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it would certainly have been nice if every driver/hardware that worked in Windows 7/8/8.1 worked in Windows 10, but in the real world Microsoft is going to make changes, that are going to break some of these.</p>
<p>It might look it is intentional or just sloppy programming, but in fact it might very well be a change for increased performance, or for security or such.&nbsp; And it can be that the manufacture when writing there original driver didn't completely adhere to
 the proper API, but it worked anyways.&nbsp; And when Microsoft changed something, it affected their driver for that reason.&nbsp; Since I don't have access to the code or the developer to understand why something was changed, I will certainly not be making general
 statements like everything that worked in prior version of Windows has to work or that if the hardware has the possibility to work, it should.</p>

<p>A few steps that may work.</p>
<p>Go to device manager and expand the network adapter.</p>
<p>Go to power management settings tab and turn options to off.</p>
<p>Go to the driver settings and uncheck &nbsp;wake wlan and low power states.</p>
<p>Check that the connection speed is the higher set, win10 likes to use the lower speed for some reason.</p>
<p>If you are using a microsoft account on win10 to login to the pc, there is a delay in network connections on both lan and wifi; more so on wifi.</p>
<p>Also go to menu, settings, network and internet; check if vpn is enabled or metered connections are active.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Last I would check the lan cable is &nbsp;ok, equal or higher than the lan device &nbsp;and see if it is connecting at the right speed or if the&nbsp;modem, router supports that speed ( a gigabyte lan device can only run at that speed if the cable and &nbsp;modem, router &nbsp;support
 it.</p>

<p>The home network(Belden Cat6)&nbsp;is fine and has been tested there are no issues, especially the run to&nbsp;this PC is on.&nbsp; Only this PC was switched to Windows 10 as sort of a canary.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notification area is part of the taskbar that provides a temporary source for notifications and status. By default, the only icons that will be visible in this area are some system icons. However, you can select which icons appear on the taskbar. Here's
 how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click the arrow next to the notification area, and then click <strong>Customize</strong>.</li><li>From there, select an option for each icon:
<ul>
<li><strong>Show icon and notifications</strong>
<ul>
<li>This option would always show the icon on your taskbar.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Only show notifications</strong>
<ul>
<li>This would hide the icon, except when it needs to show a notification.</li></ul>
</li><li><strong>Hide icons and notifications</strong>
<ul>
<li>This option would hide the icon and would not show any notifications.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>

<h2>            Major issues with streaming Windows Media Player 12</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have at least 2 major issues with my WMP 12.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>One I cannot stream media on my computer at all. The "Streaming" button/menu that should be&nbsp;visible&nbsp;so that I can share and set up streaming options for media files is just plain GONE!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Two the auto check for updates option is no longer able to be selected. It is a light grey text color of things that are options but not selectable. Its there and should work but not able to be selected at all.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now I have been running and using my laptop for over a year now and I have alot on this 160gb hd and do not want the hassle of having to go blow $100+ for an external hd to save my vital files and to reinstal windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I have gone into the admin settings and disabled a lot of remote access and such type things. Now if I disabled something vital to WMP 12 and media streaming I have no clue. I need some major help here as this has been driving
 me crazy for damn near 6 - 7 months now.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the steps mentioned below and check if it fixes the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></span><span><span><br />
a. Click the Start button, click All Programs, and then click Windows Media Player.<br />
If the Player is currently open and you’re in Now Playing mode, click the Switch to Library button in the upper-right corner of the Player.<br />
b. In the Player Library, click Organize, and then click Options. <br />
c. Click the Network tab.<br />
d. In Streaming proxy settings, click the protocol you want to configure, and then click Configure.<br />
e. Select the option Auto detect proxy settings.<br />
f. Click on OK.<br />
g. Then click on Apply and Ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></span><span><span>:</span></span><span><span>Register
 the wmnetmgr.dll file in elevated command prompt.<br />
a. Click on Start &gt; Type in <strong>cmd</strong> in the search box<br />
b. Right click on&nbsp; cmd that appears on the start menu under programs and hit&nbsp;&nbsp; “Run as administrator”<br />
c. Now run the command <strong>regsvr32 wmnetmgr.dll</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong></span><span><span>:
 Delete the Wmsdkns.xml file</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Location of the file:<br />
C:\Users&gt;your username&gt;AppData&gt;Local&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows Media&gt;12.0 folder</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After you delete it, Windows Media Player will re-create the Wmsdkns.xml file. You may restart the computer once
 and check to see if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link for help:<br />

<h2>            Frostwire 4.21.1 not compatible&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The problem is that I am trying to open the Frostwire 4.21.1 and the only thing that happens when I click on it is a message asking if I want to allow an unknown publisher to make changes. When I then click yes.. nothing happens.</p>
<p>So I troubleshooted and looked at its properties etc. It told me that it was not compatible and when I tried to use it on a different windows program.. none seem to be working.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would like to run DISM RestoreHealth to correct some errors found but could not be fixed by sfc/scannow. Unfortunately I keep getting "cannot find source files". I downloaded and generated an ISO per this link

HERE </a></p>
<p>&nbsp; and used the command:-</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:WIM:<strong>X</strong>:\Sources\Install.wim:1 /LimitAccess (X is replaced with the drive letter), but still get "cannot find source files". I checked the contents of the ISO and found that there is no Install.wim:1
 file, there is an Install.esd!</p>
<p>Can anyone give me clear instructions on how to get DISM working</p>

</p><p>Thanks for the response but the thread you suggested contains the same information as the one I included in the OP, by the same author also. As mentioned following those instructions does NOT produce an Install.wim:1 file which is why I get the "cannot find

<p>
</p><p>OK I set up a new user with admin privs and again tried to run the DISM............../RestoreHealth, same result as in the OP, ("cannot find source files") I did not bother trying to specify the source!</p>
<p>It is probably a good idea at this point to get back to the basics of why I want to run DISM............../RestoreHealth:-</p>
<p>I keep getting notifications that I should check whether all the programs that are run at startup are required and look in the Task Manger/Start-Up for details,&nbsp; or words to that effect. The Task Manager Start-Up tab is empty which is clearly in error as
 several programs that I know of do run at startup! When I googled the problem I found it appears to be quite a common one but with no clear, as far as I could see, fix, however it was suggested that running sfc/scannow plus using DISM to correct any issues
 which could not be fixed should resolve the problem. Thats how I got to the point where I raised the OP, please note despite the "unncorrectable issues and the error in Task Manager the systemm appears to be running well.</p>
<p>If I access the Task Manager from the new account I do see programs in the Start-Up tab but how do I get them to display in the original account and how to clean up the errors identified by sfc/scannow. Given that this system was an upgrade from Win 7 I
 suspect a clean install would be a good idea but given the ammount of work involved I would prefer to explore any other solutions first.</p>
<p>All help will be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply but unfortunately it came too late! I had already begun a clean install, which I judge to have been the simpler solution albeit involving much work to return the system back to full operation! Whatever, the clean install has resolved
 the original problem with the Startup tab and sfc/scannow runs without detecting any unrepairable errors.</p>
<p>My guess is that the upgrade install possibly inherited and added to existing problems with a long running (aging) Win 7 install.</p>
<p>Thanks again anyway</p>

    <title>Task bar and Icons move to random monitors after power cycle to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaaaystone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task bar and Icons move to random monitors after power cycle to multi-monitor setup</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to keep Windows 10 from changing locations of start menu and Icons if power is cut to a monitor?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have 6 monitors (3 E2715H and 3&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">E2414H</span>&nbsp;) on my computer, two rows of 3, &nbsp;which are hooked up through two separate video cards (Nvida 960 and 720). &nbsp;My computer is in my bedroom and I like to
 turn off the power to all the monitors when I go to bed. The lights on the the monitors are bright even when the monitors are turned off and the computer is asleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the monitors plugged into their own power strip so that I can just turn off the power strip. &nbsp; Whenever I turn the monitors back on all at once the icons get rearranged to a new monitor depending on which monitor randomly starts first and my start
 menu is always moved back to the primary monitor. &nbsp;Its very annoying. I have to move everything around every time I turn the computer on. &nbsp;I like to have my Start menu on the bottom left monitor vertical and pulled out about 3 inches so I can see the names
 of all the files I have open. &nbsp;I like to have all the icons on the top right monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the result of windows auto detecting monitors and trying to compensate if one is unplugged. I realize why things function this way but there should be a setting to turn this off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not been able to find a way to deal with this.</p>

<br />
As stated in the title the game is Starcraft Brood War digital version by Blizzard. The game works fine in single player mode but the problem starts when I try to connect to the game server for mulitplayer mode. Its been patched with the most recent update
 and all setting for compatiblity are set according to the game developers requirements. Also ports are set to be allowed through for my firewall (windows firewall, pre-installed) and current anti-virus is Norton 2010 (shutdown to play but still get error)
 spyware program is Ad-aware free edition that is also shutdown to play but error still happens. Anyways, once that Battlenet option is selected it will jump to the sign in screen then i get this error.<br />
<br />
Brood War: Windows - Application Error.<br />
The instruction at 0x760b5960 referenced memory at 0x6667677f.<br />
The memory could not be read.<br />
<br />
At which point the only option it allows is to close the program. All drivers have been updated for all hardware so im really at a loss on what the issue is here. Searched Developers FAQs and Support pages and Support forums to no avail. Tried un-installing
 an re-installing and patching countless times.&nbsp;Flushed my DNS and cleared temp files and even went into safemode with networking and ran it but still the same error happens. Did diskclean-up and ran memory test (passed all) defragged.<br />
<br />
As for my Graphics card its a NVIDIA Geforce 6150 SE nForce 430, drivers up to date. Also have NVIDIA nforce 10/100 mbps Ethernet card that has been updated to most recent drivers.<br />
<br />
Any ideals on what the problem is? If anyone can figure this out ill build an Alter in your&nbsp;honor and offer chickens to the computer gods daily :D

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well I would suggest that you update Windows to SP2 and all other current updates.&nbsp; Since all these errors are referencing memory you may want to take out half of your memory and test the game and then switch out the memory and test.&nbsp;

&nbsp;<br />
You may try search for some third party software’s, which may remove duplicate photos from your photo library.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party
 Software is at your own risk. <br />

            <p>Hi Ash,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>I understand the inconvenience caused to you and I will definitely help you.</p>
<p>From the issue description, it appears that you are having problems uninstalling Kaspersky software.</p>
<p>Please answer the following questions so that I could assist you further:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer or the software?</li><li>Do you have a parallel operating system installed?</li><li>Are you receiving any other error messages?</li></ol>
<p>Try the following steps and get back to me with the results:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Update<br />
</strong>The most common cause for these kind of errors is missing or corrupt files. Update your Kaspersky using the website given in the manual or from
<a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/product-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Disk<br />
</strong>Reinsert the disk into the drive and attempt a repair. Before installation, you will see three options namely, Install, repair and remove. Use the repair option first to repair the corrupt files and attempt uninstall. If that does not work, try the
 'Remove' option from the three.</li><li><strong>Support<br />
</strong>Kaspersky support personnel will be able to answer this question better than me. Use
<a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/tech_support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this</a> link to get to the Kaspersky support page.</li></ol>

            <p>Crimson Skies is a great game and was made for the original Xbox. &nbsp;You say it appears on your hard drive but is it an external drive? &nbsp;USB? &nbsp;4gb internal? &nbsp;Where did you purchase the drive?</p>
<p>Only an official Xbox hard drive can be used on Xbox Original games. &nbsp;Anything else or if it's a 3rd party drive (usually purchased from an online retailer such as ebay, etc) will not allow the game to play.</p>

<p>As an added precaution on that, if you opt to cancel the auto-renew be sure to do so *before* you see the charge on your bank account as otherwise it may be too late to request a refund. (For myself it wasn't charged until 30 days after the 'billing date')
 Also be sure to have all of your account information when you call.</p>
<p>Hope everything works out!</p>

                    Been using Hotmail since 1985.&nbsp; Have new HP laptop since 2016, still using Hotmail, now with Win10.&nbsp; Emails always have kept draft automatically, no need by me to tell it.&nbsp; I deleted some old drafts and now all drafts are gone and no drafts are saved--folder
 tells me it has none.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I recover my lost drafts and save all new ones automatically?&nbsp; I do not get a message do I want to save draft and never have gotten that in the past.

<p>OK. Not&nbsp;<em>quite</em> sure what you mean by "<span>How do I recover my lost drafts and save all new ones automatically? " - that implies to me that you are deliberately storing message in your Drafts folder.</span></p>
<p><span>Perhaps you need to clarify exactly how you've been using the Drafts folder in the past?</span></p>

            In past without my telling it to do so, Hotmail simply saved drafts of my outgoing emails, even the emails I sent right after writing them.&nbsp; That gave me a rather full drafts folder, so I deleted a lot of them, but it chose to wipe out every draft and
 will no longer save them&nbsp;routinely. &nbsp;Now I can save a draft only by choosing drafts then save and have no automatic draft saving for any emails, even ones I want to hold as drafts while working on them, and the saved draft disappears as soon as I click send.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Never having used Hotmail particularly in a Browser, then I suspect that there was some setting to enable that. That's certainly NOT normal behaviour. The point of a Drafts Folder is just that - it's&nbsp;
<em>temporary</em> storage for a mail that you've started but are not ready to send.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I don't understand why you would want to save an email to Drafts&nbsp;<em>automatically</em> - that's not what the Drafts folder is for. And yes, that's normal behaviour for the draft to vanish when the email
 is sent - the email can be found in your Sent Items folder.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The only thing that I can think of, is that somehow, in the past, you have managed to set the Drafts Folder to be the location for sent emails.</p>

            Thanks for your comments.&nbsp; I know what the drafts folder is and how it works. I&nbsp;did not do what you seem to think.&nbsp;It was what MS did.&nbsp; All I did was buy a new computer a year ago, and that's the way it worked.&nbsp; Whether I want to save drafts automatically
 is not the question.&nbsp;
