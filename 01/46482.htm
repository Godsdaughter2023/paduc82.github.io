<h2>            Windows 8.1 Mouse Lag while playing games and watching online videos.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 8.1 Mouse Lag</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I see that there are many posts. None of them have helped me. This issue is at it's worst during games, but it still happens when I'm doing toddler activities like watching youtube videos or something simple, yet somewhat taxing on the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My specs are (Built computer) 8.1 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>i5-4430</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>GTX 760</p>
<p>Running the OS on a 120GB SSD</p>
<p>Have other files, as well as Ubuntu 14.04 on my 3TB HDD</p>
<p>I have 2 monitors, if that means anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2908279/en-us and yes I did the 64-bit. Even tried the 32-bit for the heck of it. Neither worked. They said (On Windows Update Standalone Installer) "The update is not applicable to your computer"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I checked. It seems I could already have the update. I don't, the 2903939 update is not on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, I thought I might have the update in another form. Maybe a newer one that I can't match to 2903939?</p>
<p>Nope. Because primary patched games (cod4 for example) still have dead mouse input lag, where clicks and movement don't register.
</p>
<p>The browser still does as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even tried this http://www.blurbusters.com/systemwide-fix-win81-mouse-fluidity/ and got nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've noticed is that the frequency and severity of the lag gets worse everyday.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's not the mouse, because I've tried a few around the house, and even bought a new one that I'm using right now. They all work fine. It's the 8.1 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there isn't anything else I can do, or an update that will actually do something that is coming in a day or two, I'm probably going to find my way back to 8. I really shouldn't have to do this. Using my free-time outside of work for hours on end, buying
 a new mouse, etc. etc. for what? So I can spend more time and downgrade my OS so it actually works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS really needs to just patch the dumb patch they added in 8.1 that "saves power". Yeah, a few minutes of battery and a few cents a year on electricity. Definitely not worth a $1000+ computer....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I sound like I've torn my hair out. I've had a few too many setbacks lately.

            <p>Thanks. I actually found the solution. (A weird issue)</p>
<p>After downgrading back to Windows 8, I realized I was still getting lag. The reason was because of my mouse. After reading this http://logitech-en-amr.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/31549/section/troubleshoot/crid/398/lt_product_id/6811/tabs/1,3,2,4,5/cl/us,en
 I thought it might be possible that my keyboard and 2 monitors were interfering with the mouse. But that didn't make sense. It was then that I realized that the wireless USB receiver, in the back of my case, might be getting some interference from the mobo,
 GTX 760, i5, PSU, etc. that were all within inches of it. <br />
<br />
I moved the USB receiver to the front USB slot on the case. Ever since then, everything has worked fine. I upgraded back to windows 8.1, and it still works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This explains why it was lagging more during intensive gaming, and not just then (the 8.1 issue), but also during browsing and stuff like that. Especially while watching videos and coding. When the computer was running harder, the Electromagnetic interference
 was probably higher, therefore inhibiting my USB device from making a connection with the mouse. That's why ALL mouse input would go out for a few seconds over and over, and just the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has this problem... This is a viable solution. Once everything else (drivers, updates, reg key edits, down/upgrading, changing mice, etc.) has failed.</p>

<h2>            Frequent unexpected shutdowns</h2>
                    I just bought a brand new toshiba with windows 7 online.&nbsp; everything seems to work fine except it keeps experiencing unexpected shutdowns.&nbsp; i would like to avoid doing a system restore since A) this has been happening since i first used it and i assume
 the problem existed before it got to me, and B) i dont want to have to redownload Office and an SPSS program i use for one of my classes.&nbsp; is there any easy suggestions that dont involve having to send it back to where i bought it from or sending it anywhere?

<p>Hi Gretavan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more information regarding your concern with the installation of Windows 10 on your computer. Which installation method are you using? What's the make and model of your computer? What are its specifications? Just for clarity, are you unable to press
 any buttons when the installation reaches that part? Are the buttons grayed out?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

            Thanks Andre for all the help but, it looks like I have hit a brick wall. I have tried using virtual box&nbsp;several times&nbsp; and all was going well until I got to where you are to hit the button called start. Every time I got an immediate&nbsp;BOD scree saying computer
 had run into a problem and it would restart as soon as some info was gotten. Doing a direct install meets with the same results- no install. All seems well and I see boot install, as well as grub install but when I restart and remove disk there is no choice
 of OS just a direct boot into Windows 10. I really want to install Cinnamon but unless there can get by one of these issues it just won't happen.

    <title>installation problems &#43; occult watcher - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            installation problems &#43; occult watcher</h2>
                    I have been trying to download and install software titled 'OccultWatcher' from a trusted software engineer, Hristo Pavlov. My system comprises an ASUS laptop running Windows 8. The Windows installation module will not permit this installation to proceed
 citing security concerns. How can I over ride this? I have run Occult Watcher successfully on other computers for many years previously and I trust the software designer completely.
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanking you in anticipation</div>

            You should be given an option to over-ride against windows advice. Even though you have been running this software previously I would still think twice before over-ridding Windows.&nbsp; Hope this helps and if you need further assistance post and we will be

            <p>There are some factor to consider why you're experiencing this kind of issue. Let's
<span><span>make sure that your computer doesn't have any corrupted system files by running
</span></span>System File Checker:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong>.</p>
<p>- Type cmd and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>- Type <span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The <span>sfc /scannow</span> command will scan all protected system files, and replace corrupted files.</p>
<p><span>Note</span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished. Reboot your computer after the process is finished.</p>

            I came up with a workaround, by resetting the taskbar color to a light hue so the black text can be read against &nbsp;it. I'd rather not go through life with an orange taskbar, however, and don't think I should have to.

    <title>Do files deleted on an external drive ever get copied to the root - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jollyfred57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Do files deleted on an external drive ever get copied to the root drive via the recycle bin&#63;</h2>
                    I've read several threads (and now understand) about how files are deleted from various drives in Windows - but want to know the following:&nbsp;if a deleted file from an external drive shows up&nbsp;in the root drive recycle bin (which it does for me), does this
 mean that the deleted file has been transfered to the root drive in the same way as copying or saving it to the root drive?<br />
<br />
Also, some of the threads mention that you can see 'recycle bins' on all drives if you unhide them in Windows Explorer - my folders are set to unhide and yet I can't see a recycle bin/drive/file anywhere but the root drive.<br />
<br />
I'm using Vista 32bit Home Premium.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, freddy.

<p><span>Hello Jollyfred57,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using the Microsoft Vista Answers Forum!</span></p>
<span><span>
<p>It <span>appears</span> that when you delete a file that you have moved the file to the Recycle Bin, but the file has
<span>not </span>moved. What actually moves to the recycle bin is the pointer (shortcut) to the actual file so the file
<span>appears</span> to have been deleted. The deleted file remains on that particular HDD in a hidden folder called RECYCLER. The space on the drive where the data was stored is tagged "ready for use" and when you store some other data on this drive
 then the old data is "deleted" by having the new data over write the space where the old data was. The Recycle bin serves as a buffer for the delete command and holds that command in the Recycle bin until confirmed.</p>
</span></span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>Thus, when you delete a file on a drive or external HD and send that "deleted" file to the Recycle
 bin; the file has <span>not</span> been deleted and the space that the file used has
<span>not</span> been freed. To actually free up that space on that drive you must go to the Recycle bin (or open the RECYCLER folder on that particular hard disk, which has a folder with a really long numerical name and open this folder) and delete
 the file once more.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>True, other drives have a folder called RECYCLER which is connected to the main Recycle bin. The RECYCLER
 folder is a hidden folder and Explorer must be set to "show hidden folders" in order for you to see this file on each drive.<br />
Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></span></p>

            Hi there David, thanks for the reply - have read this before and sort of get it (I think) - but I don't see the RECYCLER folder for any of my external storage (hard drive, speedstick), even though Explorer is set to 'show hidden folders' - any idea why
 this is? Thanks, freddy.

            <p>An LAN is a Local Area Network and is not connected to the Live service. &nbsp;Therefore, if you've hooked things up correctly no one should require a Gold membership to play.</p>
<p>However, if you are connecting and playing a game locally through the Live service then all person's participating should need a Gold membership.</p>

<p>Thanks for the &nbsp;quick reply. So you are saying that if i do a wifi party, everyone will have to use live? &nbsp;Is there any serious lag on wifi lan parties? If so, i dont want to do wireless &nbsp;then. &nbsp;My router is on the second floor of my house. How can i move
 it to my basement?</p>

<p>Found the answer to the router question. I'll just run an ethernet cable to another router(?) and connect xboxs to that. Does anyone know if there is a lot lag for wifi lan parties?</p>

<p>Now in the arcade store to download. Although it is the same as the game they brought out a couple of years back. But If you didn't play it back then it's worth 800 points.</p>

<p>Whoa! This game is out already and it's basically the Sega Rally game that came out a few years ago?! I knew the game was coming but nothing I read said it was a reissue. That's disappointing as I was a massive fan of Sega Rally and was hoping Online Arcade
 was going to be a sequel of sorts. I guess the good news is I could buy it (again) and get some races online.</p>

<p>I just did a little research and this is not a port of the most recent Sega Rally game. It's a mix of the most recent titles but basically runs on the arcade engine (not SR2008's). That's another disappointment. I'll download the trial tonight and see how
 I get on with it. Fingers crossed it's good.</p>

Also the same question to transfer your dlc it was announced you could with no timeline then later added you could only do it until a certain date.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Great customer service as usual takes over 2 weeks for a reply to a question&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>

            I get the same message for my Lexmark printer and cannot print. Also, my wireless keyboard does not work and there are no drivers for it. Thanks Microsoft for completely jacking up my computer.

            <p>Hi Lynnette</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since got rid of this error with an updated driver from Lexmark. Which printer are you using?</p>
<p>Also I believe the error is coming from the software suite and not printer driver itself.</p>
<p>I found as an example when I was getting the error message I could still print a PDF file I had from the print command at the top, also the scanner worked with Windows scanner program.</p>
<p>Once I uninstalled it off 2 machines and re-installed using the new one the error went away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver I used was for Windows 8. I don't think Lexmark has any Windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Suite changed from Productivity Suite to Quick Pic or something like that. But it has basically the same limited functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had other issues with printer sharing on a wireless laptop but after a lot of un &amp; &nbsp;re-installs I can now print from my wireless to my Desk top Win 10 Pro that has the printer connected by USB I got that sorted out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wireless keyboard was fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So go to Lexmark input your printer model and look for the Windows 8 or later driver. It has the whole program not just the driver..</p>
<p>I'd say try the same thing for your keyboard. Try &nbsp;to borrow a usb keyboard from someone to do the typing to get them though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck and let me know how you make out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't feel bad, At least you can buy a cheap printer and keyboard. Windows 10 Pro wiped my 1TB USB backup/ pic&amp; videos drive to put a 15 meg recovery. I still got to figure out how to get that drive back. I know the data's gone but what a waste. Uggh!</p>

            <p>I have the same problem with my Lexmark printer 5600-6600. I tried to download .net framework 2.0 and it said 3.5 was installed. I reinstalled my printer CD and my printer is working but the window pops up saying "required system software not installed Microsoft
 . NET framework version 2.0 required".&nbsp; Now the trick is how to get it back in my computer since the downloads won't work. This window pops up every time I turn on my computer and is annoying.

            <p>HI PamRybiki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the 3600-4600 series. The issue you are having is the same as I had when installing from the original installation CD.</p>
<p>I had to remove / uninstall this the program and go to Lexmark site and find drivers for this printer.
</p>
<p>I used the Windows 8 driver version. Seems Windows 7 version won't work on Win 10.</p>
<p>This will be the whole program not just the drivers.</p>
<p>There is a possibility it will actually be a different program as with mine but it has the same functions.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Changed from Productivity Suite to Quick Pic.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Also before downloading from Lexmark be sure to see what version of Windows 10 you have. (32 bit or 64 bit) and download that version and install.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">In the search box type X56 and a list will show. Pick your exact model and Windows 8 (32 or 64 bit).</span></p>

            <p>thanks, I had the popup regarding net framework 2 ever since I upgraded win 8 to win 10. But since the printer worked (with the occasional bug whereby I had to switch the printer off and then back on again) I did nothing about it. It last worked in feb 2016.
 But today it didn't anything other than 'blanks'. The only thing I can think of was there was a recent windows 10 update. To cut a long story short, I did as the above 2 replies said and got the win 8 drivers from lexmark's website and now the printer works
 fine again. I mean like it did before the upgrade to win 10.</p>

<h2>            My DVD&#47;CD RW drive won&#39;t recognize a blank DVD but it recognizes blank CD&#39;s.</h2>
                    I'm using a Windows XP Media Center 2005 edition computer. I update through Microsoft as much as possible. It is my mother's computer, I have one of my own that i use to burn DVDs and things more regularly, so i don't know when the last time this DVD burner
 was actually used to burn a DVD of any type. I just burned a CD with it today and it worked fine, but whenever i put a blank DVD in it can't give me any information about the disc, the drive never gets ready. I tried burning a CD with WMP (latest version),
 and it just says there's a error burning this disc but when i used Nero Ultra 7.x.x is burned the CD fine, but Nero and Imgburn won't recognize the blank DVD at all. Imgburn says "medium not present" while Nero never gives me any kind of message to begin with.
 We've had this computer since probably Christmas of 2005 and have never had a problem with it in the past. It's a Dell Dimension E310. I've googled the drive model and it's a HL-DT-ST DVD+-RW GWA4164B, and other people have had similar problems and haven't
 seemed to find a fix for it or the fixes suggested don't do anything for my drive. This PC is obviously out of warranty and anyone who has reformatted their PC, or changed drivers or any of other possible solutions has said that none of them worked. People
 have been told to make these steps from Dell only to end up having Dell send them a replacement drive. I'd rather not replace the drive yet if there has been a fix of some sort for it.
<br />
<br />
Another symptom i've noticed that happens is when it's trying to read the disc, and i go to My Computer, it pops up blank, no info on any of my optical or hard drives, then when i click the X to close out of it, windows explorer reports an error has occured
 and must restart, so then windows explorer restarts and the problem isn't fixed. If i take the disc out and go into My Computer, no problem at all. Today i tried the Microsoft Fix It application for the drive, and it took at least 15 minutes to analyze the
 drive after picking that i want it to diagnose disc writing capabilities (i had a blank DVD in the drive at the time). Eventually it asked me to pick what model my drive is and it had the matching model number so i picked it, and it rescanned it and it gave
 me this message "The selected drive is not capable of writing. If you have several CD/DVD drives try using another drive, otherwise you may need to install a CD/DVD writer." This is only obvious but why does it recognize blank CD's and not blank DVDs. I haven't
 tried a DVD with a movie or anything on it yet, but i may try that next. <br />
<br />
Please help me!<br />

            <p>Mine does the same thing on both laptops, even after replacing the DVD drives 3 times in 4 months on both. NO.....I know what I'm talking about and doing. I've been writing software, building computers and everything else imaginable, since Microsoft BOB
 came out, as well as writing software for Microsoft since DOS 3. Something in Windows (I have 7 on one lappy and 10 on another) is causing these burner problems, ever since the last updates came out within the past 4 monhs. I can pull out both hard drives
 and pop in Linux, and everything works great. C'mon MS.....your writers are screwing something up big time. Seems like whenever Microsoft "Improves" things, it actually creates more problems. Guess it's time we all used Linux.</p>

<h2>            deleting windows 10 and disinfection messages</h2>
                    <p>Far as I can make out, Windows 10 has been downloaded to my computer, awaiting installation.&nbsp; But I don't want it any more. I have cancelled my order. But I now want to wipe out the download.&nbsp; What am I looking for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since I got the notification that&nbsp; W10 was ready to go, my security system (Kaspersky) has been giving me an endless series of
<span>messages along the following lines:<br />
<span>messages along the following lines:<br />
Disinfecting file ... (e.g. pmxf.dll, pmnx.dll, pmls64, pmropn.exe, pmxg.dll, pmservice.exe) ... that can be used by criminals to damage your computer or transfer data.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Then I get:</span></p>
<p><span>pmnx.dll (or whatever) deleted: disinfection failed</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I open my Kaspersky centre and get a warning of variable numbers of Active Threats and I click Resolve All and delete suspect files as they come up and restart, but it all then starts
 again. This is interfering with normal use of the screen.</span></p>

            As suggested by Jesinta, the answer to this lay with Kaspersky, who supplied clear&nbsp; instructions on updating their programme so that the removal tool dealt with the files in question - adware, I think - instead of getting stuck in an endless loop.&nbsp; I had
 left my anti-virus to update itself but somewhere along the line it had missed a trick and I needed a re-instal.<br />

            <p>When we installed Windows 10 the Kapersky we had became absolute. Windows said it's not compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was told to wait till Kapersky opens up a new version that includes Windows 10. &nbsp;i guess I have to wait till my other computers security by Kapersky expires - right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for me to remove Windows 10 from my computer without losing my Windows 7 and others???</p>
&nbsp; and can i do this by going through "Add and Remove" programs to do it?????

<h2>            Solitaire Daily Challenge Won&#39;t Load</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset my Windows 10 a couple of days ago. Since this I can run Solitaire and play any game which doesn't try to bring up an advert, the minute I try to play one that wants to run an advert the whole game just shuts down. I've tried turning off the Firewall
 and Windows Defender, I've tried running the app trouble shooter and I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling. I don't have the funds to pay for an ad free version and I like completing the daily challenges. Minesweeper is fine it loads the advert and then
 continues to the game with no issues. Can anyone help?</p>

            Solved this myself, found a related service in task manager and re-started it. Can't remember what it was though (something to do with the xbox communication) perhaps the "Microsoft Support Engineers" could put which services relate and then re-starting
 them can be a fix to try!

<h2>            Can&#39;t login to Windows 8 with account live password&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just bought Lenovo Yoga 13 today from Best Buy and was so disappointed with Windows 8 login problem... Ok, I was using my new laptop fine until i rebooted the laptop. After reboot, i entered my microsoft account live id but wouldn't let me log in. The
 error message says "That password is incorrect. make sure you're using the password for your Microsoft account. You can reset it at account.live.com/password/reset". I've changed my password successfully and tried it but no luck. Tried it several times...
 I've read up on some threads on this forum and found that lot of people are having this problem from few months ago till now&nbsp;but there is no solution... called best buy but they told me they don't have solution to this known issue yet... reading from other
 posts, there are no solution from Microsoft either... </p>
<p>Does anyone know how to resolve this issue? My login screen ONLY shows my name on top, email underneath and a box for password, so don't tell me to go to setting or login to guest or try less than 16 character password (i tried all 10-16 also different combination
 with 1 char off and 2 char off and so on)... The only&nbsp;option i can click is power option to sleep, restart and shut down.
</p>
<p>I have basic computer knowledge so please explain as if talking to a baby. ;) If i can't fix this issue then i'm going to return this laptop....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: All of the sudden my power option had changed to "Update and Shut off". There were 21 updates but after it downloaded, it started to configure it. Up to 15% and it said Failed to configure, trying again and again, then it said reverting back... now
 i'm back to square one... Also, there was a message on the bottom right when it was downloading updates, it said "Windows will restart in 2 days to finish update" what does that mean? is that related to the failed configuration? hmm..</p>
<p>EDIT: BTW I found a way to get into BIOS setup boot menu and system recovery. Does anyone know if these can help fix the login issue?</p>

I have had my Samsung laptop with Windows 8 for a few weeks and have had this same problem twice.  There are also lot's of posts online about this issue and Microsoft is unwilling to help.   


All was fine until Windows 8 installed an automatic update.  After the reboot following the update it says my password is incorrect.  The only fix I have found is to restore the pc back to factory software (in my case by pressing F4 at POST to bring up the Samsung Restore app).  This is not a permanent fix because it went to get an update 3 days after restoring and now I am locked out again. 



I spoke with Samsung and they say it is a known Microsoft update problem.  Called Microsoft and they told me that they may be able to help me but that it would cost $99 for their support.   I told them that was a new product and that this is BS.   I asked for a supervisor and was told they they are not available and can have one call me back, but don't know how long that will take.  I'm about through with Microso

            I have also had this problem. This is the second time in a week I have had it. This is the last Microsoft product I will ever buy. Spending a little more for a Mac will be worth it. Currently restoring my PC as well. Bad idea to upgrade from Windows 7.
 I would never tell anyone to get Windows 8 and I hope Microsoft makes some changes or they will go out of business. I almost hope they do.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,my console arrived today ok, - had ordered it via the official Microsoft online shop.</p>

<p>The controller that came with it doesn't work - I can see where the batteries go it is missing a metal contact for one of the batteries. I had bought a second controller with a play and charge kit which is working fine, so luckily i can still use the console,
 just only one controller...</p>
<p>I have tried alternative batteries in the faulty controller. It won't turn on.</p>
<p>I have tried the play and charge battery in the faulty controller.&nbsp;It won't turn on.</p>
<p>I have connected it to the USB on the left side (when play &amp; charge battery is in).&nbsp;It won't turn on.</p>
<p>Comparing it with my working controller you can see that it is missing a metal part where the batteries go...</p>

<p>Need to send it back and get a replacement presumably - can someone at MS help?</p>
<p>Phoned the MS phone line but waited ages and no one picked up.</p>

<p>That would be the case. They might even offer you a replacement first, and you send it back to them after you receive your replacement. I'm not sure how the replacements for the Xbox One are being handled at this point in time.</p>

<h2>            ibtsiva</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to determine what ibtsiva is and is it safe.&nbsp; I found the article below that explains it and refers to ibtproppage.dll as well stating that if I find this particular application with the extension .dll that I should then delete both.&nbsp; They are
 stating that ibtsiva.exe is being camouflaged as malware.&nbsp; I don't want to delete these until I am absolutely sure that I should.&nbsp; Any advise?</p>

            Hi Cindy,
<br />
<br />Some of these websites out there are meant to scare you into believing you have malware. ibtsiva.exe seems to be a part of Intel's Bluetooth software, and therefore should be safe.
<br />
<br />Here's proof of its practical use: <a href="https://communities.intel.com/thread/88639" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://communities.intel.com/thread/88639</a>
<br />
<br />You can double-check by right clicking the file, then going to Properties. In the new Properties window, you can look at Details (see if there's the Intel name in there) and Digital Signatures and see if it's signed by Intel. In that rate, it should not be malware. If you are however still feeling doubts about the file, have software like Malwarebytes on hand and scan it, along with many other files on your computer:
<br />
<br />Malwarebytes: <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helped, Cindy.

            Thank you very much for your help.&nbsp; I have done other scans on these and no threats are appearing.&nbsp; However, I haven't used Malwarebytes but I will download it and scan the files with that too.&nbsp; Again, thank you for answering my question so promptly.

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />
<br /><a href="https://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://security.symantec.com/nbrt/npe.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />On the page of the above link you can get the program NORTON POWER ERASER,
<br />
<br />The scan with this program is more powerful than Mailware Bytes.
<br />
<br />Below I briefly describe the operation of the program.
<br />
<br />1. On the website, click Norton Power Eraser.
<br />
<br />2. Select save and then open it. The program is abbreviated to downloads as NPE with yellow icon,
<br />
<br />3. Click on NPE. The program opens on your desktop. Click on accept.
<br />
<br />4. Click on scanning for risks and restart the laptop when prompted.
<br />
<br />5. After you have registered again, you do not have to do anything else because the program,
<br />
<br />after some time, it will continue itself with the scan on the desktop.
<br />
<br />How long this takes depends on the speed of the laptop.
<br />
<br />Leave the mouse alone and do not do other things.
<br />
<br />After scanning is finished, the threats can be removed.
<br />
<br />Finally:

<br />Let me know if that helps.

            Hi CIndy, those files are associated with Intel Wireless Bluetooth. There is no need to think they are anything else.
<br />
<br />What has prompted you to think you may be infected, are you getting an error or is some malware software on your system flagging these files?

<p>I did several different scans using various platforms and this particular "threat" appeared in a result of one scan.&nbsp; But, from what I am gathering here, it is not a threat.&nbsp; I was informed through a previous reply that there are some websites that like
 to scare you into thinking that something is a threat.&nbsp; But after reading all of the responses to my question and&nbsp;performing additional scans as recommended, I feel confident that these do not pose any threats.&nbsp; Thank you for&nbsp;responding to my question and
 for your concern.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Cindy, that is very true, if you google any dll or sys file, you will always find lots of websites that report them as threats, the reality is they want you to install their software, which inevitably turns out to be the real threat !!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Missing files could be caused by a corrupted user profile. We suggest checking if you're signed in with a temporary profile, and performing the troubleshooting steps on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12386/windows-10-find-lost-files-after-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. With regard to your concern about slow performance, try to start your computer in
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a>, and check if the issue persists. Safe mode starts Windows using a limited set of files and drivers.<br />
<br />
Feel free to update us on the result.

<h2>            Xbox One X Stuttering Lag</h2>
                    <p>Currently during games of both Call of Duty WW2 and Overwatch, I will get a lag freeze for about a second then get constant stuttering lag until I hard reset my Xbox One X. My character will be fine but all other character and environment models have about .5 FPS. This has never happened before with my Day One Xbox One. Ive tried resetting my router, xbox, games and am unsure what is going on.</p>

            Hi, Rebecca,
<br />unfortunately any drive may became broken unexpectedly. That's why it is strongly recommended to make a backup copies of all documents, photos and so on.
<br />Try your drive in other USB ports and on other computers - may be this is a local problem.
<br />If the documents are of high value you may ask a help from data recovery companies but usually their help is expensive.       
        </p>

            Hi Rebecca.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you try another computer to get your files off?  
<br />
<br />In Disk Management scroll down on the drive map to see if you can find it, then right click to assign a drive letter or it wont' show up.
<br />
<br />Also in Device Manager find the flash stick under disk drives, right click to Uninstall, restart PC to reinstall driver.  Check again.
<br />
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />
