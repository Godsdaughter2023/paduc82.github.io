<p>Most of the time that this happens, it usually fixes itself; given the time you should have your Xbox life profile up within an hour. On other solution i would advice is signing out of you profile then back in(sometimes jump starts the process). If this
 problem continues contact Mister Gwyther at <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/t/153151.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi <strong>Ben</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you’ve encountered can be caused by an incompatible device driver or a faulty hardware. Now, for us to isolate this concern, we suggest that you
<strong>perform a clean boot</strong>. This troubleshooting technique will help us determine to root cause why the computer is crashing. This can also identify any possible conflicts with other programs installed on your computer. Please click this
<p>
</p><p>Once you’re in the clean boot environment, check if the same behavior will be observed and if the same error will arise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em><strong>Note:</strong> After the troubleshooting, refer to this section: “</em></span><em><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span></em><span><em>” on the same</em><span>&nbsp;</span></span><em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>support
 article</span></a></em><span><span>&nbsp;</span><em>to boot the computer in normal setup once the issue has been resolved.</em></span><span>
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, you can also try running the <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> troubleshooter and see if it will help. Type
<strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the <strong>Search </strong>box from the taskbar, select
<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>. Then, click <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>

<p>There was some unknown device it had found and after some tinkering I found out that it was some gaming mouse software and installed the latest version, now the trouble shooter doesn't find anything. I will try the clean boot if the problem happens again
 but I'm not sure how efficient the clean boot will be because I cannot replicate this problem and I don't wanna be sitting in a mode where I cant do anything for hours or days on end waiting for my pc to randomly crash&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did a clean uninstall of my NVIDIA graphics driver and installed the latest version, it was already on the latest version but I did it anyways, hopefully this will work as well.</p>

<p>That's controller drift. That happens when your analog stick starts to wear out and doesn't snap back to the neutral position on its own. It shouldn't happen with a new one, unless your new one is a used controller or is simply defective.</p>

                    <p>The preview pane in File Explorer (Windows 10) doesn't work for Word documents.&nbsp; It works for everything else, as far as I can see, but not for Word.&nbsp; This has I know been a known issue for years and years, back to Windows 7 and so far as I know beyond.&nbsp;
 It is a real problem for me.&nbsp; I'm just asking to see if anyone has found a solution, although knowing how little interest MS take in these persistent issues I don't hold out much hope of a response from that quarter.</p>

<h2>            All Desktop backgrounds black and picture images in Explorer white in Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    Recently the desktop background turned black. If I go to Personalize all the listed themes also show a black background, except for Windows 7. Selecting Windows 7 shows the Win7 image under "Desktop background" at the bottom of the window, but the actual
 desktop background is still black. Selecting any of the other theme options (which are all black in the preview) are also black at the image at the bottom of the window and on the desktop. I have run sfc /scannow and it completes but says there are some errors
 that could not be fixed. &nbsp;I have reviewed the forums and ran the "fixit", as well as all the other suggestions I have found. &nbsp;I also created a new user account (as was suggested) and the new user account has the same problem with a black background. &nbsp;All else
 in windows and the many applications I run operate correctly. &nbsp;What else is there to try?

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, desktop background turned black on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your efforts in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Have you made any recent changes on your system prior to this issue?</span></li><li><span>Are you using third party wallpapers?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of your system?</span></li></ol>
<p>You may face this issue due to virus infection or due to corruption in graphic card drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1. </span></span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Microsoft Safety Scanner.</span></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to perform a full system scan using the Microsoft Safety Scanner to eliminate any issues related to virus/malware.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your offer to help. &nbsp;I usually make minor changes to my computer but can't think of anything I did to start this problem. &nbsp;However, since it happened and since the last email I've done the following:</p>
<p>1) Ran ADW cleaner. &nbsp;I had a problem with a browser and this found camycilop infection. &nbsp;I removed it but it came back. &nbsp;So I booted in safe mode and then ran it again. &nbsp;It has not come back. &nbsp;I occasionally run these, but have done all the below in the
 past 24 hours (after updating each's database) and all have come up clean:<br />
</p>
<p>1) Ran ADW cleaner again</p>
<p>2) Ran Malwarebytes anti-malware</p>
<p>3) Ran SuperAntiSpyware</p>
<p>4) Downloaded, installed and ran Ad Aware</p>
<p>5) Ran CCleaner</p>
<p>6) Microsoft Security Essentials is my virus protection and I did a complete computer scan with this and it found no errors.</p>
<p>7) I also downloaded the Microsoft Safety Scanner as I saw in other posts on this problem and it ran (over 24 hours to complete) but found no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After all this I then ran "sfc /scannow" from administrator dos window and it still says it "found some corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them". &nbsp;I can send the cbs.log file if that would help. &nbsp;It concerns me that sfc does not complete without
 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the update driver steps you suggested and when I let it search automatically it came back saying the existing driver was most current. &nbsp;Also, the current display adapter driver has been the same one for quite some time (not changed in many months or
 more) and has never had any problems before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I await your next suggestion to try. &nbsp;Perhaps help me fix the sfc errors first? &nbsp;If you want me to submit the cbs.log file, please let me know how to post it. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p />

            <p>There have been two Windows Updates in the last 6 months or so that have caused ficticious SFC errors.&nbsp; Neither is of any value except to grease the skids to Windows&nbsp;10, so you can safely uninstall them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Windows Update window. Bottom left click on link to see installed updates.&nbsp; WAIT a long time while the green bar creeps across to the right.&nbsp; Wait until you see a number like 200 or so as the total. Now, type in one of the following and find it.&nbsp;
 If it is there, uninstall.&nbsp; Clear the search box and wait again.&nbsp; Now type the 2nd in the box.&nbsp; If it is there, uninstall it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>KB3022345 SFC<br />
KB3068708 SFC</p>
<p>Restart your computer, and run SFC again.&nbsp; SFC has been known to sometimes require more than one successive run to fix all corruption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are using too many antivirus programs.&nbsp; This too can cause numerous problems.&nbsp; I will offer you my advice on how to manage security on your computer.&nbsp; The worst thing you can do is overdo this.&nbsp; Many people do and get them selves in trouble.&nbsp; Windows
 7 is inherently a very stable and reliable platform that is not easily infected.&nbsp; Using the best of the antivirus programs and ONLY one, is the best strategy with an occasional scan using ADWcleaner.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the suggestions. &nbsp;I uninstalled the two updates you mentioned. &nbsp;I then rebooted and ran sfc, still with errors. &nbsp;I noticed the log file was 400MB, so thinking it just added on, I rebooted, deleted the log file and then ran sfc again. &nbsp;Still
 errors. &nbsp;I did this process about six times, but sfc still has the same message saying it could not repair all the errors. &nbsp;What next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the antivirus I think you misread my email. &nbsp;I said my antivirus program I use is MSE. &nbsp;In online newsletters I've always heard good reports on that one. &nbsp;The other programs I mentioned are not configured as anti-virus programs, but I did a full
 system security scan using all those scanners - to make sure I got the infections checked that another tool might miss. &nbsp;So I am confident that there are no viruses on my system since all scans found no areas on a full system scan of about 5.6M files. &nbsp;And
 MSE was and is the only anti-virus program I have running. &nbsp;I might change some day, but that is not the problem why my wallpaper is black, since I've used MSE for years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, as suggested by Ashish's post I also have downloaded the display driver from HP for my dv6-2043us, and then reinstalled them and rebooted, but that made no difference either. &nbsp;I did this just in case the driver had been corrupted on my system.<br />
</p>
<p>So I am looking for any suggestions to determine why sfc still can't fix the errors and why the desktop background is only black. &nbsp;Thank you for help anyone might have.</p>

            <p>When I have a client computer that presents SFC results of can not fix, my strategy is to re-install Windows.&nbsp; Option 2 below is likely your best alternative, but you will have at least 6 to 12 hours of Windows Updates to do after that.&nbsp; If it has been several
 years or more since your hard drive has been re-built, I would seriously consider that because it would give your system an amazing performance improvement.&nbsp; That would be number 3 below.</p>
<p>
<em><strong>Re-install Windows 7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed.</strong> Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first.
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best alternative strategies to rebuild are the following in preference order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.&nbsp; This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is not a valid strategy on a failing hard drive.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Clean Install tip</strong></em></p>
<div>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong>
</span></em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at that point.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for PLUS R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

            <p>I'm not about to do a complete reinstall and loose all my application programs just because Microsoft issued bad updates that messed up sfc checks. &nbsp;My computer has worked fine and all operating system and applications continue to work fine (except for the
 desktop wallpaper being black). &nbsp;Just because sfc has issues is not a reason to reinstall. &nbsp;Hopefully someone from MS support will offer to look at the log file to see exactly what errors sfc is having and fix those errors rather than a reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also do some trouble-shooting as to why desktop images can't be loaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would never do a factory reinstall and reload all the bloatware and other **** they put on a system for their own revenue add-ons. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking for solutions to the problem. &nbsp;Erasing everything and starting over is not a solution to finding the problem. &nbsp;Especially without even bothering to look at the log file that is supposed to list the errors that sfc can't fix. &nbsp;Worst case I could
 load a system image from a few months ago, but that is only bypassing the problem and would take considerable work to get all up to date again. &nbsp;I'm hoping someone at MS will actually look into why these two issues exist and how to correct them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since&nbsp;Ashish Sondhi gave me some initial things to do (which I did and reported back) hopefully he can give some help as to how to fix the problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check, Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>

</p><p>Also, please provide status on the sfc errors. &nbsp;Can I send you the log file to review and suggest what I should do to fix those?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled a couple MS Update patches per Canadian Tech's above suggestion, but this did not seem to help the sfc problem as he thought it might. &nbsp;MS Update is now asking me to reinstall those updates. &nbsp;Should I do that now or after we get sfc errors
 cleared? &nbsp;I will thank you in advance to you hopefully getting back to me again.</p>

            <p>Thank you Mayank for the suggestions. &nbsp;I did not see your suggestions before I sent my last post. &nbsp;But yes, as soon as I read your suggestions I performed those tests, which I just completed now. &nbsp;Here are the results:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode: &nbsp;In Safe Mode the background was still all black and I could not see any of my desktop icons. &nbsp;I don't know if this is normal. &nbsp;There also was no "Personalize" option available in Safe Mode so I could not apply any other themes or backgrounds.
 &nbsp;But in Safe Mode I did open an Administrator Command Prompt window and ran "sfc /scannow". &nbsp;After completing it again said that some corrupt files could not be corrected. &nbsp;As I was told earlier, it sometimes takes several runs of sfc to get all the errors
 out. &nbsp;I ran it five times in Safe Mode and every time it completed fully but said it could not correct some of the corrupt files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean Boot: &nbsp;I then rebooted normal and then used MSConfig to do a clean boot as instructed, disabling all start-up programs and disabling all services, except for the MS one. &nbsp;Again it was black background and when right clicking on desktop and selecting
 "Personalize" again all background images in the selection window showed as black, except for Windows 7, which showed the normal color. &nbsp;I again clicked on the one Windows 7 theme that showed colors and that image went in the preview screen at the bottom of
 the window and I heard the sound for the new theme. &nbsp;However when closing that window (with the 'x' in the upper right corner) the background was still black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know the next tests to do for the black background and also help me to get any corrupted files that sfc might see corrected. &nbsp;Should I re-install those two windows updates that Canadian Tech had me uninstall? &nbsp;Can I send you the sfc log file
 to review? &nbsp;Thank you for taking up this case.</p>

    <title>Would like to know if the default app for a .scm &#40;script file&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wondermuse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Would like to know if the default app for a .scm &#40;script file&#41; is &#34;Internet Explorer&#34; in Settings&#62;Choose apps by file type</h2>
                    <p>I recently tried to download an 'arrow' script file to my Gimp 2.10 scripts folder, and in the process I was ask how do I want to open this file. If I remember, there weren't a lot of choices, but I do remember choosing "Internet Explorer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now though, I get an error message: Error: 1)Eval: Unbound Variable:&lt;!DocType. I don't know, but I am wondering if my choosing an app to open the file caused this problem, and if the default app for a .scm file is Internet Explorer on the "Choose apps by
 file type" page in Settings. I am wondering because I can't change it. Firstly, I don't know what to change it to, and secondly the only other selection to choose is "Find and app in the Microsoft Store".&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I have noticed on the "Choose apps by file type" page in Settings that some file types have no default app selected and are designated with "Choose an app". Wondering again, if maybe my choice is now the default app because I chose it while in the downloading/extracting
 process. Maybe I double clicked on it as a force of habit or something after extraction when I shouldn't have, I don't remember.<br />

            Hi wondermuse, yes, by default in Windows an scm file does not have a default application
<br />
<br />It is not easy to remove a file association in Windows 10,
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />On the view Ribbon (tab) check the box marked 'File Name Extensions'
<br />
<br />Close File Explorer
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop and choose New - Text File
<br />
<br />Change the file extension on that new file from .txt to .exe
<br />
<br />Confirm the change
<br />
<br />Right click a .scm  file, choose open with - Choose another App 
<br />
<br />Check the box marked 'Always use this app to open .scm  files' - IMPORTANT! 
<br />
<br />Scroll to the bottom and click 'More Apps' 
<br />
<br />Again scroll to the bottom and choose 'Find another app on this PC' 
<br />
<br />Navigate to the dummy file exe on your Desktop and click OK
<br />
<br />The .scm  file will not open 
<br />
<br />Delete the dummy exe file on your Desktop and restart your PC 
<br />
<br />The file association will then be broken!

<p>No luck. It did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this in a Microsoft&nbsp; Community Forum while trying to find a solution online:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Dated: January 5, 2018</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I accidentally associated a Keynote file (Apple's answer to PowerPoint) with PowerPoint. It is a file with the ".key" extension. Now I can't upload my Keynote files on iCloud since iCloud thinks all my Keynote files are PowerPoint files.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>SOLVED:</strong></p>
<p><strong>I didn't solve it; I called in my IT friend who did it.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Somehow he downloaded &amp; installed the NotePad app;</strong></p>
<p><strong>He then was able to associate the .key file with notepad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>He then went in the registry &amp; did something (I didn't see his manipulation) and now the .key files are not associated with anything.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I hope that it makes sense to you.</strong></p>

    <title>Flash Player update and disabling Active X - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bluenose_ted  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flash Player update and disabling Active X</h2>
                    <p>I have started to get on screen messages that I do not have Flash installed or enabled if I try to watch a video online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as the attached screenshot shows, it is enabled:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2b5f7fb-fa05-4537-b4bd-a22a5e4228f9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2b5f7fb-fa05-4537-b4bd-a22a5e4228f9" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Adobe (<a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-issues-windows-10-ie.html#Enable%20Flash%20Player" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/flash-player-issues-windows-10-ie.html#Enable%20Flash%20Player</a>), I then need
 to disable ActiveX Filtering, by visiting the page in IE that has&nbsp;rich media content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What page would that be? The site with the video on that I wish to watch?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go to Tools along the top, I can see Active X Filtering, but nothing for Safety. I have unchecked Active X Filtering, anyway. But if I click on the cog in the top right hand corner, Yes, I can see Safety and ActiveX Filtering (unchecked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what I am doing wrong, but Adobe's instructions are very poor.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In which browser do you face this issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you check if similar issue persists in other browsers as well?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are experiencing issues when watching videos on Internet Explorer, check if you face similar issue in Edge browser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to update the flash player by downloading the latest version from the manufacturer website and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Adobe insisted that I did not have Flash installed - I have Win 10 and Flash is installed on all Win 10 computers by default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, I didn't check other browsers, but I think I have now resolved it in IE10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am never really sure what the term 'rich media' means. YouTube is 'rich media' (videos, sound, etc), but it is nothing compared to the BBC in terms of their 'richness'.</p>

<p>Adobe Flash seems not to be downloading, although it should be on Windows 10 according to what I read.&nbsp;

<p>Where is that Rich Text that is spoken of ?&nbsp; On the web browser?&nbsp; On each website having Flash trouble.?</p>

<p>I forgot to mention an important detail. My problems started after I got a refurb from Microsoft in late 2010, because the Kinect dashboard update red-ringed my Xbox outright. It acted okay for about a month, but took a severe downturn after one of the updates
 happened. It was just a general update according to the release, but actually was a total anti-piracy lockout measure according to some of the gaming news sites. I have been struggling to keep the console going since. I should get achievements for opening
 and closing the disk tray so many times trying to make the discs read. </p>

<h2>            How do install my copy of Windows 10 on an SSD that I will then swap for the internal SSD in my Dell Laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new 500Gb 2.5" SSD and an external USB Hard Drive Case. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to do a fresh install of Windows 10 on this drive externally, then swap it for the existing 125 Gb SSD in my Dell Inspiron 11 laptop.<br />
</p>
<p>I do not have a registration key for Windows 10 as it was preinstalled, and I am concerned that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The laptop may have a custom Dell installation, ie unique drivers and mods</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I will lose my registration</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I will lose all my software installations</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The laptop will not boot the drive after I swap it in</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me step by step instructions and a heads up of any problems I may encounter and should avoid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your requirement in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even you need to do a Clean Install, when you want to move it to SSD (Solid State Drive). For doing this you should require a product key for activating the Windows copy.
<span>Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need a product key for re-activations on
 the same hardware. If you make a meaningful change to your hardware or moving to different hardware, then you may need to contact customer support to help with activation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go here to contact <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=530206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Keep posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>Let me clarify:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone through downloading the iso of Windows 10 installer and started the installation process right up to where it begins to restart, at which point I have quit because it never asks for an installation target and gives every sign that it is going
 to wipe my internal SSD and install there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be wrong but do not want to risk it wiping my internal drive, before I have had a chance to set up my external SSD as the boot drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue, which you have not addressed is installing a bootable version of Windows 10 on the external SSD (in a USB case) which I then propose to boot off to check it works before installing that external SSD internally into my Dell Inspiron 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a trivial exercise for OSX. Is it, or is it not possible with Windows? If so what are the exact steps?</p>

            <p><span>Hi BenjaminLWV,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for the post. I am sorry to hear that you are unable to install recommended updates on the
 computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you with this.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which Microsoft Fix it have you used?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to install updates fine earlier?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you getting any error code or error message? If yes, what is the complete message?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow the methods provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>You may run Windows Update troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a></span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Step1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to temporary disable all antivirus software’s installed on the computer. Refer the following link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>NOTE</span></b><span>: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable
 your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable
 to attacks</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After disabling antivirus, you may try to manually download and install the updates in Clean Boot state. Refer the following article.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Brian,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does the scan reports any errors once it is done?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes it happens that disk check always starts to check the file system on one or more drives for consistency. If any key is pressed, the disk
 checking is aborted. Actually this is because some data structure of the drive or some file is corrupted which can not be recovered and check disk is always run at Windows startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Run check disk from command line</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start; in the start search type cmd.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on cmd.exe and choose to run as administrator.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>In
 the command prompt, type chkdsk /r and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Answer
 Y when chkdsk asks you if you want to check the drive next time Vista boots (restarts).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>/r = The /r switch tells chkdsk
 to attempt to recover any bad sectors of the hard drive if any are found. A bad sector is a spot on the hard drive that cannot hold saved data anymore. If you’ve any data on that sector, you’ll lose that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Use the hard drive diagnostic tool if any from hard drive manufacturer</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Test the hard drive with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive manufacturer’s website. Perform a thorough scan of the drive and then check
 if the issue gets resolved. </span></p>

First of all, please note that Windows 8 comes with&nbsp; two<br />interfaces; the Modern/Metro Interface (which may be all they've<br />looked at) and the traditional Desktop Interface. That traditional<br />Desktop Interface is almost identical to Windows 7's interface; the<br />biggest difference is that there is no Start Orb to click to bring up<br />the Start menu.

            <p>Thank you. You solved my problem. I am getting used to Windows 8, but I still prefer Windows 7 look because on my other laptop I have windows 7. Thus I only have to get used to one rather than two systems.</p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p>I also found some other third party software by searching the Internet, but I will use what you suggested.</p>
<p>Thanks again. You and the Microsoft Community have helped me to learn Windows 7 from Windows XP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Microsoft takes votes, I am positive majority would be with Windows 7; Microsoft should have added what they removed from the Windows XP. They removed the folder password protect function from the Windows XP. I was hoping that they would add it back to
 Windows 8. In Windows XP, I was protecting all files within a folder with one stroke.</p>

    <title>Missing Programs and Apps After System Restore in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> od9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Programs and Apps After System Restore in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I did a system restore and now I have missing apps and programs. I can't find the Camera, Alarms &amp; Clock, Calendar, or even the Calculator on start when I go to "all apps". I also had a Kindle and Netflix app and those are gone as well. Using the search
 doesn't help either. The Microsoft Store is gone and the App Explorer doesn't open. This is my second system restore. The first restore I did wasn't too bad since only a few apps I didn't care about were gone, and I didn't think too much about it. But with
 this one it's seems like a good majority of the apps that came installed on the system are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a new laptop with Windows 10 Pre-installed on it. All of the apps that are now missing were also already pre-installed on the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I just went to the online app store to see if I could re-install a few of those apps, i.e. Netflix and it says "the product is installed." Like I mentioned before, I searched for it but the search isn't giving me any results. So I clicked "open"
 but it won't open because of an "error."</p>

<h2>            How to detect the windows 8 is&#47;isn&#39;t remote network boot via PXE&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    copy and pasted the similar question and answer from:&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/intel-undi-pxe-21-build-083/b82d199f-dfd3-4a39-a05e-3c8427638111?msgId=ccfbf1c9-bea0-4f49-a584-aaffa2b375de">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-system/intel-undi-pxe-21-build-083/b82d199f-dfd3-4a39-a05e-3c8427638111?msgId=ccfbf1c9-bea0-4f49-a584-aaffa2b375de</a>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
<div>My PC with windows 7 got hacked for years, I thought that was done by the remote hacked.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I download windows 8 through Microsoft dream spark site, and finally decided to wipe out all my HDD (using KillDisk tool), did the clean windows 8 installation. I'd learned Windows 8 is more secured and I want to see windows 8 can help me out
 of the remote hacked situation.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; After HDD cleaned and reviewed my bios setting, I set up my MOBO Super user ID password (before I left its field undefined), I installed windows 8 w/o hoop up with network cable, installed OK, windows 8 was up faster then windows 7, I truly
 like the new display and all the apps, task manager tools, etc,,.. &nbsp; I hooked up network cable to initiate internet so I can complete my PC registration process. Then I got internet connection problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Since windows 8 installed well, I clicked window tool to trouble shoot why no network connectivity, but diagnosis message was not to the point at all, so I use&nbsp;<b>EVENT VIEWER</b>&nbsp;to trace problems, I'd found that my PC already had couple
 ERRORs at the beginning, ERROR event ID number such as 7023, 137, 46,...etc. &nbsp;Interesting,&nbsp;<b>One of the error (event ID:46, Volmgr, "crash dump initialization failed.") belong to other owner name, not define by me</b>. So I highly suspect part of
 my PC mobo firmware might have been altered by hacker.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<div>I recalled, when I'd wiped off whole HDD, the "intel UNDI, PXE-2.1 ....." messages shown on the screen, I can't do any thing at that time, except I reset my bios to the manufacture default value ( which mean most of the values are AUTO mode, no
 super user ID password defined). then turn the PWL on and off and on, &nbsp;then windows 8 back after a while.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Why does the network sudden be connected? I rechecked my bios setting and recognized that my bios -S.M.A.R.T LAN setting panel was no longer smart, it only detected "network cable wire existed" &nbsp;but can't detect network ports status any more
 ( no matter that is open port or short port), I can't figure out how to fix it. I exit bios mode, tried it boot up system again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Then I looked at the up running windows 8, the displayed windows or default IE site are altered, not the original Microsoft setting any more, the APP of &nbsp;"administrator tools set" are disappeared. I have not learned how to bring that APP back
 on the screen yet, it shocks me again.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;How to get rid of online stalking, buy another mobo? which one? ( my current one has EFI, I didn't enable it yet, until now, can be too late to do it?) get another laptop? I have two laptops, actually 3 PCs, two of them are old-builded.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Bye the way, if you response my email through my microsoft email box, and hacker can view it. Can you image what happens next? &nbsp;I can't identify who did it one me, but I know this person who can access/control enterprise level equipments and
 systems for sure.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;PLEASE POST ONLINE about the possible procedures I should follow up. or phone number I should call for help.&nbsp;</div>

            I recommend you use System Restore to set Windows back a few days. You won't lose any data but this will most likely fix your problem.<br />

<h2>            Gamertag stuck in limbo, what should I do&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>1) I logged into my xbox live account on the xbox live website<br />
2) I went ahead and updated the email associated with my gamertag with a new email<br />
3) Everything looks good so I logged off<br />
4) A few hours later after gaming a few hours on my xbox, I went to my dashboard and was told I got disconnected from<br />
xbox live and need to log in.<br />
5) I did with my new email and password and it says invalid email and password, so I tried with my old email and password<br />
and still no go.<br />
6) So I went back online to the xbox live website to see what is going on and if all this has to do with me updating<br />
my email associated with my gamertag<br />
7) I logged in with my new email and instead of the usual webpage with my gamertag and all the info in it, it is a brand<br />
new page with a randomly generated gamertag.<br />
8) I thought wtf, so I logged off and tried to log in with my old email, and it said this microsoft account doesn't exist,<br />
enter a different email or create a new account...again wtf. So I tried creating a new account with my old email and
<br />
it said that email is already registered...If its registered then why would it say it doesn't exist!?<br />
9) So it seems like my Gamertag along with my old email is stuck in limbo<br />
10) Next time I probably shoulda just update my email via my xbox console instead of via the xbox live website,<br />
but in the mean time, what do I gotta do to get my Gamertag/account back?</p>

<p>You changed the CONTACT e-mail, not the login e-mail. &nbsp;The LOGIN e-mail can only be changed on the console. &nbsp;That being said it sounds like something broke on your account so you'll need to contact support. &nbsp;Most likely you won't get the account back for
 a while, so be prepared for bad news.</p>

<p>Hey stable,<br />

Really sorry to hear you're having issues with your account.<br />

Giblet is correct, you'll really want to get in touch with your local <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Phone Support</a> for assistance with this. They'll be best equipped to look into your account with you and work on getting things sorted out.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Granting Special Permissions</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I encountered an issue earlier where I wasn't able to delete a file because I didn't have the necessary permissions to do so. I was able to delete the file, but I don't think I've found the long-term solution. How do I grant my&nbsp;account (the administrator
 account) special permissions so I'm not locked out of deleting a folder I want gone?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand if my system undergoes any changes it can cause some conflictions. I'm on a new laptop and just recently activated windows (through purchasing a new product key).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p />

            One way is to create a "public" folder that all user ids have access to.
<br />
<br />Another way is for the Admin ID to "take ownership" of the folder

<br />The link(s) to non MS-page(s) appears to be providing accurate, safe information. I suggest you stick with the “manual” instructions. Unless I explicitly suggest it, avoid downloading their “utilities”.  Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. Sometimes they include 3rd party programs, "unwanted" programs that are automatically installed during a standard install.  So, if offered, do a "custom" install and carefully read each step. One of the steps MAY give you an option to install, or NOT, "additional" programs.  99.9% of the time you don't want to let them be installed.  For example, when you install Adobe Player you are given the option of installing 2 additional "free trial" programs: Potentially Unwanted Programs: MacAfee  Security Scan and MacAfee Safe Connect.  The option to install is turned on, you have to manually turn it off. Those are PUP's.  If you click "OK"/"Next" without paying attention you get the 2 "extra" programs.

<br />As well, watch out for ads on the site. They may advertise products that include PUPs. Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<p>The term "Special Permissions" is deceptive. Lots of people think that they will grant you rights that are not available to other users. Wrong. "Advanced Permissions" would be a better term. They include 14 settings and let you change things that you would
 not normally modify. As far as accessing your folders is concerned, see Rohn007's detailed reply.</p>
