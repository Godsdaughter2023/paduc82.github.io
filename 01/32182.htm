    <title>Replacing Windows 10 Pro &#40;about to expire&#41; with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> idunnonuthin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Replacing Windows 10 Pro &#40;about to expire&#41; with Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>My enquiry relates to the possibility of replacing Windows 10 Pro (64 bit) with Windows 10 Home (64 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop currently running Windows 10 Pro. I bought the laptop (pre-owned) almost 6 months ago. It has recently started displaying a dialogue box stating “Your Windows licence will expire
 soon. You need to activate Windows in Settings”. The Activation page states “Windows activated using your organisation’s activation service”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am therefore assuming that the OS on this laptop is- or has been- activated via an organisations network licence key, and that the laptop no longer has access to that network so cannot renew
 the licence. That being the case, I will- unfortunately- need to purchase a new OS. I see no other way around it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I replace the current Pro version with a Home version (to be purchased via retail) prior to the expiry/sudden death of the current Pro version? If so, how do I do that simply and effectively?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I can not or do not replace the Pro version before it becomes inoperable, can I install Windows 10 Home after the demise of the Pro version? If so, how do I do that simply and effectively?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have probably noted that I am not tech savvy...my understanding of tech jargon and systems is basic in the extreme, so relatively simple advice will be very much appreciated.</p>

    <title>how to regroup items in the start all programs menu&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how to regroup items in the start all programs menu&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just starting out with Win 7 and its usability has really suffered from Xp in my opinion.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Xp you could explore the start button and rearrange and regroup items in the start--&gt; all programs menu after programs were installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that in win7 this ability has gone&nbsp;away along withthe flyout menus that would expand when you moused over a grouping.&nbsp; Now you have to work in this tiny little window, click on a folder to open subfolders, and then within them,&nbsp; more clicking and
 opening and scroll youself crazy to do even the simplest of things.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any way to move stuff in the start menu to regroup them (as in XP) &nbsp;in order to shorten the list of things that appear in this tiny window?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>(MS could have at least allowed this window to be resized since they removed the flyout menu). &nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into program files (x86) and moved a bunch of things in there into the groupings I wanted, but they don't show up inthe start menu that way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Me thinks I may have messd something up doing this no? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you can offer here.&nbsp;&nbsp; Much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community forums and thank you for posting the question. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a system restore before moving items into the Program Files folder so&nbsp;you&nbsp;could&nbsp;start fresh.
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Perform <strong>System Restore</strong> to an earlier point before installing this application.</span></p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>System Restore</strong> can return your system files to a point in time before you noticed a problem, without affecting documents, photos, or other personal files. If System Restore doesn't fix the problem, you can undo the restore operation and
 choose another restore point.</div>

            <p>Hi Winston....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thnaks for your reply, and sorry taking so long to respond to it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did better than system restore...&nbsp;&nbsp; After&nbsp;installing code project classic shell and really hooping things, (nothing worked and system hung to point where had to power off to shut down), I wound up reformatting and reinstalling windows, and re-installing
 everything. </p>
<p>Have been working on tyring to get things going ever since.&nbsp; Have come to the conclusion I don't like win 7 and what it has to offer, but am trying to slug through it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An example of some issues are: </p>
<p>1. IE9 extrememely slow to load after initial boot of system (after cold boot or restart). After first time seems to load speedily as expected.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. cannot download adobe reader (any version 9, 10, or 11) download times out. Have spend hours trying to get answers on this one.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Along line of original question here, In program files x86 BEFORE installing any programs, I created a folder I want to group things in.&nbsp; (e.g. Scanner Related).&nbsp; Installed&nbsp;Scanner related programs to this folder, but in start---&gt; all Programs, this folder
 name (scanner related with subfolders for programs, does not appear, but instead, the programs I installed show up as separate entries making the list long.&nbsp; If I look on the drive under programs (x86), &nbsp;they are in the folder use to group them, just not in
 the all programs window. &nbsp;&nbsp;So much for that Idea.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. even trying to highlight text in this message with mouse in order to&nbsp; move it or delete it, or bold it&nbsp; or whatever....&nbsp; can't be done...Really!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked at&nbsp;at your links and suggestions. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whats new in start menu...&nbsp; No Joy there.&nbsp; Had looked thru there before.</p>
<p>Customize start menu... nothing helpful there either.&nbsp; Had already expored it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where my issue lies, is with the all programs listing that appears fromthe start menu.&nbsp; There is no more grouping in there it seems, no more flyout menus to choose from and I am forced to work in a stupid, dinky little no resizable window and scroll myself
 to death trying to see things in there.&nbsp; What problem was microsoft trying to solve with this move?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its really too bad that most vendors did not jump on win XP64 with driver support or I'll bet that a lot of win7 64 bit users, who only went to&nbsp; 64 bit to be able to utilized more RAM on their system, would have never chosen win 7.&nbsp; I know I would not have
 ... Win 7&nbsp;is a productivity killer, and win 8 looks&nbsp;to be even worse. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really not happy with perfomance I am getting out of this PC that I have just assembled ( I do this regularly with new PC'sfor our&nbsp;business's home office ). The hardware is top notch, too bad the OS is not up to meeting it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So it looks as though I still have no answer to my orignal question about how to group things in the start all programs menu, but I thank you for your suggestions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's is what I am working with - and why things like&nbsp;IE9 &nbsp;taking 30 seconds to load are bugging me big time.

            The start menu and where you install the programs is in no way related. This holds true since Windows 95. You can choose to install the programs wherever you want, but you shouldn't go in there and start manually moving things around or you will have problems.
<div><br />
<div>You could move items around the start menu exactly in the same way you could in Windows XP, by dragging and dropping. You could also right click All Programs and select Open or Open All Users and organize it that way which would probably be easier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;creating&nbsp;separate&nbsp;threads for the other problems to get more focused advice for each. I also recommend including any changes you made to Windows in those threads.</div>
<div><br />
<div>That being said, something to think about would be to remember back after Windows was first&nbsp;installed, did you have any of these problems?</div>
<div>If yes, I would say backup and reinstall again to make sure you are starting with a good install to work from.</div>
<div>If no, what changes were made? Try reverting those changes to see if the cause can be identified.</div>

            <p>Hi David....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; Much appreciated. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions and comments:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;<em>You can choose to install the programs wherever you want, but you shouldn't go in there and start manually moving things around or you will have problems &lt;&lt;</em></p>
<p>Yes I figured that out already as had to restart from Scratch and reinstall windows, Chipset drivers then windows updates, and then some programs.&nbsp; So starting out fresh already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;You could also right click All Programs and select Open or Open All Users and organize it that way which would probably be easier. &lt;&lt;</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm afraid that is where the wheels fall off the wagon.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I right mouse on all programs&nbsp;in the start button window, and select open or open all users, I get the same explorer window so it appears it does not matter which I choose.
</p>
<p>the breadcrumb trail reads as Computer--Win7X64SSD(C)--- programData--Microsoft---Windows Start Menu---Programs but the whole path is collapsed with&nbsp; the Highlight on the C Drive line. (I'll come back to this later).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I expand the path manually and go to the "Users" folder there,&nbsp; then expand it to "All Users" (which shows a lock beside it), and expand all users, there is a shortcut icon beside the Start Menu folder which is where I would expect to be doing my arranging
 /groupings.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>However,&nbsp;clicking on it&nbsp; I get error message popup: C:Users\All Users\Start Menu is not accessible.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same thing if I try it under my user id.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So going back to the highlighted line I mentioned above, &nbsp; and subsequently expanding each highlighted line that shows after expansion, one eventually gets to the start menu folder where you can actually see whats in it and it appears to be the same list
 that shows in the Start--&gt;All Programs menu listing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I presume this is where I can do what I want? Can you confirm this please?</p>
<div><br />
In XP, I get there in 2 mouse clicks-- right mouse on start--Click on Explore--- and I am there..at the start menu.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Why the big difference&nbsp;in the amount of work I need to do in Wn 7, in order &nbsp;to perform such a simple thing in XP?&nbsp; Then even after I manage to do what I want, I am still confined to the dinky little window I need to scroll and keep clicking on items to
 expand under one another, of having the flyout menus as before.&nbsp; What Problem was Microsoft trying to solve here?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Anyways, if you confirm this is where I need to be to do what I want and can do stuff in here
<em>WITHOUT MESSING THINGS UP AGAIN! </em>then I guess you you have directed me to the solution.. but it took a lot of brain cells on my part to get there! ;-)
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>And I still cannot use my mouse to highlite a string of text within this message for some reason.&nbsp; Weird indeed. instead of
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thnaks again for your help. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Cheers!</div>

    <title>Change in format of photos - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sandra mo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change in format of photos</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated to &nbsp;Windows 8.1. from XP and now use Photo Gallery but have to say I, like many others, wish we could go back to the simplicity of XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I edited a number of photographs in Photo Gallery and duly saved the alterations. &nbsp;However when I now go into the folder the format of some of the edited photos has changed - they appear to have been "thinified" - &nbsp;and the only way I can see the photo as
 it should be is by hovering &nbsp;on the "black &amp; white" box in the Edit format and photo goes back to 'normal'. &nbsp; However, having then closed down the folder the 'corrupted' format then re-appears when next opened. &nbsp;It does not happen with all photos. &nbsp;What have
 I done and how can I cure this?</p>

    <title>Class not registered error when trying to open .py files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Class not registered error when trying to open .py files</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Python to my windows 10 computer. I wrote a small bit of beginner code and saved it. It was Example.py and when I tried to run it, it says the path to the file and then, "Class not registered." I have tried changing the default app to
 open it and tried doing the dcomconfig thing, but nothing seems to be working. Any Ideas?</p>

<p>Get the biggest freaking tv you can afford. Like 98' movie theatre size.</p>
<p>It all depends on budget. There is no reason to get a 720p if you can afford to get a 1080p tv. If you can afford to get a 1080p tv then why not? If you get bluray players or other HD devices, they could take advantage of the resolution. Some xbox games
 are 1080p, so the additional resolution won't go to waste with the 360 either.</p>
<p>I would say 37' 1080p tv is good. Some people will say go bigger and others will say to go smaller if it sports a better picture. Go to you local electronic shops and browse their tvs. Sometimes the blacks look gray and things like that. Picture quality
 is also important.</p>

<p>Better of with a 1080p Display, it will be better for the long run. Make sure the TV is a suitable size for you and it runs at 60 HZ. Also go for a good/trusted TV brand such as LG or Samsung and not a cheap one, you get what you pay for.</p>

<p>All you NEED for Xbox 360 is a widescreen HDTV.</p>
<p>After that, it's just whatever you want. &nbsp;Competitive gaming requires a smaller TV, but if you're just in it for the enjoyment then anything goes.</p>

<p><span>[quote user="Blu Renegade"]Interesting. Why does a smaller tv make gaming more competitive?
</span></p>
<span>[/quote]I <strong>guessing</strong> because with a smaller TV, you can see things on either side of the screen faster, than on a bigger one.&nbsp; That's what someone said in another thread a few months ago.</span>

<p>I own a 60" samsung led-LCD tv, 1080p, 120mhz (2010 model) and it is an awesome looking TV but it's too big when I want to play MP games like COD. &nbsp;For me, it just takes too long to process whats going on. &nbsp;I also own a 32" Sony 3D, LED 240mhz, 1080p (2011
 model). Pricey for the size but comes w.all the bells &amp; whistles. &nbsp;I pretty much play all my shooters on the smaller TV &amp; everything else on the 60".</p>

                    <p>I have a 2007 Compaq notebook which is working fine.&nbsp; It is on Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; It has been offered the Windows 10 upgrade, but upon Checking PC, it returns:<br />

<p>
</p><p>As a result, I cannot see an option to reserve Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>If later I am able to install Windows 10 via an ISO disk, how will I get the activation key?</p>

            <p>You won't need an activation key. The 965 error is due to a buggy tool. There are people running the Windows 10 tech preview with the 965 and there is a fully supported driver on Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft most likely will not fix their buggy tool but you will be able to download and install on July 29 or after and upgrade on 7 SP1 without an activation key. You don't want to be first, do you? The tool is buggy and probably the upgrade will be as
 well, so perhaps you should wait until you see what the experience has been for others.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So again, ignore the report on the 965 and be assured that as long as you have a genuine copy of Windows 7 SP1 (non Enterprise) you will be able to get the free upgrade with no activation key required.

<p>Whenever i try to play battlefield after i put the disc in it takes me to a screen saying the game needs updated and when it tries to download the update it brings up a screen that says there was a problem with the update. I tested my connection and everything
 was fine and tried again and it says the same thing. So i held down the bumpers and triggers and it gave me an update error 0x8b050033 0x00000000 0x00000402. I tried a system reset already and it didn't help at all.</p>

<p>Maybe uninstalling then re-installing the game again could work. If that doesn't work then try Battlelog and get help there as its dedicated to Battlefield. Good luck.</p>

<p>This little glitch is Epic's very creative way of saying "F#%@ YOU" to all of the hardcore completionists out there.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>To address your concerns briefly:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>- If you did not back up your player data file to the cloud or an external hard drive (like a USB flash drive) all of your data is lost for good (as the other people have mentioned).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>- This problem usually happens when you "dashboard" or reboot the Xbox when the game freezes, however there are other circumstances where a rank reset can happen as well. &nbsp;The result is that your player data file gets corrupted and you get reset back to
 level 1. &nbsp;I believe that some of your medals also get "locked" as well, preventing you from getting them onyx-ed (but I'll have to double-check that).</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>- Epic knows about it. &nbsp;Microsoft knows about it. &nbsp;Neither of them will do anything to get your data back. &nbsp;This is a fact.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>More information about this problem can be found here:</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_360_games/e_k/gearsofwar3/f/310/t/264900.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../264900.aspx</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And here (even better):</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.epicgames.com/threads/839290-RESET-amp-BACKUP-INFO-I-used-to-be-a-red-92-then-i-took-a-gnasher-to-the-knee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.epicgames.com/.../839290-RESET-amp-BACKUP-INFO-I-used-to-be-a-red-92-then-i-took-a-gnasher-to-the-knee</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Feel free to add to the mountain of complaints, but just remember that nothing you do short of having your data backed up will get your rank back. &nbsp;Your choices now are to either continue playing Gears 3 from "scratch" or move on. &nbsp;If it makes you feel any
 better, you are not alone. &nbsp;By the way, if you are some kind of masochist and decide that option 1 is for you, do yourself a favor and back up your data.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sorry for your loss.</p>

<h2>            Destroyed MBR and lost partitions in windows 7 &#40; &#43; deleted profile files&#41;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>Hi!<br />
I'm facing problems with the way how windows 7 cooperates with hard drives. I'd be very gratefull if someone could analyze the issue and check if it's really a drawback of win 7 and what to do.<br />
<br />
Lost partition:<br />
Month of using Windows 7 RC (september 2009), disk: SATA Hitachi HTS541612J9SA00<br />
I was scanning photos, saved one then scanned another and couldn't save it next to the first one cause this partition no longer existed. 70GB partition has gone somewhere... It just disapeared with no alert, no error, no system sound. Disapeard from My Computer,
 Disk Utility in Control Panel and command line and existed as a free space for new partiton. I've tried using many programs undeleting partitions but no effect. Just recovered some files with recovery program and finally formated the partiton hoping to finish
 the struggle.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Deleted profile files:<br />
Windows 7 Pro, January 2010, on a new<span><strong>&nbsp;disk: SATA Seagate Momentus 7200, 320GB.<br />
When having web browser opened and&nbsp;<span><strong><span><strong>listening to music in winamp, I stopped the track. Whole windows stopped reacting. Nothing seemed to work but force shutdown. After booting,
 I logged on with my credentials and got temporary profile. Then discovered that the whole folder with my profile files just disapeared. As is. I've lost everything from documents and desktop. (had no backup - my bad). I had no idea how to bring it back so
 I've put the disk into usb case and used as an external one. As a system disk used the one with win 7 RC installation from previous-above problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Destroyed MBR:<br />
Using win 7 RC and external usb disk with 4 partitons.<br />
When browsing files on external drive, system stopped responding. Once again nothing else remained but force shutdown and boot again. When did, external drive is not longer visible in My Computer. In disk utility disk is presented as a white field with no partitons
 and if was unformatted at all. I took it out of usb case and put in laptop to use win 7 installation disk and automatically repair - no effect - installer was unable to do that. Command prompt - used bootrec.exe with /mbr than bootsect with different options
 - still nothing. I don't want to lose 200GB of my files so please anyone suggest some solution.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And PLEASE - Microsoft - go through the windows 7 habits concerninig drives cause really strange things take place with this system. What is more, a friend of mine had the same problem as I did with lost partition so it's not just a single-computer issue. Maybe
 you'll make it before more people loses their systems when scanning pictures or listening music.<br />
<br />
Please - some specialist - what to do now to get the MBR back or at least get any kind of access to files?<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
<br />

            Perhaps you and your friend are using the same game or are infected with the same virus/malware that's repeatedly trashed your file system. Microsoft engineers will no doubt take note of your post but the bigger question is whether and when *you* will
 take note of the iron rule of computing: That you must back up all important files at regular intervals. You have had three big hits. Shouldn't this be enough to review your own habits instead of telling the Microsoft engineers to look at theirs?<br />

            Thank you for reply!<br />
<br />
I don't blame microsoft for lack of my backups. I only suggest that the behaviour above may occure because of some undiscovered issue of win 7 and I don't wish others to have same problems. This is why I wrote it.<br />
<br />
Concerning malware/virus - I don't exclude this reason however there is very slight possibility that only us both got the same virus since we don't exchange any files at all. That's why it may shortly concern more people using internet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Apart from that, do you have any clues how to get the disk file system back?

            I recently had a similar issue with a brand-new machine with no software loaded other than what was included with the factory installation. Diskmgmt.msc allowed me to create a 400 GByte partition and to populate it with files and folders. After the subsequent
 reboot Windows claimed that the new partition had an unrecognised file system. I repeated the process several times, with the same result. In the end I resolved the issue by creating an extended rather than a primary partition.<br />
<br />
I reported the issue to Microsoft, using the internal MVP reporting channel. Whether anything will come out of it I do not know.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 cut off my disc drive from my computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 cut off my disc drive from my computer.</h2>
                    <p>When I installed Win 10 (free version) I didn't realize it knocked out my dvd player. I loaded what programs I wanted from discs and everything was cool. I realized sometime later that I had no dvd player. Computer simply was no longer recognizing dvds.
 With the last lengthy (3 days in a row) update, the computer no longer even recognizes there is a disc drive. It comes up in device manager, says it's working fine, says the driver is up to date. File explorer does not show it. Period. Put any kind of disc
 in and it starts, then stops without being recognized. I have tried every fix I've found (and could understand) with negative results. I have spent the last 2 days trying to get techs to help. After getting hung up on by the automated service 3 times, being
 told to call back after a tech remotely started a scan that would take awhile only to be given the run a round and put on hold for over an hour (twice) until my phone died and (most recently) being "accidently" disconnected from a third phone appt with a tech
 after she read the log on my problem (and was not called back), I have decided that Microsoft doesn't really care to fix (or the techs don't know how) a problem their software has caused.</p>
<p>My question is... Is my only option reverting back to Win 7?</p>

            Hi Molly, <br />
<br />
There's a possibility that some of your software and hardware drivers won't work on the new operating system (especially if you've performed an upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 7) due to compatibility issue. To resolve the issue with your disc drive, you
 need to install the driver that will work with Windows 10. To do so, please check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back should you need further help.

            Been there, done all that several times. I have an Acer laptop with a Sony Optiarc disk drive. Acer has nothing for it and Sony runs me around to one that isn't even for this computer and isn't compatible. I was online &amp; on the phone with Microsoft Techs
 for two days until the last girl read my case log &amp; hung up on me while I was trying to explain, yet again, what the problem was. I cannot even revert back to Win 7 because it can't read the disk to do it.&nbsp;

            When you connect your iPhone to a Windows 10 PC, the first thing you need to do is ensure you trust the device.
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-hardware/how-to-connect-and-browse-your-apple-devices-on-a/4d275984-78d2-4e1d-8eb6-f8b84d5c9d3e">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />After trusting the device, click File Explorer &gt; This PC
<br />
<br />Right click your iPhone then click Import pictures and videos.

<br />
<br />You can do some other things like making sure your iOS is updated.
<br />
<br />You can also install the free OneDrive or Google photos app, the use it to upload your camera roll. You can then use OneDrive in Windows 10 or Google Backup and Sync to restore them on your PC.

<p>Thanks for the reply Andre, that’s the backdoor way I import them, but the numbers of pics are always off..ie..my cell shows 6929 pics in the camera roll, when importing it shows it importing 7169, but when it’s finish, it shows 8469 items in the folder
 &amp; I skipped 93 pics when importing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most videos don’t show as videos but as a regular pic &amp; it’ll give me an error msg when I try to click on the video to play. &nbsp;Im not sure where all these extra items are coming from besides Apple has a lot of ghost files/blank pages in my photo library &amp;
 I dont know why bc they showed up after an update (these are files that have img_5705.AAE...which I believe are edited photos). Pictures are not in order from date taken either even though I went into setting before importing. &nbsp;Wont let me enclosed pics to
 show error msg nor size of picture folder...I really need help with this mess!</p>

            iCloud on Windows is buggy and hardly ever works. 
<br />
<br />The iPhone 7 supports a new picture format called HEIC files.
<br />
<br />Make sure you download and install that codec in order to see all supported files on your iPhone.
<br />
<br />Launch the Photos app.
<br />
<br />Click the See more menu in the top right hand corner represented by the three dots.
<br />
<br />Click Settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to 'Download a codec to display HEIC files'
<br />
<br />Click Download a codec to display them.
<br />
<br />Check if you can then view and import the pictures.
<br />
<br />If you still encounter problems, could you please file a bug report?

Andre, thanks for your help, but there's no See More or 3 dots in my photos app on my iPhone 7+.&nbsp; Are&nbsp;there any other way to find this section?&nbsp; I did download the app to my iPhone 7+, but it seems like it's asking to convert 1 picture at a time and I have
 over 7 thousands on my cell bc icloud&nbsp;has never released any of my pictures to my computers in almost 3 years &amp; apples reps have instructed me to turn off the icloud photo about&nbsp;1 1/2&nbsp;years ago while they try to correct my icloud.&nbsp; I found out a few week ago
 at the apple store that the engineers have recently moved or deleted thousands of pictures [ALL] in my icloud and I'm waiting for them to place them back bc I don't have them anywhere else, only in the icloud :(
