            Do following to remove Yahoo Powered - 
<br />
<br />1. Uninstall it 
<br />Type appwiz.cpl in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Click appwiz.cpl &gt; Look if Yahoo Powered is here &gt; If yes, uninstall 
<br />Also look for suspicious programs which you may have installed to bring it on. Uninstall them also 
<br />
<br />2. Remove it from all browsers 
<br />This sits as plugin / extension / add-ons. So, you will need to go to all browsers and deactivate them. 
<br />
<br />3. Run Antimalware 
<br />Malware Bytes - <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a> 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            When did it install?
<br />Reason why i am asking is you can use a restore point to before it installed and that will remove the app.
<br />But it will also remove any apps you installed FYI.
<br />
<br />Go to search and type restore point.
<br />Click on 'Create a Restore Point'.
<br />Then click System Restore and go through the wizard.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this works.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be58bcb3-e3a1-4a79-9a24-3297e5274e73?upload=true" />

            <p>Hello Jamie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are not able to connect your&nbsp;head phone with the computer. It seems that there might be some drivers corruption. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">However I would require some more information to assist you better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the Head phones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the complete error message are you getting? </p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Does your head phones requires any software to be installed on the computer in order to connect it with the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Have you checked if the head phone is detected on a different Windows 7 Computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Are other USB devices working properly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps to get the issue resolved.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1: </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Run a Fixit </strong>from this Microsoft article and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Hardware devices are not working or are not detected in Windows</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above step does not help us to diagnose the issue, uninstall the drivers for USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller and restart the computer. Let Windows install the generic drivers and then see if it helps you to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Follow the steps to uninstall &amp; reinstall the USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller from device manager.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click on <strong>Start </strong>and in <strong>Start search box </strong>type in "<strong>Device Manager</strong>" (with quotes) and press<strong> enter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. <strong>Device Manager</strong> windows will be open.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Look for the <strong>device under USB [Universal Serial bus] host controller, right click</strong> on it and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5.&nbsp;Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. On restart, Windows 7 should re-install the drivers automatically.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note: If there is yellow question marks in device manger, please refer to the Step 4.</span></strong></p>

<p>3. i didnt make any changes, i went away for a few minutes, i came back and they didnt work.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for keeping us updated about the issue and sorry for delayed response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If issue persists I would suggest you to check the system files are they working fine or not and to check that try to run
<strong>System File Checker (SFC)</strong> tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>SFC scan will scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />
How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong> and open <strong>
Accessories</strong>.</li><li>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in the Program list and then select
<strong>Run as administrator</strong>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER: </li></ol>

            Hi Jtm, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />If Windows Defender appears to be missing, I'd try two things - the System File Checker and DISM. Here are instructions:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />DISM:

<br />
<br />Try running both of them and see if the problem is solved after a reboot.
<br />
<br />Let me know how you go! Thanks!

<p>Thanks Graeme&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately the problem wasn't resolved. &nbsp;Let me try to describe in detail whats happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first my windows defender was telling me its turned off by group policy. I &nbsp;tried to fix that through security and maintenance thats when i realised i can't access it,however i managed to fix that without going through it. I still want my security and
 maintenance to be accessible for future use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the windows defender was opening but couldn't start giving me error 0x00...424, forgot the middle &nbsp;numbers. &nbsp;I then went to services to see if it was enabled but couldnt find it there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did what you told me and it still cant start and still not found in services but the error has changed to code 0x8007041d.</p>
<p>Is there anything else i can try?</p>
<p>Thanks for helping&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>My notebook is Asus P53E, earlier installed Windows7 64-bit. Card reader is working perfectly (but I don't remember that displaying in device manager or not; at that time).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found request to upgrade to Windows 10 and updated to latest release till date. After few months when I try to use my memory card in laptop, it did not detect or show anywhere in system. However, device manager is refreshing when I insert/eject the memory
 card (but did not show in device manager).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please suggest me the best reason and solution for that.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
The drive or cabling could be bad.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<br />
Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

                    I have been getting several of these messages that are quite frustrating. I have tried turning off pop-up blocker..no luck...uninstalled everything but bare minimum programs and NOW can only open Windows Photo Gallery by right clicking and running as administrator?
 Please help if you can. I have Vista and IE8 and ALL are up to date.

    <title>GameDVR simply gave up and no longer works - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            GameDVR simply gave up and no longer works</h2>
                    
<p>For the past week I have been battling with the Game DVR app. &nbsp;It went from spotty inconsistent performance to simply not giving a funk and just going on strike. Tweeting about this resulted in my having to fill out surveys and nothing more. While I can
 appreciate that someone in the vast void that has become xboxone customer support is waiting to address this, it would be nice if they could address this with more than a wait and see attitude. I've done all the suggested fixes and quite frankly am more than
 a bit annoyed to have to jump through so many hoops with my $500 toy. I can't imagine this is good for business considering all the new sales the competition is putting out and with news about them beating the box to features like 3D blu-ray etc. Can we please
 have someone address this issue PLEASE. I really don't want to be that guy on youtube calling MS out with a rant but you guys are not making this easy. Do right with this or for goodness sakes buy a company to make a proper app for you. I missed a lot of awesome
 gaming moments to this &nbsp;nonsense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've done it all. I've even unplugged it for 5 to 10 mins. and nothing. When I say "xbox record that" it flashes the words in acknowledgement but nothing at all happens. When I manually launch the app and set it to record it counts down the 5 mins. but yet
 again nothing happens. Worse it won't even give a consistent error message. I've looked some up on xbox help and they return the search with a blank look telling me the error number is unknown or has no results. More than a little frustrating to say the least.

            <p>Just out of curiosity what are you trying to record with the DVR? &nbsp;The system is set up to only record Xbox One video games. &nbsp;It will not work for anything else. &nbsp;No movies, TV shows, dashboard items or even games from your 360 if you if it connected via HDMI.</p>

<p>First, thank you for your attempts to help with this. It is appreciated and none of my frustrations should ever be mistaken for being towards you. I am pretty tech savvy and have always only attempted to use the GameDVR as it was intended, which is to say,
 merely to record gameplay clips of 30 seconds and up to 5 mins. (although some games have given me up to nearly ten). I will detail a typical evening and perhaps you might spot or notice the issue or perhaps something I may have missed along the way.</p>
<p>1. I arrive home from work and say to myself "Self? How about a game of Watchdogs or perhaps Killer Instinct?" Myself responds with "Sure! Why not!"</p>
<p>2. I then spend the next twenty minutes basically yelling, screaming, shouting, pleading, whispering, and generally cajoling my xbox one to please turn on as I repeatedly say "Xbox! ON!" (sometimes in different languages in the hopes that ONE will work...)
 Despite the fact that I am sitting a mere 6' away with the controller in hand, and my wife and children basically besieging me to please just get up already and press the button on the console, I stand steadfast and refuse because after all it's a matter of
 pride after the sixth, seventh, or thirty-ninth time of asking. Eventually it turns on and everyone lets out a sigh of relief. (but that's because I waited until they weren't looking and finally just got up and pressed the button...sigh)</p>
<p>3. After it turns on I spend the next twenty minutes battling with the xbox one to recognize me and auto-sign me in. I toss out voice commands left and right and say things like "Xbox, show my stuff!" all to no avail, as the xbox one refuses to admit it
 knows me. To make matters worse, it picks up the simplest of commands with ease now after refusing to acknowledge the command to turn it on in the first place. But admitting it knows me is still something it will only do if in the mood. I eventually cave and
 manually sign in with the controller or say "Xbox, sign me in". I am now signed in, and hopefully we can both put this nonsense behind us.</p>
<p>4. I launch the game of choice and begin playing. Suddenly something awesome and unbelievable happens...that one magical gaming moment that could easily put me in the gaming hall of champions if only someone else could witness it. I shout across the living
 room "Xbox! Record that!!" and suddenly the xbox comes to life, acknowledges my voice command, and fires back with "Xbox, Record that" to confirm receipt of my voice command. I sit back with a smug look of content on my face, as my team mates all around me
 get shot up, squished, and generally run over by titans, vehicular combat, and enemy attacks, but that's ok, because I've stopped offering cover fire so I can rewatch my recorded game clip once I get the notification from my xbox that it has indeed "recorded
 that".</p>
<p>...but it never comes.</p>
<p>All around me, I hear the battle cries of my fellow team mates as they die in agony...but my xbox never once goes "blik!" to show me the notification that it has indeed done what I have asked of it.</p>
<p>I immediately make my way to my upload clips, and sure enough...nothing. Nothing at all. "Ok..." I think to myself..."..maybe it's just going to take a bit before it shows..." and I proceed to wait. But after ten minutes....nothing still.</p>
<p>6. I then proceed to say "Xbox, snap GameDVR" and once it does it, I then proceed to set that in motion. I select for a new clip, start recording, watch the counter start, and begin to play generally assuming all things are well. If I end the clip early,
 it states "Sorry couldn't record that..." or some such message containing an error code. If I let it play out...I can come back and find it did absolutely nothing the entire time. Absolutely nothing. Worse, if I take one of the error codes to the help section
 here, in an attempt to find a solution, often times the returned results state "Couldn't find anything" or some such wording to indicate it doesn't even know what the code stands for!</p>
<p>Now, keep in mind I don't let anyone move, relocate, or generally go near the Kinect. I very carefully go through the set up process for both video and audio with it as well. So I fail to see where it picks and chooses to listen to me. I also have used it
 during noisy times, and during ideal quiet times, and neither makes a difference with how fickle the Kinect chooses to be in regards to my voice commands.</p>
<p>As for the actual DVR issue, I've attempted to follow just about every suggestion given to me by xbox support, but again, all to no avail. Turning off the system and restarting it, unplugging it and waiting five minutes, etc. etc. and nothing. I've even
 filled out a few "surveys" to help address the issue, and when I check back with the support, it's generally "Hey! Thanks for checking back with us...we aren't any closer to a solution for you...but hey...thanks for checking in on us...you have a great day!"</p>
<p>Now I know my sarcasm is dripping here, but I think I am not alone when I state, this is extremely frustrating to say the least, especially when I sit in the living room weeping and gnashing my teeth, losing the respect of my wife and kids in the process,
 and my $500 toy refuses to work as advertised.</p>
<p>ANY help that could actually solve this is GREATLY appreciated.</p>

            <p>No worries. &nbsp;No offense taken. &nbsp;Now, a quick question. &nbsp;Are you saying Xbox Record That as all one sentence or is there a slight pause after Xbox. &nbsp;I have found that if I leave a slight pause it works better.</p>
<p>Also, what is the placement of your sensor in relation to your speaker system? &nbsp;Is the sound extremely loud when you're giving the command? &nbsp;Perhaps the sensor is not hearing you over the game. &nbsp;(I know that doesn't count for Xbox On)</p>

<p>I have accounted for the placement of my center speaker (which is on the shelf directly underneath the Kinect), so I am aware of how that does affect it hearing me. However, despite this, the xbox does acknowledge that it heard me when I ask it to DVR because
 it flashes the phrase in the upper right hand corner of the screen as it normally would when it used to work. The only difference is in that it fails to follow up shortly after with the notification that it actually recorded anything.
</p>
<p>I have done the "Xbox (pause) -insert command here" and also the "Xboxinsertcommandhere" (at times even going so far as to sound lethargic or like the announcer of "epic rap battles of history"....but despite the xbox not wanting to acknowledge my "Xbox
 ON" command consistently, it does appear to hear me without issue when asking it to record that...it simply just doesn't follow through with the command. As I've stated before, I have seen other threads here with the same exact issue dating so far back as
 December of last year if I recall...and yet...still apparently no solution. Truth be told I'm almost more inclined to expect a new 2K15 Football game than a solution to this issue any time soon at this point. :(</p>

<p>I'm not in any beta programs for the Xbox ONE console. The only beta I participated in was the one for Destiny. Admittedly, I noticed the problem just after being in that beta. Those were some of the last clips I was was able to record.
</p>
<p>Now it simply does nothing. Won't record at all.</p>

            You cannot reduce the size of Windows. But MVP Andre Da Costa's post here discusses this in detail on how to handle Windows update on limited space:

            Hi Harry.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Harry, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here every day on Community . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>Stereo sound work on everything. Surround sound works in speaker setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lonnie7777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stereo sound work on everything. Surround sound works in speaker setup but nowhere else.</h2>
                    <p><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">Is there any real help?</span><br />
</p>
<p>Third time I have asked for help on this.</p>
<p>Stereo sound work on everything. Surround sound works in speaker setup but nowhere else.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newest drivers, windows 7, IE9, Ausu motherboard, all squares that I can find are checked. If I leave it as 7.1 surround most sites only use the stereo speakers other sites have no sound and display "cannot connect to speaker will keep trying".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I was not clear enough when I wrote "all squares that I can find are checked". I should have wrote that I have read several previous threads about sound problems and followed the advice including selecting and checking "play sounds in web pages.</p>
<p>The part were I wrote " If I leave it as 7.1 surround most sites only use the stereo speakers other sites have no sound" means that the sound does work through two speakers but not the other 5 speakers. This is also true for Windows media center.</p>
<p>Surround sound only works in the speaker setup, I can hear sound from all 7 speakers in the speaker setup.</p>
<p>Surround sound will not work any other time. Only stereo will work. This is not a no sound problem it is a no surrond sound problem. I have new drivers.</p>
<p>I think "Windows 7" has a problem. Why would the surround sound work in speaker setup and not work anywhere else?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>New question. Auto complete does not work. Google chrome worked great and I'm thinking about going back to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Yes the square is checked. I do not want to save any passwords on my computer. Ever heard of hackers?</p>

            <p>This is my 1st time seeing your question, so you might have to explain things you explained in&nbsp;your previous questions again, however annoying that may be.</p>
<p>What (if anything) are you using as your audio manager? For example on my home computer I have Realtek HD Audio Manager, where all the settings including surround sound are. Or are you just using the sound section of the control panel?</p>
<p>Does the surround sound work anywhere other than in speaker setup? You said it doesn't work on sites, but what about when listening to music, or watching a movie, etc. In other words, have you played something that you know has surround sound, and the surround
 didn't work?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, for autocomplete, it may sound counter-intuitive but you might actually be safer having the save passwords option on. The saved passwords are all encrypted, which would be hard for hackers to&nbsp;get, and then even harder to&nbsp;decrypt.
</p>
<p>But if you're typing your passwords out every time, then all a hacker would need is to get a keylogger on your computer and&nbsp;then&nbsp;they instantly have your password, because the keylogger records&nbsp;everything you type, so it would record the password.</p>

<p>Surround sound will not work any other time. No Sound.</p>
<p>Surround sound only works in the speaker setup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Autocomplete should work without the save password. A keylogger would be more of&nbsp;a virus or trojan and should be,I say should be easy to detect and at the same time encrypted passwords can be obtained and decrypted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Set the Windows sound control panel to 2-channel, and then set WMC to 5.1 or 7.1 (whatever you have).</span></p>
<span>IIRC this is mostly necessary for bit streaming, but it might also be necessary if you’re doing TOSLink or S/PDIF output.<br />

<p>I used to get the "cannot write to speaker will keep trying" error when I bought a new laptop running on Windows 10. I got the error specifically when I run Blackboard Collaborate to watch live or recorded lessons. The lesson host told me to check if my
 speakers are set to surround and to set them to stereo instead. I checked the setting and stereo was the only choice, so that did not resolve the issue. I then looked into all the Blackboard support topics, and nothing worked. I also bought a couple of software
 that claim that the cause of the error is a registry problem and that the software will clean the registry; I wasted close to $100 with no results. Furthermore, as the audio driver is Realtek HD Audio, I updated the driver and also reinstalled the driver;
 and that also did not work; for some reason Realtek HD Audio Manager is not available, even after I reinstalled the driver, so the only audio setup was through Windows. Finally, I tried to connect different headphones to see if I can bypass the speakers, but
 I still get the error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the error for 1.5 years since I bought the laptop. Finally, I thought that the problem could be caused by a hidden application that is using the speakers, even though I did not have any audio or video applications running while I tried to run the Blackboard
 lessons. My laptop is an MSI gaming and when I checked if there are any programs running in the background that are using the speakers, I found a program called Nahimic for MSI that enhances the speakers' performance. I disabled the program and went back to
 run a Blackboard lesson. Eureka!!! I no longer get the error and the sound was running perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your information, before I resolved the issue, I bought an ASUS gaming desktop and had the same issue. It appears that the gaming laptops run an audio application in the background to enhance the gaming experience. I never had this audio error in the
 past on non-gaming laptops or desktops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, check if there are any programs running in the background that are using the speakers by clicking on the up-pointing arrow towards the right of the task bar and hover over the different icons. If you see a program that appears to be a sound-related program,
 right-click and open it. Then, disable it and exit. Hopefully, this should fix the error.</p>

<p>Hi Marty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try to isolate this issue so that we could find a way for you to play Forza Horizon 3 on your computer. Kindly provide us the following information below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you tell us when did you notice the issue?</li><li>Can you also tell us the error message that you receive when playing the game?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you launch the Xbox app on your computer and try checking the network status from
<em><strong>Settings &gt; Network</strong></em>. This will help us to determine if your computer is connected to the Xbox Live server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail - &#34;Update All&#34; only updating one account</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 different accounts running on Windows Live Mail (WLM) and they all worked as they should up until a recent Windows 8.1 update around&nbsp;May 15, 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the update, my SSL settings had to be changed to work with my ISP and WLM. I changed the incoming and outgoing mail servers and the ports on each account. They all work as they should, but I now have to click the down arrow on Send/Receive and update
 each account separately. "All email Accounts" and "Update All" no longer work and only update one of the accounts. Aside from reinstalling, is there a solution to fix this?</p>

<p>What makes you think that a Windows Update would have any effect on the performance of a Windows Live Mail account? Did you try selectively uninstalling updates to identify the one that was having this effect?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>With the update, my SSL settings had to be changed </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, how did you arrive at this conclusion? I can think of no way that&nbsp;a Windows Update can change the security requirements of an email account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you change the SSL settings, it's important to close down the program for a few minutes to ensure that the new security settings are properly stored before testing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>"All email Accounts" and "Update All" no longer work </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is probably affected by the settings on each account.</p>
<ul>
<li>What types of account are we dealing with here - HTTP, POP3 or IMAP?&nbsp;[&nbsp;If you're not sure, right-click on the account name in the folder pane and select
<em>Properties</em>. The type of account is given at the top of the <em>Server(s)</em> tab. The properties dialogue for an HTTP account has three tabs, for a POP3 account four and for an IMAP4 account five.] It would help to know which mail servers you're connecting
 to.</li><li>On the <em>General</em> tab of&nbsp;these&nbsp;accounts' properties dialogue,&nbsp;is <em>Include this account when receiving mail or synchronizing</em> selected?</li><li>On the <em>General</em> tab of the program options dialogue (Ctrl-Shift-O),&nbsp;is
<em>Check for new messages every </em>n<em> minutes</em> selected? If so, what is
<em>n</em>? Some mail servers will lock a mailbox for a period after each poll to cut down server traffic.
</li><li>For each of the affected accounts, compose a test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself , i.e. address it&nbsp;to the same account it's being sent from. Post any error message in your reply.</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Aside from reinstalling, is there a solution to fix this?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's establish what the problem is before looking for solutions. Re-installing will rarely correct any fault with account settings; these are saved in the store folder and untouched&nbsp;when the program files are&nbsp;re-installed. The fact that one account behaves
 itself seems to demonstrate that there's nothing wrong with the program's send/receive functionality.</p>

    <title>How can I resize the On-screen keyboard for my laptop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kyouhyung kim  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I resize the On-screen keyboard for my laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed official release&nbsp; version of Windows 8 on my ThinkPad X201 Tablet.</p>
<p>Although the onscreen keyboard is big ans thus easy to type on, I sometimes think it's too big and want to shrink it down a bit.</p>
<p>In windows 7 I could easily resize the keyboard in just the way I would do with normal windows, but this new keyboard doesn't seem to work like that...</p>
<p>Do I have an option to resize the keyboard? If not, is it planned to be coming soon, or is it not planned at all?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plus, I have designated one of my bezel buttons to call up or close the OSK, and I want it to be the only way to call it up.</p>
<p>I don't want touch input on letterbox to automatically call up the OSK, but I couldn't find that option either. Same question here: Do I have the option? If not, is it coming?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. one more&nbsp;off-topic question: is snap feature for 1280*800 screen resolution coming as well? I really really think the resolution is big enough for snap...It's a pity I can't use it.</p>

            <p>Hi. Thanks for your reply. I followed the link and read the contents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, it does not solve my problem...</p>
<p>I want to resize the normal keyboard(not the split keyboard), and by far, I coudn't locate an option...</p>
<p>Also, the writing recognition panel is way too big to write on...I'd just like it to take about 1/3 of the screen height, now it comes up as high as 1/2 of my whole screen height...which is rather uncomfortable to write on...</p>
<p>I can just write small in English, but when I am writing in Korean, whis is my primary language, you can not just write in one big blank...it has divided blocks and one letter goes into each block. Whis this size, you only get like 5 or 6 blocks...too few
 to actually try to write something...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just want the whole touch input interface to shrink down a bit...but I can't&nbsp;find a way...</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply though :)</p>

<p>Below are statements regarding on-screen keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"One of the features that Microsoft plans on adding to the touch keyboard in Windows 8 beta is said to be the
<strong>option to resize the keyboard when in split view</strong>. "<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Choose between small, medium or large touch keyboard in Windows 8</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The size of the keyboard also depends upon the screen resolution set for your monitor. Increase the screen resolution and the keyboard size will automatically adjust."</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Swipe the right edge of the screen out to access “charms.” Select settings, then more PC settings. Go to general, scroll down and there will be an option to make the standard layout available.</p>

<h2>            Music deleted from hard drive but not from Groove library</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>Recently I deleted some of my music from my hard drive, but in Groove, they are displayed in songs, their albums are in the albums section and so on; like they're not deleted and when I try to play them, It gives me the following error:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/04376604-5529-43f7-98de-385372ddbe01" /></p>
<p>Is there a way to force Groove to refresh it's library or a way to delete these items?</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Pro 64 bit</p>

            <p>Hi Kong,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address your concern about having Local Area Connection, we suggest you to perform
<strong>DISM RestoreHealth</strong> command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to the steps below: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use the <strong>Windows key + X</strong> keyboard shortcut to open the <strong>
Power User</strong> menu and select <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong>:<br />
<strong>DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> While running DISM using the /RestoreHealth, you will notice the process will seem stuck at 20% or 40%, but it's normal behavior. After few minutes, the operation will finish as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Provide us an update on the progress of your concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

    <title>Err_Internet_Disconnected Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dm319  say:</h3>
<h2>            Err_Internet_Disconnected Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>After updating to Windows 10, my lenovo yoga 2 sometimes fails to connect to the internet. When I am at home, I am able to power cycle my laptop, router and modem to connect to the internet. However, I am unable to do this in public places and the solution
 of power cycling sometimes only lasts a few minutes. I have tried several "solutions" including uninstalling and reinstalling the network adapter, enabling and disabling the network adapter. I have also tried dnsflush and ipconfig/release &amp; renew in cmd prompt.
 When I try to release and renew the ipconfig, the response I get back is media disconnected. I have also tried calling my internet provider who claims the modem and router are appropriately connected, which makes sense since all other wifi enabled devices
 are able to connect to the internet without problems. Any suggestions would be appreciated!!!&nbsp;</p>

            +1 on this error, and troubleshooter not working. Then again, not sure when the troubleshooter has ever worked. &nbsp;I have a Dell laptop, less than 2 years old. Windows 10 looks a lot better, easier to use, but got to have wifi.
