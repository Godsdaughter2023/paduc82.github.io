<h2>            ALL files on internal hard drive suddenly read only and cannot be changed</h2>
                    <p>Hi ~</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this seems to be a 10-yr old problem that was never solved. All the files on my computer suddenly behave as if they are read only even though the files do not show a read only flag. Its actually more like the folders that the files are in have some mysterious
 permission applied but when I check the folder permissions, everything is normal and I have full control. Whats NOT normal about the folders is that they all have a blue read only box. Previously, all folders had a grey checkmark in the read only box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to open any existing file, the program opening it (Word, Autocad etc) will warn me that the file is read only and asks if I want to continue opening it. If I continue, it indeed opens it as read only and I am unable to save the file. I can't even
 save the file with a new name. A permission denied error pops up. The only place that I can save files normally is My Documents folder or Desktop or My Music or My Pictures. Any other folder or partition on the internal hard drive will force the file to behave
 as if its read only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken ownership, removed all attributes from cmd, disabled UAC and even uninstalled the disk driver in computer management but the folders will not change. I have even added my very own username with full control to the permissions stack and even
 that doesn't work. The only thing that worked was to add the Everyone group and give them modification rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone solved this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Win7x64 SP1</p>

<p>No - that is NORMAL for all folders to have a blue read only box and it is not a 10 year old problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider it a Windows feature where the system is working as designed but maybe not as desired or expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you may have another problem of saving files but the appearance of folders and the read only box is normal, but things on your system may not be normal anymore if you have been messing around with ownership, attributes and UAC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From another topic of the same non-issue it is explained how Windows works and has always worked:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3bde4926-8bec-4f2e-9994-a11042c9486f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3bde4926-8bec-4f2e-9994-a11042c9486f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows does not pay attention to the Read only attribute on folders - you can't make a folder read only but you can make the contents of the folder read only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's why the message next to the box says "Only applies to files in folder".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot change the Read-only or System attributes of <strong>folders</strong> and you can read more about it here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/326549/you-cannot-view-or-change-the-read-only-or-the-system-attributes-of-fo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/326549/you-cannot-view-or-change-the-read-only-or-the-system-attributes-of-fo</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you can't make a folder read only but you can make the files in the folder read only if you apply that checkbox to the contents of the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check any/all folders in Windows and they will all have that blue box and you can't make the blue box go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if you create a brand new folder the blue box is there:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff442d08-95ad-46d5-a1b9-4af708251acc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ff442d08-95ad-46d5-a1b9-4af708251acc" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Even the Windows folder has the blue box:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33fb895e-1872-4f40-9dd9-721e98b88ad0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33fb895e-1872-4f40-9dd9-721e98b88ad0" /></a></p>

<p>OK I think I figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first deployed the workstations, I disabled the UAC because it annoyed many users who were using a whole bunch of legacy software at the time. Since those are now gone, I turned the UAC back on but it removed the inherit permissions from parent folder
 on certain folders. All folders on mapped drives were not affected. Only folders residing on the local drive were affected such as D:\Projects or C:\Temp. In order to see this, you need to drill all the way down into the Advanced Permissions menus which is
 why I didn't initially see any permissions problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also on some computers, turning the UAC back on removed the username object permission from the user profile folder. The user profile folder should have three object permissions: SYSTEM, Administrators and Username permissions - the last one being removed
 entirely which affects email apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Turning the UAC back to disabled does NOT remedy the situation. The folders are left in their improper state. Manually restoring the proper permissions on all affected folders turns the blue read only square back to the normal grey checkmark after a reboot
 and the system behaves normally again.</p>
<p>

    <title>Cannot pin File Explorer to Taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeramee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot pin File Explorer to Taskbar</h2>
                    <p>I just bought a new Win 10 PC about 8 hours ago and am trying to set it up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to transfer files from my external hard drive onto the new laptop only to find out, once the transfer was nearly complete, that Win 10 defaulted the transfer into my OneDrive, which I didn't notice until I got an error message that OneDrive was full.&nbsp;
 What. The. Heck?&nbsp; This is seriously not ok, and I'm angry.&nbsp; MS keeps pushing people into these stupid "solutions" that are nothing but problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, because Win 10 is as confusing as the IRS code, it took me several minute just to find the file explorer.&nbsp; I used to be able to get this by clicking on the C: drive icon in Win 7, or some similar method.&nbsp; So, after finally finding it, I thought I'd
 just pin it to the taskbar so that I wouldn't have to fight Win 10 just to get to my files that I've been working on. Once pinned to the taskbar, though, the icon will not open the file explorer.&nbsp; Forum posts show that this has been a problem for years, yet
 it's still not fixed?&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; Seriously?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, take a look back through my posts for the last 2 years.&nbsp; I keep having problem after problem with MS products.&nbsp; I've stopped using my Hotmail completely.&nbsp; MS cloud apps consistently have compatibility issues, so I've stopped using those too.&nbsp; It's
 just one thing after another with MS.&nbsp; Will you folks please stop screwing up your programs?&nbsp; Or is it time to stop being disgusted and just change to another OS?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*Btw, to make matters even worse, typing into this site remains a pain, which, I'm pretty sure, is another issue I've mentioned before.&nbsp; There is a lag between typing and words appearing on the screen, and it's causing a lot of typos.&nbsp; Seriously, Microsoft,
 you can't even get your forum to work right?</p>

 According to&nbsp;my Local Xbox Support they were unable to track illegal activity in his Account and his Account was in good standing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is quite a lot of ***. Furthermore,&nbsp;he hasen't scammed at all, but banned for another reason, so why in the hell should they Suspend his Account till 9999. What the hell?!</p>
<p>This is a freaking entertaiment Console. Why should they ban someone that's always nice to other players, never has done anything wrong and play games on the fair way.</p>
<p>Proberly the Enforcement Members are unable to admit that they have Suspended the wrong Player and now leave it this way. Well, if they don't Suspended him, I also quit with this ***. For me the fun's over now!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thanks for replying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Proberly you don't the understand my question that well, so I summarize.</p>
<p>I stand up for my friends whatever the problem is.</p>
<p>That's why I post for him, however he also posted in 15, but got the same response as me. Maybie it stops for him with response number one, but not for me. I keep going till they give me/him the right answer. They don't have prove, at least, it looks like.
 We have, but they won't believe and I know they believe me, but they won't admit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, what should <strong>YOU</strong> do if you was banned for somthing you didn't do and you get a lame answer like "Yea your Account has been Suspened due to involvemed bla bla bla" and&nbsp;you're sure that you're not guilty.</p>
<p>I keep cellecting eveidence that he's not guilty at all, but these rich's man won't give me a change to send me the prove that we need to prove that my friend isn't guilty.</p>
<p>The main thing of all is that you keep going and don't stop at all. They need to know that thay're wrong so long as they pulling me back from their Forum.</p>
<p>Also, they <strong>MAY NOT BAN SOMEONE</strong> for the reason that he's guilty for even
<strong>HE'S&nbsp;NOT GUILTY&nbsp;AT ALL!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is your friends duty to speak up for himself in these matters.</p>
<p>The posts you shared show the reasons for the ban, and they are not reversible.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It may have even come from one simple time where he may have been joking with someone online that he was a microsoft worker, and said something wrong that was overheard by another, and it was reported.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>What's done is done. Your friend will have to make a new account, and he should read through the Terms of Use fully so he knows what not to do.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is just the problem.</p>
<p>If the Enforcement Team just play for one freaking hour Call of Duty 4 Multiplayer, then I can assure you that at least 200 people will get banned from the Xbox Live Services.</p>
<p>I know, this is just an example and I also know that Activision is responsible for this kind of issue, but this is a more serious problem then&nbsp;Suspend one person that has somthing done that isn't even been verified and then it should be a very long time
 ago and the Enforcement team is taking action now. Well, if they take action of the Call of Duty 4 Modders, no, of course not, they ban just a single man, the Call of Duty modders is to much work for them. This is what I mean. You get banned for things you
 don't even know you did somthing wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the File-Complaint System doesn't work correctly. If one person doesn't like another Xbox Live Player, they call up his complete friend-list and perhaps some recent players and ask to File-Complaint him for example Cheating. The other players have never
 heard him, never played with him, they just assist the other player that want to get rid of him on Xbox Live. The Enforcement Team get at least 67 File-Complaints and that's their prove. That's quite a lot of ***. For players who really did somthing wrong
 it works perfectly, but for my friend it's just quite f**ked-up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you have another suggestion for me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi FS x Thunder NL!! Sorry to hear about your friend but both you and him have clearly recieved an answer about the issue, problem is you just don't like it. Making muliple topic posts isn't going to change the fact that your friend is banned (as previously
 stated), it's just going to annoy people. Accept that he isn't getting it back and have him create another account if you two want to continue gaming together and if he chooses to. Brining up faults in the Xbox system isn't going to further your cause either..</p>

<p>Actually, when someone has their friends mass report, it does nothing. They review the reports and that can get those people temporary suspensions for misusing the features.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for MP games such as older CODs and others. Well, the problem is so severe that enforcement can't keep up with it all, and the game developers don't care, so proper action can't be taken if the developer of the game itself doesn't do anything.</p>

<p>Hi HoAx1993,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not agree at some points:</p>
<p>1. Bringing up faults in the Xbox System is definitely change some things. The
<strong>File-Complaint System</strong> is a high-technology System, but just like other High-technology-systems there are bugs in the System that aren't been discoverd yet, until it's going wrong, like it happends right now. I don't know if you know how the
 System works, but I do. I suggest you watch the video in <strong>15 - My Live Account was Suspended</strong> and then I know what you mean. It's somwhere in
<strong>4:20</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Either <strong>I DO NOT</strong> accept his Suspension what I already have written above.</p>
<p>Imagine by yourself if you get banned without a&nbsp;reason. I see you have quite a lot of Gamerscore and suddenly you get's banned and you are sure you haven't done anything wrong. Are you accepting that? Well I don't. I will not let myself getting banned when
 I know I didn't do anything wrong. But if you accept that, well that's your choise, but all the time you spend in earning these trophies and MultiPlayer Rankings are all for nothing, keep that in mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi Jamesr78,</p>
<p>Thanks again for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like <strong>HoAx1993</strong> I do not agree at some points:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Not only the developers are responsible for the game, but these players are also violating the
<strong>Xbox C.O.C.</strong>, but the in much higher numbers.</p>
<p>The ban of my friend isn't even been verified and I quess they don't even know the answer on my question. If you ban someone that's banned from Xbox Live while modding the COD 4 Servers they have no&nbsp;choise then to&nbsp;to accept&nbsp;the Suspension, but this Suspenion
 is so f**king ridicilous.</p>
<p>Like I said to <strong>HoAx1993 </strong>that you have to imagine that you or one of your friend's been banned from Xbox Live&nbsp;without a reason. Can you live with that? Yes that's possible, if you haven't your Account as long as my friend. I just want a
<strong>SERIOUS EXPLANATION</strong> why he's Suspended from Xbox Live, but they won't give me that reason at all and I don't know why. They just won't admit that they're wrong and than we are right. The only proof that they have are the File-Complaints, they
 don't even know him and his Account is still in good standing according to my local Xbox Support. They weren't able to track illegal activity in his Acount. If they can reduce the ban from peremently to for example 1 year, I'll stop complaining, cause this
 is just a high-extremely ban for that part of the Xbox C.O.C. and&nbsp;<strong>HE HASEN'T DONE ANYTHING WRONG!!!!!!</strong></p>
<p>I made this post in <strong>This Categorie</strong>, cause I want an opinion that helps
<strong>US</strong> out, but properly that wasen't a very good idea, cause now is everyone against me. And yes, I have already made a lot of posts in
<strong>15 My Live Account Was Suspended</strong> and still in discussion with <strong>
The Enforcement Team</strong> till I get an explanation what we're waiting for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is anyone able to give me a good reply what else I can do than accepting that ban, creating a new Account, switching to another Game-Console, end this discussion etc.</p>

<p>Hey FS x Thunder NL,</p>
<p>Judging by your replies you will not be satisfied with any answer given, however let me attempt to make a few things clear: Your fighting a battle your not going to win, and if you do stand a chance in getting some resolve it will be a long, hard and exhausting
 battle! In the time that you and the friend in question will spend attempting to get some resolve to this issue.. at least a few hundred game titles, movies, songs, and maybe presidents will change! It would be simpler for the persons whom account has been
 suspended to just create a new account and move on! Besides any of the things being pointed out in this post or the others, the only things you could do is take legal action ( lots of money spent, time wasted, and so on), continue doing what your doing in
 hopes that someone will take a closer look at the problem.. only to explain that the account has been removed from the servers, or to gather together friends and begin helping the person in question begin gaining achievements /awards/etc for their new account.
 Best of luck with this. </p>

<p>Hi Bamboo,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whould you said in your reply: "<strong>&nbsp;( lots of money spent, time wasted, and so on), continue doing what your doing in hopes that someone will take a closer look at the problem..</strong> :"</p>
<p>If I, my friend or someone else doesn't take action to investigate the problem "Seriously" and I stop complaining they never gonna take it serious and never ever gonna take the issue serious. Mistakes by The Enforcement Team are made rearly and everyone's
 know that. Now there's one person that keeps complaining by The Enforcement Team and that's me. If one person keeps complaining that they have made a mistake and they don't take&nbsp;it serious, well I keep going till they handle the case as
<span>adults</span> instead of <span>children. They even won't give me a reason why he's banned. Well, sorry mate, but I still am a Xbox Live Customers and so I have the right to know what's going and why he's bunned
<strong>FOR NO REASON</strong>. Also I will ask you too: What will you do if you're Suspended when you're sure you haven't done anything and your Acount has never been comprimised? If you have a lot of Multiplayers games completed, you have quite a lot of Gamerscore
 and you've spend a lot of money and hours in the games you have&nbsp;played. Would you accept the Suspension while you haven't done anything. You're crazy if you agree with that Suspension, cause you haven't done anything wrong. That's also counting for my friend.
 Is it just that hard to investigate the case and to take a closer look to the case if one person is&nbsp;so annoying? These guys getting paid for that and we are paying their wages so we have the right (at least my friend has the right) to know what's going on
 and why's banned for things that he hasen't done. Of course we will lose a lot of time in this, but I'll take the change to do it. Hope you have another reply on this reply for me. Thanks.</span></p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Theres nothing else to suggest. Your friend violated the code of conduct and therefore got banned. Thats really all the explaination you can get/you need. Once an account has been suspended/banned. IT IS PERMANENT! They do not reverce these because they
 did a deep investigation into the matter to see if what your friend is doing falls into the critera of violating the CoC and needs a ban.</p>

<p>As everyone else said in this thread <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>YOUR FRIEND, NOT YOU

    <title>Speech Recognition in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianmcdonald_998  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech Recognition in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm trying to train my PC to better understand my voice and use the Speech Tutorial in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I first installed Windows 10 I had no problems with any part of the Speech Racognition or Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't used any of them for a while until just recently but now I am having 3 issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Iaaue 1 is that I can use the Speech Recognition fine to dictate to my PC and for quicker typing in Word or other documenting software but my PC does not understand me properly and puts the wrong words in the wrong sentences which makes typing a lot faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using several different suggested techniques to try to resolve my problem but have not had any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Speech Recognition set to start when I power up my PC and log in so that I only have to right click on the Speech Recognition Icon and select what I wish to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have both my PC and Speech set to English UK as I live in the UK!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click in the Speech Recognition Icon then select the Start Speech Tutorial link I am being taken to&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14213/windows-how-to-use-speech-recognition How to use Speech Recognition but this is not giving me
 any answers to resolve my problem as this page is only showing for Windows 7 and 8.1, not Windows 10, The Start Speech Tutorial seems to be missing from the Speech Recognition and does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue 2 is when I right click on &nbsp;the Speech Recognition Icon then left click on the Configuration link then Improve Voice Recognition a window pops up and says "</p>
<p>
</p><p>Speech Recognition Training</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">Welcome To Speech Recognition Voice Training</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>By Listening to you read aloud to the computer, Speech Recognition learns how you speak.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Some training text will be displayed on the next page. When the training text appears, read it aloud in a natural even tone.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The system will display one line at a time. When you have finished reading a line, the system will, after a short pause, automatically present the next line.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the system doesn’t understand what you read, it will skip to the next line. This is normal and not a cause for concern.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Click Next to begin training.</span></p>
<p><span>Note: We recommend that you take the Speech Recognition tutorial first. In Addition to improving the recognition of your voice, the tutorial also gives you
 an opportunity to learn the most important Speech Recognition commands.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It shows Next and Cancel in boxes at the lower right side of this window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(SCREEN SHOT ATACHED)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I then left click on the Next box and another window opens which displays the following message.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Speech Recognition Voice Training</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">Speech Training Error</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(68, 114, 196, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Speech Training is not configured properly. Please go to the Speech Recognition Control Panel, click on Advanced Options and set Microsoft Speech Recogniser
 8.0 for your system language as the default recogniser.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A box with Finish is displayed on the lower right of this window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have added screenshots of all stages so what is happening can be seen step for step, when I go to the Speech Recognition Control Panel and try to set the
 Windows 8.0 as the recogniser I am being given the choice of either US 8.0 or UK&nbsp; 8.0, screenshots will show.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Is there some programming missing from my system and any way I can sort this problem out as it is becoming a nuisance when trying to use speech to write important
 documents and Court Statements.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Issue 3 is using Cortana, when I first installed Windows 10 all I had to do was say “Hey Cortana” and Cortana would wake and listen to everything I said or
 commanded but now when I say “Hey Cortana nothing happens, instead I have to click on the mic icon on the right of the search box to wake Cortana and even then I am only able to give one command or say one sentence and Cortana goes back in to sleep mode, I
 have to keep on clicking on the mic icon to wake Cortana.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>ANY HELP IN RESOLVING THESE ISSUES WILL BE MUCH APPRECIATED.</span></p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I've managed to reset Cortana and she is working and responding alright now without having to click on the mic every time, I just say Hi Cortana like before and she works now after turning off then on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a bit of a problem getting the Voice Recorder to start up last night but it seems to be working fine recording and playing back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still having the issues with Speech Recognition though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click on the Speech Recognition Icon &gt;Configuration&gt;Improve voice recognition a window opens like before I click on Next and am still being taken to the same message as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Open Speech Reference Card is still taking me to&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12427/windows-speech-recognition-commands which is of no help as I already know commands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start Speech Tutorial is still taking me to&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14213/windows-how-to-use-speech-recognition which is of no use for Windows 10 as in the Dropbox on this page only shows for Windows 8.1 and 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is as if the Speech Recognition has only part installed on my system as I can start Speech Recognition and give commands and write text in all word documents like emails, Microsoft Word, Libre Office and all other things where I can dictate text but there
 doesn't seem to be any tutorials or reference card to train my PC to understand my voice and improve the output of the spoken words as my system is putting totally different words than I say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to the Control Panel&gt;Troubleshooting&gt;View All&gt;Speech&gt;Next a window is opening which is only showing 2 boxes (Cortana can't hear me and I can't hear Cortana) but Cortana is working fine after resetting her.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this be the fact that the problems I'm having could be what I've suggested that the tutorial etc have not been installed correctly or are missing from my system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would there be any way of performing a Compatibility check and if so would suggesting they worked on an earlier version of Windows probably correct the problem or is there any way of reinstalling the Speech Recognition without having to do a fresh installation
 of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently had to reinstall Windows 10 as someone somehow managed to hack in to my system (which was partly my fault for answering the phone), people were posing as Microsoft representatives but even though I didn't allow them remote access to my system
 they must have found some way to hack in and delete my accounts and place some bug which would have eventually made everything shut down and crash, lucky enough I noticed there was a problem when I checked my accounts in Control Panel and noticed they had
 all been deleted so I did a fresh install straight away, since then I have been having these problems, the fresh install seems to have missed the Speech Training features even though I selected to delete everything and reinstall Windows 10 from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had someone call me trying to pose as a Microsoft Representative since but as soon as he said "We have noticed you have problems with your system" straight away I said "Oh really, I suppose you are a Microsoft Representative then?" and as soon as
 he said "Yes" I said "Yeh, alright" and told him to F Off and out the phone down straight away as I know he was not from Microsoft and I was as rood as I was to him as I am getting a fed up with these people as Microsoft probably are, I have noticed that every
 time I have received these kind of calls the person on the other side always seems to be of Indian Origin, never a person from any other country or languages, I can tell these people are of Indian Origin because of their accents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no more of this kind of call since I told that guy to F off thank God but I do not think it was him who managed to do anything to my system as I have been having the problems above since my fresh install of Windows 10 and since the Updates with
 the Windows Insider program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll see if I can do a Compatibility Check and let you know how I get on and the results.</p>

<h2>            Sound Dropout on Windows Media Player</h2>
                    
<p>When watching video clips (from library) on Windows Media&nbsp;Player the sound drops out after a minute or two. If I play the videos on my J.River Media Center or Windows Media Center the sound is just fine.</p>
<p>Any ideas on how I can fix it?</p>

<p>Hi Halima,</p>
<p>I went to Media Player&gt; Tools&gt; Options&gt; Speakers&gt; Advanced&gt; Changed setting from Default to S/PDIF Pass Through Device and this has fixed the problem. I find it strange because the&nbsp; S/PDIF Pass Through Device is the default device. Anyway the mystery seems
 to be solved...Thanks</p>

 the random ads would play! So I went into volume mixer and found 2 entries that said "Name Could Not Be Found", which lead me to dig into the task manager. I found a memory and CPU hog on the top called "WindowsFormApplication1" and traced it down to my programs
 directory. The weird thing is the .exe was called "pleasant" and the description also that, and the original folder was called "naive". I went into my programs and found two more folder, "naughty" and "animated" and open the folders to find random files. So
 I took immediate action and stopped the processes and deleted the files. I would be more clear but frankly I deleted the files and can't remember anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hi, every few days I am experiencing a blue screen of death. It happens once I log on and the desktop appears, then I get BSOD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the BSOD I get:</p>
<p>A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage<br />
to your computer.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be caused by the following file: fltmgr.sys</p>
<p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen,<br />
restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow<br />
these steps:</p>
<p>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed.<br />
If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer<br />
for any Windows updates you might need.</p>
<p>If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware<br />
or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.<br />
If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart<br />
your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then<br />
select Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Technical Information:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x0000003b (0x00000000c0000005, 0xfffff880010b4777, 0xfffff8800d6df8f0,
<br />
0x0000000000000000)</p>
<p>*** fltmgr.sys - Address 0xfffff880010b4777 base at 0xfffff880010b3000 DateStamp
<br />
0x4ce7929c<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried running a check disk and that came back no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems to be an issue regarding the filename ACPI.sys, fltmgr.sys and ntoskrnl.exe
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
*If the files are too large please upload them to a file sharing service like "Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />

    <title>Can I install games and programs in Local Disk D&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aid12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I install games and programs in Local Disk D&#63;</h2>
                    Hey,
<div>I was wondering if it was safe to install programs and games in Local Disk D? The drive I am&nbsp;currently&nbsp;using is Local Disk C which has windows and all my games and programs installed on.</div>
<div>My Local Disk C has 178GB of space but Local Disk D claims to have 267GB of free space. What I want to do is uninstall my big games and&nbsp;re install&nbsp;them into Local Disk D where I have lots more room.</div>
<div>I just wanted to make sure that this was safe and I would be able to uninstall anything I installed in Local Disk D?</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>EDIT: I used a program called EaseUS partition manager to delete Local Disk D and then move all the free space from Local Disk D onto Local Disk C.&nbsp;</b></div>

            used EaseUS too.I didn't delete drive D, i reduced its space:
<p>- in EaseUS select D</p>
<p>- choose Resize/Move partition </p>
<p>-resize D to the needed size with cursor sliding</p>
<p>-ok</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then click on drive C. Choose Resize/Move and take that empty spase you've just got from drive D. Done! Restart comp.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I ve got&nbsp; extra 100 gb for drive C</p>

<p>Thanks for the update. Based on your response, I would not recommend downloading updates using mobile data. It's best to download and install updates on a Wifi or Ethernet connection since it's more stable and there are less chances that your download will
 get corrupted.</p>

                    I cannot view pdf files from Preview Pane &nbsp;in Windows 8. &nbsp; I just upgraded from Vista, where it always worked on my system. &nbsp; Now, when I click on a pdf file, the Preview Pane has a message that says "this file can't be previewed." &nbsp; In addition, I can't
 view pdf attachments in Outlook (I'm using Office 2010) like I could in Vista. &nbsp;I get a message that says "this file cannot be previewed because of an error with the following previewer: PDF Preview Handler for Vista." &nbsp;The Preview Pane and Outlook previewer
 are working with Office programs and text files.

            <p>If you got Adobe reader installed (Adobe Reader XI is what I got). You need to confirm Adobe reader as the "Default PDF Handler" for WIndows 8.</p>
<p>This is what I have done to view the PDF content in the preview panel.</p>
<p>1/. Open up Adobe Reader XI</p>
<p>2/. Go to Edit-&gt;Preferences</p>
<p>3/. In the Preference windows, select "General" Categories on the left panel.</p>
<p>4/. Click on "Select Default PDF Handler" near the bottom.</p>
<p>5/. Click "Yes" when the "User Account Control" dialogue box pops up.</p>
<p>6/. Click "OK" when you are back in the Preference windows.</p>
<p>7/. Close the Adobe Reader XI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now you should able to view PDF in the preview panel.</p>

<h2>            After update, Synaptics Touchpad keeps crashing</h2>
                    I just installed the "Synaptics - Input - Synaptics PS/2 Port TouchPad" update. In its description, it says it was an update released in August 2008. After installing that update (and restarting my computer), Synaptics crashes every time it loads.

            <p>Was the update from Microsoft Update or Synaptics?</p>
<p>It is strange that the update is still there if you updated to a restore point before the update was applied.</p>
<p>I would uninstall the Synaptics software and reinstall, preferable from their site.</p>

    <title>&#34;Play-to&#34; network device keeps repeating same song - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tavarino  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Play-to&#34; network device keeps repeating same song</h2>
                    
<p>When I move a group of songs to the play area on the right-hand panel and select the "play-to" drop-down item, my DLNA compatible AV controller appears. When I select it, a new window opens, and the first song on the list begins playing on the AV device.
 Fine.</p>
<p>The problem is that song just keeps repeating. It doesn't matter whether the "repeat" control is turned on or off. I can click on any song in the list and it happily plays that song - over and over and over :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I select a saved playlist from the DLNA client, it plays just fine and doesn't repeat. Unfortunately, I want to control the device from WMP, not from the panel of the DLNA client.</p>
<p>Help appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I'm assuming that there will be no problems with the current drivers because they (obviously?) are Windows 10 compatible.&nbsp; Or, am I missing something?&nbsp; That's what I need to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done a clean install of Windows 10 before on a Toshiba Satellite, which turned out to be a nightmare with the drivers.</p>
<p>

            What I would do is first try backing up the driver store.  
<br />
<br />navigate to C:\Windows\System32\DriverStore then make a backup copy of the FileRepository folder. 
<br />
<br />After doing that, proceed to perform a clean install:
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<br />
<br />Yes, If you are currently running Windows 10 and you do a clean install you should have no problems with the drivers.
<br />What I suggest is after a clean install, install HP Support assistant that would automatically install all the drivers.
<br />Here is the driver page, if needed:

            Hi Fred,
<br />
<br />First thing to do is make sure Windows 10 is activated, to avoid activation issues after a clean install
<br />
<br />Then clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />A full set of drivers will be available to download from this page, so drivers will not be a problem:

<p>The install went without a hiccup.&nbsp; The install was almost seamless.&nbsp; I have done a clean install before so setting the EUFI to start on the USB was easy.&nbsp; But having that backup gave me a little more peace of mind.</p>

</p><p>I would like to use the HP Support assistant so that I can get updates about two attacks that have surfaced on Intel cpu's.&nbsp; Could there be a conflict between HP and MS/Intel drivers -- you know, Windows 10 could load drivers when they're updated, and then

    <title>Surface Book Yellowing Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> birdzo2k2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Yellowing Screen</h2>
                    So I opened my surface book and noted this yellowing on the screen. I am now out of warranty &nbsp;(expired 12/29/16) and I purchased it brand new from Best Buy. Is there any way they'll replace this as it seems from what I've seen it's a hardware issue? I
 feel slighted seeing as I purchased their premium product only to have this issue. I barely use the laptop but for $1500+tax, I feel like this shouldn't happen.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Backup - Not Removing Old Files</h2>
                    <p>My company&nbsp;runs about&nbsp;20 workstations&nbsp;on Windows 10, each is running version 1607.&nbsp; We activated the Backup feature&nbsp;configured in Settings (from&nbsp;the start button not the Control&nbsp;Panel).&nbsp; We set "Back up my files"&nbsp;to run every 3 hours and set "Keep my backups"
 to 1 month.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We expected Windows 10 Backup to remove&nbsp;file history older than&nbsp;one month but at least leave one recent copy of each backed up file regardless if it was older than&nbsp;one month.&nbsp; We are backing up to a NAS device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Backup has been successfully operating for more than one month but is not removing backup file history&nbsp;older than&nbsp;one month.&nbsp; Is there a problem with the "Keep my backup" option?</p>

<h2>             what to do if my &#34;System volume on disk is corrupt&#34; &#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>When i boot my vista machine i get two options, Repair and Run windows, Repair option cannot repair the problem and in the log file
 it says "System volume on disk is corrupt". I am able to access the hard drive through command prompt.&nbsp; i don’t see any obvious problem. I looked at ntbtlog.txt, it says it cannot load around half of the drivers (mostly *.inf). I have the OEM reintall disk.
 What&nbsp; other option do i have , other than reinstalling.</span></p>

            I took the hard drive out of the PC. Used my Laptop&nbsp;to connected the external hard drive docking station. Then connected the PC hardisk to the docking station and was able to transfer the data. I was a bit lucky, after i transfered the data the harddisk
 was fully gone. Not sure if this will work for you.

<p><span>Go to Command prompt.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 We may be able to replace the corrupted fules without needing to re-install the system (which is equivalent to a clean boot) as long as there aren't too many - and that's unfortunately very likely if it's saying the volume is corrupt.&nbsp; In fact, you may need
 a new hard drive.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.&nbsp; I'd bet it finds some corrupt sectors.</span></p>
<br />
Can you get into safe made (by clicking continuously on the F8 button while booting and then selecting safe mode with networking)?&nbsp; If so,
<span>
then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:

<p><span><br />
Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers, do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates
 from Windows Update as follows: </span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
</span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.</span></p>
<br />
</span>If it comes to a clean boot, y<span>ou can use Knoppix
</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way like with safe mode) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the
 Recovery Disk with the Recovery Partition or the OEM Reinstallation Disk (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Make sure you backup your important data first because you will lose everything on the partition during this process (unless
 the OEM installation disk allows for repairs/upgrades which you should try first if available).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly over
 100 updates pending,...<br />
<br />
Good luck and I hope this helps - but you may need to buy a new hard drive and you may need to do a clean re-installation (we'll see from these procedures).</span>
