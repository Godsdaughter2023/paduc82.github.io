<h2>            My Xbox will not turn on.</h2>
                    
<p>I have had my Xbox 360s for about 10 months, and I have never had a problem with it. But I tried playing it yesterday, and it will not work. Every now and then it just starts making the turn on sound and last night i got it to come on, but it would not open
 the disc drive or connect a controller. Please help me, any advice is welcome.</p>

<p>What color is the light on the power adapter? Also try pluging the console in a different power outlet. Make sure that all plugs (Av cable, Power cables) to the xbox are pluged in. The power cable connects to the wall then to the power brick then to the
 console. make sure all these are pluged in all the way and that there is nothing loose</p>

    <title>Getting Plus Signs in Search Text boxes that I did not type - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting Plus Signs in Search Text boxes that I did not type</h2>
                    After a reinstall (clean with format) When Windows 7 boots, all of the search text boxes fill with + signs. I have to delete all of them to get a menu in Start. Google does the same thing on startup. Once the +signs are deleted the system works perfect.
 &nbsp;I have already gone into msconfig and done a clean startup. Even with all start up programs disabled it did not help. I get the + signs even in safe mode. Any help would be appreciated. I have a Compaq 2.8 mh with 3 g of Ram and a 350 G hard drive and a 2
 T desktop drive.

<p>Could a hardware issue cause that?&nbsp; I don't know exactly what they are referring to in terms of the "search text boxes", but my guess would be a setting somewhere.</p>

            Steve,
<div><br />
<div>When I read this posting my first thought was exactly as Shawn's: hardware issue. Specifically, the keyboard. I have seen many times before keys getting stuck on the keyboard so slightly that you don't notice. Also if a liquid was spilled on the keyboard,
 it could cause such a behavior (it has happened to me). I would ask if that situation only happens on the search text boxes (which by the way is a correct term in the Windows lingo). &nbsp;If this also happens on a program like notepad, then for sure is a faulty
 keyboard. Better yet, if Shawn's suggestion works, we know that it is indeed a keyboard problem. I think that Shawn's first thought, should be the way to troubleshoot the issue. If that doesn't resolve the issue, then and only then, look for a different approach
 to solve it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards.</div>

            <p>I still don't understand what is meant by the "search text boxes".&nbsp; If its a search issue, you can go to Control Panel | Programs and Features and on the left choose turn Windows Features on and off and then you can uncheck Windows Search (and Indexing Service
 if its checked) to disable it and then reboot.&nbsp; That may or may not affect the issue.&nbsp; You can also change indexed parameters via Control Panel | Indexing Options if you leave Search enabled.</p>

            Save a database file to a SharePoint document library
<p>This method is a convenient way to manage access to a database. You can save a database to any SharePoint document library. This lets you integrate the management of Access database files with the rest of your documents and business information.
</p>
<p>Note Publishing a database to a SharePoint site is available only for database files that are saved in the Office Access 2007 format.</p>
<p>For example, if your SharePoint site contains lists that track customer service issues and store employee information, you can create a database in Access as a front end for those lists. You can build Access queries to analyze those issues and Access reports
 to format and publish written reports for a team status meeting. If people have Access on their computers, you can make the Access queries and reports become available on the View menu for the SharePoint list. When people view the list on the SharePoint site,
 they can locate and open the queries, reports, and other Access objects by clicking the View menu. If people don't have Access, they can still use the data in the lists by using SharePoint views.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the database that you want to share. </li><li>Click the File tab, and then click Share. </li><li>Under Save Database As, in the Advanced section, click SharePoint. </li><li>In the Save to SharePoint dialog box, browse to the document library that you want to use.
</li><li>Review the database file name and database file type, make any necessary changes, and then click Save.</li></ol>
Move your data to SharePoint lists and link to them
<p>With this method, each user can modify her own copy of the database, because the data is shared via the SharePoint site. Although you do not gain the same benefits as when you publish the database to a SharePoint site, you do gain the convenience of centrally
 located data. This method has the same benefits as using a split database. In addition, because the data is in SharePoint lists, you can make it separately available over the network by using SharePoint features.</p>
<p>This method has three main steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Move the data to SharePoint lists. </li><li>Create links to those lists. </li><li>Distribute the database file.</li></ol>
<p>You can use the Move to SharePoint Site Wizard to accomplish the first two steps, and any means at your disposal to accomplish the last step.</p>
Use the Export Tables to SharePoint Wizard
<ol>
<li>On the Database Tools tab, in the Move Data group, click SharePoint.
<p>Note This option is available only if your database is saved in the .accdb file format.</p>
</li><li>Follow the steps in the Export Tables to SharePoint Wizard, including specifying the location of your SharePoint site.
<p>To cancel the process, click Stop.</p>
</li><li>On the last page of the wizard, select the Show Details check box to see more details about the migration.
<p>This wizard page describes which tables have been linked to lists and provides information about a backup location and the URL for your database. It also provides a warning if some migration issues were encountered and provides the location of a log table
 where you can see more details about the issues.</p>
</li><li>Click Finish when the wizard completes its actions. </li></ol>
<p>Note To view your lists on the SharePoint site, click Lists on the Quick Launch, or click View All Site Content. You may need to refresh the page in your Web browser. To make your lists appear on the Quick Launch on the SharePoint site or to change other
 settings, such as enable versions to be tracked, you can change the list settings on the SharePoint site. For more information, see Help on the SharePoint site.</p>

<h2>            wireless printer prints from one computer but not from the other</h2>
                    We have a wireless printer (HP5740) and two laptops using windows 10. Until now both computers were able to print. Now there is no printer response when one of the computers tries to print. Although the printer queue does have document in its list. But
 nothing happens.

            Hi Kusha, in version 1803 of Windows 10 Microsoft for some reason removed the Homegroup functionality, please try this:
<br />
<br />If you have a problem seeing each PC in the Network Section in File Explorer:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the 'Function Discovery Resource Publication' service
<br />
<br />Double-click that and set its startup type to Automatic
<br />
<br />Then Start that service
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you get a Network Credentials popup, you should be able to turn off that requirement . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel 
<br />
<br />Go to Network and Sharing Center 
<br />
<br />Select Change advanced sharing settings in the left pane 
<br />
<br />Expand the network you want to disable password protected sharing on by clicking the down arrow on the right of the profile
<br />
<br />Select 'Turn off password protected sharing' and then click Save changes.

            <p>Brian, </p>
<p>Sorry for not replying earlier. was busy on weekend. I fear my tardiess was responsible for your switch back to AVG.&nbsp;In comparisom to MSE I find it to be a resource hog, just replaced AVG with MSE&nbsp;on a relatives machine on last week and the performance increase
 was quite noticeable.</p>
<p>You indicated you Zone Alarm previously installed and also that you had uninstalled it using the proper removal tool. Did you by anychance check the
<strong>info </strong>link from the <em>Security Software Uninstallers list? </em>
There are to reasons I bring this up. Firstly additional steps are required for complete removal even after using the tool and secondly MSE installation does not always do well with Zone Alarm particularly if remnants exist.</p>

</strong><a href="http://forum.theispguide.com/isp-ftopic1024.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.theispguide.com/isp-ftopic1024.html</a></p>

<p><strong>Zone Alarm and Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
</strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/zone-alarm-security-essentials-conflict/24f6f65a-0950-496c-b276-2c16151c4b4a">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_start/zone-alarm-security-essentials-conflict/24f6f65a-0950-496c-b276-2c16151c4b4a</a></p>
<p>Irregardless of whether you may consider giving MSE another try, which I hope you will, you should consider doing a search for left over ZA files as mentioned in the first two links.</p>
<p>I have a question about one of the statements you made in a previos post-<em>Restarted computer and icon has disappeared again even after ending the Processes.
</em>After ending the <strong>msseces.exe </strong>and <strong>MsMpEng.exe </strong>
did you restart MSE using the MSE entry&nbsp;in the All Programs list?&nbsp;Ironically enough I lost my notification area icon yesterday on a reboot after installing an optional update for .NET framework 4.0(KB253523)but after following the same procedureI outlined the
 icon reappeared.</p>
<p>Also you mentioned that the AVG icon is slow to appear. This suggests several things. Perhaps you have more startup programs and services than necessary causing interference resulting in&nbsp; bottlenecking. In other words, too much competition forresouces on
 a low resouce(RAM)computer and not enough time for everything to be properly loaded.
</p>
<p>Paring down your startup programs and adjusting startup types for services will generally results in faster&nbsp;boot times and overall performance. To determine where you can make cuts refer to the following:</p>
<p><strong>Black Viper Windows XP x86 Service Pack 3 Configuration<br />

</strong><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/startups/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/startups/</a></p>
<p>To adjust startup use <strong>msconfig </strong>and for sevrvices type <strong>
services.msc </strong>in the <strong>Start&gt;Run&gt;Open: </strong>box, click entry once for start/stopping, click entry twice to change startup types.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option for managing startups is using the program <strong>Autoruns.</strong></p>

<p>There could be some icon caching issues as well. I suggest the follwing:</p>

<p><br />
Navigate to C:\Documents and Settings|&lt;user name&gt;\Local Settings|Application Data and delete the file

<p>Finally <strong>defrag</strong> and do a <strong>chkdsk </strong>at startup.If you don't aready have youmight consider

<p>Edit:You had not mentioned <strong>AVG </strong>as previously install. Did you use the specific removal utility for that before installing MSE? I just found refernce to your problem being associated with remnants of AVG.</p>

            <p>Hello again Brian,</p>
<p>It probably goes without saying but, *no antimalware/antivirus program is 100% effective in protecting you and your computer*. Security software aside the best protection depends on
<strong>US</strong>, meaning you and I and our individual &nbsp;usage. There are actually some who go without security software, updating or having native security features enabled that never had any malware issues. Some would call this dumb luck although it's obviuos
 they were doing something right.The current threat landscape being such as it is probably means any luck involved may soon run out.</p>
<p>The AVG Link Scanner is something that MSE does not have as it adds little in the way of actual protection and only needlessly increases the resource usage. It's simply a site reputation rating system based on past user experience and I suspect draws from
 a smaller database than a similar browser add-on such as <strong>WOT(Web of Trust)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Web of Trust<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.mywot.com/en/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mywot.com/en/download</a></p>
<p>Resident Shield refers to <strong>real-time protection </strong>which MSE provides. MSE does not have a dedicated Email but does scan all attachments. See the following:</p>
<p><strong>Does MSE Scan E-Mail?<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/does-mse-scan-e-mail/2b9dd412-1116-4d28-84bb-ebeab5d28ced">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/forum/protect_scanning/does-mse-scan-e-mail/2b9dd412-1116-4d28-84bb-ebeab5d28ced</a></strong></p>
<p>Keep in mind that since we're talking about <strong>Windows™ Xp </strong>and <strong>
Internet Explorer 8 </strong>MSE does not include<strong> Network Inspection System</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;nor does the same level of integration exists as with
<strong>Vista/Windows 7 </strong>and <strong>IE 9. </strong>That unfortunately is a fact&nbsp;of product lifecycle. That being said recent tests have shown IE&nbsp;8 to quite capable of protecting against &nbsp;th most common socially engineered malware.</p>
<p><strong>Tests Show IE9 Tops in Blocking Web Malware(also includes IE 8 results)<br />
</strong><a href="http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/apple/283405-tests-show-ie9-tops-in-blocking-web-malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://securitywatch.pcmag.com/apple/283405-tests-show-ie9-tops-in-blocking-web-malware</a></p>
<p>Generally a layered approach(additional security related software)ensuring that updates are done and practising safe surfing&nbsp; and computer usage are best pratices.&nbsp;Along with MSE I use&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>WinPatrol, Spyware Blaster, ERUNT</strong>(daily registry backup)
 and <strong>Qualy's BrowserCheck </strong>to ensure <strong>third party(Adobe products, Java, etc.)</strong>&nbsp;add-ons/plug-ins are up to date.I also use
<strong>Malwarebytes Antimalware </strong>and <strong>ESET Online scanner</strong> for second opinion on-demand scanning.</p>

<h2>            Accidentally created a dual boot situation and can&#39;t remove it.</h2>
                    When reinstalling Windows 7 using my cd drive, I accidentally installed it in partition 2. &nbsp;The previous version was installed on partition 3. &nbsp;Now every time Iturn on the computer it asks which one I want to run. &nbsp;It is eating hard drive space, but won't
 come off when I try to remove old versions on the control panel. &nbsp;How do I get rid of the duplicate? &nbsp;I have backed up all my files.

            <div>Hi, </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Yes, we could delete one among the dual operating system. Before that, I need to know whether you have two drives or one?
<div>How to Delete a Operating System Listed in Windows Boot Manager in Windows 7</div>
<div><br />
1. Open the<strong> Start </strong>Menu, type <strong>msconfig </strong>in the search line, and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. </div>
<div><br />
2. Click on the <strong>Boot </strong>tab.</div>
<div><br />
3. Select the <strong>operating system </strong>you want to delete that is not set as the Default OS, and click on
<strong>Delete</strong>. </div>
<div>NOTE: If the Operating System you want to delete from the list is the Default Operating System, then you will need to change the default operating system to another listed Operating System first. Let us know if this is the case.
<div>4. Check the <strong>Make all boot settings permanent </strong>box, and click on
<strong>OK</strong>. </div>
<div><br />
5. Click on <strong>Yes </strong>to confirm. </div>
<div><br />
6. Click on the <strong>Restart </strong>button. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also, I would suggest you to post a screenshot of the Disk Management to get more information.

            <p>Click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Manage</p>
<p>Expand Disk Management</p>
<p>Select the partition where the unwanted installation of Windows 7 exist. </p>
<p>Right click it, click 'Format'</p>
<p>You will receive a Warning dialog, click OK to continue.</p>
<p>The next step is to select your file system option, in this case, go with the default which is NTFS.</p>
<p>The formatting process will now begin.</p>
<p>Once complete, the drive will be displayed as a ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management.</p>
<p>Right click the ‘Logical Drive’ in Disk Management, on the contextual menu, click the ‘Delete Volume’ option. Click ‘Yes’ when the warning dialog appears.</p>
<p>The Volume you deleted will now appear as ‘Free space’, you will also notice that the disk icon no longer appears in the list of volumes.</p>
<p>Right click the Free space partition, and click Delete, click Yes on the Disk Management warning that appears.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>The volume will now appear as Unallocated. (good stuff). Our next step is to merge back that unallocated free space with the system partition. Right click the System volume and click the ‘Extend Volume’ option on the contextual menu, click ‘Yes’ when the
 warning appears.</p>
<p>A wizard will now begin that will guide through the steps to merge back the unallocated space with your system partition.</p>
<p>The wizard provides a simple procedure to merge back the unallocated space with the system drive. Once you have selected the space, click Next, at the end of the wizard, you will see the amount allocated.</p>

<p>Removing the boot entry:</p>

<p>Click Start, type: msconfig</p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard</p>
<p>Go to the Boot tab</p>
<p>Select the Entry you want to Delete</p>

<p>Then set the Time out to '0' </p>
<p>Then click Apply and OK</p>
<p>Restart if prompted.</p>

<p>Uncheck the 'Time to display list of operating systems'</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Then Apply and OK</p>
<p>---------------</p>
<p>If that still does not work, try the following:</p>
<p>EasyBCD by NeoSmart Technologies would be your answer, it provides a graphical front end to the BCDEdit Command line that makes it easy for you to define start-up settings and edit boot entries on the new Windows boot manager.

<h2>            Monitoring scheduled tasks</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking for a way to monitor tasks that are scheduled in a remote server.&nbsp; The tasks run every 2-5 minutes (depending on the task) and are scheduled using Windows Scheduled Tasks.&nbsp; The problem I'm having is that is one of these tasks "hangs" we find
 out after it starts impacting business users.&nbsp; I would like to find a way to get an email when this happens to find out there's an issue before it starts impacting the business users.</p>
<p>Is anyone aware of a tool or utility I could use to accomplish this?</p>

            <p>Yes, the Surface is in direct sun light.&nbsp; For the Power plan, auto screen brightness is OFF, battery power SLEEP after 10 minutes, plugged in SLEEP after 30 minutes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I do get the Surface is too hot Icon when I try to restart it after it goes blank.&nbsp;

            The dump file you poster blamed Frocrusite USB driver. If you have an audio device related to it connected through USB, its driver is at fault.
<br />Remove the driver completely:

<p>Hi Sumit,</p>

</p><p>I just performed all the actions you recommended. I followed the guidelines of Focusrite as to how to perform the installation of their driver. It was still the same driver though. Maybe my former installation got somehow corrupted.</p>

<h2>            Manual downgrade from Windows 7 Enterprise Edition to Windows 7 Professional Edition</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I installed and activated Windows 7 Enterprise Edition (32-bit). Can I disable all features that relevant to Enterprise Edition and that don't exist in Windows 7 Professional Edition (see<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7_editions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7_editions</a>):</p>

BranchCache Distributed Cache<br />
DirectAccess<br />
Subsystem for Unix-based Applications<br />
Multilingual User Interface Pack<br />
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) Enhancements<br />
Virtual Hard Disk Booting</p>
<p>If there is a possibility to disable these features,&nbsp;then I want to know:<br />
Does Windows 7 Enterprise Edition without these features equal to the clean installation of Windows 7 Professional Edition?</p>

Hi JS,</p>
<p>Now I'm not sure if I need all additional features of Windows 7 Enterprise Edition, and I need time to check it.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Enterprise Edition license, but I don't want to have on my computer features (=&gt; more system files, disk spaces, registry compexity =&gt; low performance) that I don't use.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of those features have any impact on your system, even if you are connected to a Windows Server 2008 R2 domain, they have to be configured by the Administrator. A lot of the features are server side based. All editions of Windows 7 use the same base
 requirements. Windows 7 Enterprise is expected to use the same requirements as a computer running Windows 7 Home Premium, even if it had the unique capabilities enabled.</p>
<p>There is no more disk space or registry complexity because Windows 7 Enterprise.</p>

<p>You don't need to have both Windows 7 Enterprise and Professional installed unless you are targetting a specific component unique to a particular edition, such as BitLocker or Direct Access. All you would need is a couple VM's with 32 and 64 bit Windows
 7 Professional or Enterprise. Both Enterprise and Professional are based on the same core. So any application that works on Professional or Enterprise will work on any edition of the OS.</p>
<p>You cannot use OEM, MSDN-AA or Volume license keys (MAK or KMS) with Anytime Upgrade. If you would like to upgrade to Windows 7 Enterprise from Professional, you can simply use a standard in place upgrade procedure.</p>

<h2>            What Should I do to Improve Performance of my PC</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my machine has the following specs and I'm hoping someone here would give me recommendations for improving the GENERAL performance of my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>RAM: 4 GB</p>
<p>Graphics card: Intel G45/G43 Express Chipset</p>
<p>Processor: Pentium Dual-Core E5700 @ 3 GHz</p>
<p>Motherboard: &nbsp;Dell 018D1Y A00</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I was thinking of increasing my RAM to 8 GB since not much more of this machine is customizable, at least not easily I don't think. Do you think this is a good way to go?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or should I just get a new machine?</p>

            <p>To upgrade to 8GB you would need 64bit Windows if not already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the chipset is 8 years old, the CPU 6. Perfectly functional for basic computing tasks but a bit long in the tooth for modern solutions. It depends on where you see performance issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest bang for buck has to be replacing the HDD with an SSD. If you are at Windows 10 following an upgrade then couple that with a clean install of the operating system. The drive could at least be transferred to another computer. Some performance
 increase could be achieved by installing a discrete graphics card to offload the CPU but the effect is limited and graphics chips go out of date fairly quickly.</p>

            <p>Thank you! I do have 64 GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see performance issues when the computer loads up and when I load programs mainly...and when I run them. I assume running them is RAM. The other things improve a bit when I make sure to defrag and cleanup and remove start up programs. I imagine those are
 related to the old CPU and chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interesting idea about SSD, I'll look into that. Thanks again!</p>

            <p>All of these could be down to how clean the system is overall but do not be tempted by the speed up tools you see advertised, the risks they pose far outweigh any slight benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If as I said the system was an upgrade consider a clean install, could be a lot of work but almost always worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SSD definitely helps booting, it reduced mine by more than half.</p>

    <title>Windows 7&#47;10 upgrade and downgrade failure - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7&#47;10 upgrade and downgrade failure</h2>
                    <p>Lenovo Z580 laptop</p>
<p>factory installed windows 7 Home Premium</p>
<p>
</p><p>My buddy clicked on the upgrade free button to get his PC to Win10. &nbsp;After upgrade it failed to activate -
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Error code: 0xC004C003. &nbsp;After trying a few things over teamviewer it just seemed like it would be better to revert to 7 and try again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Well - after reverting to 7 it won't boot properly. &nbsp;It rarely boots all the way to the login page and once it does it errors out on: this application failed to start because side-by-side-configuration is incorrect. &nbsp;Then after you click okay - you are left
 with a black screen and a white arrow and nothing else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>He now shipped the PC to me and it is at my desk. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using my Win7 Home Premium CD and clicking repair I get "This version of System Recovery Options is not compatible with the version of Windows you are trying to repair." &nbsp;I tried both my 32 and 64 bit disks just in case. &nbsp;Same error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booting the Hard drive and clicking Startup repair says "No solution found" or sometimes it just runs on for hours...</p>
<p>
</p><p>System restore&nbsp;says "No restore points have been created".</p>
<p>
</p><p>System image recovery says - cannot find a system image on this computer.<br />
</p>
<p>Safe boot hangs up on "Loaded: \windows classpnp.sys &nbsp;sometimes and sometimes just goes past that to a black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to have 4 partitions on the hard drive:</p>
<p>C: SYSTEM_DRV = 158MB free of 199MB</p>
<p>D: Windows7_OS = 763 GB free of 886 GB</p>
<p>E: LENOVO = 21 GB free of 25.4 GB</p>
<p>X: Boot = 28.9 MB free of 31.3 MB</p>
<p>
</p><p>And F: = CD Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have booted the pc in linux. &nbsp;I plan to copy all the personal photos and info to an external drive and then wipe and reinstall - unless there are some good things I should try that might save time and trouble?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues with Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to take all your backup, once you have taken backup of your data, you may do a factory restore using the restore Lenovo partition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists then you may re-install Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Okay - the Lenovo one touch restore doesn't seem to work either. &nbsp; It just locks up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using a Linux boot cd - I backed up all the pictures and documents etc.</p>
<p>So I plan to reinstall now from Windows 7 DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will I have issues using my DVD's that I purchased for "Upgrade"? &nbsp;Specifically I have the Windows 7 Home Premium Family Pack 3x - "Upgrade designed for Windows Vista". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it activate if I just type in the license number from the bottom of the laptop? &nbsp;The sticker reads "Windows 7 Home Prem OA".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my DVD won't work - can you direct me to the proper download for the installation media that will activate from the key on the sticker?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>WAN</p>

            <p>Latest wrinkle - I thought I would just try with the disk I have so I started a reinstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I get anywhere it says "Windows cannot be installed to Disk 0 Partition 2"</p>
<p>"Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. &nbsp;On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows cannot be installed to this disk. &nbsp;This computer's hardware may not support booting this disk. &nbsp;Ensure that the disk's controller is enabled in the computer's BIOS menu."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that I can boot to linux and reformat the drive - but is that the right answer?</p>

            <p>Okay - Well - for those that find this and have the same troubles:</p>
<p>I did boot to linux delete all partitions.</p>
<p>Then booted to my Windows 7 upgrade disc. &nbsp;Did a clean install. &nbsp;When I got to the hard drive - I had to "Add" a new partition which it defaulted to adding 3 partitions - a boot, user and something... but that got me through the "May not support booting
 this disk" error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose not to activate during the install process (I read that if you click yes that sometimes it has problems)</p>
<p>Then after it was up and running I clicked activate online and typed in the key from the sticker and it activated quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>Hello (Vicki),</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see why you're concerned. I would be happy to help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're pertaining to account deletion, yes,&nbsp;it may affect your Outlook account. If you've linked your Skype and Outlook accounts or you're using the&nbsp;Outlook account to log in to Skype, deleting your Skype account will also delete the Outlook account.
 This is due to the full migration of Skype to Microsoft and one credentials to all Microsoft products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are pertaining to cancelling just the active recurring payment for your subscription, it will not affect your Outlook account. Cancelling the recurring payment will only affect the auto renewal or future payment for your subscription.
</p>
<p>To know more about cancelling subscription, you may refer to this link: <a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1881/how-do-i-cancel-or-change-my-skype-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I cancel or change my Skype subscription?</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps but if you have questions and clarifications, please do not hesitate to reply back.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Do you remember any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?</div>
<div>2. Was it working fine earlier?</div>
<div>3. Did Windows 7 come pre-installed?</div>
<div>4. Did you custom or clean install Windows 7?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Try resetting Windows Update components and check if the issue persists.</div>

<h2>            &#34;Boot Device Not Found Please Install operating system on hard drive&#34; after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>After the latest Windows 10 update when I turn on my computer I get a black screen with<br />
"Boot Device Not Found Please install and operating system on your hard disk Hard Disk (3F0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done all the suggested procedures suggested by HP and nothing works (checked the hard drive both quick check and full check for errors -
<br />
none found; reset BIOS to factory default, hard reset by removing battery etc.. nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't get Windows to load,so I can't get to system reset, system recovery or system restore.</p>
<p>My laptop, an HP Envy M7 Notebook didn't come with a Recovery Disk nor a Windows 10 disk. I know my laptop<br />
came with Windows 8.1 installed and I did the free upgrade to&nbsp; Windows 10. After the last Windows 10 Update<br />
I cannot log into my laptop, Windows 10 isn't loading, can't get anywhere near my Desktop screen, just get a black</p>
<p>screen with the message "boot device not found/ please install operating system on your hard disk (3F0)"</p>
<p>message and have googled to try to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss. Money is tight because I have been unemployed for a year and a half so this couldn't happen<br />
at a worse time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best sounding solution I was able to find was to make a Media Creation Tool on a DVD. Alas under
<br />
Repair Your Computer none of the Troubleshooting options work:<br />
- System Restore - gives me an error "to use system restore you must specify which Windows installation to restore.<br />
Restart this computer select operating system then select System Restore (Alas I don't get a list of operating systems.<br />
- Go Back to Previous Version - When I click go back to Previous Version it says "we ran into a problem and won't<br />
be able to take you back to Previous Version of Windows. Try resetting your PC.<br />
- System Image Recovery - it says "Windows could not find System Image on this computer."<br />
- Start Up Repair - it says,"start up couldn't repair your PC"<br />
- Command Prompt - says "not enough memory resources are available to process this command."<br />
- UEFI Firmware Setting - restarted computer no improvement.<br />
<br />
I was scared to click Install Now (which is the only other option available on the Media Creation
<br />
Tool DVD I made) but a member on another board forum told me this would fix my problem so I did.<br />
<br />
I clicked Install Now and wait while setup is starting. A window opens that says Activate Windows. Since<br />
this isn't the first time I installed Windows (I did the free upgrade from Microsoft from Windows 8.1)<br />
I clicked I don't have a product key. The next Windows setup window that opens asks me to select the<br />
operating system I wish to install. These,are the choices listed:<br />
Windows 10 Home<br />
Windows 10 N<br />
Windows 10 Home Single Language<br />
Windows 10 Education<br />
Windows 10 Education N<br />
Windows 10 Pro<br />
Windows 10 Pro N<br />
<br />
All of the windows options listed say X64 and date modified 4/12/18 (the day the windows upgrade screwed<br />
up my laptop.) Pretty sure my laptop is 64Bit.<br />
<br />
Which one do I choose since I upgraded from the Microsoft Windows site to get the free Windows 10 upgrade.<br />
I know there's supposed to be somewhere on my BIOS where I can see the product key but I'm confused since the install<br />
said I only needed to enter it if this is the first time I'm installing Windows on my computer.<br />
<br />
When I chose Windows 10 Home&nbsp; it said "the installation was cancelled. Windows cannot find the Microsoft License Terms. Make sure the installation sources are valid and restart the installation" (same error when I tried Windows 10 N and Windows 10 Home Single
 Language.)<br />
<br />
I was really hoping this option would work but I just got yet another error message.<br />
<br />
Another forum member told me to do this:<br />
<br />
"Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button<br />
for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down<br />
<br />
Do this twice<br />
<br />
On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can
<br />
access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.<br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC<br />
Choose to keep your files and apps<br />
Then start the Reset"<br />
<br />
I wish I got the spinning dots so I could try this but I don't.<br />
<br />
Would it be better to buy a full install disk of Windows 10 and does that come with any repair features? Does it have an option<br />
to save my personal files? Like I said money is tight but if it's the better option I'll bite the bullet.<br />
<br />
I've tried to be as descriptive as possible so you guys can help me. I won't proceed til I get responses<br />
from you guys. I've been at this for 3 days and I'm fried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I even try installing the Media Creation Tool onto a USB? Do you think that would make any difference or am I just spinning my
</p>
<p>wheels?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a copy of my personal files as of 6 months ago but would love to have my personal files to date.<br />

            Use this alternative method:
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />

<p>Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much. I was able to reinstall Windows and get my HP Envy laptop working again. Now my only problem is trying to recover my personal files since nothing appears, well, at least not that I am able to see/find, on the Windows.old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you recommend a recovery software for me to use to recover personal files (Microsoft Office, mp3 and photo files? I would love to be able to get access to my old applications, especially the bookmarks file for Mozilla Firefox since I had a large number
 of sorted bookmarks saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the software programs I'm considering is Stellar Phoenix Windows Recovery Professional edition. Please let me know your opinion on the best software to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for helping.</p>
<p>
