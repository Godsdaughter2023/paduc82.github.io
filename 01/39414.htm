    <title>Change the Custom Pagefile Size on Windows 7 computer. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Change the Custom Pagefile Size on Windows 7 computer.</h2>
                    <p>When setting a custom pagefile through the windows gui&nbsp;interface, which of the following is correct?<br />
Example: 2GB Custom Pagefile<br />
<br />
Do you enter:<br />
<br />
Minimum: 2000<br />
Maximum: 2000<br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Minimum: 2048<br />
Maximum: 2048<br />
<br />
There are references from Microsoft Windows articles that say "2000" without the ending numbers.<br />
<br />
However, there are just as many articles by others that use "2048" since it follows 4kb paging multiples.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be inclined to believe the Microsoft Support articles, which show pagefiles as being entered in flat numbers, like 3000 and 4000, but as I've seen soo many times over the years, many of those web pages are often refuted by a plethora of people, some
 of which have great clout, like Mark Russinovich. And then sometimes, the articles are simply outdated, so they no longer apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Also, whatever is the correct answer, does it apply to all versions of Windows?</p>

            <p>For the average user which makes up the vast majority of windows users, I agree, system managed is the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason I'm asking though, is because I am an avid tweaker, and hardcore gamer. I strive to get the absolute most out of my machine, and operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those types of people, system managed is not good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally found an answer with information to back it up, during my countless hours of research...</p>
<p>I read this article several times, including many many others:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2160852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2160852</a><br />
<br />
There is a small key piece of information that shows what is correct:<br />
<br />
"When the memory being used by all the existing processes exceeds the available RAM, the operating system moves pages (4-KB pieces) of one or more virtual address spaces to the computer’s hard disk. This frees that RAM frame for other uses"<br />
<br />
[4-KB] pieces is the important part.<br />
<br />
In order to get the most EFFICIENT use of your pagefile it should be set in multiples of 4.<br />
<br />
There is no incorrect size per say, but if you want it to be most efficient, for those of us that have performance/stability OCD in our computers and like to tweak everything perfectly. Use a multiple of 4.<br />
<br />
I.E. 1024, 2048, etc.<br />
<br />
Also, for those that are curious for more info. A pagefile is REQUIRED by many games and applications to even Launch. Also, if you enable the console in-game and read the data after launching the program, (for those games/programs that do start without a pagefile)
 check your application log files, you may find errors when you set pagefile to disabled. Most programs will run with it disabled, but they often complain about it.<br />
<br />
Yes there is a stupidly miniscule performance increase by disabling the pagefile, due to a reduction in system overhead, however it's so small (do your own testing and benchmarks, it's only a few points) that you ultimately lose as much as you gain, or more,
 in terms of stability. Also, because you now have extra data being written to those log files, you have increased overhead from hard drive writes, thus losing any performance benefit you just gained.<br />
<br />
Everyone argues this issue so often, but never really says "WHY" to disable it, or to set it. Those are the reasons, and you can test them yourselves. They are true, I've done it multiple times and tested it over and over, in my quest for the perfectly tweaked
 system for hardcore gaming. Its fairly easy to do.<br />
<br />
Also, for those who want the most optimum setup, you'll also want to set the minimum and maximum size to the same amount.<br />
<br />
This helps prevent the pagefile from being fragmented, due to fluctuating sizing. Also it helps to alleviate issues on the hard disk platter, because games and other software will get installed in the spaces adjacent to the pagefile, so if you have a pagefile
 that needs to grow due to heavy computer usage, it has nowhere to grow, so it literally moves and recreates itself to the next open block of your hard drive, which is further back on the plates, which as many people know, the further back you go on a hard
 drive, the slower the access times are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The best thing to do for these types of users, is to disable pagefile completely (steps can be found on google) after a FRESH install of the OS. Then defrag the hard drive to make it contiguous. Restart PC, wait for everything to finish loading, all background
 process to finish. Then defrag one more time, including the Freespace on the drive, only specialized defragmenters can do this, IE. Defraggler by Piriform for example. Then set the pagefile to a static number, like 2048-2048 min/max.</p>

<h2>            Default programs are not working.</h2>
                    <p>I recently received and update for my Windows 7 system and an automatic update for my Windows 10 system.&nbsp; Since then, default programs have been changed.&nbsp; The programs that were the default programs are no longer in the default program list. (ie.&nbsp; Word,
 Excel, Access and a variety of other programs.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on Settings, Default Programs and Set Default Programs produces a list of 13 programs.&nbsp; There use to be and should be many more.&nbsp; Why screw with us like this with updates?&nbsp; PR is at an all time low.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find no way to add them back into the default list.&nbsp; Therefore, I can not change the default program to my choice.&nbsp; It looks like Edge is used to display most everything.&nbsp; Google.doc also used at times.&nbsp; Both of these programs are of an inferior design
 and usability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, it looks like Microsoft and Bill Gates have struck again.&nbsp; Does anybody have any solutions or suggestions to try?</p>

<p>Hello Lea Novak,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Community Forum.<br />
<br />
Actually in the Vista buils the function as you know it is no longer available.&nbsp; There is a way to do it however.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
- Close or minimize all windows that are open so that the Desktop is showing.<br />
- Right click on the Destop and choose "New" then select "Folder"<br />
- Now that you have a new empty folder click and drag it to the side of the screen that you wish&nbsp;quick launch to&nbsp;be on.&nbsp; The folder will snap to that side<br />
- Now right click on the bar that was created when the folder snapped to the side<br />
- Choose "Toolbars" then "Quick Launch" from the options available<br />
- Right click on the bar again select "Toolbars" and unselect "New Folder" to get reid of that label<br />
- You should now see your Quick Launch buttons in the bar/Folder.<br />
- Now right click on the Task bar select "Toolbars" and unselect "Quick Launch" to remove the quick launch bar from the task bar<br />
<br />
After that you can customize the new bar as needed but you should be all set.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Jonathan</p>

<h3> craigbrooks  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to&#58; test if my operating system is faulty&#63;</h2>
                    Are there any tests i can do to check if my operating system (VISTA HOME PREMIUM) isnt stable or is faulty somehow?<br />
<br />
I had to get a new harddrive recently and reinstall everything and ive felt since doing so that the operating system isnt behaving too well. Struggles to manage me flicking between windows, lags alot when im typing quickly or watching anything on say youtube
 amongst other issues. I also got a blue screen and shutdown earlier and believe there was a quick message about the operating system before it went off.<br />
<br />
Ive done all the tests i could find/think of such as CHKDSK to check the harddrive is ok and all the tests came back clean, i have the recovery discs if needed for anything. With the specs on the laptop (HP 6735s) laptop it should be capable of doing a few
 things at a time.<br />
<br />
Any help greatly appreciated<br />

<h2>            Windows Updates eating disk space</h2>
                    Hello. I bought an Asus tablet with Win 8.1 and 32 gb disk space. I had about 15 gb free when I received it about 4 weeks ago. I have not installed any programs to the c:. I now have about 6.5 gb free and I have to believe that Windows/Office Updates are
 eating up the free disk space. I do have the Updates set to install automatically. I have since set it tell me so that I can decide which to install. I intend to install only the "important" ones. Is there some better solution to my dilemma?&nbsp;

            <p>Okay that's what I was going to suggest. Over time updates to the OS are going to add up to about 10 GB. That us just a guess but generally the OS will get larger because more code is added to make the OS more secure and hotfixes are installed. Most of these
 overwrite files so it isn't too bad but the new file is most likely going to be larger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run this <a href="http://www.vindamedia.com/windows/help/windows-update-general-failure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.vindamedia.com/windows/help/windows-update-general-failure</a> Don't worry about the other stuff there is a section to reset the Windows Update Service. This will also delete update packages used to install updates. This is usually done to clean
 up a update that may have downloaded and become corrupted but it will work in your situation too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked if there were updates that were pending because it if is downloaded but requires a restart the update may live separate from the OS and not merged with it for 3 days before a major security update is installed by warning you it will shut down then
 it will shut down no matter what you are doing. This is done to keep malware from forcing a PC to not restart when it needs to. There was an update like this recently. If you haven't finished installing it yet you will see a alert in the power button inside
 the charm bar. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing to note is that updates track what they do incase they need to be uninstalled. If you delete certain files you can undo an update very well and it can cause issues. 10 days to a month usually is a good time frame to know if the update doesn't have
 a issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system restore point should only be 1% of the drive size. maybe a little larger if it needs to but those are only kept for a certain time ( I can't remember what it is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are probably going to need a SD card to increase the memory.&nbsp;What you can do, if you haven't, is use the onedirve folder to store files online only and then right click specific files or folders to store them offline and online or offline only.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will allow you to keep stuff you will need online only if you won't need it all the time and you can wait to get online.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Maintence is set to run at 3am every day then another one weekly. make sure the device sits idle for a little now and then so it can run. Most of them are designed to not run if the PC is active. I am guessing that you device can check emails when
 it is off? If it is then it should be able to do maintenance when it is in a sleep state. I will have to check that I am not 100% sure</p>

<h2>            How can I disable updates in Windows 10 permanently&#63;</h2>
                    How can I disable updates in Windows 10 permanently? 3 times now windows update has made a laptop useless because it has updated to the newest windows and failed. All I get is the windows screen with the spinnning circle. It will sit there till I finally
 shut the computer off. Repair can't fix it, revert to previous windows wont work, system restore points have all been erased even though I presonally made a restore point last time it did this after I got everything back working. After the last time I use
 the wushowhide.diagcab to block the newest windows update. It would keep downloading the update over and over and fail, but eventually 2 days later it snuck it in anyway and now I have to reinstall windows again. This is getting ridiculous. I have other customers
 that go through similar issues with these updates.

            Hi Peter, complete the 3 steps to permanently stop Windows 10 Automatic Updates
<br />
<br />1.
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options
<br />Choose to sign in with a Local Account rather than a Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />2.
<br />In the Settings App
<br />Go to Network and Internet
<br />Set your WiFi connection as Metered
<br />
<br />3.
<br />Click your Start Button, type services and hit ENTER 
<br />Scroll down the list of services to find Windows Update 
<br />Double click the service 
<br />If it has started, click 'Stop' 
<br />Then you must set its startup type to 'Disabled' - 'Manual' will not do! 
<br />Restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks. I have done all suggested above except the metered connection setting. I'll try that this time and hopefully that will stop this.&nbsp; Thanks for all the responses. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Oh, I also disabled all the windows update options in task scheduler. There's 4 or 5 in there that will turn your updates back on.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>that shouldn't result in any hardware damage, it could result in save game issues or other issues when console for example is updating, but not actual hardware issues itself.</p>
<p>The HDMI cable can show lines if the cable is disconnected and connected again often, but that usually won't result in any loss of image quality</p>

    <title>Firewall Recommended Settings - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Firewall Recommended Settings</h2>
                    Recently I have had a problem with windows 8 firewall not using the recommended settings. I will be connected to the internet when a page is unable to load. When I check the firewall it shows that the recommended settings are not being used. I then click
 "use recommended settings" and the firewall functions normally for a few days until the process repeats itself. I do not know how the settings become altered. Is this an indication of a larger problem? What should I do?
<br />
Thank you!<br />

                    <p>I have installed Windows 10, but it is constantly freezing and requires regular reboot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems if I have more than 1 program running (have so far only reinstalled Adobe DC and prefer to run Chrome (eg browsing on Chrome and switch to Adobe) it simply freezes?</p>
<p>I have run the latest upgrades, still no fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am reading that this is becoming an increasing identified bug .. is there a fix on the way. &nbsp;Pretty useless as it is :-(</p>

<h2>            Windows Photo Gallery doesn&#39;t work since updating to Windows 10</h2>
                    Windows Photo Gallery doesn't work on my Pavilion laptop since updating to Windows 10, this is just one of several issues I've had, asked, and haven't found a solution for since updating (the most serious being&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-power/problem-shutting-down-after-w10-upgrade/762bce77-ba7d-4f93-9f82-42997494ad9e">this</a>.)
 But anyway, can I get Photo Gallery back in working condition? The Photos app just isn't good enough for me.

    <title>Odd performance&#47;malware&#63; issues - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Odd performance&#47;malware&#63; issues</h2>
                    
<p>I'm not even sure how to title this. A few weeks ago, it started in Outlook 2007 - it was like 1/4 of the data on the screen went blank. I tried to get a screenshot to show, but when I went to open Digital Image, I got an error like: pi.exe application error
 0xc0000142. Then I tried to open paint and got Quick Launch (null) is not a valid win 32 application. Other errors along the way included things like imprtwiz.ede bad image or error getting the clipboard data or Update.exe application error. The instructions
 at 0x36e3326 referenced memory at 0x00f9c020. The memory could not be "read" Click ok to terminate program.</p>
<p>Along the way, I'd get dialog boxes when were blank other than the title bar which would say something like Update.exe application error - then the oK box - nothing else.</p>
<p>I would reboot and it'd be fine for a couple of days, then start again. I was usually running a few IE windows, Outlook 2007, Mozilla Foxfire, Access and MSG at any given time.</p>
<p>Today I got a new one, I was trying to open an MSN MSG contact and got sysfader:msnmsgr.exe bad image.</p>
<p>I have Win XP SP3, IE 8, whatever the latest Mozilla is. I run AVG 9 Free, have that up-to-date and it hasn't found a virus. For Malware, I ran SpyDoctor and Advanced Care to find any Malware, and found nothing or fixded nothing.</p>
<p>I looked at doing&nbsp;a system restore, but it only goes back to 7/13 for some reason, so it's not before the problem started (is there another way to get an earlier restore, 7/13 is the oldest date highlighted and it won't let me click back to June).</p>
<p>I did a RAM test and found no errors. Like I said, upon reboot, it'll run a few days with no problems, then it'll start again. I ran Spyware Dr. in safe mode this am, it didn't find anything but tracking cookies. I'm running AVG Free in safe mode right now
 which defaults to a dos mode version.</p>
<p>I'm assuming it's some sort of malware, but if spyware dr. and AVG can't find it, where do I go next and please don't give me a solution that involves a clean install of Win XP as it would take me DAYS to reinstall all my apps and stuff. I do have my files
 backed up onto an external HD nightly, but the apps involved would take way too long to reinstall.</p>
<p>Thanks for any other suggestions.</p>
<p>Dawnvk</p>

<p>It actually doesn't sound like malware to me. It sounds like hardware failure. Since you've already tested the RAM, I would look next to the hard drive.</p>

<p>I ran several of the tests using the TuffTEST for Windows tool.</p>
<p>The Hard Disk Test was fine, but this one showed RAM issues. It doesn't give me specifics. I've opened my machine and cleaned out the dust bunnies as suggested as well.</p>
<p>I increased the virtual memory. I ran the test again. It says it'll take 3 minutes, yet it comes back in seconds with errors. It gives suggestions which really don't help</p>
<p>1. quit all other running programs and redo the test (nothing is running, even turned off AVG) increase virtual memory and redo test - done - same result</p>
<p>2. try disabling external cache or changing wait state timing in BIOS setup utility if possible - not sure how or if I want to mess with that</p>
<p>3. Reinstall CPU, cooling fan and memory modules or use the least amount of memory modules, maybe 1 or 2, and then redo the test.</p>
<p>4. If problem persists, you may need to replace the memory modules or external cache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic mtinst.exe tool and it didn't find any errors - which should I believe?</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions.</p>

            I prefer Memtest86+ to test RAM. I certainly wouldn't do any of those suggestions. I think it's time to remove TuffTest from my webpage. I used to run it when I wanted to check out the motherboard but have been using programs off the UBCD and Prime95 now.
 I always used Memtest and SeaTools to test the RAM and hard drives. Can you tell me your computer specs, including its approximate age?

<p>Yip, I saw that in re-reading after I made my post, ran that and it returned with NO ERRORS! I think that's good news. Could all this be caused by having my virtual memory set too low? I was at 1500 or so and I jacked that up to 4000 (I have 2GB RAM).</p>
<p>The computer is a Dell (desktop) Dimension 4700 and is about 5 years old. I added RAM several years ago to get it up to 2 GB. I'm running XP SP 3, The Processor is&nbsp;a Pentium 3.40GHz and it has a 230 GB HD w/21.5 GB free. I recently did a disk cleanup. I've
 run Advanced System Care and Spyware Doctor regularily.</p>

            I have always found that simply setting virtual memory to "system managed" is the best. Why not try that and see if it fixes the issues? If not, well your computer is getting elderly and they don't last forever.

            Things were going well until this morning when the plot thickened... I tried to open XL 02, got error messages indicating it's not installed properly, then it went on into Bad Image errors - had to click ok about 10 times to get out of it. So I tried to
 open XL 07 - got an error, then it offered to open in Safe mode which worked. Then I went to open a spreadsheet from w/in XL 07 and it said "C:.../my documents is not accessible, not enough quata is available to process this command." I surfed around in there
 a bit and did get it to open and was able to make changes and save. Then I closed XL 07 and tried to open 02 again and it opened up fine. I had a thought... at the time, I had open Outlook 07, 2 IE windows, Mozilla (w 5 tabs running), an IM window and at that
 time XL. This isn't unusual, I've been running these apps daily for years... but the one thing that I wondered is if my .pst is getting too big (1,795,785 KB). Would it get to the point that it would suck up all my RAM and start causin

            I've continued to have issues, today I was able to get some screen shots, though I don't see any way to attach them here. 7/24 - issue was with Outlook 07 giving me an error that my .pst cannot be accessed, along with other errors along the way. At one
 point, I it would open nothing but my task list. I closed it and ran scan.pst - it wouldn't allow access to the file. I rebooted, ran ckdsk with fix errors selected. Then I ran Office Repair, then I rebooted and ran scanpst.exe again with only minor inconsistencies
 found. All was well until 7/27 - Outlook did the same type of thing, only I got even newer messages. Rebooting makes it ok again. So, if it's not my RAM, not my HD, not the .pst, not malware or a virus - what do I check next? I'm running out of ideas. Thanks
 for any suggestions and let me know if you'd like to see the screen shots in some manner. Dawn

<p>If it's not the RAM and not the hard drive and not malware, then it's some other component. That leaves the motherboard, processor, and the power supply. Before going further with that, I would back up your data and do a clean install of Windows. See how
 the system behaves. If all is well, then add a few programs at a time. Do a fresh install of MS Office and run Outlook with a new data file. If all is well, I would not import your old .pst (except for Contacts and Calendar if you use them) and only open the
 old data file instead. Get what you want out of it and then close it.</p>
<p>If you experience problems after a clean install, then you know it's the motherboard and/or processor. Decide what to do based on the age and warranty status of the computer.</p>

<p>Akkk, the clean install of Windows would be my last resort... The problem is, over the years, I have so many programs installed that to reinstall would take DAYS -IF I can even find all the disks/internet install pts. THis is in fact what prevents me from
 just getting a new computer - that an the fact that Windows 7 may not even run all of my software for example I have a loftof data invested in Money 99 - I know, ancient, but it does what I need and have used it for years so all my archives are in it. MSFT
 Digital Image Studio is another one Windows 7 doesn't seem to support - I use that every day. etc. What a pain! It kills me (esp. as an ex-MSFTie) that MSFT is the one preventing me from migrating to newer stuff. Maybe it's just Outlook, maybe I'll try the
 new .pst bit and see if that solves the problem.</p>
<p>Thanks for that suggestion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you mean error number: "<span>0x800CCC0D" ? </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If yes, given that you have already verified the port numbers, the issue could probably be with your Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please check your Firewall and make sure that Live Mail is allowed through the firewall especially if you have a third party firewall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the Start button, type "firewall" on the searchbox, then click "Allow a program through Windows Firewall"</p>
<p>Here you can verify your firewall settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi.
<br />My name is Miles.
<br />
<br />	You will see the following message when you start a game or an application and we have to check the usage rights:
<br />Do you have this game or application?
<br />
<br />	If you have a game disc, put it now. Otherwise, make sure you're signed in to Xbox Live. If you do not have rights to reproduce it, you will need to buy it in the Microsoft Store.
<br />
<br />	There are some reasons that can prevent us from checking the usage rights.
<br />
<br />Solution 1:
<br />
<br />	If you're playing a game that needs a disk, insert the game disc into the Xbox console. If the disc is already inserted, see How to solve problems when playing a disc on Xbox One.
<br />	<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/disc-e...</a> 
<br />
<br />Solution 2:
<br />
<br />	If you purchased or installed the game or application from Microsoft Store on Xbox One (formerly known as the Xbox Store), make sure you're signed in to Xbox Live.
<br />
<br />Solution 3:
<br />
<br />	If someone else has installed the game or application digitally (without a disc), it must be that person who signs in to Xbox Live.
<br />
<br />
<br />Suggestion:
<br />
<br />	If the owner of the game chooses a specific Xbox as its main Xbox (in Settings&gt; Personalization&gt; My main Xbox), anyone using that Xbox will be able to use the installed apps and games, even when the person who installed them has not logged in.

            Hello! I understand that you are having some trouble with your webcam. You could try these solutions to fix the problem: Try updating Windows, uninstall webcam driver from Device Manager and unplug webcam from PC. Then, restart your PC and plug the camera back in. It should reinstall the driver. Hope this helps!

<p>Hi Ryo</p>
<p>Thanks for reply.</p>
<p>Windows is using latest update and I installed the latest camera driver today. Before the system used a generic driver ( which didn't work) but I am now using the manufacturers driver. The issue is only with Skype. The camera is working well in other applications</p>

<p>More than likely the limitation is in the existing drivers or hardware. If your camera does not have official Windows 10 drivers and is not fully UVC compliant/compatible, it will not work with Windows 10 Apps. This should not stop it from working with desktop
 applications like Classic Skype (7.x). Is your camera detected and does it function in the Windows 10 Camera App with either driver?</p>

<p>You can provide the information Ruwim is requesting, in case something else is the cause. This could be some other out of date driver or conflicting software. If that is not the case, more than likely due to the age of the 0.3 Megapixel camera and no official
 Windows 10 drivers existing, it will remain incompatible with Windows 10 Apps. Usually the only remaining solutions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Locating other drivers that might work with Windows 10 Apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. This could be a universal driver someone has developed.</p>
<p>b. This could be virtual camera software that will provide the compatibility the camera driver is lacking (a simple flag/setting or a protocol). Be aware that the majority of virtual camera software is incompatible with Windows 10 Apps. A few of them are.</p>
<p>c. Contacting the maker or supplier of the camera to see if newer drivers exist. I personally did not locate any official Windows 10 drivers for that camera's chipset on Microsoft's update servers or the Genius website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Purchasing another camera that is Windows 10 compatible or UVC compliant (so that it is compatible with the USB Video Device drivers that come with the OS).<br />

<p>I am having the same issue but with my Sonix 2mp(1680x1200) webcam. (latest driver Win7 x64)</p>
<p>
</p><p>been working well for 10 years.. still working well, except in win10skype, I knew about this problem as I tried updating from classic skype before but managed to go back.. but now support for classic skype is ending, I no longer have this option.. I find
 MS's policies with skype rather backward.. like why can't we downgrade if we have a problem? why can't we have classic skype if that's what works for us? Why on earth would I want to use Win10Skype if I'm forced to BUY a new webcam JUST for that App. moronic.
 I use skype everyday with my partner as we are long distance*.. it's not rocket science, you just allow the same webcams you did with skype classic. job done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>on the flip side.. to be fair.. Win10Skype does look pretty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>*I also have a yearly subscription.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--</p>
<p>one a side note.. it's stuff like this that puts people off using the MS app store, a building resentment.. and considering how much effort MS is putting in to getting people on there.. you'd think they would care enough to tell the Skype devs to allow all
 our webcams.</p>

<h2>            Getting upside down login page in Windows 7</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When will Microsoft fix the problem of the frequent occurrence (first 3 times this morning!) of an upside down login page in the Windows 7 downgrade (hard to call it an upgrade when you see the mess they made of "Windows Live Mail" compared to Outlook
 Express in Windows XP)?&nbsp; Do they really pay people to make these screw-ups?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P.s.:&nbsp; Even when I tried to search for "upside down login page", the result was a question about creating homegroup.&nbsp; Argh!<br />

 on "upside down login page" and he will find one or more millions of web pages on this subject.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are the people who reply to questions in Microsoft Answers employees of Microsoft or is this a user-run forum?&nbsp; The name implies that it is a Microsoft service but I am beginning to suspect that it is not, especially with the smart-aleck upside down typing

            This is not Microsoft. This is a user to user forum provided by Microsoft, manned primarily by volunteers and a few Microsoft support engineers.

<div>Sorry about the upside down typing gag. It was a failed attempt to be&nbsp;humorous.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I'm having an issue with my Windows 10 OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically it randomly reboots. I'm not sure it's because of the BSOD as all I see is the Windows login screen after I leave my PC for some time.</p>
<p>How can I troubleshoot this?</p>

            <p>Hi Deepika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice to hear from you. &nbsp;;) I have the same concern as Hung. I wonder how do I enable dark theme (just like on Windows10 Mobile) without resorting to high contrast themes. The last option suggests extreme contrast and awfully unfriendly boxes
 in the bottom of the screen, etc. some users manipulate registry and get partially dark theme and other users would like to have it too as default option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great to have dark option available that would remain friendly and pleasing to the eye. I have to commend Microsoft's efforts in Windows 10 mobile, Office, but what about your main product that lags behind? Please pass on the concern and address
 it. Please. Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>V.</p>

The only solution I found is to spam the A button on unmute and when i see my friend unmuted I stop the spamming.

<h2>            Windows Update KB4284819 &#40;1709&#41; error 0x800704c7</h2>
                    <p>I'm really tired of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all: I'm a gamer. My PC has been accumulating updates since there are a couple of them that are not installing. Every time I restart the PC for some purpose or shutdown, it says "update and restart/shutdown". Since there's no other alternative to
 do it I click it and the show begins; 30~ updates are ready to install and I have to wait for them to finally turn off or getting my PC ready to use again. But they never go away, I turn on the PC and the same updates are "installing" again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It never finishes updating, it is an endless loop that takes a lot to finish and I'm very tired of it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look the update history there are 2 KB failing over and over for no apparent reason.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Windows Update Troubleshooting; found problems, fixed them and nothing happened.</p>
<p>2) Downloaded the SSU; nothing</p>
<p>3) Downloaded the KB; obviously, it fails.</p>
<p>4) Stopped the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services; Nothing.</p>
<p>5) Installed Win 10 1803; it worked but my gaming performance literally became an unplayable HELL (installing latest GPU drivers didn't work)</p>
<p>6) Went back to 1709, performance OK Win Update problems are back. What is wrong with Windows Update?!</p>
<p>7) *UPDATE*: Dism.exe commands; nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, I need a way to solve this without sacrificing performance so I can still play my games.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be a way to reset Windows Update, delete temp files or delete the updates that are queued causing problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:</p>
<p>
</p><p>After finishing this post I checked Windows Update again and look who's here, downloading again:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fee87157-15f7-4b1d-a701-cc7c96a2ce1c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fee87157-15f7-4b1d-a701-cc7c96a2ce1c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>So It will ask me to restart 2 times to say that it failed at the end.</p>

            Hello Ricky
<br />
<br />You can do these methods that can help you
<br />
<br />Method 1:
<br />
<br />Access the following article and click on the section Search and correct problems with devices and hardware and follow the respective instructions.
<br />
<br />Method 2:
<br />
<br />Click on the Start button and type CMD. Next, right click with the mouse button on Command Prompt and choose the Run as administrator option. In the resulting window, type the command dism.exe / online / cleanup-image / scanhealth and press the Enter key; once this process is finished, type the statement dism.exe / online / cleanup-image / restorehealth and press the Enter key again. These processes may take a little time and will depend mainly on the level of affectation of the system files.

            Hey Ricky.    I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Many, many complaints about Windows 10 oppressive Updating.  
<br />
<br />Some top tech columnists are advising to turn them off and then run them when you want:  <a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Latest methods to turn them off:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Ok so now my ethernet connection is "metered" but the KB is still downloading by itself. But now I need to get the rest of the updates installed or deleted so I can restart/shutdown without long waitings.<br />

            That should only happen if it was already installing before you Metered the Connection.
<br />
<br />Type Services.msc in Start search, right click to Run as Admin, scroll down to choose Windows Update Service, turn it off and set to disabled.  Restart PC.  
<br />
<br />If the Update has installed anyway then System Restore or uninstall it in Installed Update History, then block it using Hide Updates Tool:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
