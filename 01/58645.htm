<h2>            Error Could not find driver software, but no new device added</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>Found today that have an error report from that states Windows detected a&nbsp;new device was attached to&nbsp;the computer, but could not find the driver software necessary to make the device useable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the same time Microsoft Trusted Audio Drivers installed (I can see this via&nbsp;reliability monitor) and I can see them in device manager under Sound, Video &amp; Game controllers if I click 'View' and 'Show Hidden Devices'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click on their 'Properties', under 'Events' I can see 3 entries:</p>
<p>1. ~a fortnight ago indicating device was deleted (not by me, so something that happened automatically)</p>
<p>2. date time of error that driver service added (dmkaud) (matches date/time of problem report)</p>
<p>3. date/time of error that driver service installed (wdmaudio.inf) (matches date/time of problem report)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'General' details report that the device is not connected to the computer and to fix the problem&nbsp;the hardware device&nbsp;should be reconnected, however I'm not sure what would run with this driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a number of other Microsoft items listed e.g. Microsoft Streaming Clock Proxy, Microsoft Streaming Quality Manager Proxy etc which also indicate being discounted and to fix the problem to reconnect the hardware device to the computer and which
 are also only available to view when the option to 'Show Hidden Devices' is selected.&nbsp; None of these other ones have any events to view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use the option in Windows Update to receive Updates for Windows and other Microsoft products, so assume Microsoft Trusted Audio Drivers came via this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet as indicated I had not plugged in a new device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The information in the report gives a hardware ID, but I haven't managed to pinpoint device on my pc.&nbsp; Search in Knowledge Base with this string of characters indicates
<em>possibly</em> something to do with Microsoft Kernel DRM Audio Descrambler.&nbsp; But cannot be sure.&nbsp; Haven't managed to find anything on else through Knowledge Base search that defines what it is, so haven't managed to track down device on computer (i.e. wondered
 if it was a sound card or something like that)&nbsp;to see if hardware ID matches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One opinion I have received (not related to Microsoft Forum), is that recent factory reset was not successful and needs to be repeated.&nbsp; Do have few other&nbsp;minor issues&nbsp;e.g. as posted on Microsoft Forum that problem reporting not offering me the option to
 view and&nbsp;select which errors to send - I can only send them all.&nbsp; Also couple minor points which I&nbsp;haven't followed up:&nbsp;Automatic maintenance runs and runs and doesn't seem to complete, even leaving PC idle&nbsp;for hours with power save options off&nbsp; and language
 abbreviation indicator in notification area will always turn itself off after a restart.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally a programme crashes for no apparent reason.&nbsp; So perhaps might indicate poor installation problem.&nbsp; But it's not drastic, programmes open etc, windows up
 date works, defender scans</p>
<p>
</p><p>But before I do another factory reset, which is a bit drastic and not something I do lightly, I'd like to seek further advice please.&nbsp; Could it be related to the following things that had happened prior to this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Immediately prior to error reported / driver installation Installed optional&nbsp;updates: KB3000850, KB3013816, KB3013769</p>
<p>-Earlier in the day had run Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM.exe), as found with System File Checker (sfc.exe)&nbsp;an error that a file&nbsp;could not be repaired, reporting a hash mismatch and running DISM was voted&nbsp;most helpful answer in a Microsoft
 Forum post relating to the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or could it be due to the 'device' being deleted (reported under events of Microsoft Trust Audio Drivers)&nbsp;~ 2 weeks ago as indicated above.&nbsp; How it was deleted&nbsp;I don't know.&nbsp; But even so what confuses me is that the error report indicates a device attached,
 which I didn't do physically, and which has only ever occurred if I have physically plugged in a device for which there wasn't an installation disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for a long description and many thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Update</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Further to the above, just in case it is relevant, I found today that a Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter installed during yesterday.&nbsp; It was showing as a Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Direct # 2 in Device manager.&nbsp; Following advice from another source
 uninstalled this new second instance.&nbsp; Seemed to have same driver details and as far as I know same hardware ID, so seemed reasonable not to have duplicate there.&nbsp; Plus the second instance had the info that it was not connected, whilst the first one (remaining)&nbsp;says
 it is connected and that the device is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondered if this gives any details about what computer is up to.&nbsp; Have Windows Update to automatically install other Microsoft product updates, so perhaps not surprising I'm finding things have installed.&nbsp; But why a second instance of something already installed?&nbsp;
 Did have device installation settings to not install anything until found this today and now set to automatic.&nbsp; Could there have been some conflict in the settings such that the computer didn't check to see what was already there?&nbsp; If this needs to be split
 out and posted separately please let me know.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would appreciate you for giving us detailed information and the effort that you are putting to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Which are the program that crash?</span></li><li><span>Did you get any error message when the program crashes?</span></li><li><span>From when are you facing this issue?</span></li><li><span>Have you made any significant software or hardware changes?</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Microsoft Trusted Audio Drivers</span><span> may be downloaded if you are using
<span>Driver Scanner application. Which would automatically detects the latest drivers and install them. I would suggest you to check in
<strong>Programs</strong> if there is any application installed without your permission.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As your computer shows that you have a driver Microsoft Trusted Audio Drivers installed. I would suggest you to check for the latest windows update including
 optional updates, which you may have already tried but I would suggest you to try updating once again and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>You can try removing the optional updates one by one and check if the issue persists. This will help you determine which update is causing this issue.</span><span>I
 would also suggest you if you could locate the Hardware ID and provide it to us so that we could further investigate on the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you haven’t tried please follow the below steps to run a hardware and device troubleshooter and check if it helps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>
‘Windows + C’ </strong>to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to bottom right corner of the screen and you will get the charms menu.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‘<strong>search’
</strong>and select ‘<strong>settings’ </strong>and type ‘<strong>Troubleshooting’
</strong>and select ‘<strong>troubleshooting’</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click on ‘<strong>Hardware and Sound’
</strong>and select ‘<strong>Hardware and Devices’ </strong>and click on next to run the troubleshooter.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would also suggest you to perform a clean boot and try running the program that crashes and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the section
 "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" in the provided link to return your computer to Normal startup mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sometimes if the Event viewer logs are corrupted. Then they might generate event logs that are not accurate. I would suggest you back up all the event
 logs and completely clear all system event logs.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have cleared please run the system for 24 hours and check if similar event logs are generated. If yes, I would request you to send us the event
 log file for further investigation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to the below steps to clear an event log by using Event Viewer:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Start
<strong>Event Viewer</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the console tree, navigate to the event log you want to clear.</span></li><li><span>On the
<strong>Action</strong> menu, click <strong>Clear Log</strong> .You can either clear the event log or save a copy of the event log and then clear it.</span></li><li><span>To clear the event log without saving: Click
<strong>Clear</strong>.</span></li><li><span>To clear the event log after saving: Click
<strong>Save and Clear</strong> , type a name for the saved file in File name on the Save As dialog box and click Save .</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>May be there is some issue with the windows file but as System File Checker was not much of help. I would suggest you to run a full system scan and check
 for virus and malware infections.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this information is helpful. Please do reply us with the status of the issue. So that we can assist you further.</span></p>

<h2>            How to remove Password Requirement at Sign-In&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I installed W8 about an hour ago and during the installation process, I inadvertently entered my Hotmail Account and Password not realizing that this would require me to enter my Password any time that W8 is started (or restarted). My question is,
 how remove the Hotmail info from W8 so that I can start W8 without entering a Password? &nbsp;Thanks,

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occurs due to bad sectors on the hard drive can be a cause for high disk usage. Let’s work together to get this problem resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, before we proceed I would require some more information to assist you better:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. When exactly the computer freezes and shows 100% disk usage? Is it when you boot the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to check which process is utilizing the Hard Disk on Windows 8.1, you may try the following steps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Open <strong>Task Manager </strong>and click on <strong>Details</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. <strong>Right click</strong> the columns headers and click "<strong>Select Columns</strong>".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. From the "<strong>Select Columns</strong>" window, check: I/O Reads, I/O Writes, I/O read bytes, I/O write bytes and then click OK.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. Now the columns will be added to the view and will display how much each process is utilizing from the hard disk.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Sort by I/O read bytes or I/O write bytes by clicking on the column header to see which process is utilizing the Hard Drive most.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you not run the 'check disk' scan or tried optimizing the drive, follow the steps from this article.</span></p>

            Hello Michael, I'm Sam, an Independent Adviser. Glad to assist and help with your question.
<br />
<br />Because you are a child in the Microsoft family you cannot make any changes. Only an adult family member can remove another family member. You can remove yourself from your family if you are over 18 years old.
<br />However if you send a request to leave the family, the notification will be sent to the parent account and your parent will be able to remove the restrictions.

            Hi Michael
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />It is possible, you could try changing your date of birth if the restrictions are not on your account:
<br />
<br />Step 1:
<br />
<br />Change the date of birth on your Microsoft Account to ensure it reflects your are 18 years or older:
<br />
<br />Change the birthdate on your Microsoft account - Microsoft Support
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/microsoft-account-change-birthdate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12411/...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: 
<br />
<br />If the other account is setup as a family account, sign into your Your Family at the following link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/family</a> 
<br />
<br />Under the account, click More options, click Remove from family.
<br />
<br />Restart then check if you can sign into the account again.
<br />
<br />Change the account privilege 
<br />
<br />It is possible there is a profile issue, you could try changing the account privileges to Standard User from Administrator to see if it logs you in.
<br />
<br />In your current account
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Users tab
<br />Select the account, then click Disconnect
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: control userpasswords2
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Select the other account
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Group Membership
<br />Select Standard user
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Click Apply then OK again
<br />
<br />Restart the machine, the try logging into the account. 
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, then it suggest NTUser.dat might be corrupt. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type view advanced system settings
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under User Profiles, click Settings
<br />For the affected profile, click Delete
<br />
<br />Select your user profile or another user profile that is able to log on successfully. 
<br />Click Copy To..
<br />Click Browse then save it somewhere on your drive
<br />Rename it to something else
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; system drive where Windows is installed
<br />Open the Users folder
<br />Open the troubled profiled
<br />Go to the View tab, then check off Hidden items in Show/Hide
<br />
<br />The NTUser.dat with backed up earlier, copy it into this folder
<br />
<br />Restart, then check if you can log in.

<h2>            On laptop start-up SKYPE cannot log me in due to an error it says.</h2>
                    However, if I try to reinstall SKYPE for Windows 10 it seems that whatever the difficulty earlier now this is overcome and I am logged in. The installation of SKYPE does not actually happen as they system announces that SKYPE is already installed and proceeds
 to sign in. This strange behaviour never happened to me before. Can anyone help in this puzzle? Thanks.

            Hi AndreasConstantinides
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />You may need to go for Skype for Desktop, if you are using Store version of Skype. Use below method to uninstall and install Skype to solve this problem.
<br />
<br />CTRL+SHIFT+ESC to invoke Task Manager &gt; Kill any instance of Skype.exe
<br />
<br />A. If this is UWP (Microsoft Store) Skype app of Windows - Windows Key+i &gt; Apps &gt; Click Skype and Uninstall
<br />Install Skype again from Microsoft Store. You can install from <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDNCRFJ364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9WZDN...</a>
<br />
<br />If above doesn't work -
<br />
<br />Choose to install desktop client of Skype from and use Skype for Desktop <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />B. If this is Skype for Desktop client 
<br />Copy the below line and Windows Key+R and paste into Run window by CTRL+V and Enter
<br />%appdata%\microsoft\Skype for Desktop
<br />Rename this folder also to something say Skype for Desktop_Old
<br />Reinstall Skype again from <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<p>Is it possible to put the old version back on the play store so that paying customers can use a working product while you fire the people that created v8 and replace them with people that understand skype is a voip client and not a buggy imitation of snapchat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi, you got the stock reply from Microswitch, they have no intention of letting you go back - forever forward with skyechat 2.0 as its now being called, no matter if its wrong. I found a post that had this link on it ( https://skype.en.uptodown.com/android/old)
 Version 7.46.0.596 should work best. I have already rolled back and got all the BEST features working again. Good Luck<br />

<h2>            Xbox 360 Console replacement request &#40;part 2, the sequel&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>This is to update the first post I made, in case anyone gets an Email and decides to do some research.&nbsp; The first thread can be found here:
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/5590/50120.aspx#50120" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/5590/50120.aspx#50120</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The console had was old, had the drive replaced, and had just Rrod'd.&nbsp; The only answer I seemed to get on the forums&nbsp;was that the "warranty is void!"&nbsp; My answer was that:&nbsp;(A) there was no warranty, it had expired, (B) it wasn't a warranty claim (had nothing
 to do with the warranty).&nbsp; It wasn't an "out of warranty repair" either.&nbsp; MS had made my console obsolete, now they were replacing it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thread was eventually locked after everyone jumped in and said the warranty was void over and over again, and indicated that was the answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That was not the answer.&nbsp; The new Xbox arrived a few days ago.&nbsp; 250Gb, new controller, data transfer kit, headset, cables.&nbsp; They simply needed to make a new shipping order to match the number on the console&nbsp;(not the one on the drive, since it was switched
 out).&nbsp;&nbsp; I suggest if anyone has questions about this process they skip this forum and simply call (<strong>800</strong>) 4MY-XBOX or (<strong>800</strong>) 469-9269.

            Hi MissEssJay, 
<br />
<br />Click start, and type "device manager" and open it
<br />
<br />You should see "bluetooth" like the photo I've attached below. This would indicate you have a bluetooth adapter in your PC. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

<h2>            my scrolling operation for two finger touchpad will not work anymore even when i go to the services and restart it on my samsung np3530ec laptop.  Any ideas&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    when I got the np3530ec laptop the touchpad would scroll with two finger touch and change widows with three fingers etc. &nbsp;But after the first update in february this stopped working. &nbsp;Once or twice after an update i was able to get it to work when i went
 into services trough administration tools. &nbsp;I double clicked on the touchpad installed package and clicked on start in the left panel. &nbsp;the scroll function worked again. &nbsp;But after the last update a few weeks ago it did not work and will not do so, even though
 the services says it is running.

<h3> s4w  say:</h3>
<h2>            TRITTON Warhead 7.1 Dolby Wireless Halo Edition Headset</h2>
                    
<p>I bought the above headset when halo4 was released for the x360&nbsp;but&nbsp;wanted to ask M$ if you are ever going to support the Tritton Warhead wireless headset. I noticed that the adapter you have released for older headsets to work on the XBOX One doesn't support
 my Tritton headset (obviously because it is wireless and doesn't have a plug). I know you can update the firmware in the controller itself as shown with the latest XBOX One update so my question is will support ever come&nbsp;for the Tritton&nbsp;headsets via a firmware
 update to the controller so it will sync with my base or have I now just got a $400 set of head phones?</p>

<p>This is like flogging a dead horse. Thanks for your support on this M$ after years of loyal support for your flagship product all we get is ...a $400 pair of head phones ,thanks. You could have at leased talked to Tritton and maybe come up with an mic boom
 (as ours plugs into the side of the headset) with a cable running from the boon that plugs into the controller (with a controller FW update, it wouldn't be wireless but it would still let us use out $400 headset). At leased it would have been something but
 this is just not acceptable and you have lost so much respect in my eyes this gen I'm almost out.</p>
<p>Why can't a FW update to the controller be pushed anyway to tell it to sync to our base?</p>

<p>I don't believe in this day and age that M$/Tritton can't have a work around. When this headset was made it was a year or so before release of the XBone (XBone would have been well into production) so they knew this day was coming. It is just not acceptable
 they had plenty of time to make something happen so it would work on NextGen. Thanks for the useless set of headphones I now have. You burnt me too many times M$ and this is the last straw.</p>

Ifs possible the OS needs do be tweaked a bit before it installs. <br /><br />I hope this hopes. Let me know, and we’ll troubleshoot in the AM!<br />- C

            I just uninstalled and reinstallled x64 of both 2015 - v14.0.24212 followed by 2017 - 14.13.26020.
<br />
<br />I haven't tried x86 though.
<br />
<br />Is there any particular reason you want to install x86 only? Is your OS 32 bit?
<br />
<br />Another thing you can try is to install in clean boot mode. 
<br />Refer to the section - Install, uninstall, or run an application
<br />Don't forget to do - Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting.
<br />How to boot in Clean boot mode - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135...</a>

            Oh I understand. You try to install 2017, and it barks that 2015 isn’t updated. You try to update, and it doesn’t work. <br /><br />I’m looking at the system requirements - <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/productinfo/vs2017-system-requirements-vs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/p...</a> - and if doesn’t look like 2015 is a pre-req. would you entertain uninstalling 2015, and seeing if 2017 would install?

</p><p>In case the problem is with the pointer device, try using the equivalent keyboard shortcuts,&nbsp; Ctrl-Esc and Win-S.&nbsp; Additionally since some have found that there may be a rendering problem due to video driver you should try activating Narrator to assist you.&nbsp;
 Win-Enter.&nbsp; Then it may describe or show you things that are there but can not be seen.&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW when the Search box is marked hidden using Narrator will be the only way to detect its presence (before more typing starts using it and then showing it regardless).</p>

<p>
</p><p>You have missed a very important point.&nbsp; My workarounds are also diagnostics, especially the use of Narrator, so telling us "they are not working" fails to tell us what you see.&nbsp; Remember, your words have to substitute for what our eyes might notice.&nbsp; That
 would be the only way you could hope to get more effective suggestions.</p>

            Same issues I was also facing but you can get rid of that by just installing all the updates through windows 10 update and recovery menu. Most probably one of the Windows 10 update is missing through your system. Is it like your taskbar is kind of freezed
 except the apps that you have pinned?

            I stumbled upon this by accident. Start or restart the computer. On the screen that says Choose an operating system, look down and click on the line that says Change defaults or choose other options. On the next screen click Choose other options. Then
 click Troubleshoot. Then Advanced options. Then click Startup repair. That did the trick for me (so far). It's been several days and everything is still working fine. Hope that helps.

                    <p>Utter <strong>frustration</strong>.&nbsp; Yet more hours trying to solve this ongoing issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>

<p>Getting in touch with 'the website owners' directly.</p>
<p>Taking a screenshot and sending this issue to Microsoft.&nbsp; No-one has yet responded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop was fine until about three weeks ago, then some websites stopped loading properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My laptop came with Windows 10 already installed.</p>

            Just to isolate the problem, does the website load fine in alternative web browsers such as Internet Explorer, Chrome or Firefox on the same computer?

<br />
<br />What about other user accounts on the machine - does it happen them too? 
<br />
<br />Could you post a screenshot in a reply here so we can get better idea of whats happening?
<br />
<br />Have you actually tried reinstalling Edge?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: powershell
<br />Right click PowerShell then click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the prompt, type: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose}
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />When complete, exit PowerShell, restart your computer then check if Edge is working again.

<p>In response to Andre Da Costa (your reply to the above appeared via my Android phone but did not appear here on this page, on my laptop ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As already stated above, Chrome does not load these pages either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I go back to Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox or Chrome when Edge is supposedly the best and most up to date and compatible browser for my Windows 10 package?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone down the 'other user accounts' avenue, but this does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would I reinstall Edge?&nbsp; The 'Windows 10 Fall Updates' have just been installed, in the last couple of days, in my laptop but the problem started prior to these 'Fall Updates'.&nbsp; Therefore reinstalling Edge is not the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already sent a screenshot to Microsoft Team, but no-one responded.</p>

            Well, I am a different participant here and I can't see the screenshot you posted. So in order to help, I would need to see the screenshot too. You are posting in a community of volunteers. Microsoft employees rarely participate here.
<br />
<br />Also, the reason I asked to try Internet Explorer is to isolate the problem, I am not asking you to use Internet Explorer full time. Besides, its in Windows 10 for compatibility and testing. 
<br />
<br />You said you just updated to the Fall Creators Update, but the issue existed before the upgrade. Again, I am trying to isolate the problem. Edge now has a built in repair option, its at least worth a try.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-microsoft-edge-web-browser-windows-10-1709/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-repair-m...</a>
<br />
<br />Edge is a very new and still maturing web browser. It might be built into Windows 10, but certainly doesn't mean its the most compatible, yet. There are many web sites that don't support it. You did point out something important, the pages don't load in Chrome either. 
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />Which Antivirus or other security utility are you using?
<br />
<br />Awaiting your reply.

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help, it is very much appreciated.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is only a year old.&nbsp; It came with Windows 10 installed (as already stated).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried adding the specific websites that do not load to my IP's customer's security utility website directly as well as via my own laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep trying to resolve this issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, if there is anyone out there who has found the solution to this problem, please let us all&nbsp; know :-).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards.</p>

            yes i only bought the printer 9 days ago i have had a kodak agent try to (remotely )install them ,and they wont install either from the installation disc or online he seems to think that my os is at fault, and that microsoft will be able to help me. i
 had a esp5 printer which worked ok and i just re placed a black ink cartridge and the computer can not find the drivers! another kodak agent couldnt solve this either, and came up with the same answer as the previous one!

            <p>HI. I HAVE THIS PROBLEM WITH A KODAK PRINTER HERO 7.1 RE WINDOWS STARTER EDITION ON MY NOTEBOOK. NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS PRINTER WORKING WITH THIS NOTEBOOK. WHEN I BOUGHT IT ABOUT A YEAR AGO, I HAD 2 PEOPLE FROM KODAK SPEND WORK ON THE ISSUE--ONE
 DID IT REMOTELY FOR ABOUT 2HRS! THE CONCLUSION WAS THAT IT WAS A WINDOW OPERATING SYSTEM PROBLEM. I GAVE UP, &amp; JUST NOW CHECKING ON THIS PROBLEM AGAIN WITH MY 32 BIT WINDOWS STARTER EDITION. I SAW THAT THERE WAS SOME SOFTWARE UPDATE PUT OUT IN JAN 2013 THAT
 POSSIBLY MIGHT RESOLVE THIS MATTER FOR ME. I WILL DOWNLOAD IT, &amp; SEE IF IT WORKS. I ALWAYS KEEP THIS NOTEBOOK ON AUTOMATIC UPDATES, SO ALL THE DRIVERS SHOULD BE UPDATED, BUT I WILL CHECK THAT ONCE AGAIN ALSO. IF I FIND OUT ANYTHING THAT MIGHT HELP FURTHER,
 I WILL ADD IT ON A POST. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THIS MATTER---THIS PROBLEM WAS SO FRUSTRATING DARN AS I &amp; KODAK REPS SPENT HOURS ON IT OVER A YEAR AGO, THEN JUST GAVE UP USING THAT NEW KODAK PRINTER---BUT I HAVE A FEELING THAT NEW SOFTWARE RELEASED IN JAN 2013 IS THE KEY.

            <p>I just ran into the same issue troubleshooting the same model of printer and was able to find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When using the Kodak All-in-One Printer Home Center Software (the only driver download that Kodak offers) it would install the drivers for everything but the printer and fail out after a while saying it couldn't communicate with the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking behind the scenes it seemed like it was trying to get a driver from Windows update but wasn't able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did to resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went into the Device Manager in Windows (here's a guide for that:&nbsp;http://pcsupport.about.com/od/windows7/ht/device-manager-cp-windows-7.htm)</p>
<p>Found the Eastman Kodak Hero AiO 7.1 under Other Devices</p>
<p>Right clicked on the printer and clicked on Update Driver Software</p>
<p>Then clicked on 'Search automatically for updated driver software'</p>
<p>Took a little while to find the driver through Windows Update but eventually it found the driver and installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing I did that may have helped was to go into Add Printer through Devices and Printers, clicked Add a local Printer, chose USB from the Use an existing port option, then clicked the Windows Update button on the Install the printer driver page.
 This goes through and grabs all of the printer drivers from Windows Update (takes some time) and after it finished it had the option for the Hero AiO 7.1 XPS under Eastman Kodak.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps anyone that's run into the same issue.</p>
<p />
