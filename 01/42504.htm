<h2>            Win 10 - Explorer - Nav Bar - OneDrive Folder</h2>
                    <p>When I open Explorer, OneDrive opens to its full tree, which takes up all of the visible realestate, and my 'Quick Access' folders are pushed up and out of sight.&nbsp; Then I constantly have to drag OneDrive down and out of the way. . . about 100 - 200 times
 a day. &nbsp;&nbsp; So, I'm a little frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried "Right Click Quick Access&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; click 'Options'&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; click 'View'&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; scroll all the way to the bottom and clear&nbsp;&nbsp; 'Expand to Open Folder'&nbsp;&nbsp; and clear 'Show all Folders' and clear&nbsp; 'Show Libraries'&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; However, these controls only seem to control
 the other Folders/items in Explorer Nav Bar.&nbsp; One Drive continues to Open to 'Fully Expanded' &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Tech guy has no other ideas,&nbsp;&nbsp; except quit using OneDrive, and replace it with GoogleDrive or DropBox, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I give up, I gotta at least try one more time.</p>
<p>Ideas?</p>

<p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you’ve encountered regarding the folder view from the <strong>Navigation Pane</strong> of the
<strong>File Explorer</strong> window on your <strong>Windows 10 </strong>computer may be caused by some configuration on the system. To sort out your concern, we suggest that you
<strong>restore the program to its default settings</strong>. This is to re-establish the good working state of the program and check if the issue is not related to it. To do this, you may follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>File Explorer</strong> and then press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. On the File Explorer window, click the <strong>View</strong> tab
<strong>&gt; Options &gt; Change folder and search options</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">3. Click the <strong>View</strong> tab on the <strong>
Folder Options</strong> window.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">4. Under the <strong>Folder views</strong> section, click the
<strong>Reset Folders </strong>button <strong>&gt; Yes</strong>.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">5. Click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">6. Once you’re done, you may check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, if the issue continues, we recommend that you run the <strong>System File Checker (SFC) tool
</strong>to scan and correct if there’s a possible integrity violation on the system. To do this, you may follow the steps provided on this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="System File Checker tool">link</a></strong></em>. Once you’re on the page, you
 may expand and proceed with the steps from the <strong>Windows 10, Windows 7, or Windows Vista</strong> option under the
<strong>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</strong> section, and then complete the process. After completing the steps, you may check if you’re able to use your computer properly.</p>

<h2>            Applications and Programs are taking a long time to respond. What could be the problem&#63;</h2>
                    Every program and application is taking a long time to respond, except IE is very quick.&nbsp; I notice I have 114 processes running in the background. Could this be an issue? I have Norton, Malwarebytes, and CC Cleaner and they do not detect a virus.&nbsp; I've
 opened Task Manager Application Processes and Services and cannot tell what is necessary to have running and what can be deleted.

<p>I would recommend running a scan with HitmanPro (https://www.hitmanpro.com/en-us/hmp.aspx) the software detects any pups and has pretty good detection rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't work i would recommend using Process Monitor (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) or Comodo KillSwitch (http://help.comodo.com/topic-119-1-328-3523-.html) both programs can help you see what is happening with
 your computer.</p>

            I have a similar problem. I find ccleaner and norton type things do nothing. NOTHING. I used the Windows debug tool and it shows me several problems in the program code, but I am no closer in knowing what the correct lines of codes to enter than I am figuring
 out what the Egyptyian Pyramids were built for....&nbsp; I get code:0X80070003. One of the problems is in a JavaScript update . I don't know if it's that. I went back to previous JavsScript and it did'nt help. I don't have a good recovery disc either. I might have
 to reinstall with a $5.00 Disc off Ebay if I can't get help on here.

<h2>            Upgrade win 10 home to win 10 pro, keep win 10 home activation key for VM&#63;</h2>
                    My current OS is Win 10 home, upgraded from win 8.1.&nbsp; It is an OEM installation. &nbsp;<br />
I have the activation key saved in a safe place.<br />
I also have a vmware vm running the same OS (win 10 home) with the same <br />
activation key (yes, I know that won't work for the long term as the vm or <br />
guest OS requires a new activation key).<br />
<br />
I want to upgrade the host OS to win 10 pro (via the Settings/Update &amp; <br />
Security/Activation/Go to Store button, while still being able to use the<br />
guest OS (win 10 home) and original activation key.&nbsp; Is this possible?<br />
My fear is the original activation key for win 10 home will be nullified.<br />
<br />
End result, win 10 pro as host OS, win 10 home as guest OS, TWO LEGAL keys.<br />
<br />
Note:&nbsp; I already created a win 10 home ISO and USB drive using the <br />
MediaCreationToolx64.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.

Activation in Windows 10 - Windows Help</a>&nbsp; the upgrade to Pro uses the new Digital Entitlement activation method which ties your hardware signature to that license for the life of the hardware.&nbsp; Because this is a new activation method we're not fully aware

            Hi  rainsmajesty0228, you will need to clean install the 32bit version, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Switching to Windows 10 32 bit is free, you don't have to pay for it. As long as you have a qualifying Windows 7 or 8 or Windows 10 license, you are entitled to use it.
<br />Switching requires that you perform a new installation, that means files, applications and settings will be deleted.
<br />
<br />You will have to reinstall applications and native 32 bit drivers.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD or USB, you should see this option.

<br />
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart and reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

    <title>Windows version 1803 RSAT qquestion - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows version 1803 RSAT qquestion</h2>
                    <p>I have installed a LSI MEGARAID 6391-81 in my Lenovo P700 Workstation and am running a RAID 5 Array of three 10TB disks.&nbsp; I have isntalled the MegaRAID Storage Manager&nbsp; (rel 17.05.00.02) from AVAGO.</p>
<p>Trying to log into this software yields to an error.&nbsp; I see the IP of my system but can not log on this software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Broadcom support&nbsp; stated: </p>
<p><em>"MegaRAID Storage Manager (MSM)" was designed to be used for older Controllers (till 6GB/s). It is recommended to use "LSI Storage Authority (LSA)" with 12GB/s controller and newer ones!</em></p>
<p>I am trying to set the LSA to see my controller but can not find anyting on the WEB to help.
</p>
<p>Does somebody know how to set up the LSA on my Window10 version 1803. Or shall update to Version 1903 ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I re-created laterly&nbsp; my system based on a CD with Version 1803. </p>
<p>Many thanks for any hints ......Francois</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I need LSDAP. See screen shot<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7a5fe38-ea4a-4c0c-a501-f4c022fb7636?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a7a5fe38-ea4a-4c0c-a501-f4c022fb7636?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>KDAP login is not configeured obviously.</p>

    <title>Cannot get internet connection from modem by ethernet unless plugged - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolfkil shepard  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot get internet connection from modem by ethernet unless plugged into netgear switch.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I've been struggling for many hours across many days. At this point I am really considering just reinstalling windows in hopes that everything goes back to the way it used to work. Would really appreciate it if someone could help me fix this without
 reinstalling windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wired ethernet connection to my Motorola surfboard modem/router has always worked. I just plug my win 10 pc directly into the router by ethernet and it quickly would connect to the internet without any issues. I recently dug up an old Netgear Prosafe
 8 port GS 108 switch and plugged that same ethernet cable into the switch and connected my pc to the switch with another ethernet. Network was discovered and the internet connection worked. Now the problem arose after using the switch for a short period, the
 internet connection would just cut out (it would show the no network available red X symbol) then it would reconnect to the internet. Sometimes it will disconnect and reconnect multiple times before it stays stable for another half hour or so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After realizing that the netgear switch was acting up like this, I quickly switch back to my old setup (ethernet wired modem directly to the PC) Now when the PC is plugged directly into the router/modem, it shows "Ethernet is not connected" for a few moments
 then shows up as "limited connectivity". </p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get the internet to connect by direct connection to the modem now. It only works when I am using the netgear switch and it keeps dropping in and out. If anyone has any idea how to get my direct connection working again I could really use some help
 =/</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: </p>
<p>I know for sure that it is an issue with between my modem and my PC. We have multiple PCs connected wireless and wired. Mine is the only device having this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't really care to make the switch stop reconnecting I just want to make my old direct connection work again. I think the switch is cursed, I vaguely remember something like this happening before after I used it years ago.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also seems like it is something to do with DCHP. I keep getting a 169 address when doing ipconfig /all directly connected to modem. When plugged into the switch my IP shows correctly as a 192 address.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>+Made sure DHCP is enabled</p>
<p>+Releasing and renewing my IP</p>
<p>+Made sure IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are set to automatic</p>
<p>+Reinstalling/Uninstalling Network drivers</p>
<p>+Followed many tutorials that walked me thru resetting the TCP/IP stack with netsh</p>
<p>
</p><p>will happily send logs of any configuration that leads to figuring this thing out. Thanks in advance guys for any help at all.
</p>
<p>

I would suggest you to check if the netsetter works on different Windows 8 computer or not. If it is not working on other computer also, then it could be an issue with the Net setter.</p>

<h2>            Media center&#47; media player &#47; any other mp3 player causing bluescreen</h2>
                    using above mentioned tools playing music causes Windows 7 after 2-5 to crash with a blue screen (Memory_management).<br />
This behaviour is reproducible and happens whatever player is running.<br />
-I tried to run pc in clean boot environment the same is happening<br />
- i tried sfc /Scannow utility (some errors found in language packages but I cant see any problems caused by this<br />
<br />
Environment<br />
Windows 7 6.1.7600 Build 7600 Home Premium 32 bit<br />
Asus P5b-Vm no special soundcard installed<br />
Nvidia drivers are on the last update level <br />
Soundmax driver is on the last update level<br />
Automatic update is on<br />
<br />
This is a Pc with a dual boot enviroment. XP is running since years on another harddisc. Of course no problems using XP.<br />
Means this problem is coming from and with Windows 7.

<p><span>Hi reimuell,</span></p>
<p><span>Since your XP computer isn’t seeing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), it is more likely to do with the software installed in your
 Windows 7 environment.</span></p>
<p><span>You’ve mentioned about your drivers being updated to the latest level. Were they updated via Windows update or from the Manufacturer’s
 website?</span></p>
<p><span>Since conflicting drivers hold responsible for many of the Blue screen errors, verify from device manager if any of your device driver
 is causing this conflict.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>To go to device manager:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to start and type device manager.<br />
2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select device manager from the control panel list.<br />
3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the device list, see if there’s any exclamation mark or error reported. If so, you can remove the driver related to the device and install a new one.<br />
4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there’s no error reported, you can try disabling one device at a time and test until the problem appears. This will verify which driver is ca the conflict.<br />
5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To disable a driver, right-click on the device and select properties. Go to driver tab and select disable.<br />
<br />
<strong>Disable the following devices (if present).</strong><br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a. Video Cards<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>b. Sound Card&nbsp;<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>c. Network Card&nbsp;<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>d. USB Devices and controller (Please don’t do this if you are&nbsp;using USB keyboard or Mouse or Wireless Keyboard or mouse)<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>e. CD and DVD&nbsp;<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>f.&nbsp; Modems<br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>g. &nbsp;Ports (serial and parallel)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once verified which device is causing the computer to crash, remove the corresponding driver by double-clicking on the device, going to driver tab and clicking on “uninstall”.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Media Player 11 Plugin for Windows 7 64-bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> v1nc3nt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 11 Plugin for Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    Hello, everyone. I was recently attempting to download and install the Windows Media 11 Plugin so that I could get an online radio station to work. For some reason, I always get an error message. I have tried it with both&nbsp;Firefox&nbsp;and Google Chrome. In
 Firefox's case, I click to install the plugin, and it says "no plugin installed" with no message as to a reason. I click on "Install Manually," and it brings up a 503 Error Message. I then tried downloading Windows Media Played 11 itself, even though I just
 got this computer less than a week ago and therefore assumed that the WMP that had come installed with it was the most recent version... However, when I click to download Windows Media Player 11, it says there is no download for this&nbsp;operating&nbsp;system. Is this
 an error in Windows 7, or in my computer? Please help.
                </div>

            Hey Remy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can save a System Image backup from the old drive to external hard drive, or just back up the files to external or flash USB media or to OneDrive (5gb free) and/or Google Drive (15gb free).  Or you can connect the old drive after install to import the files.  
<br />
<br />Then swap the drives,  boot the media provided to do the Clean install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>It's actually surprisingly easy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You make an image backup of the HDD and then restore the backup to the SSD. You end up with everything exactly the same as it was, just on a SSD instead of a HDD. It's like moving a dollar from your left pants pocket to your right - same dollar, different
 pocket. And there are no worries about licensing or activation. I did this myself, and I'm no kind of computer genius.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most retail SSDs come with the image backup software you'll need as well as detailed instructions on how to use it. If yours did not you can probably find the same on the SSD manufacturer's website. The manufacturer's technical support will help you make
 and restore the image.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making and restoring an image is the one sure way to swap hard drives and get it right the first time. Not only that, making an image and restoring the image&nbsp; - once you learn how - is over and done with very quickly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>If</em> your SSD did not come with software and instructions, and the manufacturer doesn't supply them, I really think it's worthwhile to learn how to use a third-party image backup application. One good example of this is the free version of the popular
<a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Macrium Reflect</a>. I won't lie: It will take some time to learn how to use this software. But when you see how easily and quickly you can switch from a HDD to SSD, and do it right
 the first time, I believe you'll agree that it was worth the effort.</p>

            Hi Remy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I thought I answered this earlier.
<br />
<br />You can either save an image of C from the hard drive to apply to the SSD or do a Clean install:
<br />
<br />I would use free Macrium to save a System Image backup to external drive, create it's media to use to boot and apply the image once you swap in the SSD alone.  See this guide:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then do this gold-standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />The tutorial shows how to back everything up so you don't forget anything.  You can do this to external or flash USB drive, or upload up to 5gb to OneDrive or 15gb to Google Drive for storage.  The Macrium image can also be mounted to extract files if needed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Remy, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />
<br />Most Important change - make sure SATA Mode is set to AHCI !
<br />
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi RemyTH
<br />
<br />If you are looping back to the installation menu:
<br />
<br />During the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation media at this point

<h2>            Brother MFC 620CN PRINTING PROBLEMS</h2>
                    I can't get my new Dell Inspiron, window 7 to work my MFC620cn Brother printer properly. I have tried the windows driver listed for this printer but have experienced problems with printing mulitple pages. I have contacted Brother. They tried different
 things but couldn't solve it and I have contacted Dell they haven't helped. I can only think there is a driver incompatability as the printer works fine on my other computer using xp. Is ther a different driver to the one listed on the Dell computer windows
 7 printer drivers?<br />

<p>Hello -- Thanks for your reply but that was not my question&nbsp; ---&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that there is a bug with the 1903 update if its saved on a usb drive ---&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bug in the update is that the update, might/could change the assigned letter to the drive to a new letter&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>so,&nbsp; again, if the usb drive was not&nbsp; "mounted" as a letter, but&nbsp; as a&nbsp; directory link, would that work?&nbsp;</p>

<div>This is all very bazaar, since this issue has been published and a fix is in the works&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is what I did —&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I downloaded the “media creation tool” for win 10 build 1903&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>and created the windows 10 update 1903 to a usb drive (an ISO image is an option too)&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Then executed the “setup.exe” on the created usb drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After a few minutes, the update stop with an error , with the error that the 1903 update can change the drive letter of any USB connected devices, so it could be possible that a usb drive connected as “G:” could become “E:” after the update – and the 1903
 update is on a usb drive&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, the question is if the usb was accessed as a directory link, would that work?&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>

<h3> giftbearer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker is Making All My Videos Blurry. How Do I Fix It&#63;</h2>
                    I looked this up and all I was able to find tutorials on Youtube about this is to go to Advanced and uncheck the two boxes that deal with making the program easier to edit. This did not fix my problem. The blurriness was still there after I closed the
 program and re-opened it. The picture quality in my videos is terrible and looks almost smeared. I heard that there is some way to find a compatability mode and set it for your operating system and that might fix some problems but all I find are options to
 uninstall the program. I am using Windows 8.1 operating system.

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Run the SFC command when troubleshooting a buggy Windows system. SFC works by scanning for and replacing system files that are corrupt, missing, or changed. Even if the SFC command doesn’t repair any files, running it will at least confirm that no system files are corrupted and then you can continue to troubleshoot your system with other methods. You can use the SFC command as long as the computer itself will start. If Windows will start normally, you can run it from an administrative command prompt. If Windows won’t start normally, you can try starting it in Safe Mode or in the recovery environment by booting from your installation media or recovery disc.

<br />
<br />If the above does not work, follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Would you be so kind to say if this solved the problem?

    <title>Proxy server greyed, out, can&#39;t change in policy editor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waynraynwl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Proxy server greyed, out, can&#39;t change in policy editor</h2>
                    <p>Hi There:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am suddenly unable to use my proxy server in Internet Explorer. It is permanently greyed out, and I am forced to use&nbsp;proxy settings which have appeared in the Advanced area. I believe this is the result of malicious software, although I have cleaned it
 off my computer. Nonetheless this problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more specific,&nbsp;after I&nbsp;put a checkmark in the "Use Proxy Server for Your LAN" space, it does not become usable. It&nbsp;stays greyed out.&nbsp;When I click on the Advanced button beside it, I see that a proxy has been put in which is address 127.0.0.1, with
 port 49532, in both HTTP and Secure proxy windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the solution found here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2289942?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>... To no avail. It does not reset. After opening several browsers, the proxy settings go back to the ones above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also saw posts referring to "Disable Changing Proxy Settings" in Group Policy Editor. If this is enabled, users cannot change the Proxy Settings.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming this was enabled on mine, I went into Group Policy Editor to disable it. Here is the catch: This policy no longer exists in my GPE. It's not there. Possibly the malware deleted it, forcing me to use the proxy settings above. So, I need to first
 create this policy, then be sure it is disabled. But I don't know how to create this policy in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please explain how I can create this, or offer other suggestions as to how I can reset my Internet Explorer (11) Proxy Server to be usable? The reset needs to stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks very much,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wayne</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I was finally able to solve this problem permanently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The answer is not Group Policy Editor, but Registry Editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on a comment from Deepak Handa found here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/ie/forum/ie11-iewindows8_1/lan-connection-settings-keep-changing-back-to/76a0f5d2-167f-41fa-bf40-1461b8c01642?page=2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also manually set it through registry editing if your an advanced user<br />
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings]<br />
"MigrateProxy"=dword:00000001<br />
"ProxyEnable"=dword:00000001<br />
"ProxyHttp1.1"=dword:00000000<br />
"ProxyServer"="http://server:port"<br />
<br />
1 for enable and 0 for disable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>... I went into the Regedit&nbsp;Internet Settings and found that the "ProxyEnable" DWORD had been changed to "0" (disabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I set it to 1, which activated it. I still found though that the Proxy Server in Internet Explorer was greyed out. So I then used the Proxy Server Reset Auto-Fix found here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2289942?wa=wsignin1.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>... And between the two&nbsp;of them,&nbsp;my Proxy Server seems to be functioning properly. Meaning it is no longer greyed out, and I can put in whatever proxy address I want and it sticks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps someone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

Don't click on the mouse wheel - use less pressure.

<h3> maldrulsmith  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows logoff sound</h2>
                    my Windows logoff sound is longer than 10 seconds so I keep getting the notice that the logoff sounds is preventing my computer from shutting down. All the solutions I've found so far simply state 'pick a different logoff sound that is less than 10 seconds
 or simply don't have a logoff sound. Those answers are not acceptable. I want to keep my current logoff sound but keep Windows from displaying that annoying message. How do I do that?

<p>There's no way to completely disable it.&nbsp; If any program at all (not just a sound but ANY program) causes your logoff/shutdown to be delayed, then you will get informed about it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But you <strong>can</strong> decide how long the delay has to be before the system warns about it.&nbsp; See here:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/282062/control-how-long-windows-waits-before-killing-apps-at-shutdown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Control

            <p>Hello Cherie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you referring to inserting Memory card?</p>
<p>Are you concerned about Auto play?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me confirm that Windows 10 come with built-in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/photos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Photos app</a>. Through which you can View, Edit or Organize photos accordingly. The Photos app automatically enhances photos by tweaking things such as color, contrast, brightness or red eyes, or even straightening a slanted horizon, as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Usually whenever you connect the device, Auto play will automatically pop-up on the top right corner&nbsp;with&nbsp;an options like,
<strong>Import Photos and Videos, </strong></span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Import Photos and Videos to OneDrive, Open device to view files
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">and </span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Take no action.&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you select
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open device to view files,
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">then it allows you open the view the files with Photos app by default. You can access
</span>Windows Media Player by clicking <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Windows Media Player
</strong>into the search space and select the same from the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 not starting from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a MSI GS60 Ghost Pro.&nbsp; The laptop is relatively new so I do not think it is a hardware issue.&nbsp; I recently downloaded a Windows update which I think came out around Thanksgiving (or at least that is when I noticed it).&nbsp; The problem is that when
 I close my laptop and then open it back up, it boots into the bios but not Windows.&nbsp; Instead all I get is the black screen as if it is transitioning to Windows (hopefully I am making sense).&nbsp; Again, I never get to the Windows login screen for my laptop.&nbsp; When
 I open up my laptop I see the MSI logo, a loading symbol, and then the screen goes black.&nbsp; The only way I can access Windows is by manually restarting my laptop.&nbsp; Any help or advice would be much appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved from: Windows / Windows 10 / Windows update, recovery, &amp; backup</p>

            What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<p>Hello Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick reply.&nbsp; So far I have tried calling MSI, but have not heard back from them yet.&nbsp; This was the next place I turned to.&nbsp; This has been happening ever since last Wednesday (11/22).&nbsp; According to the update install history, the most recent
 update was a feature update as well as some quality and driver updates&nbsp; According to the update install history, I am currently on Windows version 1709.&nbsp; I do not know which version I updated from.&nbsp; I have tried the first two of your suggested options.&nbsp; They
 did not work.&nbsp; I will try resetting the bios some other time.&nbsp; It might be best if I take it into the Geek Squad or Microcenter before I do that as I understand that if you are not careful with the bios that you can lose information on your computer.&nbsp; I see
 in the recovery option under the update and security tab in Windows settings that there is a way I can reset my PC.&nbsp; Do you think it would be a good idea to try resetting to a previous version of Windows before taking it in to get the bios checked out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ryan</p>

            If you perform a reset, it is likely to reinstall Windows 10 1709. You could try that to see if it helps. 
<br />
<br />I don't see any updated drivers for your make and model since 2015 though:
