<h2>            Legal - changing XP classic logon screen banner image&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've recently discovered how to change the XP "classic logon screen" banner up the top to a logo of my choice, however, before I deploy this change to all the clients in my network, I would like to know if there are any legal issues with removing the existing
 "Windows XP" banner. Does anyone have any information on this? Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>If you don't know which banner i'm talking about, see this image: <a href="http://yfrog.com/5nwindowsxpctrlaltdeletelj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>All you need to do is replace msgina.dll in the system32 folder with a program like reshack (this is safe to use, and is free)</p>

                    I have to clear files from my Laptop which is running Vista. I have cleared all the usual culprits and then could not understand where all the space was being used. I ran Diskdetective and found out that it was windows itself!!! My windows folder takes
 up 25GB of a 50GB partition. The main culprit is the WinSxS folder, how can I reduce this folder as CCleaner or other programs do not touch it.&nbsp;

<h2>            How To Pin Spreadsheets to Program Icons In Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've seen a million questions about how to pin a file to taskbar or start menu in Windows 10. I wanted to share something that I found. Did you know you can pin individual spreadsheets to the Excel Program icon context menu so that wherever the program icon
 appears you have access to&nbsp; your spreadsheet, including in the Start Menu or on the taskbar?</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Drop a shortcut of a spreadsheet on your desktop.</li><li>Rename it to what you want to have appear within the program context menu. This is the menu that appear when you right click a program icon in Start Menu or on Taskbar.</li><li>Make sure you either have the Excel open or already pinned to your taskbar. As long as Excel is currently showing up on your taskbar.</li><li>Click and drag the shortcut from your desktop onto the top of the Excel icon on the taskbar until you are asked if you want to pin it. Say yes.</li><li>To test, right click any Excel program icon in order to get the context menu to appear. You should see your spreadsheet shortcut in the menu now.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, Microsoft, for giving us this awesome option.</p>

    <title>Custom Xbox 360 controllers&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> itinerarychief0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Custom Xbox 360 controllers&#63;</h2>
                    I am currently looking to paint my Xbox 360 controller to the Ohio State color theme. I really like the color gray of the stock bottom headset trim and I was wondering if anyone could help me out with what kind of gray it is. Or if there is a way to get
 ahold of the specific gray paint that Microsoft uses, that would be even better. P.S. I am not in any way modding or customizing my controller to either give me an advantage in online multiplayer gaming or messing with any Microsoft logos or anything that
 would interfere with any sort of licensing Microsoft has on the controllers. I am only looking to color my controller.

<p>dude, im sorry but this was not the smartest of questions,</p>
<p>1. your controller is your controller you can do with it what you like except for mod it</p>
<p>2.they have tons of websites where you can get your controller painted custom</p>
<p>3. they would not even notice if you DID paint your own controller</p>
<p>sorry if this was rude, but if this helped get back to me please</p>

<p>There is no issues with you doing anything to your controller if it doe's not involve you modding it\giving yourself an unfair advantage over others in any games. There are alot of websites out there that could help you I am sure. I don't know how to suggest
 finding a certain color of paint besides maybe bringing in something that is the color you like to a store and comparing it to the colors they have there on display. Hopefully this has helped with your question.</p>

<h2>            Touchscreen scroll in chrome not working</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Hi<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a scroll problem in chrome with a Microsoft Surface pro 4, scroll with one finger on screen (not with touchpad).</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Sometimes, when I wake the surface from sleep, the one finger scroll in chrome doesn't work anymore (sometimes it register it as a "right click").</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
When this happen, the scroll is still working fine in edge.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
The only solution workaround I have found is a reboot.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
I have tried disabling/ enabling all HID-device with "touchscreen" in the name without sucess. I have done all the window update without sucess. I have tried reinstalling chrome</p>
<p style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">
Any idea ?</p>

            While it has nothing really to do with the taskbar, it just your web searches to return screen reader friendly results
<br />
<br />From the Edge Webpage:
<br />
<br />"Search for anything on the web or your device using the search box on the Windows taskbar. If you use a screen reader, follow these steps to make the web search results open in Internet Explorer instead of Microsoft Edge"

Thanks for posting your question on the&nbsp;<span>the Microsoft Windows Vista Community site.<br />

Yes. Microsoft Office 2000 will run in Vista, but if you are unable to obtain the updates to run it, it may prove to be problematic.<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t load from USB or DVD UEFI, secure boot</h2>
                    <p>So I have read lot of post about this, but I think my BIOS is just bugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Noblex NB1501U Notebook with windows 8 installed, I wanted to change to windows 7 but when I access the BIOS option and set to legacy OS support on the boot menu nothing else appears beside the "windows startup" option. I tried several times with
 CD/DVD or USB plugged in and nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something that I'm missing ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And another thing: what would happen if I install windows 7 directaly from windows 8 with setup.exe ? I mean since the legacy boot doesn't seems to work, that would screw up everything right ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for my bad English and thanks.</p>

<h3> dre g writer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Man, I really hate insta kills</h2>
                    
<p>Got damn do I hate them.<br />
<br />
Seeing as I play most of my characters as melee types, this really puts me at a disadvantage against every enemy type but the geth.
<br />
<br />
So I haven't played this game in a while(since the release of the N7 characters) and just got back into it with the release of the last multiplayer pack and I fought the collectors for the first time, had no idea that collectors were even in this game.<br />
<br />
So me, using a Krogan warlord, just running up to everything and smashing it with my hammer, I runs up to a Scion, NOT KNOWING it was capable of insta killing, I started swinging away, and one melee hit, took his life down to one bar, and I was about to deliver
 the final blow and right in the middle of my melee animation, my melee animation is stopped, and the camera pans around and he knocks me to the floor and he KOs me.......................*sigh*....................got ****.<br />
<br />
<br />
So many enemies have insta kills. And I hate the fact that once your insta killed, its a wrap for the rest of the match. No team mates can help you up or anything.<br />
<br />
And I don't like that they can interrupt my heavy melee attack with their attacks.<br />
<br />
This really discourages me to even play sometimes as I can't play how I want to play as the way they designed these enemies discourages that style of gameplay forcing me to stay back behind cover and shoot with my level 1 and 2 pee shooters.
<br />
<br />
My weapons can't do $h!t, as I said, I haven't played this game in quite a while so there's a bunch of weapons I dont have and the ones I do have are around that level 1-5 level with only the starting weapons being at level 10. My gear is also lacking with
 gear at level 1 and a bunch of gear tat I don't have, which is why I go the melee route as I can increase damage output to max with perk use. But against anything that can insta kill, I can't do anything as soons as I get a hit off, before i can even run away,
 their animation catches me and im done for the whole round.<br />
<br />
I is sad............*puppy pout face*&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So.......<br />
..........yea</p>
<p>..............You may now proceed to call me names and such if that's your thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then shift your focus to sweeping up the enemies that can't insta kill you and leave the others for your teammates. That's what I do when I play the Krogan Warlord and Havok Soldier. Of course I will take back attacks if the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>A reference list for the instant kill enemies:</p>
<p>Reapers- Banshee and Brute</p>
<p>Cerberus- Atlas and Phantom. I want to say the damn turret but since you can revive yourself it isn't. Steer clear of it though.</p>
<p>Collectors- Praetorian and Scion.</p>
<p>Geth- None but I'd steer clear of Geth Pyros too. There flame's reach is ridiculous.</p>

<p>I've noticed this also, if you have the option use the Geth Juggernaut, &nbsp;powered up his melee is as strong as a Krogan but the advance is that his melee is electrical and it stuns most enemies so when your near then they cant retaliate. Most of my kills
 on multiplayer are with this method. Also he is a power house when it comes to taking damage and he hardly goes down.</p>

<p>I primarily use the Krogan Battlemaster and spam out Biotic Charge to get into range when these opportunities open up. &nbsp;The Krogan Warlord is going to have to stay relatively close (but still far enough to avoid 1 hit-kills) to capitalize on these moments.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Banshees &nbsp;= &nbsp;She can only 1 hit-kill you when she is doing her teleport dash routine or when she has the "Super-Saiyan" aura thing going on. &nbsp;When she stops, she will use Reave / Warp 3 times and then scream (this will give her a "Super-Saiyan" aura thing
 once again) and then proceed back to her teleport dashing routine; run away! &nbsp;When she uses Reave / Warp, move in and land as many hits as you can before she gets out of this cycle.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Brutes &nbsp;= &nbsp;The only safe time to melee this thing is to catch it as it does its chest pounding taunt or after evading its charging heavy melee attack (there is a long post-melee animation that it has to go through), so get your hits in and run away.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Atlas &nbsp;= &nbsp;This hulking tin cannot 1 hit-kill you if it is using its Triple Shot Attack or Missile attack. &nbsp;Rush in when you see these opennings and start unloading on the hurt, running away immediately after landing some blows.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Phantoms &nbsp;= &nbsp;The only safe time for you to melee her is when she hides behind cover because there is a 1 second delay before she can start swinging her sword.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Praetorians &nbsp;= This massively hallway congesting crab like thing cannot 1 hit-kill you if it is using it is doing its Optic Blasting attack (Cyclops from the X-men) or lauching its homing projectiles at you.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Scions &nbsp;= &nbsp;This Flood (from halo) like opponent cannot 1 hit-kill you if it is doing its triple shot attack or multiple grenade barrage attack (when possessed only) or after dodging its swinging melee attack.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>If you don't mind me asking, you said that your "starting weapons" are already at level 10. &nbsp;Which ones specifically are at level 10? &nbsp;What level / kind of weapon mods do you have? &nbsp;They are not useless dude, the mere fact that they're at level 10 means
 that you have the maximum damage output / ammo capacity for them. &nbsp;I am not sure what level / kind of weapon mods you have, but you might want to give these a try &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Extension Barrel &nbsp;= &nbsp;This attachment usually goes at the end of the gun's barrel. &nbsp;I highly recommend using this as every little bit of extra damage goes a long way</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Stability Damper &nbsp;= &nbsp;I strongly recommend using this for the Avenger X and Tempest X as your accuracy will greatly increase due to the reduce recoil issue</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Armor-Piercing mod &nbsp;= &nbsp;I highly recommend that you use the Extension Barrel for the Predator X in conjunction with this to pierce through the Guardian's shields</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Spare Thermal Clip &nbsp;= &nbsp;This is highly recommended for use in conjuction with the Extension Barrel on you Viper X and Katana X</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>On a closing note, since your Krogan Warlord doesn't care about cool down time, I would highly suggest that you arm him with your Viper X (Extension Barrel mod and Spare Thermal Clip mod) and Katana X (Extension Barrel mod and Spare Thermal Clip mod). &nbsp;With
 this loadout, you can simply shoot large 1 hit-kill capable enemies with your Viper X and unleash hell with your Katana X on Phantoms while moving backwards when you're simultaneously shooting her. &nbsp;I hope that you find at least some of this information helpful.
 &nbsp;Have a nice day or afternoon or night and good luck &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>To sum up my viewpoint, OP if you dont have a good gun then you should be playing Bronze, Silver at best. If you dont like insta kills then play the geth. Also it isnt that "it stuns most enemies so when your near then they cant retaliate" its that the Juggernaut
 cannot be insta killed.Advice, &nbsp;stay just far away that they cant grab you. </p>

<p>That's some good info Fei. I usually just Play Gold with the krogan battlemaster, and I use my reegar shotgun(level2). I usually just use that to tear down barriers, and shields as I found that shotgun to take down their defences the fastest and be able
 to use the 25% melee mod. I rarely use my weapons as I just run around the battlefield just swinging my hammer like a mad man.<br />
<br />
when I fight those instant killers, I back away and shoot till I can get their health low enough to where I can kill them in one melee hit. But sometimes, them fools sneak up on you. I usually keep my distance from those enemies, but it was just that one time
 where I fought the collectors for the first time and learning them fools insta kill too, was just kind of pissing me off.</p>
<p>But for equipment gear slot, I use a level two joint mod that increase melee by 12%.</p>
<p>I got my tech armor giving me 40% melee damage.<br />
<br />
my shotgun giving me 25% melee damage.<br />
<br />
as far as melee from the health/sheild increasing perks, I went straight melee. <br />
<br />
30% melee from rank 4, <br />
75% melee damage from melee kils for 45 seconds from rank 5 <br />
another 40% melee damage from rank 6<br />
when I kill one enemy with melee, that puts me into rage mode which adds another 105% melee damage, and then the 1500 or so damage from biotic hammer...............yea, lots of melee damage, which is why i be going hamuk on the battlefield.
<br />
<br />
I hit a brute or scion once and they have around one or two bars of armor left, but sometimes, I get greedy, seeing they only have one bar, I try to take the last shot with a regular melee, and then, I pay the price for my greediness with death.<br />
<br />
And everytime, I be saying, "man, I should of just ran away"<br />
<br />
Even then, sometimes running away don't always work.<br />
<br />
This is sometimes bad as sometimes I would hit a enemy, and they would stumble, but not take any damage, THIS is where the I die the damn most, trying to do a second melee attack, which I KNOW will kill them in one hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im sorry to say this but this is what happens when you put an inexperienced player in the driver seat of an overpowered character. Being overpowered isnt enough you need to know how to use the character and not do this" I rarely use my weapons as I just
 run around the battlefield just swinging my hammer like a mad man". I certainly would kick you in a gold match. There is no place for a guy who thinks he is a one man army in a team based game especially when he doesnt have or use a good gun.</p>
<p>As the vorcha said in the citadel dlc, you come back and see when you your have level 10.</p>

<p>I can definitely relate to you with wanting to get that last hit in to take down the target dude (because I used to do it too). &nbsp;I've learned to stop doing this (trying to sneak in the last extra hit) because I now primarily play private solo-runs on Bronze
 and Silver using my Krogan Battlemaster, as such I need to be super careful of what I do. &nbsp;The Krogan Battlemaster is my number one favorite character out of the entire roster. &nbsp;Furthermore, he (the Krogan Battlemaster) is the only character that I've considered
 "Gold solo-run capable" and I was incredibly shocked and surprised that I was able to accomplish this task (a Gold solo-run) on my first attempt. &nbsp;Dude, it was the most difficult match that I've ever played, ever! &nbsp;I was relentlessly being pounded on by the
 Geth (because they can't 1 hit-kill me) on Firebase Glacier Hazard Edition. &nbsp;The hazardous unkillable seeker swarm was an incredibly effective ally here. &nbsp;My Wraith X (+25 weapon damage mod &amp; +90% ammo mod) was super effective because my build gave me an addition
 25% extra weapons damage after a successful Biotic Charge; add to this the fact that I was using the Shotgun Rail Amp 3 for extra damage. &nbsp;Other people have had success solo-running Gold with other characters, but the Krogan Battlemaster is what did it for
 me. &nbsp;I was also using Disruptor Ammo 4 and Cyclonic Modulator 4 along with my Shield Booster 5 Gear (+30% more shields). &nbsp;In total I had +180% more shields from 1850. &nbsp;Also, I've noticed that Phantoms love to come in from behind an Atlas or Guardian and rush
 you as your shooting something else. &nbsp;I now capitalize on this on Silver by paying extra close attention to see if she (the Phantom) will use this tactic or sneak up behind me. &nbsp;Upon confirmation of this (rushing me from the front), I promptly prepare a welcoming
 present for my stab happy guest, a Cobra Missile. &nbsp;Bam! &nbsp;Just like that, no more Atlas + surrounding enemies and Phantom to worry about &nbsp;:) &nbsp;I would also highly recommend not to use your Biotic Charge against the Phantom unless you have a straight line towards
 her because if you use the Biotic Charge in some kind of weird angle, it will not register and she will 1 hit-kill you. &nbsp;I have died so many times as a result of this that I pretty much need to draw her into the proper Biotic Charge position to use my Biotic
 Charge + Wraith X to the face combo or home-run swinging her into the next planet with a heavy melee attack combo &nbsp;:) &nbsp;As far as acquiring better weapons / mods / gear /consumables is concerned, playing on Bronze is an excellent way to earn about 15,000 credits
 (+10% more if you get extracted) without having to resort to using any Cobra Missiles, Ops Survival Packs, Medigel, and Ammo Packs. &nbsp;Silver is absolutely awesome when you have a good squad, but the chances of you using a Cobra Missile, Ops Survival Pack, Medigel,
 and Ammo Packs is high. &nbsp;Personally, I love the Spectre Pack and I'm very happy with the stuff that its been giving me &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Spectre Packs cost 39,999 credits less than than Premium Spectre Packs (99,999 credits). &nbsp;I remember purchasing a lot of Veteran Packs
 when I first started playing ME3 multiplayer and weapons like the Mantis, Tempest, Scimitar, etc... have a good drop rate here; resulting in level 10 weapons quickly. &nbsp;Veteran Packs are an awesome deal as they only cost 20,000 credits and you get stuff like
 Cyclonic Modulator 2s, Disruptor Ammo 2s, and Armor-piercing Ammo 2. &nbsp;Have a good day or afternoon or night everyone! &nbsp;:) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>Ah but when you buy a spectre pack it is forty credits cheaper, but when you buy a second one then you have spent &nbsp;120,000 credits for basically a PSP. As a PSP is equal to two spectra packs. as I said before to each their own.</p>

<p>Nice Lei, Before the krogan warlord, the krogan battlemaster was my favorite.<br />
<br />
The vanguard class was my favorite class in Mass Effect one, two, and 3, so when I learned of a krogan being able to biotic charge to restore shields and be at point blank range to an enemy, he became my favorite before I even tried em.<br />
<br />
But the warlord, his melee damage is just stupid. And his health regenerates at a very fast rate when in rage, his regeneration is the key reason I like using him.<br />
<br />
I wish that all krogan had regeneration ability like they do in single player, but on a krogan battle master who was able to restore his shields in a second and have his life regen, he would be un-killable........................unless a damn insta-kill gets
 in the way. So I can clearly see they took that away as a balancing thing. But it would be fun though.<br />
<br />
Im quite impressed you were able to get through gold with the battlemaster. the highest I even gotten in gold against beth by myself was wave seven with the krogan warlord with a level 3 melee and shield boost. I was able to take down most enemies fairly quicky,
 but it was getting to the point where just too many strong enemies were rushing me all at the same time.<br />
<br />
I will start buying the regular spectre packs as you say that way I can stock up on my gear and mods a lot quicker as to just buying the premium as I will be able to get more items from two specter packs which gains me 10 times than one premium which gains
 me 5.<br />
<br />
So now I can buy a specter pack after every gold match instead of one premium after every two gold matches.<br />
<br />
Great advice Lei!!!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Any way to disable Power Option Brightness between Battery&#47;Plugged In&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Gigabyte laptop (i7 Processor, 16GB RAM, Nvidia 780M graphics card) running Windows 10.&nbsp; I run the High Performance Power Plan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am finding that the brightness is automatically adjusting when the battery power fluctuates at around 100%.&nbsp; The laptop switches to battery at 100% even while plugged in and then switches to AC power when under 100%.&nbsp; Because Windows 10 adjusts my brightness
 when switching between plugged in and battery, this creates a constant brightness level reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each brightness shift creates a lag for some reason which is especially noticeable when running anything in an intense graphical mode (I have a NVIDIA graphics card in addition to the Intel built-in).&nbsp; I've tried setting the Plan Brightness between Battery/Plugged
 In to be the same level and that doesn't stop the Power Option Setting from setting the brightness level anyways even if the level isn't changing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am almost always using a separate HDMI monitor which is unaffected by the Windows brightness setting so it makes even less sense why my system lags.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop battery is not quickly removable (requires disassembly), so it isn't a viable option to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for a way to disable the Windows Power Plan from making Brightness changes when switching between Battery or Plugged In profiles.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Did this work successfully before on your computer?<br />
2. Have you installed HP Officejet Full Feature Software and Driver for this printer?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
You need to check a few things. <br />
First, check that the color cartridge has not run out. Also check that in the printer settings you have not chosen to print in grayscale. You may check these settings with HP support.</div>
<div><br />
Let us try these methods as well and verify if it resolves the issue.<br />
<strong>a. Run Printer Troubleshooter.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>If your computer is having problems printing, try using the Printer troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that a printer is connected to your computer, and it checks for common issues such as whether the printer has enough paper and toner to
 complete printing your document.</div>
<div>Refer to the article below for steps.<br />
<strong>Open the Printer troubleshooter</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2. </strong></div>
<div>You need to install the full feature software and driver pack to ensure everything works fine.<br />
Here is the link.<br />
HP Officejet Full Feature Software and Driver<br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-67766-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;os=181&amp;product=3795406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-67766-1&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;os=181&amp;product=3795406</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3.<br />
</strong>You can try few troubleshooting methods as mentioned on the HP website.</div>
<div><strong>Printed Colors Are Not the Colors Expected</strong><br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01641184&amp;tmp_task=solveCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;product=3795406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01641184&amp;tmp_task=solveCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;product=3795406</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Printing a Printer Status Report</strong><br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01659965&amp;tmp_task=useCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3795406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c01659965&amp;tmp_task=useCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3795406</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Using the HP Print Diagnostic Utility in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02072599&amp;tmp_task=useCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3795406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?docname=c02072599&amp;tmp_task=useCategory&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3795406</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since this printer is not compatible with Windows 7 although it works on Windows 7 however it may limit some features. You may check with HP support.</div>
<div><strong>Here is the HP support link for this printer:</strong><br />
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3795406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;product=3795406</a></div>

<p>Try uninstalling McAfee and see if the errors resolve.</p>

<p>Consider using alternative security software such as Windows 8 built-in antivirus and firewall software.</p>

<p>If you want to use McAfee you could try uninstalling and reinstalling McAfee and if the problem persists contact McAfee support and/or post the issue on the McAfee community forums.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#34;Unable to display current owner&#34; error</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>So, I've attempted to download some files using a BitTorrent client called BitLord. &nbsp;The first few files had no issues, but the last 2 did. &nbsp;When attempting to navigate to the files using Windows Explorer, they don't show up (these two files each are in
 separate sub-folders, and the sub-folders don't show up). &nbsp;When navigating files and folders from the program "Any Video Converter" the sub-folders appear, with a small padlock symbol in the lower right-hand corner. &nbsp;Each file inside its own sub-folder does
 not display a padlock. &nbsp;When I right click on a file or folder from within Any Video Converter and check the security tab, there is no, "OWNER CREATOR" like there usually is, and I cannot change any properties of the file (though I can view them). &nbsp;From within
 Any Video Converter, I can copy or move the file from within the hidden sub-folder, but I cannot copy it out of the folder. &nbsp;If I select from within BitLord, "Browse download directory" I get an error message from Windows saying that it doesn't exist or can't
 be found (one of those two). &nbsp;It says that it may be on a local drive or on a mapped network drive, and to check my network connection. &nbsp;It is on a local drive. &nbsp;So, how do I fix this error? &nbsp;Will I have to boot into safemode, or somesuch? &nbsp;Also, I have Windows
 7 Professional.</p>

            I found a temporary workaround. &nbsp;Using that program, Any Video Converter, I can delete my files and/or folders, then restore them, and then they show up, and I can take Ownership, etc, but I shouldn't have to do this. &nbsp;I'll see about writing a formal report
 to Microsoft. &nbsp;Other people have had similar problems. &nbsp;I found out, though, what's causing the problem is that when I have programs that were designed for Windows XP create new folders or files in Windows 7, that's when the error occurs.
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: This was marked as an answer by someone named Lisa. &nbsp;This is not a solution, it's a workaround. &nbsp;Microsoft still needs to fix whatever is causing the error. &nbsp;A solution (answer) will keep this problem from arising again in the future.</div>

This will not work with windows 7 home premium edition as the administrator account is disabled for no good reason.&nbsp; You can try creating a new second admin account and try to change ownership from that account.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Contact disappearing from group</h2>
                    
<p>We have a member of our company who is having an issue with two specific contacts being removed from his Contact Group each time Skype for Business is restarted. &nbsp;One is back regularly now but the other will not remain in the group. &nbsp;I tried the script that
 I located in another thread regarding this but it would not run. &nbsp;Is there a reason that this is happening to him with just the specific contact?&nbsp;</p>

<p>hi stefaniegray,</p>
<p>to narrow down the root cause, i’d like to confirm the following information first:<br />
1. did the issue occur before, or it just comes out all of a sudden?<br />
2. what’s the detailed version of his skype for business client?</p>
<p>3. by saying "two specific contacts being removed from his contact group each time skype for business is restarted. one is back regularly now but the other will not remain in the group", can you please send us the screenshots of the detailed reproducing
 steps about it?<br />
4. can this issue be reproduced if he log into skype for business on another desktop?<br />
5. regarding ‘i tried the script that i located in another thread regarding this but it would not run.’, could you let us know the script you have tried (any link or article is appreciated.) and why it would not run? are there any error messages? please upload
 them if any. to upload pictures, please click <strong>use rich formatting</strong> and
<strong>insert/edit media</strong>.</p>

<h2>            Cannot install java no prompt messages shown</h2>
                    Hi Good Morning,<br />
<br />
I would like to ask if there's any way to install java.<br />
<br />
First thing is that I try to install the latest version of Java in windows vista, but then after choosing the continue button to proceed on the installation, Java wasn't shown in the screen whether it is downloading or not. So it happened that even though I've
 clicked the Java installer how many times, nothing happens, and its just running on the systems processes at task manager.<br />
<br />
Please relpy I really need to install it.<br />
Thank you very much.

            <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good morning. Thank you for the reply, very much appreciated.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>Yes, the PC that I am using is a Windows 7 OS, but</p>
<p>I encountered that problem on Windows Vista SP1, as I clicked Java, there's no prompt messages that I can choose to proceed on the setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Aside from Java, I encountered a problem also in installing updates on PC. It shows an error of 80072EE2 and 80072EFD which is caused by connection interruption, I've tried the Microsoft Fix Solution, WindowsUpdateDiagnostic and many more but still it did
 not solve the problem. I've installed the updated version of .Net Framework and the SP2 Pack but then, nothing has changed. As I re-run the windows update.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you very much.</p>

 updates; undoing changes'.</p>
<p>Now I am getting very frustrated&nbsp;over this.&nbsp;I have installed every single update successfully before, but I don't know what is causing&nbsp;windows update to fail this time. Please give&nbsp;me some other solution for this. Thanks for help&nbsp;anyway!&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might have caused due to some third party app or any of the security software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets try the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>Disable or uninstall the third party anti-virus software.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have any third party software installed on the computer, then I would suggest you to disable the anti-virus software and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Important Note: </span></strong><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable
 it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check if the issue resolves</span><strong> </strong><strong><span>performing a clean boot.</span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Put the computer into
</span><strong><span>clean boot </span></strong><span>state </span><strong><span>then
</span></strong><strong><span>try</span></strong><strong><span>updating the </span>
</strong><strong><span>Windows.</span></strong> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called Clean Boot.<br />

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run
 a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

<p>I ran the 'sfc /scannow' and after 100% it said "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations." Nothing else.</p>
<p>I also ran the Troubleshooter. It said : </p>

            I uninstalled my anti-virus(Malware Bytes) but nothing happened(all same). So I tried to clean boot which actually helped. As a clicked on restart after applying System Configuration settings, updates started installing. Thanks you Sachin sir. Really appreciates
 your help and time!

            <p>Please kindly ignore the previous message. I installed the updates successfully after clean boot, but after returning to normal boot, I rechecked for updates, and got the same update(Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3124263))
 to install. It restarted my pc system and again failed to install. I then again, clean booted and checked for updates, but it showed the error this time too. I am really upset with this issue. Please help me again. PLEASE!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Edward,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with audio and video on the computer. We will assist you to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may arise due to driver conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to run the </span><strong><span>Audio Troubleshooter </span>
</strong><span>and check if it helps resolve the audio issue.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong><span>in the search bar</span>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>View all</strong> on the top left corner.</span></li><li><span>Click<strong> Playing audio</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>For the video issue, </span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I suggest you to
</span><span>uninstall and reinstall the display driver and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press “<strong>Windows key + X” </strong>and click on <strong>“Device Manager</strong>”.</span></li><li><span>In the list of devices, you should see the Display Drivers.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the device and then select "<strong>Uninstall</strong>".</span></li><li><span>In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</span></li><li><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<strong>Scan for Hardware changes</strong><span>”
</span>option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></li></ul>
<p><span><span>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>
