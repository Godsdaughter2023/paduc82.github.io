<h2>            Is Microsoft Edge going to be work with Dragon Naturally Speaking&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I work with people paralysed by a spinal cord injury and we rely heavily on dictation and speech commands to control the computer and enter text.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On windows 10 we find that Microsoft Edge does not work with Dragon, the main/only speech recognition program available. Fortunatley Internet Explorer is still available on Windows 10 so we can continue to use that. But for how long?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any insight into this issue?</p>

            <p>Youtube offered&nbsp;an update for the PS4 PRO just in&nbsp;time for the release. Its a shame that google won't release a patch for the Xbox One S to support 4k. We bought an 4k streaming console and the only app that supports 4k is NETFLIX&nbsp;:-(</p>

<h2>            Red Lines on Screen as if a drawing tool has been turned on</h2>
                    <p>hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have new hp notebook and desktop with windows 10. The new laptop is wireless; so no cables. I get two red streaks as if a drawing tool has been turned on. I do not think I am in tablet mode but may be. The lines go away sometimes; I think it is caused
 by a drawing program. I hope some one can help. I have a week to take this back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just found this on Yahoo and it says I should return the laptop: https://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20130126215559AA1Qjfj</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody else have an opinion? Certainly not right for a brand new product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>I told you above that is a new HP laptop and I am going to return it tomorrow. Not only does it have this probelme, when I opened it and tried to logon to the net, all sorts of spoofs and malware overwhelmed the Macfee they insist on selling with it. I prefer
 Defender. I then spent hours on the fone with a tech getting the malware and viruses off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not right for a new purchase and that is what Yahoo says: return it. I should not be having to go into bios or any other deep settings to cure problems not caused by me, repairing a new machine? This is nuts. Will try to take it back tomorrow and
 see if I get any satisfaction from Best Buy. Otherwise, never again, if I can help it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So put this on chill for now and I will report back if I need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the clear instructions but I am 65 and disabled. I need to buy products from trusted sources; hope best buy does not fail but they have already as I made an appt. then the "geek" blew me off when I stepped up asking for help.</p>

<h2>            is there a way to see pictures as slideshow if folder is NOT in pictures library&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I can only find information on how to start a slideshow when the folder is in the pictures library.</p>
<p>But how can I do this from a regular documents folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have several folders that have mixed docs and pics. These folders are stored under documents library, not pictures.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to SEE/SCAN through the hundreds of photos that exist in a folder.
</p>
<p>I do not want to have to click on 200 jpg files to see them in succession. </p>
<p>I do not want to create a separate slideshow as a presentation. </p>
<p>I do not want to have to move the folder location to the pictures library just to scan through the pictures.
</p>
<p>I am willing to use a separate app, but would prefer not if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone direct me what is the best way to do this?</p>

<p>I think I just figured it out. So I'm leaving it here in case it might help someone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the properties of the folder and subfolders that I wanted to view. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "customize" tab, I had to choose to optimize it for PICTURES, which changed the folder options listed at the top.&nbsp; This change provided the "view as slideshow" button that I was missing from a "documents" or "general items" categorization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, luckily I could also choose "apply to all subfolders", which is a time saver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I cannot mark my own reply as the solution.&nbsp; Sorry if I bothered anyone with this now solved problem.&nbsp;

            Hi LUVSITE
<br />
<br />It is not efficient to run Disk Cleanup each day and absolutely unnecessary on a system that has good free space left on the hard drive . . .
<br />
<br />If you are doing this because you think lots of files on a hard drive can slow a PC down, that is not the case, in general it does not matter how many files you have on your PC - that will not affect performance
<br />
<br />Files on you hard drive are only loaded into RAM when you open them, otherwise they just sit on your hard drive and Windows will not even know they are there
<br />
<br />If you have enough free space on your hard drive, the running Disk Cleanup maybe once a month would be good house keeping, otherwise you are causing a lot of extra read/write cycles on your hard drive that  may in the long run shorten the life expectancy of that drive . .

    <title>Windows 8.1 license hell - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michael in oz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 license hell</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some time ago I bought a full retail copy of Windows 8.0 which I installed on my raid zero SSD array. Life was good especially with the addition of Start is back to return the good old start menu but that's another story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway along comes Windows 8.1 with a free media center update also I downloaded the update and life was good it all worked well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the Gigabyte motherboard I had then had a known issue with the Intel raid controller and it crashed. Not to worry I have Acronis backup images all good with a new single larger SSD drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UNTIL one morning I switch on and get a blue screen of death your system has failed etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK I will just restore an image from my dedicated 3 TB backup drive. Problem none of these images will restore. That was Acronis 2013 I've now updated to 2015 and its still the same. I can extract files which I am thankful for but NOT restore a working system
 image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem - Remember I mentioned my raid array failed. The product key for Windows 8.1 the update Microsoft gave me for free was in one of the emails that was lost. I did have a key I found using a product key reader however that I extracted prior to the system
 crashing (I did that because I thought it a good idea to know that detail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this I had called Microsoft to buy the DVD media for Windows 8.1 (Yes you can download a DVD or USB now image not sure if that was the case then) any way I was happy to pay say $20 for the media for insurance'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now learn after speaking to Microsoft via chat the 8.1 key is for the media center add on NOT the product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After two frustrating chat sessions I strike a Microsoft support agent who said I see the problem and he arranged a new DVD - FANTASTIC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short they sent me a copy of the media for free I was very impressed by that service it even came with a product key. What I did not realize is I bought Windows 8 Pro and the DVD sent to me was Windows 8.1 but NOT Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered this fact after loading my new system being SSD, Motherboard and CPU (I got sick of the old one crashing) and finding i could not enable RDP which i need for work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK lets contact Microsoft - Four chat session all of which told me my 8.1 key was for media center add on whats my 8.1 key ? Err I lost that when the system crashed but I have the original full retail version 8.0 key which you used to give me the 8.1 update
 and (lost) key) I.E I did not download this from the Piratebay but I am starting to wish I had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After four extended online chat sessions I've got exactly nowhere getting the product key I need to restore my system that I&nbsp;legitimately paid for back. i had a false start when one of the chat guys clued me in on the download link for Windows 8.1 pro ISO
 but my 8.0 key does not work with that has he had suggested it would. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So currently I've spent&nbsp; over four days attempting to extract Acronis 2013 images to my old hardware setup without luck with a view to using a tool to extract the product key. I've managed to get he registry hash for it but can't decrypt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I think the next step is reporting the issue to consumer affairs in the hope they have better luck than I have had.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work in IT and on a commercial level Microsoft's support is good but on a retail consumer level they suck big time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here end the rant.</p>
<p>

            <p>There are some misunderstandings regarding the licensing for Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, the Windows 8 Pro license you originally bought, is not a full version if it was bought at retail. It is a Upgrade version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To install an upgrade version of Windows 8, you must already have Windows 7, Windows Vista, or Windows XP installed on your PC.
</p>
<p>If you formatted the drive before the upgrade version of Windows 8 was installed, you won't be able to use your upgrade product key to activate Windows 8. To activate Windows 8, you'll need to install your previous version of Windows, and then reinstall
 Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free Media Center product key that was offered during the launch of Windows 8 in late 2012, required that you first had an installed and activated copy of Windows 8. Once you have done that, you can apply the product key for Media Center through Add
 Features, then you will have to reactivate again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, two instances of phone reactivation would be required:</p>
<p>- Windows 8 Pro</p>
<p>- Media Center key</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no free product key for Windows 8.1, Windows 8.1 was provided as a free upgrade to existing Windows 8.1 users through the Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Presently you can download updated Windows 8.1 with Update 1 media to avoid going through all processes of downloading 8.1 then Update 1. Learn more at the following link:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>In future, I recommend you use the built in system imaging tool to create a backup of your Windows 8.1 installation, it is more stable.

            <p>OK Problem solved (I think) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to all that offered advice also the original Win 8 Pro disk box lists it as VUP DVD so i stand corrected i believed it was a stand alone full version. I note it installs without the need to have a prior version present&nbsp; or prior version media.
 I am happy that's the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the fix I used to find my original 8.1 pro key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mounted an Acronis image which could not be restored to a disk it failed with a archive corrupt error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once mounted go to \Windows\system32\config. Copy and paste the file "software" this is the software registry hive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download a copy of Windows Registry Recovery from here http://www.mitec.cz/wrr.html (It's a free program and appears clean)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run Windows Registry Recovery and load the "software" hive you copied from the Acronis image. Select "Windows Installation" from the left hand menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the first tab displayed is the product key.&nbsp; Yay !!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am going to do multiple backups using more than one backup program and clone the current OS drive prior to attempting to change the key and calling Microsoft to get it reactivated on the new hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now running Acronis 2015 I was on 2013 when I created the original backups so I feel a little safer on the current version but I've not had an issue like this with Acronis in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this info might help others out of this drama if needed.</p>

<h2>            Does original Xbox games are region-locked on X360&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Hello, proud Xbox fans!<br />
I got few question in which I can't find clear answers. So, a few back I got CoD Finest Hour and GTA SA (both are from US region and my X360 E\GO comes from EU, bought in Germany). Tried playing SA and it gives me an error ( because of different regions and
 blah blah blah), when without hope I launched CoD and I was amazed - it worked. So question is: how to know which original Xbox game from other region (NTSC presumably) will work on my X360 EU? Maybe there is some kinda list to look at?<br />
<br />
Thanks for answer and sorry for my bad language.</p>

<p>The following link shows the regions. Just make sure that any game you buy was originally purchased in the EU and you will be fine. Don`t buy imports from Australia,USA, Canada etc,</p>

<h2>            How to reinstall Windows 7 on HP Pavilion p6537c but not with the factory reset&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have owned a HP Pavilion p6537c for about a year now and it was working fine. About a couple months ago it was acting weird, it wouldn't go to sleep and then all of sudden it started running at a super slow pace. I thought it was virus so I ran norton
 and a couple other programs and nothing turned up. The computer was still running slow so I reset it to the original factory settings and it didn't fix it. Although I reset it to original factory settings, I found that it didn't clean everything out like a
 reformat would when you install windows 7. Then I read that if you defragment you hard drive it speeds up the computer. &nbsp;So I did this and it made a difference but didn't completely fix it because within a day it was back to running slow. I am baffled at whats
 wrong so I am looking to reinstall windows 7. The computer came with windows 7 pre-installed so I guess my real question is how can re-install windows without actually having a disk? I am not looking to reset to factory

<h2>            Wifi stopped working&#59; Win 7&#47;64-bit&#59; Asus Zenbook w&#47;Atheros&#59; network SSID disappears &#38; can&#39;t manually add network</h2>
                    <p>Asus UX31E Zenbook (notebook) running Win 7/64-bit with an Atheros WiFi adapter.&nbsp; Netgear router WNDR3700v2.&nbsp; I'm the home sysop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting earlier this year, upon boot, my home wireless SSID is "seen" in the system tray as "available," but not connected.</p>
<p>I try to connect, and it asks for the (WPA2) password.&nbsp; I enter the password, and it says the connection could not be made.</p>
<p>&nbsp; (I have three other Windows 7/64-bit machines and a Vista machine that connect to the home wireless just fine.)</p>
<p>At this point the SSID is no longer "seen" in the system tray.&nbsp; No wireless networks are available, even if I'm 3 feet from the router.&nbsp; (--I live in the country.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried, none of which have worked:</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Ran the troubleshooting wizard, including resetting the router.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Made sure the WiFi adapter was enabled.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Made sure the adapter reported it was working correctly, looked at IPconfig &amp; also checked for any red flags in Device Manager.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Made sure all drivers were up to date and that all Windows updates were processed correctly.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Tried to roll back the WiFi driver, but no earlier version was available on the system.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Tried to use an earlier restore point, but none worked.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Uninstalled the WiFi drivers and installed the latest from Asus' support website.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Tried running without Norton Internet Security.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Wiped the O/S partition and restored it to factory condition.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Tried running before re-installing Norton Internet Security.</p>
<p>&gt;&nbsp; Slogged through all the updates and tried several times more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now in the Network &amp; Sharing Center, when I try to manually add my network--it says "How do you want to add a network?" and I click "Manually create a network profile."&nbsp; I get "An unexpected error occurred."&nbsp; This didn't used to happen--I could add the network,
 but couldn't connect to it.</p>

            <p>Hi Deb,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes its possible that changing SSID will not work. However WNDR 3700v2 dont offers WEP? that's wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to wifi settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This router has some firmware issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So try to reload the firmware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then try without any security in your router. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If its works then fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not then try to give static IP on WLAN &amp; try to connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best way to understand what is issue is try with different WIFI NIC card (USB).</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t Reverse &#40;fix&#41; Touchpad Scrolling Direction on Type&#47;Touch Cover 2 when connected via the Surface Bluetooth Keyboard Adaptor</h2>
                    <p>Using the new (and super slick) Bluetooth adaptor for connecting my type cover via Bluetooth, the Mouse and touchpad settings section of the Metro control panel doesn't show the Touchpad settings section that appears when I connect the type cover directly
 to my surface. Unfortunately this means I can't access the setting that lets me fix the&nbsp;annoyingly backwards scrolling direction.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm hoping someone from Microsoft sees this and gets it to the folks who can create a fix for it as this is a terrible thing to overlook as they stupidly decided to make their mouse scroll in the opposite direction of all other mousse before it for no good
 reason. I was hoping they'd fix this obnoxious default in the Type Cover 2, but they didn't.

<h2>            Is there a way to add the Win7 Home Premium &#34;Administrator&#34; user account so that it may be selected at normal log-in&#63; I want to be able to log-in as Administrator without going the F8 route, as in XP.</h2>

                    <span>
<p>I need to be able to log on as "Administrator" at the normal log-in screen, vice going the F8 route. I can find no option for this, not even NET USER at the CMD window. If this is possible, perhaps via a Registry change, I sure would appreciate the info.
 Thanks</p>

    <title>Black screen on my HP laptop after Windows 10 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> graham payne  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black screen on my HP laptop after Windows 10 installation</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading from Windows 8,1 to Windows 10 on my new HP laptop I found that the screen Blacks-out on start up&nbsp;when the adapter/charger is connected. The laptop starts up as normal but after the HP logo is shown for a few second and Windows starts the
 screen goes Black. If I remove the adapter when this happens the screen comes on again showing the Windows 10 start welcome screen.</p>
<p>If I now re-insert the adapter the screen goes Black Again. Windows is still running.</p>
<p>I have found that if I remove the adapter/charger and remove the battery from the laptop and then hold the on/off switch Down for approx . 10 seconds, re-insert the battery and adapter and then start the laptop it will start normally with the screen activated
 ok.</p>
<p>This is just a one shot method because after shutting Windows down normally the problem appears again on the next start up.</p>
<p>I&nbsp; sent the laptop back to HP and they could not solve this problem. It ended with them changing the OS back to Windows 8,1 where this problem does not exist. I am just not interested in using the Windows 8,1 OS.</p>
<p>Is there anyone that knows this problem and the answer to solve it?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
