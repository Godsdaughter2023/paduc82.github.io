            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            If you boot in Safe Mode, what you will see is a bunch of white text on a black background rolling by on your screen as files and drivers are loaded, you will get a reminder message that you are booting in Safe Mode and asked to continue (or not), you
 will see the words "Safe Mode" in all four corners of your screen, your desktop icons are likely to be skewed around, and you will probably not see your background image/wallpaper - just a black background.<br />
<br />
If you are <i>not </i>seeing that, you are probably not in Safe Mode and if you are in Safe Mode, the Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "<i>expert</i>" advice
<b>Method 1</b> to run the System File Checker will not work since SFC will not even run in Safe Mode - even though I have told then that 100 times, they keep suggesting it.&nbsp; You do not describe any symptoms consistent with a need to run SFC.&nbsp; It makes even
 less sense if you don't have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (which you indicate).&nbsp; Suggesting SFC is akin to saying "I have no idea what the problem is or how to fix it".<br />
<br />
Maybe you will get lucky with those ideas though.<br />
<br />
You need to tell us exactly what the message says that you are seeing without paraphrasing.<br />
<br />
For example, when you try to run msconfig, does it really say "cant find" or does it say something else and what exactly is that something else you are seeing?<br />
<br />
Maybe you are seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
Windows Installer may be corrupted or your computer is in safe mode<br />
<br />
or perhaps this message:<br />
<br />
The Windows Installer Service could not be accessed.<br />
This can occur if you are running Windows in safe mode, or if the Windows Installer is not correctly installed. Contact your support personnel for assistance.<br />
<br />
If that is what you are seeing, this makes more sense:<br />
<br />
First do this:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>services.msc</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open the Services applet.<br />
<br />
Look in the Services applet to see if the Windows Installer Service is even listed and you will find that it is probably not listed (but it should be listed).<br />
<br />
If the Windows Installer Service is listed, make sure it is not Disabled and if it is Disabled, change the Startup type to Manual.&nbsp; You don't have to set it to Automatic as it will start on it's own when it needs to start and you don't need it starting every
 time you restart your system and running all day when there is nothing for it to do.<br />
<br />
The Service will start when it needs to start if it is able to start.&nbsp; Click OK enough times to save your adjustments and close the Services applet, restart your system to be sure the changes "stick" and see how things look now.<br />
<br />
If the Windows Installer Service is completely missing from Services, you need to add it as follows:<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter these commands one at a time clicking the OK button for each:<br />
<br />
<b>msiexec&nbsp;&nbsp; /unregister</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (or you can type:&nbsp;&nbsp; msiexec /unreg)<br />
<b>msiexec&nbsp;&nbsp; /regserver</b><br />
<br />
Click OK after each command&nbsp;&nbsp; (there will be no message about what happened)<br />
<br />
Check in the Services applet again to see if the Windows Installer Service is now listed and the Startup type is set to Manual, restart your system to be sure the changes "stick" and see how things look now.

    <title>Surface Book 2 freezes when plugged in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelo-joseph  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book 2 freezes when plugged in</h2>
                    <p>Love my surface book, but I have an intermittent issue. Sometimes, when working on my SB2 while the power adapter is plugged in (either Microsoft Surface Dock or OEM charger) The computer completely freezes. It took me quite a while to figure out what caused
 this issue. Symptoms are a frozen screen (that remains on), and completely unresponsive keyboard and touchscreen. Simply closing the SB2 does nothing, and the screen remains on and frozen. Simply unplugging the charger puts the SB2 into almost like a sleep
 sequence that immediately wakes up and I get the screen saver/welcome screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happens, seemingly, while using any application or doing any task. It only happens while plugged in. Is this a known issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            This would be a great feature to add, imho. I don't think it would be that difficult, either, would it? You can still add words to MSWord's dictionary, right? Same type of widget, probably . . .<br />

    <title>Ex helping son bypass screen time limits - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ex helping son bypass screen time limits</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I set up screen time limits for my son's account which have been working fine. Until I sent him to his father's house for a week. As it's school holidays right now I told my son I would relax the time limits for his account while he is at his dad's house.
 My son told me not to worry because his father already did it. I was slightly alarmed and confused. I didn't see how his father could have access to that as I'm the only adult listed&nbsp;on our family account. I checked the family settings and the restrictions
 were still in place so I figured my son was just confused. However, the activity report showed that he was in fact using his account when he shouldn't have been able to. Not only that but he was using it until 2:30 in the morning on some nights! I tested his
 account on his computer at home and also on my laptop. The restrictions were working on both of those. Clearly my ex has found a way to bypass the restrictions somehow. I was worried he might have discovered my password and was simply getting my son to click
 on "my parent is here" and then signing in for him. I checked my Microsoft account and discovered&nbsp;my ex had tried to log into my account but he couldn't as he just tried to guess the password. He also signed into my son's account the same night&nbsp;and changed
 some security settings. I changed both of our passwords just to be safe. That had no effect. My son is still logging in and using his account as much as he wants. My son had a sleepover at a friends house while he was at his dad's and it looks like&nbsp;he's logged
 into his account at their house too. So it can't just be my ex's computer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how he could be getting around these time limits? I'm baffled.
</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
If your Microsoft account has been compromised or being used without your consent, then you can consider enabling the two-step verification setting on your account and your child's account.<br />
<br />
Two-step verification helps protect you by making it more difficult for someone else to sign in to your Microsoft account. It uses two different forms of identity: your password, and a contact method (also known as security info). Even if someone else finds
 your password, they'll be stopped if they don't have access to your security info. To turn two-step verification on, you can check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/12408/microsoft-account-about-two-step-verification" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
For more information regarding Microsoft account security, you can visit this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10494/microsoft-account-get-back-compromised-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>.<br />

            <p>Hello Nicholas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that the computer&nbsp;is not recognizing microphone correctly due to corrupt audio drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>update audio drivers </strong>from this link and then try connecting microphone.<br />
Refer:<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like&nbsp;you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. What is the exact error that you receive with the .dll file?</p>
<p>2. Can you provide the information as to how you detected the same as a virus?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your query, I would like to inform that mdi064.dll has been reported to be part of a spyware/malware/Trojan. It is likely that the problem you are experiencing is linked directly to the spyware/malware/Trojan rather than an actual missing DLL-file
 and the recommended course of action is to first locate/remove the Malware. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are getting an error:&nbsp; C:\Users\"user"\AppData\Local\Temp\mdi064.dll The specified module could not be found "?
</p>
<p>The likely reason for these files being missing, is that your Anti Virus software has removed them due to suspicion of PUP or danger.</p>

    <title>Blue screen whenever I play Minecraft for the past few times &#43; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elijah rodriguez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen whenever I play Minecraft for the past few times &#43; window&#39;s 10 update question</h2>
                    <p>Question 1:<br />
So when I play this game called "Minecraft" about a few minutes into playing my screen goes black and a few seconds later I get&nbsp;a blue screen. The error is "Video_Scheduler_Internal_Error". The second blue screen I got didn't give an error message or reason
 at all.(So I am assuming it is the same reason).<br />
<br />
Question 2:<br />
About the recent Window's 10 Pro, Version 151 update. When I first tried to install it I got an message saying I need at least 5 GB of space to download. So I deleted some old files to get me to 5.67 GB left on my Hard drive. Now when I re-tried to install
 the update now it is saying I need 8.57 GB on my hard drive even though previously it said I need 5 GB.</p>
<p>Also could me not updating as of right now be the reason I am getting these blue screens?<br />

<p>Thanks! I have successfully updated to the latest update of Windows 10. So that answer's/solves question 2. However I am still somewhat having trouble with issue 1. The blue screen's have stop. However now after a while each time of play, the screen/computer
 just plain out becomes unresponsive and freezes up with no way to get out of the application(not even ALT + F4 and Control + Al + Delete). I am forced to force shutdown my Surface Pro 3 by holding down the power button for a couple seconds and of course turning
 it back on.</p>
<p>Also I did try to update my display adapter and it is up to date. However please be aware I get driver updates via windows update since I am on a Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>Thanks for your response! :)</p>

            The only thing I can think that might be causing this is different windows versions.
<br />Make sure the machine you created the GPO is the exact same version and build as the one you are putting it on.

    <title>Windows 7 freezes and application crashes - memory access violation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> inconcinnity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 freezes and application crashes - memory access violation</h2>
                    So for many months now I've been putting up with random application crashes and occasional freezes. When they first started they occurred almost exclusively with battlefield 3, and I attributed them to that game being the buggy piece of **** it was on
 release, as well as Origin's overall ****ness. About a month ago though the crashes started becoming more widespread. They were affecting pretty much anything, Desktop Manager, iTunes, every video game I have and even Chrome plugins. And then the BSODs started.
 I've been through weeks of troubleshooting from info I could find on the internet. Computer is an ASUS K53SV running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.
<div>I've:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Updated every single driver ASUS lists for my laptop, as well as any other third party drivers</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Updated the BIOS&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Removed the OEM RealTek driver and run on Windows drivers (audio often crashes - I'll get to that). Then reinstalled the RealTek driver. No good&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Done a Windows repair install, which is almost a full install but keeps your files.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Done a memory check from the BIOS (was told it was potentially hardware issues). No problems found&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Run CHKDSK, both the quick and full. No problems found.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Installed 3 different antiviruses. None of them made a difference (Have done full scans with them as well as malwarebytes. Nothing found.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Ran some CMD thing I've forgotten, was meant to find damaged .dlls. It found no problems&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;I've done more but I can't remember everything at the moment. Uninstalling the Razer driver for my mouse fixed the BSOD problems, now using Windows mouse drivers. The application crashes were also happening before I got the mouse. When the applications
 crash, all I get is "application has stopped working". No other messages. The event viewer log for one of the crashes:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Faulting application name: javaw.exe, version: 7.0.40.22, time stamp: 0x4fa226d0&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Faulting module name: OpenAL64.dll, version: 0.0.0.0, time stamp: 0x49bd759c&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Exception code: 0xc0000005&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Fault offset: 0x000000000000e50f&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Faulting process id: 0xb2c&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Faulting application start time: 0x01cd42f187889b26&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Faulting application path: C:\Program Files\Java\jre7\bin\javaw.exe</div>
<div>&nbsp;Faulting module path: C:\Users\Inconcinnity\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\bin\natives\OpenAL64.dll&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Report Id: eefb2e45-aee4-11e1-bd02-14dae9365e20&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;But I get an error with the exact same exception code for every program that crashes. Heres a list of some of them.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;-svchost.exe_MMCSS (mmcss.dll)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-AUDIODG.EXE (audioeng.dll) - Windows audio driver - causing the audio failures I mentioned earlier. This often happens while playing a game but also occurs when watching media.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-AppleMobileDeviceService.exe (WS2_32.dll, version: 6.1.7601.17514)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Steam.exe (module unknown)</div>
<div>&nbsp;-HiPatchService.exe (mscorwks.dll)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-bf3.exe (KERNELBASE.dll)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-chrome.exe (module unknown)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-Origin.exe (WS2_32.dll)</div>
<div>&nbsp;-daemonu.exe (module unknown)</div>
<div>&nbsp;-sftvsa.exe (module unknown) - Microsoft Application Virtualization Virtual Service Agent&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;- PMBDeviceInfoProvider.exe (module unknown)&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;-GFNEXSrv.exe (module unknown) - Random ASUS application</div>
<div>&nbsp;-ASLDRSrv.exe (module unknown) - Another ASUS application&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;That's about a day and a halfs worth, and many had crashed multiple times. I found out the exception code is a memory access violation, and that to fix it I would just need to turn off Data Execution Protection for the applications that were crashing.
 I was excited, I thought I'd finally found the solution.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Until I got these messages: "You can not set DEP attributes on 64-bit executables" and "This program must run with data execution protection (DEP) enabled. You cannot turn off DEP for this program". The only thing I could turn it off for was Steam.exe&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp;Basically, what the **** can I do now?</div>
                </div>

            I'm thinking that if the machine is under warranty, send it back. You've done a good job of troubleshooting and testing and if the machine crashes with a fresh install there is something else going on.<br />

            Hi Malcolm!<br />
<br />
Try this: In&nbsp; Windows Explorer right click on the Favorites link on the left pane and click "restore favorites links". This should get your Download Folder back.
<br />
<br />
When you type Download in Start, your folder should also show. The normal Download-Folder-Path is:
<em>C:\users\username\Downloads</em><br />
<br />
In case you want to restore the Download folder to its default path, you could go here:
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/18583-user-folders-restore-default-location.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/18583-user-folders-restore-default-location.html</a>&nbsp; and scroll down to Option Two, Point 5, and just follow the instructions.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />
<br />
Cheers<br />
Julia<br />

<h2>            Video playback fails with headphones plugged in</h2>
                    I am unable to play videos (Edge, Netflix App, etc) when I have my earbuds plugged in to the 3.5mm jack.&nbsp; If I disconnect them and restart the video it plays perfectly.&nbsp; I have tried two types of headphone, both happen to be Sonys.&nbsp; The earbuds have integrated
 mic, the over the ear do not.&nbsp; Neither work unless you unplug them.

            Hello Xephos_M,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for reaching out. This is noteworthy that you have experienced this issue. For us to understand the issue better, let us know more details by answering the following questions:<br />
<br />
• Can you tell us when the issue started?<br />
• Which Windows version is installed on your Surface Go? Is it on Windows 10 S or did you already switch out to Windows 10 Home/Pro?<br />
• Can you clarify if the video hangs/freezes when you play it or that the video plays but no audio/sound when you plugged in the earbuds/headphones?<br />
• To isolate the issue, have you tried using a Bluetooth headset? Were there any differences?<br />
• Did you notice any error messages as you connect the earbuds/headphone to the Surface? How about in the Device Manager?<br />
• Can you confirm if there are other peripherals connected on your Surface?<br />
<br />
To help solve this issue, try running a <strong>Windows Troubleshooter</strong> for the type of issue you are having. Just go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; choose <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; then select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. Look through the list for the troubleshooter that addresses the type of issue.<br />
<br />
Should you need additional troubleshooting steps, please see below:<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. It
 is a self-healing tool which looks for potential issues and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. The tool takes about 10-15 mins. to run. Once you run the toolkit, kindly follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong> After running the toolkit, force shutdown or restart your Surface. Performing a Forced Shutdown is like removing the battery from a laptop or unplugging a desktop PC. It resets the hardware and clears all the cache and memory for your
 hardware. Here's how:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Press and hold the power button for a full 10 seconds, until the screen turns off, then release the power button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<em>Note: On some Surface models, the screen may immediately turn off when pressing the power button. If this happens, continue to&nbsp;hold for the full 10 seconds and then release.</em><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface (or Microsoft) logo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me know how the issue progresses and if you have additional questions by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.

<h2>            Unable to install a program</h2>
                    <p>HI, I'm trying to install a program called neurofeedback guides. I purchased and downloaded it from the internet. The installer is a program to click on called Neurofeedback Guides.msi. Everything goes well but at the very end I get a message that says</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Error 1925. You do not have sufficient privileges to complete this installation for all users of the machine. Log on as administrator and then retry this installation."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was news to me as I bought this computer over a year ago and am the only one who uses it. I should be the administrator already!!! After doing some research I discovered that the extremely unintelligent idiots at Microsoft created this secret hidden
 administrator profile. So I activated that and signed in as the administrator but I can't see any of the programs or downloads that have been downloaded or installed under the original user. In short, the Neurofeedback Guides.msi file is no longer there for
 me to run.&nbsp;This is very frustrating. I've installed several programs in the past year and have had no problems with this.&nbsp; I did recently upgrade to windows 10 a few weeks ago so maybe that's the problem? Basically I need to be able to install this program
 without being logged in as the administrator, or, when I am logged in as the administrator I need to be able to see everything that the other user sees. Thanks!</p>

</p><p>rename your .msi RUN.msi</p>
<p>
</p><p>move it to C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>run CMD as an admin</p>
<p>
</p><p>type cd C:\Windows\SysWOW64</p>
<p>
</p><p>type msiexec.exe /a C:\RUN.msi</p>
<p>
</p><p>and it should work. Reply If helpful!!</p>

<h2>            Wifi not working after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have a dell inspiron 15z Ultrabook bought it in 2013 dec.</p>
<p>I recently upgraded it to windows 10 and wifi keeps on connecting and disconnecting. I have to restart the laptop every time once the connection was lost. some time it won't even connect no matter how many restarts i do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked on dell website and they say that, they are not developing any new drivers for my system to have windows 10.</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this issue or I have to adjust with windows 8.1?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Some games with gold titles missing from library&#47;ready to install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p><p><br /></p><p>I&nbsp;have noticed some games with gold titles going missing from my library, specifically Rayman 3 hd which i only just downloaded last week. Others i have noticed: assasins creed 3 &amp; red faction aramageddon. The reoccurring theme? Xbox 360 backwards compatible games with gold.&nbsp;I&nbsp;now only have the option to pay for them, which is frustrating. The only reason ive noticed is because i went to play Rahman 3 HD, knowing i had downloaded it for it to be gone, so i checked a list of all games with gold i should have and noticed a few more i know I downloaded missing.</p><p>Tried to chat with xbox support, a fruitless endeavour, who ended up telling me that you cant even download xbox 360 games on an xbox one console to which i told him you can as i have about 30 the ended the chat.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I have seen others posting about this problem so i know i am not alone. Anyone have a solid solution though? Any chance xbox/MS&nbsp;will license

<h2>            Slow performance after installing Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Updates 8/27/12 - Computer slowed down</p>
<p>Took 3 days to download and install 8/27 updates: Windows Defender, Windows 7 for x64-based systems, and Malicious Software Removal Tool. My laptop has screeched to a crawl and I cannot improve performance. Everything worked fine until this download. Have
 rebooted, run virus scans, CCleaner programs, Windows troubleshooting programs... nothing works. Computer is functional after a reboot but is slow and then comes to a standstill if idle for a few hours. Can someone advise me on the 8/27 updates and what they
 might have done to my laptop? Thx!&nbsp; JB</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What OS Build of Windows 10 Version 1703 is currently installed (e.g., OS Build 15063.447)? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

            I see you are on version 1703. Manually upgrading to version 1709 should resolve this issue.
<br />Microsoft also provides many options to get the latest feature upgrade manually. You can use:
<br />Upgrade assistant
<br />Media Creation Tool
<br />ISO File
<br />to get Fall Creators update right now. 
<br />You can use the following guide having detailed Instructions on how to upgrade to the latest Feature upgrade i.e. Fall Creators update using all the three methods:
<br />How to upgrade to Windows 10 Fall Creators update right now
<br />www.yourwindowsguide.com/2017/10/upgrade-to-windows-10-fall-creators.html
<br />Media Creation tool has an Edge over the Upgrade assistant in my opinion as it offers a greater degree of flexibility of downloading and using the ISO file so that one can deploy it on multiple computers.

<h2>            Updating Driver for a Hemlock Sapphire HD 5970 Factory OC Leads To Chaos</h2>
                    
<p>(This issue occurred and persisted ever since I clicked on the "Restore Factory Defaults Button" in the options/preferences in the ATI&nbsp;catalyst software.) Going to post exactly what I sent to the ATI&amp;Sapphire tech support people:</p>
<p>Well here is my issue, and it's a hefty one. It all started back when I tried to update my driver from the 10.3 beta to 10.3 full. Everything installed and worked fairly enough until I hit the restore to factory defaults button in the catalyst for reasons
 beyond my comprehension at the moment. Ever since doing so I've had no luck with any driver except the 10.3 beta driver. Upgrading to full of that release or any other driver since leads to the bottom portion of the screen being pushed down below visible view,
 and makes playing games impossible as the image keeps flowing downwards and repeating non-stop. It's sort of devastated my main purpose of building this computer right as I finished building it. I feel as if though it's hopeless as I've tried everything from
 uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, seeking help on multiple forums and all to no avail. If you could solve this issue for me I'd quite literally be in your debt. Please help me out. Computer Stats For Added Insight: Case - Antec Twelve Hundred MOBO - ASUS

<br />
After trying everything they offered and then some, I was told to contact microsoft for help with what may be an operating system issue. So here I am, hoping that I might finally be able to put this issue to rest as it has basically crippled my newly built

<p>Called pass the buck. Beta drivers? Why go there&lt;rhetorical&gt;? "Updating" from beta&nbsp;often requires uninstall and reinstall the new drivers&nbsp;clean to avoid potential issues. The OEM card drivers (Sapphire in this case) can sometimes be a better choice than
 the generic ones due to OEM configuration of the video card (eg. if ATI factory reset&nbsp;were incompatible with some feature of that Sapphire graphic card).</p>
<p>Have you tried a clean install of&nbsp;the most recent drivers for your card from Sapphire (v10.8?)?&nbsp;One other thing that springs to mind is to make sure that Creative sound card is not in any slot that shares IRQ with the video card (Slot 1 typically). It's
 not supposed to be an issue any more but it&nbsp;often was in the past. &nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for the feedback guys, appreciate it. However nothing suggested seemed to have fixed the issue. Removal of the current catalyst software and then installing the 10.8 catalyst has given me the same issues as the 10.3 version and up. Degraded image
 quality, hard to read text, and the bottom portion of my monitor is cut off. The issue with games is also still here. However after lowering the resolution from 1920x1080 to 1680x1050 the screen seemed to fit itself within the monitor, though the absolute
 loss in image quality and the over all blurriness persists. I can't imagine why hitting "Restore To Factory Defaults" in the catalyst would have done this, and how it would persist even after numerous removals and re-installations. Either way it seems like
 I've either damaged my GPU by doing so or something else all together.

            Is your display actually scrolling on its own? That suggests&nbsp;a refresh rate mismatch. The monitor's&nbsp;usable refresh rate typically decreases as resolution increases. In some monitors this can be preset too, or the display may have stored a&nbsp;resolution X
 refresh rate combination that only existed in the beta driver.&nbsp;The same issue could account for some of the other display symptoms. Was changing the connection type to the PC one of the things you already tried (ie. DVI vs VGA vs HDMI)? How about resetting
 the monitor back to factory defaults (if the option exists)?

            Sorry for not getting back to you sooner, yes it does scroll on it's own. I know it's not a connection/refresh rate issue as everything worked perfectly until I hit "restore to factory defaults"&nbsp;on the 1.3 full (not beta)&nbsp;catalyst program. Before that
 it all worked as it should have.

            Update Java lately? I did and got major issues with screen flicker and jumpy video during gameplay, especially Crysis. I did a fresh install of Windows last week and had no problems. Yesterday I installed both 32 &amp; 64 bit versions of Java to see why others
 were getting Windows Installer errors. It seems I never re-installed it. After I did I had problems. Since everything worked fine for over a week with no Java of any kind installed, I removed both Javas and now everything is fine again. I don't know if this
 helps you, but I wanted to share the experience. In my opinion the current Java 6_21 has issues with Windows 7.

<p>I haven't had any issues using the 10.3 beta version or the disc software that was provided with the GPU, so I can't really put the blame on Java. Regardless I appreciate the input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is most modern games and whatnot require the latest drivers to function properly, and since I cannot use the most up to date drivers without complete loss of image quality and absolute blurriness, accomponied with the waterfall effect that takes
 place every time I'm in a program that requires to be fullscreen, I find myself locked out of my own computer. This is the only semi-fix I've been able to discover, and in all truth it's not a fix at all.</p>
<p>(Taken from a message sent to ATI while using the 10.6 full catalyst software)</p>
<p>A step by step to "fix" this issue upon each restart of the computer, as the issue rears it's ugly head every time I do just that (if you can discern what the issue is just by looking at how I've fixed it, that would also be great.):</p>
<p>Open CCC/CCC Wizard (ATI Catalyst Program).<br />
Click on the drop down menu on the top left and then click on Desktop &amp; Displays.<br />
Right click on the monitor picture on the bottom left and click on configure.<br />
Make sure "Use Extended Display Identification Data (EDID) or driver defaults" is checkmarked on the Attributes tab.<br />
Next, click on the Adjustments tab.<br />
Make sure the "Composite Sync" box is unchecked.<br />
Click anywhere in the red box on the mountain picture and drag up until the screen fits the monitor properly (There is going to be a few cm of black on the left and right side of the monitor).<br />
Once positioned in the proper spot hit apply and then ok.<br />
(This part sort of requires the monitor I'm using...) The bottom of the screen may be higher than it should be, open up internet explorer and then physically press the "Auto Adjust" button to the left of the power on button on the bottom of the monitor. This
 should solve the issue until the next restart of the computer.<br />
Play all games in Windowed Mode (Fullscreen).<br />
My current resolution is 1920x1080 at 60hz</p>

<p>Since the card's refresh rate setting&nbsp;is adjustable using the driver software how does any of this rule&nbsp;out refresh or connection type as an issue? A scrolling display is symptomatic of a refresh rate mismatch. It's more commonly seen with analog CRT&nbsp;displays
 and there is (was?)&nbsp;often a manual adjustment&nbsp;control to tweak vertical sync on the back of the display.&nbsp;I&nbsp;wouldn't expect to see scrolling on an LCD display that was connected&nbsp;using a DVI (digital) cable.</p>
<p>In a subsequent post you wrote:</p>
<p>"(This part sort of requires the monitor I'm using...) The bottom of the screen may be higher than it should be, open up internet explorer and then physically press the "Auto Adjust" button to the left of the power on button on the bottom of the monitor.

<p>This particular adjustment is typically used when connecting LCD displays&nbsp;using a VGA cable or other analog video source in order to align the display pixels, but it&nbsp;should be unneccessary when using a&nbsp;DVI cable to connect with&nbsp;(not sure about HDMI but suspect
 the same). Composite sync would be moot with a DVI connection and in my experience the display positioning and resizing options in ATI Catalyst&nbsp;are also only operational for analog connections. Many of the symptoms you've described so far are typical for what
 happens on CRT monitors when the display position and size are misaligned (out of their normal range) on&nbsp;the monitor or in the display driver. Again, most of these settings are unavailable/disabled when using a DVI (digital) connection to the computer. Instead,
 these display settings are locked in to fixed defaults, which is why I was curious if you'd tried changing the connection type and what the result was. Factory reset on the monitor would both reset it to its defaults and erase any stored display settings that
 could be contributing to your issue.</p>
<p>There are other settings in Catalyst which might be relevent to your problems, such as LCD overdrive, or scaling. I suspect the driver for your series card also probably offers a few more configurable options than I get with my 4500 series card.</p>

            I opened CCC and I don't have the EDID or Composite Sync options. I did notice that the maximum reported resolution for my monitor is 1920x1080. I know for a fact that my monitor's maximum and native resolution is, and always has been 1440x900. I'm somehow
 thinking that CCC might be trying to shove the wrong resolution down your monitor's throat, and your monitor doesn't like it.
