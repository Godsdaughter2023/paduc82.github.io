<h2>            Failure to access key system xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>Good afternoon I would like to report a bug in security purchases xbox one, in case the system system allows delete a security key without asking to put the key before it is removed.</p>
<p>In the Settings / Create Access Key menu can enter a new passkey to put more security on our account, one reason for the use of this key is to prevent a purchase without our permission is made.</p>
<p>A registered time this passkey every time you need to buy something in game store before the purchase is finalized it will be necessary to put the passkey.</p>
<p>In the case of this system error occurs when the access key can be deleted without the need to confirm the same, coming from the same menu that was created to access key there is the option to delete the passkey and when selected it removes the key without
 asking the User to confirm the code you chose in the creation of the access key.</p>

<p>There is an option to require passkey before changing settings.</p>
<p>Use that option and no one will be able to delete your passkey because they wont be able to change any settings without entering passkey first.</p>

            You can change the windows font by following the below directions:
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel.
<br />
<br />Open the Fonts option.
<br />
<br />See the font available on Windows 10 and note the exact name of the font you want to use (e.g., Arial, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, etc.).
<br />
<br />Open Notepad.
<br />
<br />Copy and paste the following registry code into the text file:
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Fonts]
<br />"Segoe UI (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Bold Italic (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Italic (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Light (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Semibold (TrueType)"=""
<br />"Segoe UI Symbol (TrueType)"=""
<br />
<br />[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\FontSubstitutes]
<br />
<br />"Segoe UI"="ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME"
<br />In registry code above, make sure to replace ENTER-NEW-FONT-NAME with the name of the font you want to use like Courier New.
<br />
<br />Click File.
<br />
<br />Click Save As.
<br />
<br />Under "Save as type," select All Files, and name your file anything you want with the .reg extension.
<br />
<br />Click Save.
<br />
<br />Double-click your new .reg file to merge into the registry.
<br />
<br />Click Yes.
<br />
<br />Click OK.
<br />
<br />Restart your computer to complete the task.
<br />Once your computer restarts, you should see the new font family throughout the elements, including on File Explorer, message box, taskbar, and apps that make use of the default system font.

            Hi Everett, Microsoft removed the option to adjust the font sizes in the Creators Update 
<br />
<br />Most Users are using a great small free utility called Winaero Tweaker, which will let you adjust font sizes anywhere in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to get WInaero Tweaker:

    <title>URL Zapped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chipdaily  say:</h3>
<h2>            URL Zapped</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I send my customer an icon so they can just click it and it takes them to my solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It has the URL to the solution, thier ID number and password, as a part of the URL.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10. "Yep I'm ready for the jokes..."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I keep all of the Icons ive sent in folder on my desk top... When i get a new customer i just copy/paste it change the id and send it to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure when, but they got zapped. Either Windows or Adobe completly changed the icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did a restore point to a month ago. Got them back long enough to hide them, during the time I was hiding them it zapped it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the hidden ones, but need to figure out why its happening.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone experience this? If so do you know the cause?</p>

            Sorry, unclear that what is an icon here. Is it a URL file as you said? If so, the program associated with it might be changed. Right click the URL and open Properties. Under opens with Change the program with you want to open. Windows 10 has Edge set by default but you can try other ones from the list.
If it isn't a URL File, right click the file and open its properties. Note down the type of the file and reply back.
Let us know if you have any questions.

<h2>            System Image Restore Failed</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>This is a continuation of a problem thread that I accidentally deleted! I hope Saltgrass will pick it up again, as he has helped me well up to now. The following explains what
 I have done to apply his suggestions.</font></span></p>
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>&nbsp;</font></span><font color="#000000">
</font>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>I created a Recovery drive in Windows 8.1 (without copying the Recovery partition). Entering the Recovery Environment at startup using the F9 key gave me the option "Use a Device",
 allowing me to boot from the recovery drive. I selected the Restore System Image option. This time the&nbsp;"Format and repartition disks"&nbsp;&nbsp;box was not greyed out (although the "Exclude disks..." button was, but&nbsp;when I ticked the "Format and repartition disks"
 box, then the "Exclude disks.." button became active). However I left the box unticked as I have read that it does not need to be selected. Things were looking good. However, sadly, after clicking on "Finish"&nbsp;then "Yes", the same box came up, saying "The system
 image restore failed. Error details: The processor architecture or OS version of Windows Recovery Environment is not the same as that of the computer that was backed up. For example, a backup of an Vista x64-based computer can be recovered only by using an
 Vista x64 based version of Windows Recovery". This is even though the system image and recovery USB flash drive were created on Windows 8.1 on the same computer, which is the one the recovery is&nbsp; trying to be made to!&nbsp;I did then go back and repeat the process,
 but this time I ticked the "Format and repartition disks" box and selected to exclude the USB flash drive from the restore process, using the "Exclude disks..." button. The restore process seemed to start for a few seconds, with a box coming up saying that
 the restore may take hours and&nbsp;a progress bar started to move, but then the same error message came up. Sadly it then became clear that the system restore process did start momentarily, as when I tried to restart the computer (without the recovery drive attached),
 it wouldn't restart. It went straight into the UEFI interface. Part of the C drive has obviously been overwritten. When I tried to restart with the Windows 8.1 recovery drive attached, it did boot from it, so&nbsp;I can still access the system image to try to recover
 from it. So if only I could overcome this error problem I could hopefully restore the C drive. I did try booting with my Windows 8 recovery drive, with the Recovery partition copied, and then tried to restore the factory preset programming, but after clicking
 on Rest Your PC, the message came up "Unable to reset your PC. A required drive partition is missing", suggesting there is a problem with the recovery partition! So now it seems that getting rid of this error message "The system image restore failed"&nbsp;so I
 can restore from the system image is my only hope!</font></span></p>

<h2>            GTA&#58; San Andreas - Where do I download the small files for old xbox games&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just got GTA:San Andreas downloaded to my xbox 360 slim, now it won't let me play because I don't have a hard drive, I use a USB device for my storage, after looking around it seems that all I need is to get some very small files onto my USB stick
 to emulate the xbox 1, but finding them is a pain.</p>

<p>I know it must be possible because I just downloaded a 3 GB game, so downloading the small files required would not be a problem, please tell me where I can get these files, officialy.</p>

<p>Technically all I need is the files, but by your response I am guessing that Microsoft has made this impossible to do, for their obvious extra financial gain. &nbsp;£8 for the game and a stupid amount for a hard drive, these files should not be hidden and you
 should be able to download them on xbox live, but obviously one of the richest companies in the world need more money.</p>
<p>Download then format storage to include old xbox emulator, this would only take 10 minutes tops ? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>What a horrible and sneaky tactic to make people buy more stuff. </p>

<p>that is just the way it is since the OLD xbox had a hard drive you need a hard drive to play old xbox games there is no other way around it sorry.</p>

<p>it had to do more with the caching techniques that the original xbox did</p>
<p>specially halo 1</p>
<p>they loaded 256mb maps with ai and characters that were animated there is no way that a console could do it without a hd at the time

<p>The thing is I have enough storage and it would work with the files, they just don't want to make it cheap and easy for their users, I know how these things work, it wouldn't take long to make any storage device ready for XBOX 1 games at all, in fact it
 would take under 10 minutes to download and format your storage to handle the old games.</p>
<p>That's the brutal truth here. &nbsp; Thanks for the info people, I appreciate the help even if I am not happy with the answers.</p>

<p>1st every original xbox had a HD for &nbsp;a reason</p>
<p>every game required the hd to cache and install</p>
<p>not to mention memory cards and usb drives aren't as fast as a hd not ever</p>
<p>2nd so how do you propose when a original xbox game is looking for a HD</p>
<p>how would you work around that?</p>
<p>it would be like looking for a c:\ drive when there isn't one more like a A and B drive</p>
<p>a usb key is a memory card not a hd</p>
<p>even if the manufacturer to write the code many which have abandoned the game</p>
<p>it wouldn;'t solve the problem when people using the original dvd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>the emulation software is 3gigs not including the updates and patches sorry they aren't small files</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3rd you are told upfront on the game itself and the games on demand that it requires an xbox hd</p>
<p>sorry the requirements are there</p>

<p>Ok lets get this straight..</p>
<p>The game said I needed a hard drive, it did not state anywhere that I need a hard drive with old emulator files on it, first bad lie! &nbsp;(Absolute joke)</p>
<p>Secondly this company Microsoft could easily find a way to tell the xbox 360 to use any storage above a set limit to be used as a hard drive to store the VERY small files on it needed for emulation, this would not slow the game down, and the USB pen I have
 would work perfectly for this ancient game.</p>
<p>Like when my PC looks for the floppy drive I don't have, it doesn't mean I can't use other drives, that logic is flawed.</p>
<p>And 3 gigs is small, in relative terms compared to some of the stuff I have on my pens, hard drive and my PC. &nbsp;Last game I downloaded was 16GB and it's from 2008.</p>
<p>So maybe tell your customers the truth about the games you sell, that any hard drive won't do and you need the extra expensive microsoft one only, and it must have the emulator files on it. PC games don't get away with missing information like this, they
 would be hung for it. (although I have seen it happen a few times)</p>

<p>how isn't that clear ? its saying you need a xbox HD not a USB drive</p>

<p>do you know what caching is?</p>
<p>its not something that you set</p>
<p>its temporary memory that the pc uses to store files for random access</p>
<p>an xbox nor ps3 are not computers you don't tell it how to treat system files thats automatic</p>
<p>|"Like when my PC looks for the floppy drive I don't have, it doesn't mean I can't use other drives, that logic is flawed."</p>
<p>it isn;'t looking for storage its looking for your CACHE</p>
<p>usb drives and floppys don't have cache or would&nbsp; be very very slow at read write speeds of usb 1 unless you bought a decent one at 1-12mb per sec which is very very slow</p>

<p>they did tell you the truth they told you, you needed an xbox HD not a usb drive</p>
<p>system requirements aren;'t set by you its set by the manufacturer game developers and all of them on original xbox requires a HD because all original xbox had a HD</p>

<p>Hard drive - a storage device. &nbsp;And we all know that not all the hard drives work, let's not forget that.</p>
<p>I don't tell the XBOX what to do, of course not, thats what Microsoft can do. It's entirely possible to make it use another storage device, they just won't do it.</p>
<p>So the XBOX hard drive is used as cache, then if this storage can be used as cache, any dam storage could be used as cache, with the right format. It is not rocket science.</p>
<p>They did not tell the truth here, all they said was 'Hard drive'</p>
<p>Nothing about Microsoft brand, nothing about emulation files, nothing about non use of other storage devices, which can and would do the job easily, without a doubt.</p>
<p>So which fan boy will hit me with some more random lies ?</p>

    <title>Driver issues with latest Surface Book 2 Firmware Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Driver issues with latest Surface Book 2 Firmware Update</h2>
                    After installing the August 1st update for my Surface Book 2 13" through Windows Update, I am now getting driver errors for both the "Surface System Aggregator" and "Surface UEFI" in Device Manager. Both devices are producing the same error message "This
 device cannot start. (Code 10) The request is not supported." I tried rolling back the update and downloading the Firmware update package and reinstalling manually but it still resulted in the same driver errors. The device as a whole seems to still run normally
 and I haven't encountered any other issues other than those error messages. I also tried running the Surface Diagnostics Toolkit and but that didn't seem to help so I'm at a lost.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have managed to solve this issue. It seems to be related to BitLocker/UEFI SecureBoot's preventing the installatio or execution of the updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was to follow the guide&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4057282/bitlocker-recovery-key-prompt-after-surface-uefi-or-tpm-firmware-updat</p>
<p>
</p><p>to disable BitLocker on C:, reboot to UEFI, set SecureBoot to Microsoft only and reboot again. Only at that point the Upgrading Firmware booting screen appeared and took a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the system booted, the drivers are all working fine. I them re-enabled BitLocker using the command in the guide above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate if someone could communicate this to the Surface team, since it seems to be an omission on their side.<br />
</p>

<h2>            Redeeming vouchers child account</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have redeemed a voucher on my child's account who has created an&nbsp;Xbox account. However, when my child tries to make a purchase of a DVD, we get an error saying child/teens cannot make purchases.</p>

<p>How can I resolve this?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft forums where you can find answers to all your Windows related queries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have mentioned that you randomly get an error message stating that a problem has risen and the computer needs to restart and when the computer restarts, you get another error message stating that there is no operating system found. Don’t worry; we’ll
 help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just a few questions first, to get a clear picture of the issue;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>When did this issue start? Did you make any recent changes to the computer before this issue started?</p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you get a blue screen or black screen when you get the Operating system not found error?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error message 'kernel _inpage_data_error' means that the requested page of kernel data from paging file could not be read into the memory. The error message “no operating system found” indicates that either the boot files are corrupted or the Basic Input
 Output System (BIOS) is not detecting the hard disk. These could be an indication of some hard drive errors or a failing hard drive. I would suggest you to try these steps and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Disk error check</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a Disk error check to see if there are any bad or corrupted sectors in the hard drive. Refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In File explorer, right click on the drive where the operating system is installed</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Select properties and click on the tools tab</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the check button under error checking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Data available on bad sectors might be lost when Disk check tries to repair your hard disc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Generate system health report</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to generate a system health report to find out the health status of the hard drive. You can refer these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press Windows key +C, select control panel</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “performance information and tools”</p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “advanced tools” in the left panel</p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on “generate a system health report” and check the results under “disk checks” and “hardware and drivers check”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: Windows updates</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check and download recent updates and driver updates by enabling Windows updates. Refer this link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-update-faq</a>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: Update BIOS </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could also be caused if the BIOS driver is corrupted. I would suggest you to install the latest BIOS driver and check. You can visit the computer manufacturer’s website to check for latest BIOS driver, install it and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring
 of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Please get back to us with the status of the issue, so that we can help you accordingly.</p>

            i have a brand new computer running W8 and should not have this kind of issue. &nbsp;lenovo says it was because i had a flash driver connected. &nbsp;this was removed. &nbsp;still happening. &nbsp;i reinstalled the os backt go the defaults. &nbsp;nothing added to cause this issue.
 &nbsp;the perfomance report is gobbylygook about a bad hard drive, etc. &nbsp;there has to be something else going on. &nbsp;lenovo suggested i disable the auto install for W updates.

            I bought a new Lenovo k430 and was doing updates and I got this error. &nbsp;Tried to enter the one key recovery system but it wouldn't boot either. &nbsp; I took machine back to the store (pc world in the uk). And the assistant manager accused me of trying to install
 another operating system on it and wasn't willing to exchange it. &nbsp;But I took him I was well within my rights as the machine was only a week old and was obviously faulty. &nbsp;After 45 mins of arguing he said he would exchange it this once but not again if anything
 happened it. &nbsp; &nbsp;I have got the new one home and updating and the same thing happened again but I have been able to recover it this time. &nbsp; &nbsp; I have since spoke to a friend and they have had he same thing happen to them. &nbsp;Updating win 8. And got error 1962
 no operating system installed
<div><br />
<div>What is going on with the update?? &nbsp;It's the most recent one I think and it's about 160-190 mb I think</div>

            <p>Has anybody found a solution for this problem with error 1962? My wife has a All in one Lenovo P540. I just put in a brand new&nbsp;WD 1TB 7200rpm&nbsp;HDD and getting the same error code when I start up the computer. At the time this happened the computer was running
 windows 8.1. Other than the keyboard and mouse that came with the computer nothing was hooked up to the computer. Something other than the hard drive is causing this and I can see that I am not the only one that has had this problem. The computer is only about
 a year or so old.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Thank you for answering my problem, I did everything you suggested even ran the DISM but it came back with error 0x800f081f and said the source files could not be found. When I try to create a restore point the same error message as before reappears and
 the drive or files cannot be found there either.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Why no &#34;Log Off&#34; button offered on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    With Windows 7, Malwarebytes program is set to run at 3:00AM, when I am logged off. I can't do that with my Windows 10 laptop computer since there is no "Log off" offered. Will using the "Sleep" button allow other programs to run at a given time?

<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, the <strong>log off</strong> button was replaced by <strong>
sign off</strong> in Windows 10. To sign out, just follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Windows or Start</strong> button on the lower left.</li><li>Hover your cursor to <strong>Shut down or Sign out</strong> to show 4 options in the drop down (<strong>Sign out, Sleep, Shut down, Restart</strong>.)</li><li>Choose <strong>Sign out</strong>.</li></ul>
Let us know how it goes.<br />

<p>Hi Mike84596,</p>
<p>You may do a system restore and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>System Restore returns your PC's system files and programs to a time when everything was working fine, potentially preventing hours of troubleshooting headaches. In Windows 7, System Restore is even more helpful. You can create more system restore points
 and see exactly what files will be removed or added when your PC is restored.</p>
<p>To open system restore,</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Open System Restore by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type System Restore, and then, in the list of results, click System Restore.<br />
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>Refer the below links for more details:</p>
<p><strong>What is System Restore?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-is-System-Restore</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>System Restore: frequently asked questions<br />

<p>If the issue doesn’t get fixed after doing a system restore, try rebuilding the icon cache and see if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p>1. Click Start and type cmd in the search box and press enter.</p>
<p>2. In the command prompt, type each command line below one at a time followed by pressing enter after each single line.</p>
<p><strong>CD /d %userprofile%\AppData\Local <br />
DEL IconCache.db /a <br />
EXIT </strong></p>
<p>3. Log off and log on, or restart the computer to rebuild the icon cache.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This rebuilds and recreates a new IconCache.db file.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>
</p><p>then i uninstalled the adobe reader, which is not logic because c:\x is the folder with programs installed by my choice in the former installation of windows, so when deleting adobe reader, it only removed it from d:\p (where those programs are now) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>i leave adobe reader uninstalled... maybe you have other options...</p>

•&nbsp;Did you try deleting the folder after taking the ownership of that folder?</div>
<div><br />
If still this issue persists, I suggest you to Boot the computer in safe mode and check if it helps. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows
 are installed. Please click on the mentioned link below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Easily enter safe mode in windows 8<br />

    <title>How do I open documents, and other files, from MTP devices &#40;All - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> my copyright and privacy is being destroyed by mtp  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I open documents, and other files, from MTP devices &#40;All MTP devices but Android phones specifically&#41; without them being automatically copied to the Windows PC before opening&#63;</h2>
                    This is a copyright, privacy and freedom of speech issue for my business.<br />
<br />
Each time I open a file from a MTP device I've discovered it is automatically coped (without my explicit permission) to the PC it is connected to and it remains there after the deivce is connected.<br />
<br />
This is HUGE privacy and copyright breach for any and all users of MTP devices.&nbsp; I could even be infringing my freedom of speech.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will only be able to open documents if the file format is compatible with Android phones or with all the MTP devices. It will be better if you search in google for a convertor then try to open it in all MTP devices or Android phones.</p>

            <blockquote>This is a copyright, privacy and freedom of speech issue for my business.<br />
<br />
How do I open documents, and other files, from MTP devices (All MTP devices but Android phones specifically) without them being automatically copied to the Windows PC before opening? Each time I open a file from a MTP device I've discovered it is automatically
 coped (without my explicit permission) to the PC it is connected to and it remains there after the deivce is connected.<br />
<br />
This is HUGE privacy and copyright breach for any and all users of MTP devices.&nbsp; I could even be infringing my freedom of speech.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
MTP device user and Copyright Holder.</blockquote>
<div><br />
<div>MTP (Media Transfer Protocol) is for media files only and does not work with documents. The reason for copying files into the PC is that the MTP protocol is designed to use only a single instance of communication, meaning, only a single file transfer operation
 is supported at a time. Therefore, when you open a file directly from the device, it prevents other file transfer activity in the device, so to avoid this, Windows copies the files to the PC before opening. This setting can't be changed. For more information,
 kindly follow the links:</div>

<div>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_Transfer_Protocol</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you want to prevent files being copied to the PC, you can use Mass Storage mode or Mass Storage Class (MSC) mode.</div>

            MTP does this with media as well, any file opened through windows explorer is copied out (Win7 hides the act for some media).&nbsp; Android has removed USB mass storage in it's JB update.&nbsp; I'm now stuck with a Android/Windows MTP system that blatently infringes
 (if not steals user data) the copyright and privacy of the device owner.<br />
<br />
To say this is a feature of Android/Windows that device owners have to live with would be the biggest Copyright and Privacy breach ever.&nbsp; Even freedom of speech is restricted as the file can't be edited without copying from the PC.&nbsp; Hundreds of millions of
 people are having their data stripped off their MTP devices everytime they connect them to a PC and open a file.<br />
<br />
This fault has to be fixed.<br />

            Yes, Google made it mandatory for using MTP and removed mass storage class (MSC) from ICS/JB. Kindly wait for any further updates from Google, for inclusion of MSC on their future releases.
<div><br />
<div>And for Windows, the file being opened is usually copied to a temporary location and is deleted after the device is disconnected or at most after a restart. So no need to worry about the data being copied.</div>

            As for copying to a temporary location where it is automatically deleted (I've checked this on several PC's), it's not the case.&nbsp; It copies into a "temp" folder, yes, but it is not deleted.&nbsp; The temp folder that it automatically copies to is not automatically
 deleted on restart.&nbsp; The data remains even after restart, on every windows machine I've used.&nbsp; I've even shown this to friends and colleges who've used their own PC's to access their MTP phones -&nbsp; and in every case they've had files (some of it personal) left
 behind in the temp folder, even on machines they've restarted several times since the last MTP connection.<br />
Imagine how they feel when I tell them that the same thing happens on PC's that they've connected to that they don't own.<br />
<br />
In my experience I've yet to see a single instance where the files are not left on the PC, including after restart.&nbsp; Deletion may be what is supposed to happen and what people think is happening, but the testing I've done has confirmed my experience that the
 deletion action does not happen at all.<br />
<br />
It could also be taken advantage of to transfer malicous software into PC's.<br />
<br />
I really think that if something is not done soon I will hear the words "World-wide consumer class action".<br />

            <p>I had the same problem. I then reinstalled Win7. When I contacted dell customer support, the guy told me my PC is tested suitable for Windows 10. So with his help, I updated all Win7 updates and then upgraded to Win10 again. I was good for about a week until
 a few minutes ago. It is frozen again with Google Chrome activated and idled for about 10 min. I had to hard reset to start the PC. It has many errors including the one causing system freezing.</p>

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Selection jumps to bottom file in folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mgrist  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Selection jumps to bottom file in folder</h2>
                    <p>When using Windows Explorer to manage files, using either the mouse or the keyboard, if a file somewhere in the middle of the folder is selected, the selection point jumps, and now the bottom file in the source folder (or the destination folder) becomes
 selected.</p>
<p>Makes it difficult if selecting several files to move to another folder, if, after spending some time selecting different files, the selection point has moved.</p>
<p>Usually looks fine until I move the mouse from hovering over one of the folders to hovering over the other one.</p>
<p>I hope I have described this problem correctly. I could not find another post with this exact same problem listed.</p>
<p>I ran the hardware troubleshooter, rebooted, but still same problem.</p>

<p>Anyway, <b><a href="http://www.theage.com.au/digital-life/games/blockbuster-la-noire-faces-credits-crisis-20110620-1gaw3.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">click here</a></b></p>

<p>Apparently roughly 130 Aussies that worked on LA Noire got no credit for it. Sure they got their moneys, but their names weren't included in the credits anywhere!</p>

<p>I think it's less about you and I seeing their name in the credits and more the ability to put the game into their personal portfolios. I mean who wouldn't want to be able to say they worked on LA Noire? It doesn't mean that they can't, but it's so much
 more effort proving they were if they're not in the credits.</p>

<p>I read about this not too long ago, apparently they said that if they put everyone's name in the credits who had helped on the game, then it would be way too long, and it was pretty epic as it is now.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still don't think its right though, they deserve the credit as much as any of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did hate how they forced you to sit through the credits once you'd finished the game though.

<p>Truly shithouse if you ask me. &nbsp;How little it would matter, and how little effort it would need for them to put the names of the people who worked on the game in the credits - and from what I understand Team Bondis imput was not insubstantial - when viewed
 in relation to how important it is for the people who did said work to be recognised for it, I think this is a huge let down.</p>
<p>They can make all the excuses they want about already long credits or whatever, but the thing is... they made room for their own logo, their own people, and probably thanks to all these other people who actualy did nothing and these are the names of the
 babies born during development. &nbsp;In the words of Derryn Hinch... Shame.</p>

<p>Then they should have made the credits go faster! It's a real shame to have people left off especially if they have contributed to the game. It's also cool to be able to show your friends/family, plus you can show it in your portfolio as stated above...It
 shows you were apart of the whole thing. I know I'd feel a bit miffed if it happened to me. It's fun to point out your name in the credits, done it before..hahaha.</p>

<p>Yeah I hate when you finish a game late at night and know you won't be able to stay up until the end of the credits to see if there's any teasers at the end... They should just have the credits as a menu option at all times. Lots of people wouldn't see the
 COD or Halo credits as they only play the multiplayer anyway. Same for racing/sports games..</p>

<p>I assume you mean your keyboard.</p>
<p>First, try using another keyboard on that computer and see if it works OK.&nbsp; Then try the keyboard from that computer on another computer to see if it has the same problem.&nbsp; This way we can tell if the problem is the keyboard or the computer.</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager
 and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting
 tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do so for your keyboard at least and any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Keep me advised and if this doesn't work, we'll try something else (but chances are good if this doesn't work that your keyboard has gone bad - but we'll
 cross that bridge when we come to it).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi Helal,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you referring to the Mail app in Windows 8.1?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest that you run the App troubleshooter and check if it helps to fix the issue. Refer the link and follow the steps.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Log in with a different Microsoft account and check if you face the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let us know the status of the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Mr. Viond and thank you for your reply ,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried the both methods but unfortunately no one helps&nbsp;.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Today&nbsp;I noticed that the problem is&nbsp;not only&nbsp;for the&nbsp;application of "Mail"&nbsp;, but also every application generated by Microsoft store have the same problem of not recognizing what's inside my computer ,</p>
<p>For example the Photo application doesn't recognize all the photos in the pc and I can't access all the folders in the computer but only the skydrive updated files .</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please find the attached screed capture&nbsp;for my problem<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a882ea7a-c997-44b2-afc6-d60377c04a32" />&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I replied this one by "Internet Explorer" application of windows 8.1 and I was forced to upload this capture to skydrive in order to upload it .<br />
</p>
<p>hope to see your reply as soon as possible .</p>
<p>Regards :)</p>

            <p>Hi Helal</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Photos app filters your photos to "Pictures Library" and "SkyDrive". So in order to see your photos from other locations on your PC, please add them to your Pictures Library.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can follow these instructions to add pictures to your Pictures Library&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/add-folders-library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/add-folders-library</a></p>

</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Monica</p>
