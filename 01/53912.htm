<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist, it sounds like you're experiencing an issue with the game Observer. I definitely understand how frustrating that can, but feel assured that I'm here to help. I do have a troubleshooting step we can try to perform
 which is a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Power cycle on the Xbox One</a>.&nbsp;As well&nbsp;one other thing to try is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Soft factory reset</a>(please be advised this will remove your
 profile from the Xbox One and choose the option that says keep my games and apps).&nbsp;Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>Hello Danny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reason why we do a soft factory reset is due to if a system file is corrupt and causing the issue, that will take care of it. We recommend doing the reset , but ultimately its your choice. Lets try to doing an uninstall a different way. Uninstall the game,
 power cycle the console, once the console is turned back on then&nbsp; reinstall the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            Hello!<br />
<br />
I would suggest doing a hard reset on your Xbox by pressing and holding the power button on the console for about 10 seconds, then power it back on.&nbsp; I would also recommend rebooting all of your networking equipment.

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just updated to the newest Skype and today have been getting messages sent to me from people along the lines of "Hey, long time! Glad to be connected!" etc. Gotten a few today from people I haven't spoken to in a long time so it's definitely not coincidence.
 Did Skype send out a message or alert to all of my contacts or something after I updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Benjie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply. I only mean that after I updated I started getting messages from people that said "Hi Andrew! How are you? Great to be connected!" and another that said "Hey it's been a while, hope you're doing well!" and a few others that are similar.
 It just seems strange that after I updated and restarted the app I started getting these messages all at once from people that I haven't heard from in years.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wondering if Skype maybe sends out a notification to all of my contacts that says something like "Andrew is on Skype! Say hello!" or something like that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>
<p>Andrew</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would have to agree that it is really weird that you have been receiving messages after you updated the Skype. I would like to inform you that Skype doesn't have the ability to send out notifications&nbsp;to your contacts that you updated&nbsp;to the newest version
 of the Skype app. We also do not send messages to your contacts in your behalf as we do not have that kind of feature.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is highly possible that your contacts had searched you on Skype and messaged you directly from their app.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have further inquiries or clarifications. </p>

<h2>            Win CE 6.0 - Embedding ceplayer inside the IE6 and refreshing&#47;reloading the page leaks handles</h2>
                    <p>I’m doing some testing on WinCE 6.0 and have come across the following issue. Using the IESample browser, a page that embeds a ceplayer active x component playing a movie
 file in a loop. Playing .wmv file in a loop leaks handles. So I suspected that the codec might have a bug and changed it to play MPEG-1 format file(.mpg). Now there are no handle leaks when it plays the mpg file and it runs for days. However refreshing the
 page or reloading the page is leaking the handles. This is true for both .wmv and .mpg format files.</p>

            Hi Pathek.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I've never dragged anything by double clicking.  Have you tried clicking and holding on the item to then drag it?  It's not even a full click until your release it once you've confirmed the drop location.  
<br />
<br />You can also change double click to click on any file, but not to drag, just to open it, in File Explorer &gt; View &gt; Options &gt; Change Folder and Search Options &gt; View &gt; General tab &gt; Click items menu
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply, what I was trying to explain was if we type something and then if we have to select few words from it usually we double click on the mouse pad and drag to select those words but it doesn't work on my laptop.<br />

            Hi Pathik
<br />
<br />If you want to select just a full word, you normally double click and the word should be selected.
<br />
<br />If you want to select more or less than one whole word, click and drag, do not double click - does that work for you?

    <title>Security and permissions messed up by Win 10 October upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Security and permissions messed up by Win 10 October upgrade</h2>
                    &nbsp;I have just upgraded to the latest October Win 10 upgrade.&nbsp; I went to make some changes to a music file using an app and it said I didn't have permission to change the file!!&nbsp; As a user I am graham and have a user file in c:\users\graha (for some reason
 it doesn't use the last letter but it has always been that way with Windows 10).&nbsp; When I look on the properties of the file or folders and then look at Security I see the following: Group of user names:&nbsp; Authenticated Users; SYSTEM; Account Unknown with a
 long MS type ref; Account Unknown with another long MS type ref; Account Unknown with a long MS ref; Account Unknown with a long MS type ref; (YES 4 unknown!!); The uses with her name(PC name/her name); Administrators(PC name/Adminstrators); Users (PC name/Users).&nbsp;
 The owner shown for all these under security is my *** Email address is removed for privacy *** that I use to log onto my PC I went to this approach using my MS account when I originally upgrade

<p>Hello grahamm7, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get an error as such, that means you do not have permissions to that particular file or folder.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. May I know, if you are able to access other files and folders? </p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method</strong>: Firstly, you need to be signed in as an Administrator to your account. Later, if you are unable to access that file, you can go ahead and provide Admin rights by following the article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2623670/access-denied-or-other-errors-when-you-access-or-work-with-files-and-f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Support
 article</a>&nbsp;(Applicable to Windows 10 as well). By doing that you will be able to access files and folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. </p>

<p>I had already started to look at permissions but this was confusing because of the permissions that say Deny to an Account Unknown.&nbsp; And whilst I am the owner of the files - I do not appear in the permissions list.&nbsp; I have played with permissions and can
 overcome the problem but I did every file in the sub-folder (album) and the folder (artist).&nbsp; The Music app then didn't have a problem. But I don't really want to have to go through all my 200+ music files 1 by 1 !!&nbsp; Here is link on MS One Drive that may show
 the situations and what I have done:&nbsp; https://1drv.ms/b/s!AhFCmdfDoQkqswBjpPR-8TcNlqb5</p>
<p>I hope you are allowed to look at files (PDF) on your own Microsoft One Drive that is how I have shared information before. I will be interested in your reply and how I may clean up my PC with regard to permissions.</p>

<p>You went to a lot of trouble in compiling the background information to your problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why your permissions are incorrect I do not know but fortunately there is a fairly easy cure. This recipe will solve all problems in one fell swoop:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log on under an admin account.</li><li>Create a destop shortcut for cmd.exe.</li><li>Right-click it, then left-click <em>Run as administrator.</em></li><li>Accept the challenge. You will get a black frame.</li><li>Type these commands <strong>exactly </strong>and press Enter after each:<br />
takeown&nbsp; /f&nbsp; D:\_Music&nbsp; /r<br />
cacls&nbsp; D:\_Music&nbsp; /T&nbsp; /g everyone:f&nbsp; system:f<br />
(Answer Y when asked "Are you sure?")</li></ol>

<p>What does takeown do???&nbsp; Alos cacls??&nbsp; &nbsp;I don't like doing things that I don't understand or what they do?</p>
<p>However I have solved the problem.&nbsp; Under security for the Music folder I added my user name and gave it full permission for all the folders and files.&nbsp; Solved.&nbsp; Even though I was the owner of all these folders and files I still added myself under permissions
 and it all works.&nbsp; I just liked UNIX there was root (god of the machine); your group to which you belong; and you the user; and you could give permissions cleanly.&nbsp; I have no idea what the deny to account unknown with all the usual Windows long strange numbers
 means??&nbsp; &nbsp; I do try to understand any OS I use rather than follow things blindly.&nbsp; But thanks for taking the effort to reply.&nbsp; But I would still like to know what I will be doing to my Music folder and files with takeown or cacls???/</p>

<p>Since you are comfortable in a Unix environment you might know that the commands I gave you are console commands. Typing console commands like so will tell you what they do:</p>
<p>takeown&nbsp; /? | more</p>
<p>cacls&nbsp; /? | more</p>

operable program or batch file!!!&nbsp; Actually I just used properties and Security and adjusted those if you read the previous replies.&nbsp; So I just added myself to security and gave my self FULL permission.&nbsp; As an ex UNIX person I am happy with Command type commands
 it just finding them or knowing them.&nbsp; But the permissions on Windows are weird.&nbsp; So I had Deny Account unknown with a string I don't understand - you wouldn't get that in UNIX.&nbsp;<br />

<p>In your first post you were not impressed at having to modify the access settings of a large number of files. I responded to your concern by giving you two commands that would let you do things in one fell swoop, including the removal of the unknown accounts.
 It was up to you to use the commands or not. And while cacls.exe is deprecated, it still works perfectly.</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick reply - you are on the ball.&nbsp; Sorry I misread the i as an L.&nbsp; Actually when using the Security -&gt;Permsissions there is a tick box for all subfolders and files.&nbsp; So on my Music folder I added myself and ticked the sub-folder box.&nbsp; It
 then added me to all the sub-folders and files.&nbsp; But I will put these useful commands in my Log Book I keep on my PC and Windows 10.&nbsp; The problem is remembering all the commands that are available using a Command Shell etc...&nbsp; But many thanks - great work
 keep up the good work on the forum - much appreciated.</p>

<p>The problem was not really that Windows 10 was messing up permissions.&nbsp; A particular APP (Bliss - music library) with Firefox acted as if I didn't have permissions.&nbsp; The app people are now aware and going to sort.</p>

<h2>            Customer Support - 2018 May 21st or 22nd</h2>
                    <p>There was something wrong&nbsp;with my laptop related to Windows Defender and I happened to contact Microsoft online support.&nbsp; The agent
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Elyrico V.</strong></span>&nbsp; was a very good human being and he&nbsp;suggested to reinstall windowa10.&nbsp; After doing all the&nbsp;things for new installation through a remote session he went away. Also, he did
 send an email with a link to reconnect if the same problem occurs even after the re-installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the problem occurred once again and I happened to connect with online support once again.&nbsp; Then the connected agent was one
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1); text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Junaid.</strong></span> He also attended to my matter through a remote session.&nbsp; He suggested creating a new&nbsp; User Account and created the same&nbsp;with my permission.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When he attempted to create the previously&nbsp;existed App shortcuts in the desktop, it didn't allow to do so.&nbsp; Then he suggested to pin them to the taskbar. But I needed it on the desktop.&nbsp; Then he suggested me to come through a new online support session.&nbsp;
 Actually, by then it has been consumed a quite a long time. But he should finish his job on a proper way up to the fullest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm requesting all the previous apps to create on the desktop ( because it didn't allow otherwise I could have to do it )&nbsp;
<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">Then angrily, unethically and inhumanly Junid disconnected the remote session asking me to come through a new online support session.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was helpless as a customer who doesn't&nbsp;sound on hardware/software issues.&nbsp; With the said windows 10&nbsp; installation and new user account creation, the whole system behaved strangely.&nbsp; OS language and keyboard layout have changed to German as I m in Germany.
 Even the browsers were not in English.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Translating the instructions in German to English through iPad I happened to waste almost 2 hours to change the setup.&nbsp; Then I was able to&nbsp;connect again to the one line support once again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The agent connected next was too a very good and was able to fulfill all the need to the fullest while apologizing&nbsp;me.&nbsp; (He/She has been careful not to disclose his name in the e-mail finally send )</p>
<p>
</p><p>This what my experience online&nbsp;support and I happened to sleepless the full night as I needed the laptop desperately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Please can there be a MLB Official game next year&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>It may not be a gigantic seller but there is a huge glaring gap between the PS4 and the Xbox One, and that is a legitimate MLB game. MLB: The Show is consistently a great game that has a big following and while there is a snowball's chance in hell it ports
 to the 360/One I really think EA <em>(or even 2K)</em> needs to step in and get a licensing deal with the MLB and release a baseball game.</p>
<p>I understand the last few years of MLB 2k games have been god awful (<em>and for some reason I keep buying them every year</em>) but it was<strong> something</strong>. It was a fully licensed game that had updated rosters and somewhat decent gameplay.. They
 just need to improve on the CPU Fielders and other glitches and the game would be a great rival to The Show. EA releases Madden every single year and manages to put out a very good product (<em>yes it has its flaws but it is a great NFL simulator)</em> and
 you could bring back the MVP name which still has clout with a lot of gamers from back in the original Xbox / PS2 days and get a good following from the get go. Even 2k could do something special if they were able pull their head's out of their butts when
 it came to baseball, and release a game as good as their NBA product - it would outsell The Show without question.
</p>
<p><br />
Hopefully other people on here agree there needs to be a legitimate MLB game for the Xbox for 2015...</p>

<p>I'm indifferent on a baseball game coming to the One as I haven't played a baseball game (sans Nicktoons MLB) in ages. &nbsp;It would really have to be a gift from MS to make one though as with the cost of development and licensing fees they'd more than likely
 lose money on the product due to the lack of sales it would have. &nbsp;Keep in mind that baseball is really only popular in America, Korea &amp; Japan, and the latter of those 3 is mostly a Sony country.</p>

<p>Does it annoy anybody else that that's fine? What Eggnogga said, "...mostly a Sony country." This is off-topic but it irritates me. There are articles online from legit video-game journalists at places like Destructoid, Kotaku, CVG, and Edge, that basically
 state why Microsoft's Xbox will not do well in those markets.</p>
<p>It's not because the price-points are too high, or because the products aren't up to snuff, or even that the library of games isn't appealing to the Japanese audience. It's because the product isn't Japanese - because it is American. lol This is apparently
 accepted by all, including mainstream media.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if all of North America essentially boycotted Japanese goods BECAUSE they were Japanese? The PC police would riot. I think. lol There's something a little jaded about how everybody is fine with North American products tanking in a market
 BECAUSE they're North American products. It irritates me. lol</p>

<p>If it means that much to you save up and get a PS4. You'll get to play the show and a bunch of other great games. No game EA or 2K is going to make will be as good as the show and MS isn't going to make a first part MLB game, so there's only one option.</p>

<p>Can we please have a legitmate MLB baseball game for xbox owners because last year the only baseball game on xbox that was new was RBI baseball and that game was not good at all i tried the demo and i did not like it one bit i am getting an xbox one in January
 and i hope that we can get a official mlb game with amazing next gen graphics and gameplay along with fun modes whether 2K comes back to baseball or EA brings MVP baseball out of retirement and do to the fact mlb sports games may not be big sellers there are
 many mlb fans that will buy PS4's just to get MLB the show now since xbox doesn't have a legitimate MLB game anymore so can Microsoft please talk to 2K or EA about getting xbox owners a MLB game that the community on Xbox can be exicited for</p>

<p>What if they did High Heat for a year or 2 without MLB licensing? Let the community do the editing and if it gains enough steam the can add MLB licensing in a couple of years. It would give them more money to make the game look and play great.</p>

<p>I would like to see another MLB 2K. &nbsp;Personally, I think that MLB 2K was better than Madden. &nbsp;Madden has been awful for the past several years, especially a couple years ago when they switched the Infinity Engine and players bent oddly and limbs were all
 over the place. But Football is more popular than Baseball for numerous reasons. &nbsp;I would like to see Take Two give MLB another go. &nbsp;But it is unlikely. &nbsp;</p>

            None of Skype's phone call subscriptions include SMS, nor is there ANY PAGE on your entire website that details SMS rates. &nbsp;Very frustrated with Skype about this. &nbsp;Is it that hard to say "Here's what our SMS rates are"? &nbsp;The "rates page" ONLY details making
 phone calls and phone call plans, there is NO information about SMS, and the site navigation instructions for finding SMS rates are outdates; the page no longer exists.

            Hey JaiAllen,
<br />
<br />This is more of a workaround, this most likely won't resolve your issue. But if you run Command Prompt as an administrator (go to Start, look for "cmd" in search, then right-click Command Prompt and Run as administrator), and run devmgmt.msc from there, does the error persist?
<br />
<br />Let me know.

<h2>            Jigsaw puzzle will not load.</h2>
                    <p>I have asked this question now a few times and it would seem that no one at Microsoft gives a darn about monitoring their games. When you changed to six levels of jigsaw puzzles, my game stopped loading and I have not been able to play or get past the log
 in screen for over a week. This is my favorite game, and I'm getting really angry that it won't load much less allow me to play. I uninstalled it, and re-installed it and lost all my puzzles, but it worked for a day or so. Now nothing! Fix your game or take
 it down!</p>

            Yes, change your password and remove that payment information from being automatically stored on your console. Also, you can contact your bank to either dispute the charges and report them as fraud, or to cancel the card altogether and have a new one issued
 with new numbers.

            Mostly all of the solutions here are good. As stated I would remove the debit card from the account then contact the financial institution to report the card compromised to get another one and while doing so contact EA to see if you can get the charges
 credited back to the account and if that doesn't work file a dispute with your financial institution for your money back. Also finding&nbsp; out how the person gained access to your card info may be helpful especially if the cid/cvv code was used to make the purchase
 because it may be a source closer to home doing it rather than an outside source like a random stranger.&nbsp;

<h2>            How to find inetmgr on windows 8.1 and let location field show the localhost path while saving ASP.net web application project&#63;</h2>
                    Hie&nbsp;<br />
I have started learning ASP.Net Web application.<br />
While saving first project ,it should show localhost name in the **location ** box.<br />
But it shows normal project folder present in C: path.<br />
I have also set up IIS Services.<br />
OS is Windows 8.1.<br />

    <title>Surface Pro 4&#58; How can I use Wi-Fi Direct &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chiangmaifan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4&#58; How can I use Wi-Fi Direct &#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have new Surface Pro 4 and want to transfer files using Wi-Fi Direct between it and my other devices, ie to and from both my HTC One (M8) and my Nexus 7. These Android devices are easily paired to each other and Wi-Fi Direct functionality works flawlessly.
 However, I been unable to pair either of them with my SP4. So my question is is Wi-Fi Direct supported natively on my SP4 and if so what do I do to turn it on ? But then if this is not possible is using 3rd party software an option ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that using cable or flash stick is not a sensible option as the SP4 has a single USB port and this is already taken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geoff</p>

            <p>Hi Barb, Thanks for your suggestion. I've now tried the Share My Files app (free trial).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HTC One (M8) now 'sees' my SP4 for the first time when scanning for Wi-Fi Direct peers which is a good first step :-) However, the invitation to pair (sent from phone) is not received by my SP4. Additionally, when using the Share My Files app on my SP4
 to scan for Wi-Fi Direct peers it does not find my phone. Consequently, without pairing, I am as yet unable to send/receive files in ether direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'Share My Files' documentation refers to Windows 8 and I have SP4 with Windows 10 but I don't think this should be a problem as I understand that Wi-Fi Direct is a protocol and not hardware or OS dependent. I suspect that my experience indicates that
 either my SP4 and/or the SMF app are not correctly configured for Wi-Fi Direct, but I am not a technician and any more thoughts on this would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Geoff</p>

<p>Sorry, I don't have any ideas of where the problem may be. You might contact the author of the app and see if you can get some support there. There's a lot of technical info on MSDN for app developers on how this works in Windows 10.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. What is the status of the device in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device manager</a>?<br />
2. Have you installed HTC sync?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if it helps.<br />
<br />
a. On your device, go to "Start" - "Settings" - "Connection" - "USB to PC" and <strong>
uncheck</strong> <strong>"Advanced</strong> <strong>network</strong> <strong>functionality".<br />
<br />
</strong>b. Now connect via USB and see if that does the trick. <br />

<h2>            Complaints</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am a European user of Windows Vista and would like to file an 'official complaint' if that is at all possible. In my efforts searching the internet, The closest thing I have been able to find anywhere is a snail-mail address in the U.S.</p>
<p>I have purchased every OS I have used legally, I have always felt that as the core of the PC that you use so much, it is only right that you pay, I have gone from Windows 95 &gt; Windows 98 &gt; Windows 2000 &gt; Windows XP &gt; Vista.</p>
<p>Right now I am hugely disappointed with this software and have been so within weeks of getting my new PC up and running, I have simply too many different issues to list and would love to roll back to XP at this point but I no longer have my key for this.</p>
<p>At this moment in time I refuse to give microsoft hundreds of euros not to 'upgrade to new and improved features' of Windows 7, but to get rid of bugs, lag, crashes and other issues which I fully accepted would be fixed over time, none of the various updates
 I have installed, or re-installs of the PC itself have had any effect on this operating system and right now I am left extremely angry and frustrated and suddenly in a position why I understand someone would go out there and pirate a version of Windows 7 off
 the internet, especially if they paid money for Vista first.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yeah, I imagined this was the incorrect place, part of my problem is that I can't seem to actually find a 'correct place' either. In regards to issues:</p>
<p>Most recent and annoying one that has started occurring almost daily is full-screen applications refusing to remain active, with vista repeatedly bouncing me back to the desktop, this happens regardless of the particular application, through spamming the
 task-bar to focus on the app, I can most often eventually get it to 'stay' and then use the program.</p>

<p>If you really want to "press the issue", you can google for Microsoft Corp address.</p>
<p>Back to your 1st problem....<br />
I have problem understanding. " ...bounce you back to the desktop ..." ?<br />
Do you mean the program that you had opened shut down on its own ?<br />
Or do you mean the program would not stay " full-screen " ?</p>

            Not stay full screen, the program (Which ever one it is) remains working, by clicking repeatedly on its icon on the task bar you can see it for a few seconds, then you get send immediately back to desktop (as if you had minimalised it)&nbsp;

<p>Start button &gt; Control Panel &gt;classic view &gt; right click on&nbsp;Folder Options &gt; Create shortcut&nbsp; &gt; exit Control Panel window.<br />

            <p>As a very old user (since 1980's), working with MS products since the begining of the company, even if I have some complaints to raise I can't share your point of view.</p>
<p>Windows NT, XP and Windows 7 were nices O.S. (as an engineer, with hard and soft knowledge).</p>
<p>I have spent three week to switch from Win 7 to Win 10, and met some troubles but from my changes in directory or something else very "risky" so I'm responsable of these troubles.</p>
<p>Finally I decided to swith from a clean WIN 7 install, with consequences in&nbsp;reinstall of many packages&nbsp;: it wille take some time, but&nbsp;for me important is the way taken by the new engineering team.
</p>
<p>They are driven in&nbsp;the right&nbsp; direction : -&nbsp;qualification of the configuration, drivers included, bootsrapping in realtime, net-computing architecture (cloud) like old client-server computing ...</p>
<p>I'm sure they succeed, if they take attention to some points discovered in IHM features, only after a few hours of usage.
</p>
<p>I hope I will find a way to rise a positive complaint to improve some points and get a very confortable product.</p>
<p>The win 7 look-like is very interesting&nbsp; because we need only a few minutes to manage Win 7. In fact this is the reconnaissance of the fiasco of Win 8 that never&nbsp;toke&nbsp;any care of the users very satisfied with the previous products&nbsp; I mentionned just before&nbsp;...</p>

            How is it that out of all the companies in the world. That Microsoft is the most user unfriendly. They purposefully try to makeas difficult as possible to use their products, &nbsp;and every time you do, &nbsp;you end up having to change passwords over and over.
 &nbsp;It's almost impossible complaining to them. They have no interest in helping customers, or responding to your problems or requests or complaints, &nbsp;and only want to take as much money as they can off people.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windvd creator 2 does not find my dvd recorder in windows 7</h2>
                    <p>My dvd can be seen in windows 7 and written to directly.</p>
<p>It can play dvd's without issue.</p>
<p>But my WinDVD creator 2 does not display anything under the burn direct to disk, despite having a clean DVD inserted. On attempting to write to the hard drive for install later, WinDVD creator 2 has created a folder that is not accessible and crashes windows
 explorer if you try. Cannot be deleted, Cannot be found using DOS if you attempt to CD into the directory but displays using DIR /W.
</p>
<p>WinDVD creator 2 also greys out all the menus after starting the burn to file and locked out any access to the program after it completed the burn process to file.</p>

            <p>I have since found a way to use WinDVD creator.</p>
<p>When I get to the part of burning a DVD, I now burn the files to a folder on my PC instead and then outside of WinDVD Creator2, I copy the Video_TS and Audio_TS folders directly to the DVD burner using windows explorer (do not forget to remove the desktop.ini
 file waiting to be burnt to the DVD before burning it).</p>

                    I am using a program that allows me to back up or transfer installed applications using the info in the Add/Remove programs list. One of the main programs I need to back up is missing from the list, but still installed and fully functional. I need to know
 how to recover the program to the list so my back up program can safely transfer all the required files before we rebuild/replace the PC it resides on. No, we do not have the original installation media anymore.

<p>I'm trying Recuva, which supposedly uses the Add/Remove Programs info to compile a list of all files associated with an installation for the file transfer/backup.</p>
<p>The program that's not showing up in the Add/remove Programs list is a specialized RWIS configuration program(for weather stations), the program is installed and working, but I have to assume someone tried to uninstall sometime in the past and the cancelled
 and got the "didn't uninstall properly, would you like to remove from Add/Remove List" prompt.</p>
<p>We no longer have the installation media for this and supplier reports the program is linked directly to the media, a new package would cost in the thousands. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to find and remove corrupted Windows 8 installation file&#63;  and reinstall or delete files not needed</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have similar need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I know which files I should have installed with windows 8&nbsp; and 8.1 and which ones should not be there or which ones are not needed.&nbsp; I had my PC hacked and I have gone back to factory reset a few times which I set it to wipe everything out but what
 came with the PC as purchased but I have files that still keep loading that are not from the factory preinstalled original files that I believe should not be there.&nbsp; I also have these visual studio files from 2005 to 2012 that appeared from somewhere.</p>
<p>I do know that most of my software was all installed&nbsp;in 2014 and I cannot find a list&nbsp;to see what files were originally&nbsp;installed and which were added later and some of the software also has dates that were changed and some that say it was modified on this
 date and then shows an instillation date that was after the modification date.</p>
<p>I do not have a back up disc but do have files backed up on a flash drive.&nbsp; I believe&nbsp;I am being hacked through a win32 program or outlook or windows&nbsp;??&nbsp; I have ran all kinds of malware and virus and adware programs.&nbsp; These programs&nbsp;do find things all the
 time and wipe it out and then somehow things get changed on my computer in like shared files or security options to share and I go and change it back&nbsp;to DO NOT SHARE but it keeps happening.</p>
<p>One program keeps finding PUPS and like these same Microsoft&nbsp;KEY links that is quarantines but then it reappears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft and they just passed me around in a big circle from&nbsp;one tech to another and were no help and I lost my patience with them.
</p>
<p>I have had my&nbsp;security settings on my PC and in my virus and malware protection programs&nbsp;set and then they also get changed&nbsp; as well as the firewall.&nbsp; Firewall is set&nbsp;and then the settings&nbsp;gets changed to something else.
</p>
<p>I am the only user on this PC and all my accounts and do not share anything at all,&nbsp;so I do not know how this keeps happening.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I had all my information&nbsp;stolen in reference to&nbsp;my&nbsp;modem access and pc, bios and&nbsp;passwords,&nbsp; but I&nbsp;changed these&nbsp; as well several times and it still is happening.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So If I could see where to get a list of files that came preinstalled and&nbsp;should be on my PC to compare to the list that this option of file checker finds, then I hope to know what I should delete and what should be kept and&nbsp;needed to run windows 8 and the
 other programs that came with my PC&nbsp;when it was purchased.</p>
<p>I NEED HELP PLEASE&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; </p>
<p>ANY would be appreciated.</p>
