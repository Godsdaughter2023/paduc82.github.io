<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This would happen if the video card is damaged or needs updated drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest that you check if you can boot into&nbsp;<strong>Enable low resolution video (640 × 480)</strong> mode.</span></p>

 your computer if it is powered on.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Tap
 the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Enable

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the computer is unable to boot into the Low resolution mode then you will need to use different video card on the computer and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Surface 3 Mini DP</h2>
                    I purchased a MiniDP to HDMI cable, but it doesn't seem to work.&nbsp; I contacted the seller who asked me to try changing the refresh rate to 30, but my surface 3 with windows 10 gives an error&nbsp;<span><span>&nbsp;</span>'the display control panel is unable
 to change the display settings. you may not have appropriate administrative rights to change these settings' then another error saying 'the display settings are invalid please try another combination of display settings' I tried looking for the intel hd graphics
 driver from intel to allow the control panel, but cant identify which one I need, anyone any ideas?</span>

            Microsoft are really obstructive about the drivers, and giving you control over the surface.&nbsp; I downloaded new drivers from intel, uninstalled the installed driver and installed the new one which havg me the Intel hd graphics control panel, which at last
 let me change the refresh rate etc. But sadly to no avail, i also tried purchasing a new minidp to hdmi cable, also with no luck, i presume my minidp port is faulty, shame, cos i was looking to repurpose the surface by connecting it to my projector, as the
 screen has cracked, might just bin it now.

<p>Hi Adam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve your concern regarding the missing install or download button in Windows Store, we suggest that you follow the below methods and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Powershell Command to reset Applications.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We are aware that you've already done this method but we suggest that you perform it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span>Open an Elevated PowerShell prompt by pressing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Windows Key, typing
<strong>PowerShell</strong>, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then pressing <strong>Ctrl + Shift + Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. </span><span>Paste the following command into PowerShell and execute it:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Method 2: Disable security software on the system</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Try to disable your Antivirus and security related products and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Sign in to a different user profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Try signing in to a different user profile on your computer if you'll encounter the same issue.</p>
<p>- If there's no other user profile on your computer, try creating one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            That did not solve my problem but when I try to sign out Windows store stops responding to me and I have to close the whole app, it happens when i also try to access the settings. When I Try to run the Powershell program and put in the command it tells
 me that access is denied? <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9e58cfac-845a-4bd6-8757-fd66f4fcb621?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Avatar Beach Games. &#40;Xbox 360 Game Idea&#41;</h2>
                    

<p>So summer just started a few weeks ago and the beach is one of those places where people have fun in when the sun is fresh and do plenty of active stuff in water or sand.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how about this idea for an Xbox 360 game that include avatars and plenty of games to play in the beach like volleyball, swimming races, building sand castles and even more, it can be either playable with the Xbox controller or
 with Kinect. (It doesn't really matter even though Kinect may sound more fitting for the game)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game could be similar to other beach mini-game video games like Dead or Alive Xtreme. (Except that this one wouldn't have an M rating and mature themes) but it would still look cute. -^_^-</p>

<p>The game could also include a game feature for an avatar to meet another avatar of the opposite sexx and start a friendship or relationship together. \(-^o^-)/</p>
<p>But that is just a small idea that I had in mind...</p>

<p>That doesn't sound like a bad idea. &nbsp;I've played arcadey volleyball games on other consoles before and they were fun. &nbsp;As for your other idea about avatars meeting and having relationships, no.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Center</h2>
                    Windows Media Center cannot find a TV Tuner installed on my HP Desktop running Windows 7/64 bit.&nbsp; The device is an AVerTV Hybrid Volar MAX (Windows Starter Kit) HD tuner compatible with Win 7 and 8.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have updated the tuner driver and tried to update
 Windows Media Center, (but I was told the available WMC update did not apply to my machine.)&nbsp; The tuner is recognized in Device Manager, is working properly, and is ready to use.&nbsp;&nbsp; But when I try to Set up the TV signal, it tells me there is no TV tuner connected
 to the pc.&nbsp; This device works on a Toshiba laptop running the same system, but that is not the machine I want to record TV shows to.&nbsp; Can anyone think of a reason this does not work on the HP Desktop?&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>A TV tuner is a device you can use to connect an analog or digital TV signal to your computer. Without a TV tuner, you can't watch
 and record live TV in Media Center. TV tuners come in two basic model types: external TV tuners, which usually plug into a USB port on your computer, and internal TV tuner cards, which you must install inside your computer.</font></font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font><font>I would suggest you to refer to articles and make sure you have setup TV tuner correctly. Check if it helps.</font></font></span></p>

            Thanks Beethu B -- I have read the instructions and, in fact, am able to use the device successfully on my Toshiba laptop, which also runs Windows 7, 64 bit.&nbsp; So I know the device works properly and that I have it connected in the right way.&nbsp; The problem
 exists only on my HP desktop.&nbsp; So I am looking for the possibility of a setting either in the HP computer itself or in Windows Media Center that could be interfering with recognition of the device.&nbsp; Like I said, the HP shows it as working properly&nbsp;in Device
 Manager and also states that the driver is installed and working properly.&nbsp; Under those circumstances, how can it possibly search and not find the tuner?&nbsp; Any ideas will be gratefully accepted.

<div><font>Yes, the tuner currently works well&nbsp;on my laptop but cannot be found on my desktop.&nbsp; I would prefer to use the desktop for recording TV shows because it has a bigger hard drive. Both pc’s are running Windows 7-64 bit.</font></div>
<div><font>I have updated the driver on AVer Media’s webpage.&nbsp; The tuner is recognized in Device Manager which says it is working properly.&nbsp; I have connected it with three different USB ports on the desktop to no avail.&nbsp;
</font></div>
<div><font>Because the device works on the laptop, I know it is not damaged.&nbsp; Because the HP desktop recognizes it in Device Manager&nbsp;but the Media Center cannot find it, I can only conclude that the problem is with Windows Media Center.</font></div>
<div><font>Could the WMC program be corrupt?&nbsp; If I uninstall the program, will I be able to download a new version?</font></div>

<h2>            Can&#39;t reach router login screen from any browser in Windows 10</h2>
                    I can't reach the login screen of my Asus wireless router from my Windows 10 desktop PC. However, the router seems to be working in all respects, and I can reach its login screen from a laptop on the same LAN and from my iPhone. From the desktop I have
 internet access through the router, I can ping the router OK. I have verified the ip address of the router is correct, but from the Edge browser I get a message "Hmmm can't reach this page" and similarly from IE and Firefox. This login used to work, and have
 made no recent system changes, but just noticed I can no longer reach login page from the desktop. Perhaps there is a Windows setting that is incorrect, but I have not found it.

            Hello tom.wildes, I’ll be answering your question.
<br />This is a new feature which arrived with the fall update/upgrade, there is no way currently to turn it off but if you close all open programs they shouldn’t then reopen upon restarting.

            This is a new feature, though there is a known bug in this feature and Microsoft say they are working in it
<br />
<br />For the moment, to stop this happening:
<br />Go to Settings - Accounts - Sign-in
<br />Go to Privacy and turn this option off 'Use my sign info to automatically finish setting up'

            Hi Tom.   I'm Greg, a volunteer and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />The best solutions to day that I find for this unwanted new features is here:  <a href="https://winaero.com/blog/disable-apps-auto-reopening-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://winaero.com/blog/disable-apps-auto-reop...</a>
<br />
<br />I already have Shutdown and Restart shortcuts on my desktop so I was able to reference the linked tutorial in blog post to edit the commands to avoid this annoyance.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thanks for the workaround Greg.</p>
<p>As I noted in my post, I don't want to use shortcuts, workarounds or hacks. I'd like to be able to click Start &gt; Shutdown and have it behave the same way it did before the update. It's extremely frustrating a change has been forced out without anyway to
 disable it.</p>

            What you should do is close all your programs before shutting down. Its similar to a functionality on macOS users have been asking for years on Windows. Its considered handy especially when Windows 10 restarts after an update and you want to pick up from where you left off. If you don't like it, then you will have to go with Gregs work around or downgrade to an older version.

<p>
</p><p><span>What you should do is close all your programs before shutting down.</span></p>
<p>I don't want to manually close every app on my computer before shutting down. I run about 10 apps in the tray right now which automatically close themselves when I reboot&nbsp;<strong>because that's how they were designed to operate.</strong> They aren't apps
 which run on startup when I boot my PC for a reason, I open them on demand.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;Its similar to a functionality on macOS users have been asking for years on Windows.&nbsp;</span><br />
I don't really care what they've been asking for - I haven't been asked for it so why has it been forced on me and many others who feel the same way without a way to disable it? It's not OK to roll out a new feature which changes the way Windows has shut itself
 down for the last 20 years and then say it's my fault for not closing down windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Its considered handy especially when Windows 10 restarts after an update and you want to pick up from where you left off.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>So it should work like that only after an update then, not every time I shut down or restart.</p>
<p><br />
<span>If you don't like it, then you will have to go with Gregs work around or downgrade to an older version.</span></p>
<p>I'll refer back to my original question - how can I remove this functionality natively within windows with hacks or workarounds and if that isn't possible right now when is it planned?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>A Note to Parents and Gamers who have been suspended unreasonably - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> katyperryquoter  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Note to Parents and Gamers who have been suspended unreasonably</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking to communicate with parents of children who have received extreme and unreasonable suspensions of their x-box live accounts.&nbsp; Last night my son received a message while playing peggle on x-box live that his account had been suspended through
 12/31/9999.&nbsp; From the year, I am guessing this is a lifetime suspension.&nbsp; I was with my son when he received this notice on our television and though it said an email would follow, no such email has arrived.&nbsp; I contacted customer service and was told that
 the only option I had was to post a note on the forum page and wait for a reply.&nbsp; I've done that, twice, and have not noticed where my post appears yet, nor have I been contacted by anyone at the enforcement team.&nbsp; After reviewing an overwhelming number of
 complaints for the exact same thing on the forum page, it appears that microsoft is banning people for life due to the change of appearance of avatars.&nbsp; I do not know if this is the reason why my son's account was suspended since I've not been contacted in
 response to my inquiries.&nbsp; While I understand now that this is a violation of the "code of ethics", I am quite certain that a lifetime suspension is extreme and worthy of an appeals process.&nbsp; Several people have requested information on how to appeal, but
 the responses they've received from the enforcement team have not answered this question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As parents and gamers, I'm sure that you, like my family and I, have spent quite a lot of money on x-box live.&nbsp; Including membership fees, games, downloads, microsoft points, etc.&nbsp; The suspension means that all of this money goes to waste.&nbsp; I find this to
 be absolutely unaccepable.&nbsp; The suspension terms are unfair and unequal and they need to be challenged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have experienced a similar event, please contact me at <strong>[MOD REMOVED EMAIL]</strong>&nbsp; It is my intention to have my attorney community with the Microsoft's X-Box Live Legal Department on this matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you post in the suspension forums it does go through. Posts are not published until a member of the XBLPET look into your question. This helps keep the forums easier to manage. They will respond to most cases.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>While I am not a employee of Microsoft I would have to guess that the reason, or part of the reason for the ban is the modded avatar on the account. This is in no way a official answer for you just my guess.</p>

<p>C. Consequences of Violations.</p>
<p>If you violate the Code of Conduct or the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use, action may be taken against your account, including without limitation the following.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Some offenses warrant an immediate permanent suspension, including without limitation: hacking, modding,</span></strong> fraud, severe racial remarks, nudity on the Xbox LIVE Vision camera or Kinect camera,
 repeated creation of inappropriate gamertags or profile content, or posting viruses or URLs to viruses
</li><li>Trying to avoid a temporary suspension by creating alternate new accounts may result in a permanent suspension of the new user account and a possible escalation of punishment to the original account and all related accounts.
</li><li>Repeated violations of the Code of Conduct can result in a permanent suspension of your account, or a permanent suspension of any device you are using to connect to the service.
</li><li>If you create a gamertag that has been determined to violate the Terms of Use or Code of Conduct, you will be required to change it.
</li><li>If you create Terms of Use or Code of Conduct violating content anywhere in the system, we may delete it and a suspension of varying length will be issued on the account depending on the frequency and severity of the infraction.
</li><li>If we are notified that you are abusing the voice feature or message features, your ability to use the voice and messaging system will be suspended.
</li></ul>
<p>Microsoft is not obligated to send you a warning before these actions occur. If your account is suspended while participating in a tournament or competition Microsoft assumes no liability in the loss of any potential prizes or recognition related to the
 tournament or competition. Microsoft is not obligated to monitor every post, but we have the right to remove any post or take action against any user.</p>

<p>Yep. To many people just breeze by the end user agreement and dont bother to look at the code of conduct especially when it comes to a child's account. Then when the child does something they think their kid has done no wrong and should get all of their
 money back and threaten to sue. My kids are members of Xbox Live and I monitor what they do and dont do so it prevents what all these parents are blind of. Parents do your selves a favor and read the agreements you agree to before you accept something and
 make sure you read things like codes of conduct with your child and make sure they can agree to it before you let them play on Live. It will save you lots of grief and money.</p>

<p>Oh my, listen.. I am not saying that I disagree with a suspension. If the rules were broken, then sure a warning or temporary suspension would be fine, but a permanent ban is ridiculous. &nbsp;Please refrain from insinsuating that I am not parenting my child
 correctly. &nbsp;A lifetime ban over the color of an avatar is extreme. Period. &nbsp;With all the violence most of these games have, and the foul language coming out of people's mouth's, THIS is hardly a situation where someone is being harmed. &nbsp;I'm saying give people
 a break and a chance to right their wrong. &nbsp;I don't claim to think that my child is perfect and does no wrong. I'm also not perfect, and neither are any of you. &nbsp;This ridiculous ban has got to be challenged and changed, and the posts on the forum prove it.
 &nbsp;As to how my son learned to modify his avatar, he did it on a "Microsoft Approved" program. &nbsp;And he did it more than 6 months ago. &nbsp;In any event, I still don't know if this is the reason for the ban, as I've not received a reply to any of my numerous inquiries
 and private messages.</p>

<p>Excuse me, but I am not failing to realize anything. &nbsp;I am well aware of the violation. &nbsp;What I am questioning is the extreme punitive measures that Microsoft is imposing on its consumers. &nbsp;Just look at the Forum. &nbsp;I am not the only one who thinks a lifetime
 ban for such a small infraction is extreme. &nbsp;Microsoft offers consumers absolutely no recourse, and that is unfair practice. Period. &nbsp;I have handed this matter over to my attorney.</p>

<p>Weather you think it is unfair or not does not change the fact that you or your son agreed to follow the rules when creating the account. It states what you may or may not do. It also states what can happen to a account that does not follow the rules. Like

<p>Answering the questions posed by </p>
<p>PA Bear in that other member's query</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. November 2014 (replaced unit purchased originally July 2014)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. No third party AV</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. No third party anti-malware</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Only McAfee product is a search bar that I dido not intend to install but it originally installed over a month ago and until yesterday not an issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. No</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Yes to all - except since I continue to get an error on updating I have no clue as to truth in their reporting of successful installation in list of updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7a. KB3038314</p>
<p>
</p><p>7b. No</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. No to all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now to my symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Over last couple of days while forcing update to run on demand instead of allowing it to automatically install while I might be doing something else ("windows will restart within one day to complete updates " or some such language) I have been continually
 receiving error as specified in title of thread; update failed, removing changes, yadayada, but not a single update reports (under Installed Updates) any failure.&nbsp; I have even multiple times run Update Troubleshooter, each time it finds some errors, fixes
 them, and then I manually search for updates, and attempt to install the two it finds.&nbsp; The updates download, install to about 7 or 8%, computer restarts multiple times,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. log-in screen appears a second time AFTER logging in and then error report says the updates have failed and changes are being removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>C. At about same time (just noticed only yesterday and I know machine worked fine on Saturday) my TOUCHSCREEN has stopped working.&nbsp; I have done every step in order outlined in Microsoft's only recipe for correcting this, including cleaning screen, attempting
 to recalibrate which it won't do since it is unresponsive to any touch other than with PEN.&nbsp; I have restored to a recent restore point that only had one new app affected and m y next restore point back involves auto removal of a handful of Microsoft updates
 (yet I had no screen issues in between the two restore points)</p>
<p>
</p><p>C-1 I did not yet do a refresh as the length of software requiring reinstallation seems excessive for a simple reinstall of windows if that is what Refresh is.&nbsp; I definitely do not wish to&nbsp; have to resort to a full recovery to factory specs as I basic ally
 did back in November with the replacement machine.&nbsp; Seems to this feeble mind that an issue that just crops up should be able to b e addressed with rolling back a ,more recent change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my questions are is,&nbsp;is there any possible relationship between failed (as reported when updating) updates and the unresponsive touchscreen?</p>
<p>And why does a failed update not report itself in the installed update list?</p>

            You can try a reset - which is more destructive than a refresh - but I suspect this is a hardware issue. If you are near a Microsoft store, you might be able to exchange it there. Otherwise, go through the same channel you did for the first replacement.
 Going to a Microsoft store with all your paperwork and info is probably the best alternative.

    <title>Can&#39;t Run Software as Administrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogeliomu&#241;oz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Run Software as Administrator</h2>
                    Good day,<br />
<br />
My girlfriend is having some trouble. She needs to run a program as administrator for it to work properly, but the "Run as Administrator" command is not in the menu when she right clicks the file. The problem is that her's and her brother's accounts are the
 only ones in the computer and they are both suppose to be administrators. That particular file is the only one that does not show the "Run as Administrator" command but even though the others do show it, Windows still says she doesn't have enough privileges.
 When she loads the computer in safe mode there seems to be a third account for which neither her nor her brother know the password. Please respond as soon as possible she needs to be able to load this file.<br />
<br />
Sincerely, Rogelio Muñoz Bolufe<br />

            I don't really understand your solution. Could you please elaborate? To make myself clear I'll explain everything in different points:<br />
- This one file that my girlfriend needs to open as administrator has the "Run as Administrator"
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; command disabled.<br />
- Even though the other programs do have the command enabled she doesn't seem to have&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; enough privileges to use it. In other words she can use them normally but when she tries<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; to "Run as Administrator" it gives her an error that she doesn't have enough privileges.<br />
- I would like to correct the part where I said that she and her brother both have accounts as only<br />
&nbsp; her has an account. As she has the only account she is suppose to be the administrator.<br />
- When she restarts and loads the system in safe mode another account, aside from hers,<br />
&nbsp; appears but she can't log in to it or do anything to change it. She believes this is the account<br />
&nbsp; with the administrative privileges. <br />
<br />
Please help me so she can have all the administrative privileges needed for her account.

            <p>Go to&nbsp; -&nbsp; My computer, click open, select C drive,&nbsp; right click, select properties.&nbsp; A new window opens, click sharing, then click Advanced Sharing.&nbsp; You will possibly get the window for sign on as Administrator if for some reason you made the first person
 (User) not an administrator.&nbsp; If that opens type in the administrator password that was the first account set up at installation.&nbsp; You should have that as you tell me this is a new install.&nbsp; That will get you to the Advance Sharing window,&nbsp; Check "share this
 folder", click on Permissions,&nbsp; the window will change to one titled Share Permissions,&nbsp; under "User Names" select the user name that you need permission for and you can select "full control" for that folder or even a drive if that is how you got there.&nbsp; If
 the user name of your girlfriend is not there, click add, enter her user name and click "Check Name".&nbsp; It will under line and show a path and you will now have that user as a selection.&nbsp; Click "OK" and you should now be able to get to the folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must say I have never heard of a "program" that will not open w/ out administrator privilage...&nbsp; Are you sure you actually need to be in this?&nbsp; Is it a "program" or a "folder"?&nbsp; Big difference...</p>

            My apologies I'll suggest this solution to my girlfriend tomorrow and see how it works. To explain myself better let me try see if I can explain myself better.<br />
<br />
My girlfriend is the only one with an account in the computer and yet she does not have administrative privileges i.e. She can't "Run as Administrator" the programs and some apps. In particular the one I already mentioned which doesn't even show the "Run as
 Administrator" command when she right-clicks on it. When she loads the system in Safe Mode a second account appears with a name that I don't really remember right now. She and I believe that is the account with the administrative privileges. This account only
 shows up while in Safe Mode and she never created another one aside from hers and the one he brother used before she deleted it. She doesn't know the password for this account. Is there a possible way to find the password for this account, so she can log in
 it while in Safe Mode and give administrative privileges to her account?<br />

            Hi Larry.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Possibly.  If not create the latest bootable Installation media here, which can be used for either Repairs or Reinstall:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer.  This will give access to all the Repair options here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps then choose Install Now and follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Network2</h2>
                    <p>Just upgraded to Win10 Pro and had multiple problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>One of those problems now tells me I have two networks.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am connected to my router via ethernet as I was in Win10 Home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One network is named by my router, I suspect, as Netgear36.&nbsp; That informs me I am "secured."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other is named Network2 and informs me I am "connected."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When running Win10 Home, I had only one, the one named Netgear36.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a laptop computer running XP connected via ethernet to the same router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The desktop with Pro is running well over the web.&nbsp; Lap top is not attached to the desktop at all except in the sense they both use the same router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help understanding what's going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Try doing a couple things:
<br />
<br />Set your network on both computers as private:

            Hi PapaDoc.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The Secured connection showing your Netgear router doesn't say Connected then it's just available and not connected, possibly because you have no wireless adapter on that device.  
<br />
<br />The Ethernet Connection is apparently Network2.  This can always be checked in Setttings &gt; Network and Internet &gt;   Ethernet &gt; Change Adapter Options (formerly Network Connections).  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>I checked the desktop settings and it was set to Private.</p>

</p><p>I did nothing other than that and when I again checked my access I was only connected to web via Netgear36; no more network2.</p>

<h2>            screen goes white when moving cursor</h2>
                    Frequently when I move the cursor across the screen (Windows 8) the screen goes white. I have to move the cursor to the top left hand corner to recover what I was working on. How do I stop this happening?

            <p>Hi Jill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>Did this issue start recently? Do you remember making any changes to the computer prior this issue?</i></p>
<p><i><br />
</i></p>
<p>This issue could be caused due a corrupt or incompatible driver. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to run the hardware and devices troubleshooter and check. This is a built-in troubleshooter which can detect and fix most of the incorrect settings and errors in hardware which can cause such issues. I would
 suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if there is any issue with the display adapter. Refer to these steps to run this troubleshooter:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press Windows key +X, select Control panel.</p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click on the ‘view by’ option on the top right and change it to ‘Larger icons’.</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click troubleshooting and select “Hardware and devices” troubleshooter.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b><br />
</b></p>
<p>If the troubleshooter didn’t detect any issues, then I would suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website to download and install the latest driver for the display adapter and check if that resolves the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try these steps and let us know the results. We’d be happy to help if you need any further assistance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response, Bennet. It is a Lenovo computer and I am not pleased with it. I had to return it to Lenovo service centre as the hard drive cracked up and the computer wouldn't work at all. Then a similar problem occurred last week (the day after
 the guarantee expired!!) but the Lenovo guy talked Jill through the operation to get the computer up and running again. Unfortunately this meant I lost everything on the computer and everything had to be reinstalled (favourites, Word, virus blocker, everything)
 which means losing half a day of our lives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recent experiences have left me less than happy with both Lenovo and Windows 8.</p>

The dialogue says that the device driver got stuck in an infinite loop. which usually idicates a problem with the device or the device driver programming.<br />
Any suggestions as to how to overcome this problem? Possible driver downloads etc?<br />

Thanks for coming to the forums. Sorry for the issue with your game. Is this the only game doing this? If it is we recommend to uninstall the game,

<div>This issue can be caused by a damaged .NET Framework component. In order to resolve the issue, we have to remove previous versions of .NET Framework and reinstall .NET Framework 3.5, which contains many new features building
 incrementally upon .NET Framework 2.0 and 3.0, and includes .NET Framework 2.0 service pack 1 and .NET Framework 3.0 service pack 1. Based on its current status, I suggest trying the following troubleshooting steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 1: Use .Net Framework CleanUp Utility</div>
<div>============================================</div>
<div>1. Please download the tool from the following link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please Note: Microsoft provides third-party contact information to help you find technical support. This contact information may change without notice. Microsoft does not guarantee the accuracy of this third-party contact information.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Please save the zip file (dotnetfx_cleanup_tool.zip) from the above link to the local Desktop and extract it.</div>
<div>3. Double click cleanup_tool.exe to run the tool.</div>
<div>4. Please follow the instructions given.</div>
<div>In the "Product to cleanup:" box, please select ".NET Framework – All versions".</div>
<div>5. Click "Cleanup Now" button.</div>
<div>6. Restart the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Step 2: Manually downloading and installing Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5</div>
<div>=======================================================</div>
<div>Please note: The size of Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 is a little big. Your patience to download the update is much appreciated.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Click the following link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 and .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1</div>
<div><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/0/E/20E90413-712F-438C-988E-FDAA79A8AC3D/dotnetfx35.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/2/0/E/20E90413-712F-438C-988E-FDAA79A8AC3D/dotnetfx35.exe</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Family Update</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. When the file download window appears, please click "Save", and follow the directions to save it on the Desktop. After downloading the Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 setup file on your Desktop, double-click to manually install
 it.</div>

<p>Hi-</p>
<p>Thank you for looking into it.&nbsp; I ended up switching back to Skype classic and it fixed the problem.&nbsp; Using the new Skype it wouldn't let me dial new numbers I hadn't dialed before using the dialpad.&nbsp; I could dial old contacts I had saved.&nbsp; It would say
 to add funds.&nbsp; It said I had a subscription, but it didn't seem to acknowledge it.&nbsp; I ended up switching back to classic Skype and it worked fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>How can I fix DirectX if there is an error with or missing file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> c_garcia  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I fix DirectX if there is an error with or missing file extension&#63;</h2>
                    <p>DSOUND.dll along with some other extensions became corrupted somehow causing certain games not being able to launch. This is the error when launching Medal of Honor: Warfighter showing an error with atiuxpag.dll. I've gone through all the checks with downloading
 the dxwebsetup program but it just says I have the latest version installed and closes. I've also ran the latest dxsetup but it doesn't fix the problem. I feel like everything has been working fine until I hooked up my XBOX One controller to my PC. I never
 had any issues until after that moment and that's all I have done differently than from previous times I've played games. I tried refreshing my computer from a previous date before that but it failed. I feel like I may have to redo Windows which would be terrible.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to install&nbsp;DirectX Runtime June 2010, which is a optional update that a lot of games need.</p>
<p>Even my Lexmark printer requires it... I will include a link to the full installer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a self extracting package. It will extract after double clicking on it so be sure to note the location where you\it extracted.</p>
<p>Then open the folder and double click DXSETUP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have already tried this with the web installer, but this is the full file... It might work better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I can find, the atiuxpag.dll is related to switching from Integrated Graphics to Dedicated Graphics in a Laptop dependent on whether AC power or battery is being used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does seem to be dependent on DirectX 10 in some fashion. This link is primarily DX9 and DX10 stuff, so it might help.</p>

<p>The modem is supplied by Verizon; a Westell A90-750015-07 and&nbsp;Xbox Live connected directly to it. I'll&nbsp;also add that last night I entered a code fo X Box Music Pass, and I was having a few problems&nbsp; with HBOGo last night (kept buffering during video).</p>

<p>This worked initially, and I was able to log in, however, after trying to access different apps I received the same error code, plus the message that one or more features are missing or corrupt and there may be a problem with my storage device.
</p>
<p>However, the new app I installed last night, X Box Music, works fine. The problem started right after I installed this, and it's currently the only thing that woks..</p>

<p>Follow up-after the last reboot, all apps except for XBox Music are gone, and I show no storage space available on an unformatted system. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm ready to return it-this is just over 2 months old.</p>

<p>Hey Terror. You say that there is no storage space available on an un-formatted system? Are you saying that your HDD is un-formatted? That could be why you are getting this error.
<br />
<br />
If your HDD is in fact un-formatted, I would suggest reformatting your HDD. Checkout this
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/storage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox 360 storage</a> article if you need help doing so. Note, that your Profile and all your purchased content will be available for download again, but games saves/progress will be lost.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need any more help. Cheers!&nbsp;</p>
