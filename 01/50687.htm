<h2>            Windows 10 asking for network credentials for NAS even after diabling</h2>
                    <p>I have tried EVERYTHING and I still can't access my NAS Buffalo drive because I don't know the credentials Windows is asking for!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I create a credential and then enter it when asked, I keep getting "Access is denied"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have completely disabled credentials (in root programs) and it is still asking for one on the NAS</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a local profile and it is still asking for a credential for the NAS</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is going on?!?!?!?</p>

<p>If it says access denied, you might need to add the printer as an administrator.</p>
<p>If you are in a workplace, group policy might be preventing you from adding it.</p>
<p>You could also try turning off your firewall, as it might be denying you access to the printer for some reason.</p>

    <title>Achievement does not synchronize on my profile. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> musquito-&#91;xboxvenue&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Achievement does not synchronize on my profile.</h2>
                    
<p>I played Ice Age Village daily when it came out until it froze and was unplayable. I was at level 46 and had only 2 achievements left "The bigger they are" and the level 50 achievement.<br />
<br />
I recently bought a new phone and I want to give it another shot, starting from scratch. I noticed in-game that my achievements did not synchronized with those I already had unlocked. Each time I was suppose to unlock an achievement, the in-game message appeared
 and it light up in the achievement screen in-game.<br />
<br />
Now I got finally to the point where I unlocked the achievement "The bigger they are", it gave the in-game message and the green achievement pop on top of the screen. Now the problem is that this achievement does not want to synchronize with my Xbox profile</p>
<p>I tried to force it to update in the games app, without success. I exited the game and restarted it, again without success.</p>
<p>I unlocked another achievement in another game (Real Racing 2) in the hope that the games app would pick up the Ice Age Village achievement as well, but it only picked up the one of Real Racing.</p>

<p>Any ideas how to get it on my profile? I do not want to waste my time leveling up to level 50 if everything is for nothing....</p>

            <p>Hey, everyone! This will be the final post in here.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Please do not create new threads regarding this specific issue.</strong></span> To clarify, this thread is for achievements that did not sync with your Xbox Live profile from the&nbsp;<strong>middle to end of February, 2015</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Anything outside of that</strong></em>, you will need to refer to&nbsp;this sticky. The troubleshooting steps in there include the same ones I have posted in here, so please be sure to do&nbsp;<strong>every troubleshooting step you can&nbsp;</strong>before following through with the phases in that sticky. If we see someone had submitted achievements that should have been earned between the time frame above, you&nbsp;<strong>will not be sent on to investigating teams</strong>. This issue has already been looked into and the solutions given are posted below.</p>
<p>The below steps are the only 2 ways Official Support should offer to gain your achievement(s) that did not sync during <em>the middle to end of February</em>. The reason why is because there is no data for us to manually switch over on your profile.&nbsp;I 100% understand that this is not the answer you are looking for from us, however these are the resolution steps provided by the investigating teams.</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall and re-install the game, and attempt to re-earn those achievements.&nbsp;<strong>***PLEASE BE AWARE THIS MAY RESET YOUR PROGRESS IN SOME GAMES.***</strong></li>
<li>Gain access to a second Windows Phone that you can attempt to unlock these achievements on.</li>
</ol>
<p>We understand there are some issues behind these steps, and&nbsp;<b>may not lead to a resolution for everyone</b>.&nbsp;Uninstalling and re-installing the game will allow you to redo the activity needed to unlock the achievement in&nbsp;<em>most</em>&nbsp;games. We have reports of some users factory resetting their phones and being able to unlock their achievements, however this is not a troubleshooting step we as Support encourage.</p>
<p>If you run into any&nbsp;<strong>new</strong> achievement issues, please follow the steps in the sticky linked above. Please remember to allow 72 hours before filling out the survey at the bottom, because your achievements can sync during that time.</p>
<p>Thanks again for everyone's patience! Since this thread has been resolved, and troubleshooting steps posted, we will be locking this down now. We appreciate your understanding, and encourage you to check out the sticky linked above for any further achievement issues. :)</p>

</p><p>Thank you for your suggestion but I had to just surrender to completely wiping out my machine, of course Microsoft said that this was a Gateway problem due to Gateway not updating, but for me, considering failed updates cost me almost
 two hundred bucks in repair and setting back up, to have them suggest I do this AGAIN less than two months later, is pretty bad. It is Microsoft updates that are causing problems for many people, not just me, so it is Microsoft problems and they should own
 it.</p>

<p>N,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been several similar reports over the last few months.&nbsp; Their timing is not consistent with only a single Windows update being at fault.&nbsp;

<ul>
<li>In Windows 7, it was a sensible precaution to make a spare password-protected
</li><li>In Windows 10, it seems to be essential.&nbsp; </li><li>Corruption only seems to happen to accounts that are in use and I have not seen any reports of corruption occurring to such spare accounts</li><li>I have become very / overly cautious, I make two spare password-protected <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
local</span> Admin accounts &amp; write their passwords down somewhere secure.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I also make system images so that, in the event of an update wrecking my computer, I can restore it to its previous state within half an hour.&nbsp; If you do not know about system images then I can explain if you wish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a link to a "Feedback hub" in the Start menu so you could consider reporting your experiences there in case nobody else has.&nbsp; MS do seem to take notice of problems reported there.</p>

            Hi Peter <br />
<br />
If you are unable to run any diagnostics, please try the following <br />
<br />
Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />
Do this twice <br />
<br />
On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />
Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . <br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair <br />
See if Windows startup can repair itself <br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore <br />
Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to <br />
<br />
If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />
Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode <br />
Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup <br />
Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date <br />
Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally <br />
<br />
If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC <br />
Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing <br />
Then start the Reset

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">-- A brief history of our clan --</span></p>
<p>Dark Apocalypse Gaming is a tight knit family of players that has derived from a quite massive clan known as Killers move Silently. Some things happened over there that made us split off, but I will not go into detail. We were formed in early March of 2011
 and continue to grow stronger. Everyone in our clan is treated like gods/goddesses no matter what. We feel this is the most important aspect of any organization.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">-- What you can expect from our clan --</span></p>
<p>Here at Dark Apocalypse Gaming you can expect a fair evaluation from our Initiation Officers and Leaders. We feel we cannot get a good grasp on you as a personality as well as a gamer by just letting you in. We require a 10 day evaluation period to assess
 this information and make a decision from there. As previously mentioned everyone in this clan is treated like gods/goddesses. This means the active leadership in this organization is not power-hungry. Every decision for this clan is a clan decision. You have
 a say in everything. We feel this also is a very important aspect to the "family" feeling that we strive so hard to keep intact.</p>
<p>We also have many things going on around the clock within our organization. When applying you can expect to see these things for you upon acceptance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Active GameBattles Teams </li><li>Online Tournaments With Prizes </li><li>24/7 Pub Stomping </li><li>Graphics Tournaments </li><li>Access to some the greatest montages online </li><li>And last but not least, the most fun you'll ever have in online gaming! </li></ul>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">-- What we expect from you, the recruit --</span></p>
<p>We expect maturity at all times, whether it be in game or on the forum. We do not tolerate drama and do not tolerate immaturity of any nature. Of course we all have fun and make jokes, but immaturity is a major turn-off in any aspect of the world. We also
 have a fully functional forum at your disposal. We expect that you remain an integral part of this experience as it helps grow relationships with your fellow gamers. We love to hear your opinion on any matter, and this is a great way to do so. We want your
 input!!!</p>

<h2>            Kernal security check failure issue. Webcam driver won&#39;t install.</h2>
                    It was working just fine until I moved this past weekend. Plugged everything back in and tried to open my webcam, computer crashes instantly. Gives me the error message kernal security check failure. After digging some and trying to figure it out myself
 I know that it is that the driver for the webcam will not install. I have tried multiple ways to install it. When I go to the manufacturer website the installer opens but asks me if&nbsp;I want to uninstall everything instead of installing. I have already checked
 what I can and as far as I can tell the drivers are not installed. The computer picks up my webcam and places it in "other devices". When I tried to have windows install the drivers it said it couldn't do anything about it. I have installed the latest Win10
 update and my hardware id is VID_1E14E&amp;PID_0102&amp;REV_0202&amp;MI_00. I am at my wit's end about to smash my computer into bits. Please help!

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the details that you have shared, there is a possibility that the driver is not compatible with Windows 10. Having said that, there may be changes that occurred before this issue started. In order for us to provide the appropriate solution, we would
 like to ask for additional information. Please answer the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>What build and version of Windows 10 is your computer running?</li><li>Have you made any recent changes to the settings or installed updates prior to the error?</li><li>Have you tried checking if the camera driver is still present in the Device Manager?
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We will wait for your response. </p>

            My computer is running version 10.0.16299 build 16299. The only thing I did before the error occurred was physically move the computer from one location to another. I don't remember doing any sort of updates or changing any other settings. I have and the
 device manager says that no driver files have been loaded for this device.

            I tried running the built-in trouble shooter and it says that it couldn't identify the problem. I unplugged it and then plugged it back in, all it tells me is that the USB2.0 Camera is plugged in and has a driver error. It is a Digital Innovations ChatCam
 Webcam model number 4310100. When I first set up the camera originally I used the CD it came with and it worked fine. I tried doing the CD again and it does not work. Keeps wanting to unistall the driver that is very clearly missing.

<p>Since you've mentioned that the webcam came with a CD installer, we would like to recommend a different method of uninstalling it from your PC. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <strong>Windows Search</strong> bar, type <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Click it on the search result to open the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Uninstall </strong><strong>or change a program</strong>, locate the webcam.</li><li>Right-click the webcam and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done, use the CD again to install the webcam.</p>
<p>

<p>This is what happens when I try to uninstall it: </p>
<p>- Pop up comes up asking me if I want to allow program to make changes, I click yes.</p>
<p>- The uninstaller comes up and asks me if I want to completely remove the program and all it's features, I click yes.</p>
<p>- It then switches to say that the program has been installed and it wants me to restart the computer to in order to use the program. I say that I will restart later.</p>
<p>- It then says that the program has been uninstalled and I click finish.</p>
<p>The program does not go away from the list of programs, even after restarting my computer to see if that helps. It's a strange circle that I cannot seem to figure out. I cannot uninstall it in order to reinstall from the CD. The last time I tried to use
 the CD it said that there was already a newer version of the driver installed on my computer but I do not know where. I also unplugged my webcam to see if that would help with uninstalling or reinstalling and it has done nothing.</p>

<p>I am trying to allow a program through the windows firewall, but once I click on 'Change Settings', the cursor loads for a few seconds, then nothing happens. I have tried waiting for 10 minutes (at least), and there is no response whatsoever. It seems that
 anything with the User account 'shield' logo doesn't work on my computer.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the late response,</p>
<p>I tried what you suggested, and signed in with my local account instead. However, the problem appears to remain. I'll give an example of the problem in case it may help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going to 'Control Panel', then 'User Accounts', then 'User Accounts' once again. Now there are quite a few options with the little shield beside them, which is supposed to require administrator privileges to continue (which I have), but NONE of them seem
 to do ANYTHING. It's quite strange, apparently any button or function with the little shield beside it is non-responsive. I click the button, the cursor loads, but there is no window asking me for permission, or any other sort of activity, it just does...
 nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information can give you some more ideas, as I am clueless as to what to do!</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I also forgot to mention I am running Bitdefender 2016 (in case that has something to do with the problem).</p>

            <p>Hello again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is quite strange; the applications that already require administrative privileges seem to ask&nbsp;me just fine (through the 'Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your PC' popup-window), but if I then click on the 'Change when these notifications
 appear' link, nothing happens. It appears that the 'User Account Control' section of the control panel is unfunctional, and I have no way of getting there (even through directly accessing it on the control panel).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem appears to be something involving the 'User-Account Control' section of the control panel, as it currently doesn't work on my PC. The same as the firewall exclusions section as well, the functions just seem to do nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

    <title>Issues with Elan Smart-Pad after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmitribailey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Elan Smart-Pad after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>I am using an Asus, with a built-in Elan Smart-Pad. In the mouse properties menu I am informed that it is located in port PS/2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Windows 10 update I have been having trouble with my trackpad. </p>
<p>
</p><p>During log-in everything works as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, once my desktop finishes loading, the trackpad stops working entirely.</p>
<p>I have discovered that when this happens, I must plug in an external mouse and enable the Elan Smart-Pad.</p>
<p>Settings -&gt; Devices -&gt; Mouse &amp; touchpad -&gt; Additional mouse options (this brings up a new window titled "Mouse properties") -&gt; tab titled Elan -&gt; Enable device</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must do this every time I boot up my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am able to control the movement of the mouse with the trackpad and perform left-clicks by fully clicking the trackpad.</p>
<p>However, I am still unable to perform clicks simply by tapping the trackpad. </p>
<p>And clicking the trackpad button doesn't always work. Many times I have to perform 4-6 clicks before the action is registered.</p>
<p>I am also entirely unable to perform right-clicks in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the "Mouse properties" window, where I enable the trackpad, there are two buttons labeled "Stop Device" and "Options..."</p>
<p>I assume the "Options..." button would provide me with more&nbsp;<em>options</em> and may be able to solve one or more of my problems.</p>
<p>However, this button does not bring up any new windows. The button icon moves as if it is registering my selection, but it does not lead anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my issues in a more condensed list:</p>
<p>-Must enable Elan Smart-Pad with every boot up</p>
<p>-No tap-to-click ability</p>
<p>-Full left-clicking is rarely responsive</p>
<p>-Cannot right-click at all</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Do you get any error message when connecting the device?</em></span></p>
<p>I receive no messages when enabling the Elan Smart-Pad.</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>Are the drivers updated?</em></span></p>
<p>I believe so but am not entirely sure. I do not know which specific driver I should be looking for.</p>
<p>Following your steps for "uninstalling and installing a driver", I found the&nbsp;<strong>Human Interface Devices</strong> drop down tab. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>HID-compliant consumer control device</p>
<p>HID-compliant system controller</p>
<p>HID-compliant vendor-defined device</p>
<p>HID-compliant wireless radio controls</p>
<p>USB Input Device</p>
<p>USB Input Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking for updates, I was informed that all of these are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also checked under the <strong>Mice and other pointing devices </strong>tab, the contents are as follows:</p>
<p>ELAN Input Device</p>
<p>HID-compliant mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are up to date as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which specific driver should I be looking for?</p>

            Hi, I am having the same problem with my Asus laptop. I have enabled the mousepad.. so I can move the mouse around with my fingers.. but it is - pointless (!) - as I can't click on anything. Very frustrating. Also have no options when I click on options.
 Did you get anywhere with this? Kate

<p><em>ALEXANDER22</em> is right. Using a straightened heavy-duty/large paper-clip in the emergency eject hole is the place to start.&nbsp; This should work with the power either off or on.&nbsp; Try it with the power off first.&nbsp; Push the clip straight in.&nbsp; Try to prevent
 it from going off at an angle.</p>
<p>Another thing you might try is holding the eject button down (gently) while power-cycling the system.&nbsp; Let the button go immediately if the door opens.&nbsp; Hold the tray open if it tries to close again (there are micro-switches that detect this and should stop
 the close process).&nbsp; Also, power-cycling alone sometimes clears this problem up.</p>
<p>BTW, it would be really helpful to know the manufacture and model of the optical drive.</p>

look for tiny pin hole under door-insert straight paper clip-door should open.</p>

    <title>Surface Book 2, Windows 10 Pro&#58; removing group policy issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Book 2, Windows 10 Pro&#58; removing group policy issue</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having a group policy issue that does not allow me to install the software I need during the Windows Mixed Reality Portal Setup.</p>
<p>I had my windows upgraded to version 1809, but it is still not setting up my WMR headset. I tried everything online to get rid of the Group Policy issue (In update it says: *Some settings are managed by your organization), but there shouldnt any organization
 managing my laptop. Not as far as I know. A coworker bought the same laptop as mine and have no issue with group policy and can set up the group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the only way to clean this up and remove the group policy would be to do a clean install of Windows 10 Pro. However, if I do a clean install instead of a reset, shouldnt I need a Windows 10 Pro license key? My old laptop came with the license
 key in the back of the laptop behind the battery, I cant find one on my Surface Book 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion will be appreciated.</p>

            So there are two policies configured:
<br />
<br />Intranet update service.....
<br />
<br />Specifies the hour....
<br />
<br />Set them to Not Configured in GPO snap-in and error will go away.
<br />
<br />Regards.
