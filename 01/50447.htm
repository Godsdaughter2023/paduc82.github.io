<h2>            Photo Importing</h2>
                    We are trying to import photos using the Photos App that came with Windows 10. When I click the import button it wants to import all 1760 photos that are on the camera when in reality there are only a dozen or so that were taken yesterday.. Everything
 else is already imported. Is there a way to select only the latest photos to import?

<p>Hey Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ken from the Photos Team here. The new Photos App will attempt to import all media files it has not seen before. In your case, all 1760 photos were new to the Photos App and hence it got imported. Now lets say you took 1 extra picture today and tried to
 re-import, it will only pick that 1 extra photo since it is considered "new".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being able to manually select the photos you want to import is a feature request we hear and is high our priority list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hey Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you detail the steps you have taken, what errors you are seeing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few obvious things to try&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your USB device is visible in Explorer under This PC. If not hit F5 until you see it / re plugging the device</li><li>There are known issue with Kodak and Fuji cameras but fixes have already been issued</li><li>Make sure you have write access to the Pictures Library (copy any file to the pictures library to test write access)</li></ul>

<p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, normally I connect the camera via a USB&nbsp;cable or SD flash card&nbsp;and the import dialog comes up. It does that now, but when I click import, it says "Something went wrong".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to move a .jpg file to the pictures folder. The dialog box said "you will need to have administrator permission to move to this folder" --&gt;&gt;continue, skip, cancel. I said continue and the file transferred, but when I went to look for it...it was

<p>You may be running into a known lost permission issue upgrading from Win10</p>
<p>You may want to try this solution that I <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3g42rn/updated_to_windows_10_now_im_getting_access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
found on Reddit</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Here is what I did to fix the same issue on my Win7 upgrade. I am pretty sure the problem stems from OneDrive somehow resetting permissions incorrectly on startup. For me it was my Pictures folder on my account (and One Drive Picture folder) that was causing
 issues (i.e. I lost permissions).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Disabled sharing for both Picture folders</p>
</li><li>
<p>
Ran these commands from administrator command prompt (xxx is user name)</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<span>cd /users/xxx</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<span>icacls Pictures /reset /t /q</span>&nbsp;(this will reset all the permissions on Pictures folder tree to default)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<span>cd /&lt;onedrive folder&gt;</span>&nbsp;(i.e. cd to base OneDrive folder)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<span>icacls Pictures /reset /t /q</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
reboot</p>
<p>
</p><p>Report back if the above solution or any of the other solutions on the page works.</p>
<p>(I am hoping it does!)</p>

            I didn't try this fix. After getting frustrated, I went back to Win 7 then upgraded to Win 10. The photo import option seems to be working fine. Though, I am totally confused about how to manage my photos on the C drive, myDrive and the Window phone. If
 anyone knows of a good guide, I'd sure appreciate it. For example, if I take a photo it goes into Camera Roll on my Windows phone and also to my PC myDrive. If I look for the pic on my phone myDrive folder it isn't there. I find it under the generic app Photos.&nbsp;Hmmm

                    <p>I used to have an account about 6 years ago on an older Xbox 360, the console had its hard drive wiped and thinking I lost the old account I made a new one, (I was a young child with little knowledge of technology) using a made up email with the same name as all my emails with a different domain, I wasn't expecting to work *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, the account was created and I enjoyed it for a while, i connected my face book to the account. Long after the console broke permanently&nbsp;I got a phone and started using the xbox app and wanted to use the second account I but I forgot the password and because I used that email and didn't remember my answers to the security questions I couldn't reset the password so I fixed my original account and started using it again. When I wanted to start finding my friends through Facebook I tried connecting my Facebook but it's already linked to my other account. Now I have an Xbox one and use my Facebook account for a lot of thin

<h2>            Does Windows 10 Fax &#38; Scan Support All-In-One Printers&#63;</h2>
                    My printer is a network printer.&nbsp; It is connected wireless.&nbsp; I print from my Dell desktop, my iPad and iPhone.&nbsp; Printer is listed several ways including CCD8EA and HPC3D6EF in addition to the full name HP Officejet Pro 8600 (Net).&nbsp; An HP Fax printer is
 listed as Disconnected.&nbsp; There is a generic Fax device shown due to Windows Fax &amp; Scan.&nbsp; Fax &amp; Scan is looking for a Fax Account, that is, a fax server name or location.&nbsp; I don't know what to use.&nbsp; I tried the Computer Name and it wasn't rejected, but it's
 not working.&nbsp; My fax is sitting in Windows F&amp;S Outbox with a status of Pending and a Fax Account showing my Computer Name.&nbsp; (Update:&nbsp; as I was writing this the Fax Account changed to local.)&nbsp; I don't know how to update the Fax Account once I get the information
 from you.&nbsp; I don't know how to promote the Status from Pending to Sending once I have the Fax Account named correctly.&nbsp; This AIO printer works well

    <title>Virtual Disk Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dvjac  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtual Disk Service</h2>
                    <p>Virtual Disk Service won't start in Disk Management.</p>
<p>I have had a long term subscription with Trend Micro and run Microsoft Malicious Software Tool once a month.</p>
<p>During this episode I changed out hard drives from HDD to SDD. Two of each, internally, and it didn't matter. I also installed all three Windows 10 upgrades. All updates are current. Nothing has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a problem before I did the following, multiple times over several months:</p>
<p>I went into Computer Mgmt &gt;Services and changed VDS to Automatic and started it.<br />
I checked every dependency for VDS and verified they were enabled and started.<br />
I checked all the User permissions.<br />
Regardless, the DMS could not start the VDS<br />
</p>
<p>Today I found a specific error message in the log "VDS is marked as an Interactive Service; however, the system is configured to not allow Interactive Service."<br />
I tried to start Interactive Services in the Services tab but it was not allowed.<br />
With another idea now, back to the Internet where I read there is a Registry value. Considering all I have done/tried this seems a likely possibility. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE<br />
Path: SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Windows</p>
<p>DWORD: NoInteractiveServices<br />
Change value "1" to "0"<br />
</p>
<p>I try to avoid mucking around in the Registry. Can anyone verify this Registry value?<br />
Does anyone know what the syntax would be to do it from the Command Prompt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you are unable to start Virtual Disk Service in Disk Management. One of these is due to a third party security software. If you have any, disable the application and check if you encounter the same difficulty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial part of troubleshooting, we suggest running the<strong> System File Checker</strong>. This tool will allow&nbsp;you to scan and diagnose any corrupted files in your system and enhance its performance. Check this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use
 the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a> for the procedures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will be waiting for your update so we can move forward to resolving your query.</p>

<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trend Micro is my third party security software and I have tried to start VSD with it disabled and put the vds.exe and an associated file in the exceptions list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried so many things I forgot to mention I have run System File Checker many times and there aren't errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beyond that I tried &nbsp;Chkdsk C: / f &nbsp;from the Command prompt outside the Windows environment. I should mention that the second SSD drive started as a clone of the first drive to function as a backup. That is why the error is on both drives despite each have
 a different OS now i.e. Version 1607 and Creator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I just installed the Windows 10 Creator edition so it is a clean upgrade on that SSD derive. On my second internal SSD drive I refreshed the installation with a clean ISO of W10 version 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was two days ago and the VDS error persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe I have tried all the basic things many times. Then moved on to checking what I can of system interaction with the tools Windows 10 provides.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I am thinking a registry value is likely the main culprit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I should add that as an interim solution I have been using EaseUS Partition Master 12.0 and it reads both drives without any issues. That is why I have taken the drives and their internal markers off the list of culprits.</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

 AVG free edition as the antivirus software which is up to date and Windows firewall. No other antimalware products are installed. I am trying to install KB955430.

<p>Faulting module name: ESENT.dll ...</p>

<p>This kind of&nbsp;error is often caused by faulty hardware, like a bad bit of memory. This causes a minor corruption of an ESENT database, which then causes ESENT.dll to crash when the program tries to load the corrupted database.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Live Mail uses a number of ESENT databases, one of which is the Mail.MSMessageStore that indexes your messages and which you have already replaced. Others contain your calendars and contacts lists. Any one of these could be the faulty one. To test
 whether this is in fact the cause of the crash, then, we'd have to stop the program trying to load the database concerned. This may be quite a simple procedure.</p>

<p>This tells us that you weren't signed in with a Microsoft Account last time the program closed, so if there is a dodgy database, it's most probably the one for either the default calendar or the default contacts list. Let's try with the calendar first as
 the most likely:</p>

&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Open the folder called <em>Calendars</em> and note down the names of the folders inside it.

<p>Thank you so much for your support.&nbsp; I really appreciate it.</p>
<p>I followed your instructions.&nbsp; They were&nbsp;very clear.&nbsp; Again, thank you.</p>

<p>Yes, exactly. When the program couldn't find the folder called <em>DBStore</em> on launching, it created a new one. Again, if it is a problem with a corrupted database, then there's only one left to test - contacts. Cross your fingers and do the same again.

            <p>Hi Noel,</p>
<p>There was only one folder inside <strong>%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live\Contacts</strong></p>
<p>and it was called Default.&nbsp; I renamed it to Common.</p>
<p>I then launched Windows Live Mail, and still no luck.&nbsp; The same message.</p>
<p>However inside the Common file is now a new file called <em>DBStore, </em>however it looks hidden.</p>

            <p>Rats! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you sure that the <em>DBStore</em> folder is new? There should have been one there before, probably dating from the time of the original installation. The folder has
<em>Hidden</em> and <em>System</em> attributes, which is why it 'looks hidden'. If you open it, you should see along with several others&nbsp;a file called
<em>contacts.edb</em>. What is its modified date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see that other functions that use ESENT.dll are still working properly (Event Viewer is one of them; Windows Search is another and Windows Update yet another), so it's not likely that there's anything wrong with the module itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just re-read your original question, where you explain what you'd already tried. It had escaped my notice that you didn't say you'd tried a
<em>repair</em> of the installation. This&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;a bit further-reaching than re-installing, because it checks that all the files the program needs are present and correct; this apparently doesn't necessarily happen on installation. To carry out the repair,
 close all running programs, then press Windows key&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0ee95304-f243-4595-a01a-65d0dea90296" />&nbsp;+ R, type
Enter</span>. In the window that opens, select <span style="font-style: italic">Repair all Windows Essentials programs.
</span>When it's finished, reboot the computer and try launching Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this doesn't help, can you please try launching Windows Live Mail on a different

    <title>Paired Bluetooth device icon is greyed out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xs11jack  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paired Bluetooth device icon is greyed out</h2>
                    I am using windows 7 ultimate with a bluetooth dongle to connect to a Samsung Galaxy GT-I9305. After pairing in either direction the phone icon is greyed out in the control panel , devioces and printers window, and the "allow a device to connect" is also
 greyed out in the bluetooth properties. When I click on the phone icons' properties all parameters are unknown. The odd thing is that it used to work ie I could download apps to the phone. I had this problem previously with another dongle, so I got a new one
 which solved the problem, for a while at least. I now realise that it was probably not the old dongle as the same issue has occured with the new one. I have followed many of the instructions supplied by this forum, seeking drivers, uninstalling, reinstalling
 to no avail..........but the problems of others were not quite the same, so maybe there is another answer out there.<br />

I have tried all this before. I can send files to the phone but I cannot download apps directly to it as I have in the past with this and other dongles. Why should it stop doing this and why is the icon greyed?<br />

<h2>            Windows backup error 0x8078006F</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody,</p>
<p>I'm having an issue with Windows 7's backup feature when trying to create a system image. The backup is stored on an smb share in the network and everything works just fine as long as I leave that "create system image" (or whatever it's called in English)
 checkbox unchecked. If I do check that box and start a backup, some preparation work is done but after a short time (~9% progress) the backup cancels. The details reveal an error code: 0x8078006F. Neither Google nor Bing were able to tell me what this means.
 I didn't find anything on MS's support site.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

                </div>

<p>Hello again,</p>
<p>sorry for not responding for so long. In Apple's support forums I found a solution to my problem:</p>
<p><a href="http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=6527267#6712693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://discussions.apple.com/message.jspa?messageID=6527267#6712693</a></p>
<p>Essentially, it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is an issue with Apple's implementation of Samba. For temporary workaround, open up secpol.msc (Local Security Policy) on your Windows machines. Navigate to Local Policies and then Security Options. Change Network security: LAN Manager authentication
 level to "Send NTLM response only".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like somehow, my samba server can't handle NTLMv2.</p>
<p>Maybe, I should have included a few more details about my setup: My PC running Windows 7 Professional is backing up to my trusty old iBook G4 running Mac OS X 10.5.8 (client version). The backup volume is shared via the built-in samba server.</p>
<p>Thanks for your efforts.</p>

            Hi Teddy2001,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />Can you check the Brand and Model number?  I do not find the HL-2240DW.  I am assuming it is a Brother printer based on the HL prefix of the mode.  Is this a Brother Printer?
<br />
<br />If it is download the most current drivers and install.  The drivers you have might have a corrupt or missing INI file.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.brother-usa.com/brother-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.brother-usa.com/brother-support</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

            Hi Teddy, the installation files are corrupt, you should download the Driver and software installation files again:

<p>Hello&nbsp;<span>Fernando,</span></p>
<p>Thanks for your advice. This is Brother Printer with model: HL-2240DW. I had already downloaded the driver and software (http://support.brother.com/g/b/downloadtop.aspx?c=us_ot&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=hl2240_us_eu). When
 I setup with WIFI, the error message had gone. I also searched the wifi setup procedure in Youtube (<span>https://youtu.be/NcxRxVcT03U). However, when I connected USB to computer with printer, it showed "INI
 File Error". Would you mind advise some suggestions to solve this error?</span></p>

            I watched the youtube video.  At what point in the process are you getting the INI error?
<br />Are you using the same downloaded drivers?  If so, delete those (or move to another location) and download them again.  You might have had some file corruption when downloading them originally.

<h2>            Windows 8 Apps Won&#39;t Launch</h2>
                    Hello!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have had my Windows 8 laptop for one month now, and have experienced no problems until now. When I try to open any application from the start screen (eg Mail, Calender, Weather, etc.) literally nothing happens. And when I try to open the Microsoft Store
 application, the load screen appears, but then redirects me to the start screen again within seconds. For some reason, the only applications that work are my desktop applications, so I can open my desktop and access the internet. I have tried using the Modern
 UI App troubleshooter, but it didn't help at all, and when I tried resetting the store cache I get an error message that says something to the extent of "Windows cannot find 'ms-windows-store:PurgeCahces'." If anyone can help me, I would be eternally grateful,
 because at this point, I don't what to do. Thank you</div>

            This has been an ongoing problem with many users - countless based on my research. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if it is an upgrade or a new machine, there are many users that simply cannot use the apps on their Win8 computer. &nbsp;The app repair tool doesn't work,
 there is no way to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;windows without removing the regular applications - you know, the ones that work? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I like the UI, but MS's handling on this has been so bad that I am talking people into paying more for Win7 machines. &nbsp;It is that bad. &nbsp;I did EVERY fix option I found on the web, including editing my registry, and not one worked.
<div><br />
<div>Here is the biggest problem - I got the Nokia 920 phone and I have an app that won't load on the phone. &nbsp;The fix is to connect to your computer. &nbsp;My computer won't load the phone app. &nbsp;SO, I have no way to fix my app on my phone. &nbsp;Note to self, should
 have stayed with the iPhone.</div>
<div><br />
<div>MS, if you are listening, call me to figure this out. &nbsp;I am trashing Win8, and I don't want to. &nbsp;There are a few things you could do to make this a great product, but you just keep messing up. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Quick list? &nbsp;No start button? &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;Metro UI is great, why does it go away again? &nbsp;I want to keep it up all the time - well, if the programs work. &nbsp;Better apps - mail works great on the phone, why can't it work on the mail app? &nbsp;You know, if the mail
 app opened anymore.</div>
<div><br />
Frustration and anger. &nbsp;MS, get on top of this fast, because this is a big problem.</div>

            Hi, thanks for the feedback, I'll try to give you as much detail as I possibly can.
<div><br />
<div>When I got the computer, I downloaded various programs like iTunes, Spotify, apps from the Windows Store, etc. I currently run Comodo as antivirus software and use Advanced System Care 6 by iObit Information Technology to maintain performance. But immediately
 prior to when the apps stopped working, I hadn't done anything unusual or out of the ordinary with the computer - I didn't update anything or download anything - the apps just decided not to open. If it helps, the live tile feature still works, so I get updated
 News headlines, stocks, calender notifications, and what have you on the start screen. It's just that clicking or tapping the tiles does nothing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for the help!</div>

            When running from the desktop window, sometimes you will click on an icon (in the short-cuts at the bottom of the screen)&nbsp;and it will highlight (like the app is starting up) and then it goes away (like you closed it). It's like the app is starting but
 Windows is immediately shutting it down. The last time it happened the flag at the bottom said something to the effect of "maintenance" with a tiny clock or something on the flag, if that helps.

            <p>September 5, 2013.&nbsp; I'm having this exact problem with only a select few windows apps (the Xbox games for some), and not others (Weather).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran a system restore to a date 9/3/13 where the app(s) worked right after reboot, then as soon as I switched to desktop, and back the app(s) stopped working again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too have had a few BSODs in the past month, ran tests, restarts, reloads, refresh, all the re-s you could think of; and have had things working great until 9/4/13.&nbsp; The question is surely this, what 1 thing causes this to happen, and where do we go to
 fix it.&nbsp; Most likely a registry fix, or file that is fire-walling the network features, but that is just a guess.</p>

            Yep, I got this problem too.<br />
Any app I download from the app store (not the ones already on the computer) won't launch.<br />
I see the launch screen, and then it puts me back on this "Metro Screen".<br />
The app just sits there in its tray not doing anything, and when I click on it I get brought back to the launching screen for a couple of seconds and then back again to the metro screen.<br />
Its really frustating.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have this too. About a week ago all of my Metro Apps, except the one for the Desktop. stopped working and I am having trouble opening applications associated with certain programmes (Utorrent, EFax etc).</p>
<p>I had made no changes to any software, my Kaspersky Antivirus was running as normal and I regularly use Iobit Advanced System Care 6. The apps all just died and I cannot figure out any way in which to fix them. A PC refresh didn't work, neither did System
 Restore. </p>
<p>I find it very disappointing and frustrating that MS obviously know about this issue, but do not seen interested in providing REAL help and advice. This thread was started 9 months ago, and there has been no practical help from MS at all. We have all just
 been left to get on with it and suffer. I have no real technical expertise, but have tried a number of different fixes that have been suggested on the Internet, but NOTHING works.<br />
If I ran my business with as little regard for my customers I'd be out of business in a flash. MS obviously do not care about their suckers, sorry, customers.</p>

<p>Such as?&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that often suggestions are intended only to refine the symptom description but unfortunately many users misunderstand and assume that they are "fixes which don't work".&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore there is no useful feedback and consequently all must wait
 until an incident where the necessary cooperation or collaboration results in enough better understanding of the symptom to yield either a workaround or (less likely) a fix (since helpers in here are not Microsoft Support much less Product Support personnel.)</p>

            I am having a problem with the Live app tiles such as the Weather Channel and Clock.&nbsp; I have made no changes to my computer except upgrading to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I'll bet that this has something to do with MS requiring users to connect using a MS Account and
 not a Local Logon for items such as SkyDrive.&nbsp; I had a local account and used SkyDrive up and until Windows 8.1 would no longer allow same.&nbsp; Amazon and Google cloud solutions seem to work fine.&nbsp; I found a way to get the tiles to work through unistall re-install
 and selecting the not recommended connect to MS Account individually.&nbsp; Well they stopped working again.&nbsp; Seems MS doesn't care to resolve the issue themselves,.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll wait patiently for 8.2 or whatever.&nbsp; MS seems to be moving in the wrong direction.<br />

<h2>            Notifications not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been several months now, I don't know since which update, but when I'm not on the application Skype, I'm not receiving «pop-ups» on the top right corner of my MacBook Air. I don't get sounds either. Someone has to tag me on a chat so I can get the pop-up,
 and it's usually in group chats that it happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if the problem is in the Skype settings or my Mac's, but I know that the notifications on Skype are activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's annoying, so if anyone could help me, it would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I apologize to know about your experience. Can you please try to uninstall the Skype app, reboot your device, and reinstall the Skype app? Once done, kindly check
 it and let me know if the issue persist. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Here are few reasons why you might not be receiving notifications:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Notifications will stop when you sign out of the app. Make sure you are signed in.</li><li>Make sure your Notifications for conversations is on.</li><li>Make sure your Notification sounds are on.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are in <strong>Do Not Disturb</strong> mode, you will not receive chat notifications by default.&nbsp; You can change that behavior by selecting your
<strong>profile picture</strong>, then in <strong>Settings</strong>, tap&nbsp;<strong>Notifications</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>select
<strong>Show chat notifications while Do Not Disturb is on</strong>.</li><li>Verify that you haven't turned Skype notifications off from your device settings. Settings are managed differently depending on the device. If you’re not sure how to check your device settings, you may need to check the manufacturer’s website.</li><li>Make sure you haven't turned notifications off for a specific conversation.</li><li>Make sure you're using the <a href="https://www.skype.com/go/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

I had same problem and tried updating everything!<br />

Have you noticed that if you right click on the video the ' settings' option is disabled??<br />
<br />
Well, all you do is wait for one of the small video adverts to start on the same screen, right click on that and
<br />
Et voila! - that should fix it. If not, I am sorry and good luck with your search for a solution!<br />

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which is the update that has caused this issue?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which is the antivirus program installed on the computer?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you aware of making any changes to the computer prior to the issue?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot and disable antivirus programs before installing the suspicious update.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Place the computer in Clean boot state to know which application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This
 kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes,
 you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span> Follow the steps given in the link below to do the same:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer
 to start as usual as mentioned here:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> To configure Windows to use a Normal startup state</span></p>
<p><span>After you used the clean boot to resolve your problem, you can follow these steps to configure Windows XP to start normally.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
<span>Start</span>, and then click <span>Run</span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Type msconfig, and then click
<span>OK</span>. The <span>System Configuration Utility</span> dialog box is displayed.</span>
</li><li><span>Click the
<span>General</span> tab, click <span>Normal Startup - load all device drivers and services</span>, and then click
<span>OK</span>.</span> 
</li><li><span>When you are prompted, click
<span>Restart</span> to restart the computer.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span>
</span><span>Disable antivirus software if installed any and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Warning:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software.
 If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Download the stand alone package of the updates that have failed to install.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please make a note of the KB article number for the specific update which was failed. Visit Microsoft download center and download the updates
 manually from the website.</span></p>

<p>My bad...Sorry...Skype does not work on iPhone X...Skype for Business does work.&nbsp; In several days no one from Microsoft has responded to my request on the Skype site (or direct emails I have sent) for help and nobody has responded other than you.&nbsp; If Skype
 for business works - why would not Traditional Skype.&nbsp; Several unistalls and reinstalls later, I can receive Skype calls but I cannot dial out to anyone..when you try, screen skips a bit and then app does nothing.</p>

</p><p>Maybe you can point me in right direction.&nbsp; I turned off my iPhone after each unistall.</p>

<p>I do not agree with Vinodh verdict. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You are not changing pc motherboard. If you used recovery tool for windows 10 usb backup. I believe that you can use that on your new drive. But if it doesn't work than just install 8.1 again and repeat update to windows 10. Do you have product key for windows
 8.1?</p>

                    I have a number of events that are recurring from year to year, birthdays, anniversaries, etc.&nbsp; When I went into my calendar this morning I noticed that ALL of the recurring events had been moved one day back. I had to go into each recurring event and
 change the date. Can anyone tell me why this occurred and how to prevent it from occurring?

            Thank you for your response to my question. I have checked the system date and time and they are both correct. Also have run extensive diagnostics on my computer and no files have been corrupted.&nbsp; the recurring events on my Windows 10 Calendar are still
 not accurate.&nbsp; I have had to go in and move every recurring event back to its original date.&nbsp; I did this last week and to date the events have not altered.&nbsp; I still do not know why ALL the recurring events on my Windows 10 Calendar arbitrarily moved.

    <title>Import settings&#58; The prompt for tagging on import was unChecked. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i am just looking for answers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Import settings&#58; The prompt for tagging on import was unChecked. Now I can&#39;t get to import settings&#63; it flashes right by&#63;.</h2>
                    I went to auto play and used all posible settings. used default settings and still can't get to import settings
<br />
<br />
While importing from a memory stick, I am trying to use import settings in the window that comes up after i choose the option&nbsp; ( Import pictures using windows) I set them before from that window... Then made the mistake of un checking the box refering to the
 tagging of photos. in the window that comes up after clicking on the import setting button (or words saying import settings.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;NOW when I CHOOSE the option of Import using windows&nbsp; the window comes up (flashes) so fast I am unable to press the Import settings button before it automaticly
<br />
starts to import the pictures off the memory stick into the folder that I gave it originaly. ( So i know I can Change it)<br />
&nbsp;I am unable to tag or direct the location of the photos import. Is there another way to get to import settings????<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you tried to changed the import settings from the File Menu from the Windows Live photo gallery?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get the prompt back to tag photos, here is what you can do.</p>
<p>1.Open Windows Photo Gallery by clicking the Start button , clicking All Programs, and then clicking Windows Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>2.Click the File menu, and then click Options.</p>
<p>3.Click the Import tab.</p>
<p>4. Check the Prompt for a tag on import check box, and then click OK.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer the article that will give you information on how to change and access the Windows Live photo gallery:</p>

            I have windows 7 Home Premium 64bit<br />
<br />
Going to start button&nbsp; , clicking all programs ......I have NO Windows Photo Gallery?????<br />
<br />
What do I do ???&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have searched for an answer to this problem, I am seeing there is a problem with vista and windows 7 something in the registry settings?<br />
I am not sure if this applies to me I did not want to change a registry setting if I am not sure I can change it Back?<br />
<br />
Below is&nbsp; a paste of what I found will this fix my problem? Does it apply to windows 7?<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>I'm sorry you're facing this issue. There is a bug on x64 versions of Vista and Win7 where Windows Live Photo Gallery is not showing up as an option for importing photos in the AutoPlay dialog (dialog that appears when a camera or other device is connected).&nbsp;&nbsp;Photo
 Gallery&nbsp;also doesn't show up as an available program in the Control Panel settings for Default programs on X64 version of Operating Systems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team is working to release a fix for this issue but meanwhile you can fix it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> You can download/run the reg file available here: <a href="http://cid-0ef11107b9afdf25.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/WLPGX64fix.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://cid-0ef11107b9afdf25.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/WLPGX64fix.reg</a></p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> You can create your own .reg file (just open notepad and save under whatever name you want to but be sure you add .reg as the extension) and paste
<br />
the text between the lines in this posting.</p>
<p>Thank you for using Windows Live Photo Gallery!<br />

<p>I am having this same issue and because i daily upload pictures and used this feature it is a huge time suck that this option to tag pictures was taken away.</p>
<p>This proposed "answer" does not answer the question at all. &nbsp;There is no option for tagging a picture any longer. &nbsp;When i follow these instructions there is no "prompt for a tag" because that option no longer exists.</p>
<p>How can i get this option back without having to do some majorly technical things (as have been suggested in other similar posts) which i am not prepared or able to do?</p>

<p>Hi there, you should change your privacy settings so either only your friends can see when you're online or just disable it altogether. You can do so follow the steps here:

    <title>Windows Fragmentation issue, with Errors found by Chkdsk - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andilyn75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Fragmentation issue, with Errors found by Chkdsk</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to defrag my computer because of serious performance issues. I&nbsp;went to optimize drives and tried to optimize but it acts like it is running but then stops and does nothing. So I tried using the command prompt from within windows.&nbsp;It will
 not run defrag from either the command prompt or the internal optimization feature. I ran chkdsk at command prompt and discovered the disk has many errors. From the list it appears that the disk is mostly corrupt. It has given this output:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Errors found chkdsk cannot continue in read-only mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is at the command prompt - which should not be read only. I am running as administrator. I have tried to defrag from command prompt and it won't even run. I typed in 'defrag c: /u' and all it did was output "Microsoft drive optimizer" and say it is
 copyrighted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating. I am about ready to Fdisk the drive manually because I suspect the original install of Windows 8.1 is completely corrupt. The only reason I haven't is that I don't have an install disk for it - it was a beta download. It has caught
 up with the computer and the drive is now 79% fragmented, is not running the weekly defrag as indicated in system tools, and frankly has suffered serious performance issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand why chkdsk isn't working properly - is windows 8.1 blocking it from running properly? Is there some way to bypass start up and run a command prompt not within windows anymore? Is there some reason that I can't also defrag from the command
 prompt? I suspect windows is blocking everything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>
