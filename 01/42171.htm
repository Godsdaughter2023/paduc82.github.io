<h2>            Unable to send or receive files via bluetooth.</h2>
                    
<div>Hey guys, I have a bluetooth dongle by Microsoft - the transceiver v3.0 for bluetooth. This dongle came together with my mouse and keyboard set (Wireless Laser Mouse 8000 and Wireless Entertainment Keyboard 7000). Anyway,
 previously, when I was using Vista, I was able to send and receive files through the bluetooth dongle.<br />
<br />
After upgrading to Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit, I am unable to do so but I am still able to pair my mouse and keyboard to it. When I try to send a file, this message popped up: "Windows was unable to transfer some files. The file could not be sent because
 the connection could not be established. Check to make sure the Bluetooth radio is plugged in. To try again, click the Back arrow."<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled and reinstalled the IntelliPoint/IntelliTypePro software, which would reinstall the driver for the transceiver but the problem still persists. In device manager, bluetooth radios doesn't show up.<br />
<br />
Can anyone please help me with this problem?</div>

Navigate to your system and look under Vista drivers and then look under Windows 7 drivers.<br />
There are Vista drivers and those would have come on your system. There are no Windows<br />
7 drivers currently available.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t assign volume names in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prestonpdx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t assign volume names in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have two internal hard drives and one external (USB 3.0) one (Disk 2 in the Disk Management screenshot below):<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6d738184-6f18-42fa-8ead-0e4a00f0c385" /></p>
<p>In File Explorer, it looks like this:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f59751d-1b69-486f-824a-a331b8ecd2da" /></p>
<p>Notice that the three volumes on the external drive (Disk 2), K:, L:, and M:,are listed in File Explorer as only "Local Disk." I can access the external volumes without difficulty: it's just that I can't remember which is which without volume labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that I cannot assign labels to these three volumes. I have tried in Disk Management by right-clicking on the volume and entering the desired name on the General tab of Properties. I have also tried to change it in File Explorer the same way(right-clicking
 on the volume, going to the General tab on Properties, and entering the desired label). Interestingly, when I do this in File Explorer, the label changes in Disk Management but it stays the same "Local Disk" in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to change it in Command Prompt:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ac409e87-23b0-4870-b89a-60b4089b9fe1" /></p>
<p>It changes successfully there but still shows up as "Local Disk" in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Registry Editor, it also appears correctly, but this doesn't affect how it appears in File Explorer:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc485e38-25a0-4d20-868e-2199571b7dec" /></p>
<p>How can I get the volume label to appear in File Explorer for the external drive as it does for the internal drives? For the record, I'm on&nbsp; Windows 10 Prof desktop (32 bit).</p>

            Ah, so looks like Kazik.Lesniak's observation was right on the money after all, and it's not a Win10-has-removed-this-feature issue but your Panda AV trying to be too clever by half. Why does it need to act in such a dumb manner when every other AV has
 no issues scanning/protecting plugged-in USB drives without needing to tinker with their autorun.infs?

<h2>            For some weird reason I got logged into someone elses account... how do I get rid of it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First of all, I am NOT PortalChaff611. For some reason beyond my understanding I got logged into this account when PinballFX 2 asked whether it should log me into my Xbox live account. Now I don't even have my own Xbox live account yet (I've just installed
 Windows 8 and got PiballFX 2 from the Windows 8&nbsp;app store) so I thought "well, it's probably going to tell me that I don't have an Xbox live account yet and that I have to make one". That or the Microsoft account I made when installing would also qualify as
 one but that was made with a different name with my own email address. But instead of that I got logged into someone elses account (it didn't even ask for the password).</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'm completely stupefied as to why&nbsp;why this happened. Just to make things 100% clear, I am NOT a hacker, I do NOT want to abuse this account in anyway whatsoever and I'd like to log out of it ASAP but I don't know how on Win8. Reopening&nbsp;nor re√Ønstalling
 the application worked.&nbsp;Anyone has any idea how this could have happened and how to solve this problem? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Well, I think I solved my own problem. I just read that apparently a random gamertag is generated when you log into Xbox Live for the first time using your Microsoft account, which I didn't know so I thought I accidentally hacked someone elses account. Well,
 guess this one can be closed then :) But I'd appreciate it if these kind of things could be made more clear in the future because I nearly **** my pants when I just got logged in like that with a completely random username without any notification of what
 was happening so my first thought was "**** I accidentally hacked someone elses account and I have no proof that it was an accident!". I know this might seem like a silly thought to some of you but I really don't have enough knowledge about networking to complete
 rule it out immediately. </p>

<p>
</p><p>The HP Laserjet G3110 is compatible on Windows 10.</p>
<p>To run the scanner you must upgrade scanner driver for Windows 10.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Hope can help you.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I encrypted the folder (includes subfolders and files) using EFS and I was not aware of the importance of backing up the certificate and the private key. Anyway, I re-installed the windows xp home edition and obviously I can't access to the files in the
 folder. I searched for many hours and could not find answers.&nbsp;I am still hoping that somehow I can get&nbsp;these files back.&nbsp;Can anyone help me on this issue? I am pretty sure many people had the same problem.&nbsp;Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I dont think you read his problem properly. It says it WILL NOT BOOT. You cannot do either of the things you suggest as the machine is caught in a LOOP... I am having the same problem and I am furious that Micro$oft do not seem to care.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot start in safe mode, I cannot reset it, I cannot repair it, I cannot do anything! Every option I choose takes me back to the Automatic Repair screen! Even using a disc!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using bcd fixes and bootcat.cache fixes from the command prompt but nothing works.

            <p>Hi Kristie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update and apologies for late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to use any other PC and&nbsp;<strong>download Windows 10 ISO files and create a Windows bootable media or DVD.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may refer to:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD or USB</strong>", do so.
 If you don‚Äôt see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start
 the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works.</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p><br />
The "<strong><em>System Thread Exception Thread Not Handled</em></strong>" error usually occurs due to hardware driver issue. For us to provide more troubleshooting steps to resolve the issue, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Were there any external devices connected to your computer (except for mouse and keyboard)?<br />
</li><li>Are you using a third party anti-virus? <br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply. </p>

            Hi Christian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try downloading the tool to the USB drive and running it from there which is a strange workaround but the one that works most.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise download from this alternative site:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure to get your licensed version or it won't activated.
<br />
<br />Then burn to DVD using Windows Image Burner, or write to flash stick following this guide:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-create-bootable-usb-media-from-iso-for-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-create-boo...</a>
<br />
<br />You can run the media from Windows as a Repair Install, or do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows Update will not install KB4462919</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update downloaded KB4462919 about a week ago.&nbsp; The update history page says that it requires a restart to finish installing, though I have repeatedly restarted the system.&nbsp; I tried using the update troubleshooter, which said that it found and fixed
 some problems, but the update still does not get installed after a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Microsoft support page for KB4462919 said that Windows Update automatically "offers" KB4456655 as a prerequisite to KB4462919.&nbsp; But when I checked the update history, Windows Update never tried to install this update.</p>

            Hi David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Sometimes it takes time for WIndows Update to catch up with itself.  
<br />
<br />You can try installing the prereq update yourself if you want:  <a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search.aspx?q=kb4456655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/search...</a>  But it may not even be meant for your System and WUD needs to catch up with that. 
<br />
<br />To try to resolve persistent problems with WUD:
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt by typing CMD in Start Search, right click result to Run as Administrator, copy and paste or type the following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) Complete Guide to Managing Updates after Version 1803: <a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br />6) If Updates still won't run go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<p>Hello Ashraf,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the issue with the game. If you originally got the game off of game pass, we recommend to uninstall the game then reinstall the game from the disc. There may be a glitch that it recognizing it still as a game pass game and not the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Used to burn CDs with Windows Media Player, but now the CDs won&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Used to burn CDs with Windows Media Player, but now the CDs won&#39;t play </h2>
                    
<p>Hey, I'm hoping someone can give me an idea what is going on here and how I can fix it, because I'm at a total loss.</p>
<p>Background: A couple of weeks before this started, I burned a CD with Windows Media Player. It plays in everything just fine, so I know it's capable of burning CDs that play in other players.</p>
<p>I am not sure which happened first, but I updated Windows through the Microsoft update page. Around the same time, I burned an audio CD with Nero. The version of Nero I have is 6, an essentials version that came bundled with my external DVD burner.</p>
<p>The CD burned with Nero had odd noises on it, clicking during some of the songs. Research leads me to believe that it's a Nero issue with mp3s, requiring a no-longer available plugin, and not the computer's problem.</p>
<p>There was another, different CD I wanted to burn, so I switched back to Windows Media Player. That's when the difficulties started.</p>
<p>The first CD I tried to burn, failed and said it was burning too fast. I hadn't changed any settings that I knew of, but I shrugged it off, changed the speed, and retried.</p>
<p>The CD that was created will play the first song, but will not play any others. The players try to play it, but cannot change from track one to track two. I have tried pausing, skipping to another track, and nothing works. It does the same in the burning
 computer.</p>
<p>On advice, I uninstalled and reinstalled the drive that burned the CD to reset the drivers. I tried burning a different CD. It works the same, with one slight difference - the mp3s are still on this computer, so it plays on here. If I take the mp3s off the
 computer, though, it stops working. Only on this computer, though. It still refuses to play anything but the first track anywhere else.</p>
<p>I went to reopen WMP to try and check something, and it refused to open properly. I had to close it using end program, and it closed. When it reopened, it gave me the error report that an optional plugin had caused the error and that they were disabled.
 I did not remember installing any optional plugins, so I checked. The only one showed was Nero Fast-Burning CD Plugin, and I do not know when it was installed. It is unchecked, so is presumably not engaged right now.</p>
<p>I have checked in the WMP column mode in the library, and the music is not protected, so it should burn onto the audio cd and let me play in a cd player. The music is all in mp3 format.</p>
<p>It burns rewritable CDs fine, and I have done a few of those since this whole thing began, so I do not think the laser has gone bad in the burner yet. It does burn the cds, they just won't play - anywhere.</p>
<p>The computer in question is an IBM Thinkpad laptop running Windows XP Pro SP 3.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of anything similar? Does anyone have any ideas what could be going on or how to fix it so I can burn audio cds again?</p>

<p>=========================================<br />
Since you report that the MP3 files must be available on your hard <br />
drive or the CD won't play makes me think you burned shortcuts <br />
on the CD and not the actual MP3 music files.</p>
<p>I'm guessing you want to burn an Audio (music) CD that will play<br />
on all CD players...if that is correct...have a look at the following<br />
information.</p>
<p>Windows Media Player 11<br />
for Windows XP<br />
Burn Your Own Customized CDs<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/howto/mp11/burn.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/knowledgecenter/howto/mp11/burn.aspx</a></p>
<p>Windows Media Player Tutorial: How to Burn an Audio CD With Media Player 11<br />

(5 page tutorial)</p>
<p>Also...the freeware CDBurnerXP may be worth a try:</p>
<p>CDBurnerXP<br />
<a href="http://www.cdburnerxp.se/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cdburnerxp.se/</a><br />
(yes it runs on XP, Vista, 7)<br />

<a href="http://cdburnerxp.se/help/Audio/compileaudio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cdburnerxp.se/help/Audio/compileaudio</a><br />
<br />
If you want to create an MP3 disk that will play on players that <br />
are compatible with MP3 files...you need to create a Data CD.<br />
The advantage is that you can burn many more songs per disk...<br />
the disadvantage is that some players will not play the CD.</p>

will turn red if you add too many files) </p>

<p>Thanks for the links, I have checked them over, and the tutorials are the same as what I have done before. I have burned CDs with WMP before this, just the same way as they say to do and the same as I burned these coaster disks, which is why I'm concerned.
 The only difference between their tutorials and what I did was that I arranged the playlist in the 'Now Playing' screen and chose 'Burn Current Playlist' on the Burn page, which worked with another CD. I shall try doing it the way they say, choosing from the
 library instead of making a playlist, and see if that makes a difference, when I get the opportunity.</p>
<p>My computer came with IBM RecordNow! burning software, which I have not tried yet. When I have the opportunity, I shall try it and the software you have recommended. I'm not sure which is more important right now - being able to burn CDs again or getting
 WMP back to burning properly. It's just the latest in a long string of problems, which makes it all the more frustrating...on the other hand, I think I'm finally winning out, since I've defeated every other problem it's thrown at me so far.</p>
I'll come back after I've tried them all and let you know if they worked or if I could use some more help.

<p>Thanks for the links, I have checked them over, and the tutorials are the same as what I have done before. I have burned CDs with WMP before this, just the same way as they say to do and the same as I burned these coaster disks, which is why I'm concerned.
 The only difference between their tutorials and what I did was that I arranged the playlist in the 'Now Playing' screen and chose 'Burn Current Playlist' on the Burn page, which worked with another CD. I shall try doing it the way they say, choosing from the
 library instead of making a playlist, and see if that makes a difference, when I get the opportunity.</p>
<p>My computer came with IBM RecordNow! burning software, which I have not tried yet. When I have the opportunity, I shall try it and the software you have recommended. I'm not sure which is more important right now - being able to burn CDs again or getting
 WMP back to burning properly. It's just the latest in a long string of problems, which makes it all the more frustrating...on the other hand, I think I'm finally winning out, since I've defeated every other problem it's thrown at me so far.</p>
I'll come back after I've tried them all and let you know if they worked or if I could use some more help.</blockquote>
<p>======================================<br />
It's beginning to sound like you have a hardware problem...<br />
maybe it's time for a new burner.</p>

<p>I worried about it being the burner too for awhile, but it burned rewritable data discs just fine, and then after earlier today I started to think it will still work for a bit longer.</p>
<p>I tested IBM/Sonic RecordNow, and the CD that it created plays just fine. It has played in the computer and in two different CD players so far, so one burner software is working. No pause between tracks that I can tell, which is both a good and bad thing,
 since I'm not sure how to put one in, but usually I don't want one. So it makes me guess that some setting has gone wrong/I'm doing something wrong with WMP, rather than the burner going bad quite yet.</p>
<p>I am going to test the CDBurnerXP, I have to install a .Net framework to get it to work, so it hasn't been installed yet. I still am going to check some things with WMP and Nero as well. At the moment, though, I am glad to have one program that seems to
 have worked. I should be able to try the other programs tomorrow.</p>

There could still be an intermittent hardware problem but hopefully <br />
it's just software related. Sounds like you're having better luck now.</p>

<p>Hey, I'm back. Wish I had a better update, but I have another problem/question.</p>
<p>It seems that the CD I burned that worked...only sorta worked, and I was wondering if anyone might have an idea what's going on.</p>
<p>I finally got a chance to listen to it the whole way through, and on two different CD players, the last two songs are cut off halfway through. It just goes on to the next track as though that is the proper ending.</p>
<p>I tried the CD on this laptop in WMP, and it played the last song the whole way through. So half of the song doesn't seem to want to play on other players, but the rest will. I haven't checked all the songs, I checked the last two and listened to the first
 fourteen (out of nineteen) and they were just fine - the whole song plays with no problem.</p>
<p>The last two come up as the whole thing on the comp, just don't play in the two players I've tried it in.</p>
<p>Any ideas what could cause a burner to burn half songs for CD players but not computers and only on two or three songs?</p>

<p>It was the best approach at the time, I agree - it was part of the whole redo and problems from four months ago. After fighting the virus for about a week, (at the time, it made windows hang on the wallpaper and never shut down), I reinstalled windows, but
 it had one of those recycler viruses that attack the autorun feature, so it was on my externals and made a lovely merry-go-round effect. After I finally figured out what it was, I got rid of it on one install, from the computer and all externals, and inoculated
 the externals from getting it again, then reinstalled windows again just to be sure I got it and found a registry edit to disable autorun.</p>
<p>The other problems have been things like - oh, you need to update x,y, and z. As in, oh, windows needs updated to the newest service pack. Now update IE, Adobe, this, that, and the other thing. Well, now the printer doesn't want to work (fixed easily with
 new ink, half of the cartridge had dried so it said it was full but it wasn't e_e). Then it was getting automatic updates to work, than it was something else. Now it's the computer takes a looong time to start up, CDs are refusing to burn properly, and although
 manual windows updates worked on the second Wednesday of last month, they didn't want to work when I tried to check for software updates when this CD problem started - wanted to check for WMP updates (hung on the 'checking for new updates' page). Got some
 ideas I'm going to try later for the updates, and I'm just dealing with it taking a long time to start up, as at least it<em>is</em> starting up.</p>
<p>The first thing I did after I got it re-installed and updated to SP3, plus most of my programs reinstalled and making sure it was clean, was to find a program that let me make restore disks for it and make some, actually. Then back everything on the external
 drives up onto DVDs. Every week I do a rewritable of the past week's work, as well.</p>
<p>So yeah, your idea kinda was the best at the time - most of my problems, aside from the computer suddenly having all these problems with burning CDs, comes from me trying to be a better computer-user and updating things I had stupidly let lag after doing
 the new install. I don't even remember them all, just that each one took a couple days to fix. So yeah, somebody fetch the world's tiniest violin to play a sad song on while I get some cheese to go with my whine, and we'll throw a nice pity party. :P</p>

    <title>Fallout 76 crashes and takes out the entire console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dashsixteen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fallout 76 crashes and takes out the entire console</h2>
                    <p>This has happened to me twice now in the span of a week. &nbsp;I'll be playing Fallout 76, the game will stop responding and freeze, then quits to the dashboard. &nbsp;I try to re-open the game, then a get a message about the game taking too long to load. &nbsp;I restart
 the console, and it fails to boot stating error E105 (or E106, I've seen both and am not sure which one showed first). &nbsp;Apparently the only troubleshooting for this error is to restart the console, which I've already done to get to this error so the next step
 is to restore the console to factory defaults, erasing all my data? &nbsp;I've even had issues resetting to factory and gotten other E10x errors, necessitating an offline update from USB drive. &nbsp;The first time this happened my game was stored on an external drive,
 and having the drive connected resulted in some weird system laggy issues after restoring to factory so I moved the game to internal storage and disconnected the drive. &nbsp;The next time my console crashed forcing me to restore to factory, I had to download all
 50GB of patch for the game again. &nbsp;I'm reluctant to keep playing because the next crash might brick my console AGAIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Xbox One X 1TB with the latest OS updates, and have had zero issues with it until Fallout 76. &nbsp;I get that the game isn't stable and has some outstanding performance and stability issues, but I'm totally at a loss why my operating system can't survive
 an app misbehaving or crashing?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen any messages about the console overheating, but I'm considering moving the console to a better ventilated area in spite of the fact that I've never had any issues playing any other games at 4K HDR until Fallout 76. &nbsp;Is there anything else
 I can do here? &nbsp;Should I ignore the E106/105 error and shut the system down for a while, then start it back up? &nbsp;I'm at a complete loss here, I've never seen a game crash and brick the console afterwards.</p>

<p>Hey there dash, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you have been running into this System Error code. It sounds like you have already gone through the support article "I need help with system updates on my Xbox One." If this is the case and you keep coming back to the same error codes, I would
 advise that you do register the console and send out the console for Repair. Go ahead and go through the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Support</a> to set up the repair order. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps. </p>

            Adding onto this. This appears to be specific to the X. Hopefully Bethesda will patch it in the near future and it isn't anything faulty with your Xbox.

<h2>            Is it possible to save a higher resolution file from Fresh Paint&#63;</h2>
                    I'm using a small Surface 3 and I got very excited and started drawing in Fresh Paint. But when I save the file I get a very low-res PNG or JPG. The file is 1706x960 PNG even though my screen resolution was 1920x1080 (which still isn't high enough but
 of is higher than the output I got. I know people use this for "real" art so how do you save an output file in a printable format with a higher resolution?

            <p>Hi Karen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will surely assist you with saving images with high resolution from fresh paint in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets follow the below steps and see if this helps.</p>
<p>&gt;.&nbsp;Is the issue specific to a particular image?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To save an image in high resolution refer the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When in Fresh Paint, press Win+S to bring up a search bar. Type "Print" and choose "print to xps document writer". Set the resolution to 300dpi, and choose a large paper format ( usually go for A3). This will create a high-resolution XPS file in your documents
 folder. There are online tools to convert XPS to various image formats, but I haven't tested any of them yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer the below Fresh Paint FAQ :<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/fresh-paint-faq/552a7366-fbd2-4b19-a4b8-4021453a4835"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-winapps/fresh-paint-faq/552a7366-fbd2-4b19-a4b8-4021453a4835</span></a>

<p>Lets us know if this helps.<br />
Thank you.</p>

            <p>So are you basically telling me that there is no way to save the file as .png or .jpg with a reasonable resolution? All the printing houses take .png or .jpg. They don't take xps files. All the free conversion sites I could find converted but to very low
 quality jpg files so that doesn't help at all. I did read those directions but it seems absolutely crazy to go through multiple conversions and hope you are going to really get a good output file - and also I couldn't make it work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was so excited thinking this was going to be a tool for creating real art but it seems like it is only useful for creating art to post online if files cannot be printed with any quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least with the old version you could print to CanvasPop (which is not a great solution because you shouldn't be tied to only one printing vendor) but it appears with Windows 10 you can't even do that. Is there any plan then to allow decent output files
 to be saved from Fresh Paint?</p>

 future.</p>

            Hi Bogdan,<br />

One reason why you're unable to run the command prompt on your computer is that there might be a third party software causing conflict to it. For us to assist you, we suggest that you start your PC in safe mode. This is for us to isolate the issue and this
 will also help us determine if the issue still occurs if your PC is in safe mode. Here's an

<h2>            Windows 7 says &#34;no audio output device detected&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm on a fresh install(not an upgrade) of Windows 7 32 bit. I know my soundcard works(it works with a Ubuntu Live CD), but in Windows, no matter what speakers/headphones I plug into the computer, it always tells me "no audio output device detected".</p>
<p>I have updated/reinstalled sound drivers, checked that both audio services are running, and checked under device manager to make sure there were no yellow flags. &nbsp;When I click the sound icon, windows troubleshooting starts, but it finishes by saying "no
 errors were detected". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone please give me an approach to this I haven't tried yet.</p>

<p><span>Hi bsee08,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>¬∑<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Where
 did you update the sound drivers from?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Try uninstalling and reinstalling sound card
 from device manager.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 Start and type ‚Äúdevmgmt.msc‚Äù (without quotes), and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand
 Sound, Video and Game Controllers.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the sound card and select Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 the computer and Windows should now detect the sound card and install the sound drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Log on to the manufacturer website and update
 the latest audio drivers. Also, check to see if you have other device driver updates available.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Problem with connecting HP 4050 via usb to Dell Dimension 310</h2>
                    I have a HP Laserjet 4050.&nbsp; I purchased a dell dimension 3100 series.&nbsp; I purchased a usb cable to connect the printer.&nbsp; Since I could not find the actual driver on HP site since the printer is discontinued, I downloaded the Universal Driver they suggested
 and plugged in the usb.&nbsp; The system said it recognized the new hardware and I&nbsp;see the doc in the queue but it never prints.&nbsp; Does anyone have any suggestions?&nbsp; I am frustrated.<br />

I've been getting frequent (almost once each session) 10d error code BSOD's in the Win7 64 kernel by what seems to be my firewire driver.&nbsp; Could you advise me how to go about getting troubleshooting on this? All drivers are up to date.&nbsp; I have my Skydrive set

            <p>No problem. Actually that's the way it should be spelled but that's a long story.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The minidump files pointed to the yfwbus.sys (Yamaha Steinberg FW Driver)&nbsp;as&nbsp;a possible&nbsp;cause of the error with the 1394ohci.sys (1394 OpenHCI Driver) taking the blame for the crash:</p>
<p><br />
<em>BugCheck 10D, {8, 57ff5f12558, 4, fffffa800ae06c50}</em></p>
<p><em>*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>yfwbus.sys</strong><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>yfwbus.sys</strong><br />
Probably caused by : 1394ohci.sys ( 1394ohci!IsochTx::HandleIsochAttachBuffers+3ce )</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have tried updating or rolling back the Yamaha driver you could try switching to the legacy 1394 driver - steps in the following link:</p>

<p>However if the memory is showing errors&nbsp;replacing the faulty memory should take precedence.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>There are a number of reasons why you are getting the stop code error. One example is an issue with the outdated D-Link certificate. The easiest way to fix this is to download the latest update for your driver by going to the manufacturer's website.

<h2>            Using PayPal account to buy MSP</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I linked my PayPal account to my XBL account 2/3 days ago and tried to buy some MSP with the PayPal account to get the Rockstar Pass for LA Noire.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But everytime I try to buy the MSP on my xbox I get an error saying 'This transaction can not be completed, try paying with Microsoft Points at a later time', which made me confused because thats exactly what I was trying to buy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then tried it on my PC, it loads for a couple of seconds then comes up with an error message saying 'Transaction could not be completed at this time please contact support'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yeah any help would be greatly appreciated to get this resolved as I can't leave the house as I'm to sick to go anywhere :(</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>yuross</p>
