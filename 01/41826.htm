I know nothing about computers and I have an issue in recovering my ACER.<br />
<br />
<br />
System recovery procedure on Win 10 (upgrade on Win 7 - 64 bit)&nbsp;<strong>stalls&nbsp;</strong>messaging a fatal error '0x8000ffff'.<br />
<br />
<br />
I found the Microsoft Hotfix download link and recovered the&nbsp;<strong>apt</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Hotfix KB article number 2709289&nbsp;</strong>for 64bit version.<br />
<br />
After download and automatic unzip of this tool I applied Win10 recovery procedure again and still was not able to recover successfully, ‎my PC giving exactly the same error 0x8000fff message in this process.<br />
<br />
I applied problem shooter on Microsoft Hotfi tool 447986 zip. exe to check compatibility which was unsuccessfull and I was asked to contact the software provider ie. Microsoft.<br />
<br />
Any solution? Thank you very much.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Krisde,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to know that you are unable to restore the system on Windows 10. I will certainly help you.</p>
</span><span>
<p>This issue might be caused by software conflicts, registry errors or programs not installing properly on the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to assist you better, please reply to the following questions.</p>
</span><span>
<p><strong>1. </strong><span>Are you getting this error while performing
<strong>System Restore </strong>or while installing <strong>Windows Updates</strong>?</span></p>
</span><span>
<p><strong>2. </strong><span>Have you connected any external devices other than mouse and keyboard?<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a initial troubleshooting, <strong>disconnect</strong> all <strong>non-essential devices
</strong>other than mouse and keyboard and then try to perform the restore and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>If you have non-essential external devices attached to your computer during installation, this can interfere with the setup engine and prevent the installation from completing because Windows 10 is trying to detect them. So, keep the bare essentials attached,
 keyboard and mouse. If you have external hard disk or USB keys, disconnect those too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with above information and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Vinodh,</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>No external hardware is connected, except for mouse and keyboard, while executing regular windows 10 recovery procedure. I run Norton 360 on my PC.</p>
<p>The problem is located whether at the hotfix unzip level or at the hotfix. exe command. I traced the hotfix in the system and by clicking on the right mouse button I normally can open the downloaded microsoft hotfix. this ain't happening. I also can check
 Hotfix windows 7 compatibilty by clicking on the right mouse button but that ends in a message that this 'app' is not recognized and that I should contact Microsoft corp.</p>
<p>Contrary to the Win 7 restore procedure I have no specific dated restoring points enlisted referring to former downloads or to former updates. I restored on a 50 per cent scale on the drive but that ain't also working. I want to avoid to reset win 10.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Vinodh hi, me again...</p>
<p>I went back to Microsoft incoming Hotfix link delivery mail checking out obvious features and then downloaded it again. Apparently latest download gave, contrary to yesterday, the chance to open the systemfile and to run hotfix as an administrator,which
 I proudly am. Now I am running Win10 system recovery and maybe that could give better results.</p>
<p>A restore on the station with my 2007 disk did not work and a search for shared system was unsuccessful. If you do not hear from me again, then I will be back in business.</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, best friend.</p>
<p>Kris</p>

            <p>Vinodh my best friend,</p>
<p>so the thing was that that Microsoft Hotfix was in my system file as such. However, looking closer the hotfix showed ZERO bytes size. I was mislead by the computer telling me hotfix was downloaded and unzipped. Then normally you think a valid file is stored
 on the system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went back to the Microsoft hotfix link, and downloaded that hotfix a second time. Then I did regular win 10 system recovery. The only issue there was,was that current apps disappear in this process.. After new startup the computer shows only non windows
 related apps and an app pack must be downloaded. A guy from Brussels made an article on how to write a short script to activate that download. I applied that script in the MSDos screen after the C-prompt and then full apps pack is installed on win 10. Only
 thing that remains to do is to choose your apps and set them on the task bar. I recovered non windows related apps from the moment my google search engine worked by just googling for that non windows programm, then downloading it and then creating an app on
 the task bar.That is all doable.</p>
<p>I thank you for your commitment. Rare...</p>

<h2>            svchost.exe&#59; LocalServiceNetworkRestricted and netsvcs using too much memory</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I'm totally stumped as to why so much memory is in use and my cpu is spiking. &nbsp;I am hoping a fresh set of eyes can help me. &nbsp;My OS is: &nbsp;Vista Home Premium SP2 x64</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">SYMPTOMS</span></strong></p>
<p>svchost.exe; LocalServiceNetworkRestricted (primarily) and netsvcs are using too much memory</p>
<p>
</p><p>winlogon.exe and csrss.exe are always shown as processes in task manager, no user name, no command line. &nbsp;They never used to be there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't run certain programs because memory/cpu use gets too high and everything slows. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initial symptoms were that mouse became inaccurate as if drivers had changed and machine got loud and slow in spikes. &nbsp;Soon after I had some suspicious ad activity in browsers and mouse was moving hesitantly as if something remote was happening. &nbsp;Eventually
 mouse froze and stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple scans were run and all have come back clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">OTHER</span></strong></p>
<p>Mouse description and drivers are labled differently than they used to be and any attempt to unplug/replug and reboot does nothing. &nbsp;I tried three different mouse before any would work and am just using it with the wrong, generic, drivers because I can't
 change it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not windows update, nor superfetch causing my problem. &nbsp;I disabled both and there was no reduction in memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspected an infection or corruption of WUDFSvc.dll but someone who helps with infections told me it looks fine. &nbsp;I have multiple entries, some in caps (application extension), some in lowercase (mui) a total of 13 entries within the following folders:</p>
<p>Backup (C:\Windows\winsxs)</p>
<p>en-US (C:\Windows\System32)</p>
<p>amd64_microsoft-windows-d....</p>
<p>System32 (C:\Windows)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hoping someone can help me stop svchost.exe services from jamming up my memory/cpu usage. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            Hi Amirmohammad999,<br />
<br />
<br />
You should be able to turn off your PC by forcing it to shut down.<br />
<br />
Have you tried pressing the Power button until the screen turns black and the system shuts off?<br />
<br />
Let us know if you were able to boot your PC after force shutting it down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<p>So I made the daft decision to switch to a PS3 which I regret so I'm looking to trade it in at gamestation.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if you can trade in the wireless headset aswell?</p>
<p>Hate to admit it but I made a stupid mistake trading my 360 in for the PS3. It was mainly blu ray I was after but I can get a decent-ish one in Tesco for £70 now.</p>

<p>BluRay? Why?</p>
<p>So it can be the worst BluRay player on the market? So it can segment the user base? So it can wear down your drive?</p>
<p>You can get BD players that support various streaming apps, wireless-N, silent and 1GB+ of ram for less then $100 these days.</p>

<p>Why would you need all of that in a BluRay player....any you might as well give up on any xbox having a BluRay player built in.</p>

<p>At OP: as mentioned you can...I always thought you could trade anything in, but you might get ripped off in doing so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>

    <title>Why does File History constantly lose my credentials&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travis.illig  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does File History constantly lose my credentials&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have File History set up on my Windows 8 computer. The File History drive is a share on a Windows Home Server on my network. I have my credentials for the account on the WHS saved so I don't have to re-enter them. This works and allows me access to the
 shares on the WHS (including the File History share) without having to re-enter credentials.
</p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have verified that the credentials are stored in the Credential Manager on the Windows 8 computer.<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>About once a day I get an Action Center message on my Windows 8 computer telling me my credentials for running File History were invalid and I need to re-enter them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I open up File History and just force a "Run Now" (without re-entering any credentials) it succeeds and the Action Center message goes away.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The credentials are obviously valid (since it connects) and they're remembered (since I never actually have to re-enter anything) - how come it keeps telling me my credentials need to be re-entered?</div>
</div>
<p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE July 1, 2015:</strong> I still have this problem. Even if I use the WHS administrator account as the credentials on the WHS for backing up file history, it still forgets my credentials. I can still fix it by just clicking "Run Now" without
 re-entering credentials. It was annoying me enough with no solution that I searched again today to see if someone had figured this out and... came upon my own post from three years ago, still with no answer.</p>

            This also happens for me. &nbsp;I have a Windows 8 Pro laptop using a Synology NAS for File History. &nbsp;I enter my credentials, everything works fine until the next day when the action center prompts me to re-enter my network credentials.
<div><br />
<div>I've checked the Credential Manager and the credentials are stored there. &nbsp;However, unlike travis, if I click "Run Now" without re-entering the credentials it does not run.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When I re-enter the credentials it runs as normal, until the next day. &nbsp;This is incredibly annoying behaviour.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any help would be appreciated.</div>

<p>
</p><p>To add to this, my server had the share permissions set up properly, but I also had to set the security permissions of the folder on the server to allow as well.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade melted my Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to upgrade my Samsung laptop to Windows 10 from 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GWX didnt activate and while searching the site as to why despite it telling me my Laptop was all good to go. I cam across a media creation tool which I used to update . It failed on stage 3 at 83% and reverted back to 8.1 after two days without issue.
 The computer continued to work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted the on-line support who told me it should be fine, took control on my PC and edited the registry (changed a 0 to a 1) to activate the GWX update after being told to disable the UEFI secure boot. I tried again as instructed. It failed again, same
 place. It had some trouble restoring this time and I had to boot the bios, didnt change anything just saved and exited and it booted fine without further issue. Though by this point Id realised there was something very wrong with my Laptop's windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted support again, who ran a /scannow which found several corrupted files. She then downloaded and a new media creation tool despite my protests something was wrong with the laptop, ensuring me this would work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It failed, again, same place. This time it took me 30 mins to recover it to windows 8.1 as it just kept looping the boot, without even giving me the option of the bios. Contacted support again, who messed with some stuff and told me to reboot. I did. It
 not longer works at all. I was refered to phone tech support who informed me they cant help because of how far gone it is and passed me to Samsung, who informed me the OME partition was corrupted and I would have to pay for it to be sent off and repaired (as
 well as the fact they dont recommend upgrading their laptops to Win10, something which apparently windows knows).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say Im pissed. Im not sure I want help as such, this is more a complaint. 3 successive support techs updated my laptop into oblivion, now it stuck somewhere between 8.1 and 10 and it just wont work and Im going to have to pay for it.</p>

            I wish it were that simple, but I bought this laptop after they stopped handing out CD Keys and disks and it came pre-installed with Windows 8. So I would either need to buy a retail version of something I already own to get a key or Id need an OME version.
 Hence why Samsung want to charge me.

<h2>            Green flashing pixels on the screen.</h2>
                    Hello. I am here because of my screen. I am only 10 and not a huge genius about computers, but I recently just fixed one. Anyway, I am here because of green flashing pixels on my screen. They are not dead pixels because they move, and they won't go away.
 When I Google the situation it says a different answer every time on says get a new cable another a new monitor and one even said you can't fix it. I would love it if a expert on computers would answer this not someone is just trying to sound smart. I should
 mention I am using the VGA channel on my monitor/TV. (My monitor is a crappy TV because I haven't bought a monitor yet)

            <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As this issue occurred after upgrading to Windows 8.1, you need to ensure that all pending Windows Updates are installed and all device drivers are update accordingly. You can update the device driver from the Device Manager and you may also access
 the computer manufacturer website to check for latest updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further, if the issue persists even after updating the display driver from the Device Manager, then you may download the latest driver from the computer manufacturer’s website and save it on the desktop. Once this is done, uninstall the existing driver
 and install the latest driver to check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If there are no Windows 8.1 compatible drivers available then you may install the driver in Windows 8 compatibility mode to check if this helps.</span></p>

    <title>A Disgruntled Xbox Customer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acetres  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Disgruntled Xbox Customer</h2>
                    
<p>I'm posting this in this forum at the recommendation of another user (I initially posted in general discussion).</p>
<p>TL;DR version: Xbox One with continually disconnecting controllers, not eligible for the free game, misinformed by Support to send system AND accessories in, now waiting two more weeks before I get a functioning One with all accessories.</p>
<p>This is the first time I've ever posted on the forums, and admittedly, this is the first negative experience I've ever had with Xbox or Microsoft. To add some perspective, I've been a loyal Xbox customer since the original Xbox and the days of Halo. I've
 always loved the system and my experiences, which prompted me to get a 360, and then to get a One. All this to say, I love the brand, I love the system, but I've found myself disillusioned with my recent experiences with the Xbox One.</p>
<p>I preordered on the day that the Xbox One was announced through a local retailer. I picked my Xbox One up at midnight on the 22nd and immediately set it up for use. However, it soon became apparent that there was a problem with my One. My controller would
 continually and randomly disconnect from the One, only to reconnect a few seconds later. This made it&nbsp;essentially impossible to play through anything.&nbsp;Thinking it was just a glitch, I began to do some research. I ran through every technical support solution
 I could find online. I tried disconnecting everything electronic in my house, putting my system in multiple locations in the house with multiple line of sights, tried with and without the Kinect on, et cetera, et cetera. No matter what, the controller kept
 disconnecting. I even went and got a new controller from a different retailer, used different batteries, all with no success.</p>
<p>I contacted&nbsp;Customer Support on Sunday to discuss the issue, and after 2 hours on the phone, it was determined that I would need to send my console in for replacement. The representative I spoke with walked me through many of the solutions I'd already tried,
 including additional solutions like unplugging&nbsp;the system,&nbsp;hard restarting it, clearing caches,&nbsp;starting it in stand by, et cetera.&nbsp;The woman I spoke to was incredibly nice, and she ended up patching me through to her supervisor who gave me three months of
 Xbox Live for my patience (apparently there were a lot of rude callers that day). But, here is where the problems were further compounded. The woman I spoke with told me to send EVERYTHING back in a box, not just the system. And so I did. I went to FedEx on
 Monday, paid $12 to pack up my system, and sent it back in. I was told a timeline of 1-2 weeks to have everything returned, as I chose the option of sending my system in first and then getting a replacement (I did not want a 500 dollar hold on my credit card).</p>
<p>Shortly after, I learned via multiple sources that Xbox was going to be giving people a free game if they had issues with their Xbox One. The article specifically referred to the disk drive issue that many users were having, but the article made it clear
 that the reason for the free game was to make things right for those who had a defective system. I thought this was a great idea, and kudos to Microsoft for treating their customers right. I assumed (yes, my fault) that other people with issues would also
 be eligible, but being a very through individual, I decided to contact Support via Twitter to confirm. After I would estimate about 50 attempts to get an answer, I was still unable to get a confirmation. It wasn't until I read another online article that I
 learned that Microsoft was only giving the free game to disk drive error individuals.</p>
<p>I'll confess, this was pretty frustrating. Admittedly, I know that Microsoft didn't need to comp anyone. They could have just fixed the system for everyone and said sorry. but it felt like a real slap in the face that only some people would get a free game.
 I mean, just because I did not have the disk drive error, am I no less sitting with a defective and unplayable Xbox One? And to further compound the issue, Microsoft still hasn't released anything (that I can find) about the particular error I experienced
 with my controller disconnecting. After reading the forums, I know that I'm not the only one with this problem, as I've read&nbsp;many many other posts where people have the same problem, but no information has been released other than to send your console in for
 a fix. So, I guess&nbsp;maybe because this wasn't as big an error as the drive issue, it can be given less attention?</p>
<p>Well, after waiting two weeks. I was very excited to see my replacement One had been shipped out and was ready to be picked up on Friday. I went to FedEx, picked it up, opened the box, and guess what was inside? Just a system. No accessories, no cords, nothing
 else. Aside from a note that read, "You may have been told to send both your system AND accessories back. Only send your system." Too late to tell me that now. So, now I have an Xbox One (which as I've not used it yet, I can't even confirm if its a working
 system), but no way to use it.</p>
<p>So I contacted support again. Another hour phone call later, I was told by a gentleman (again, a nice phone rep) that there was misinformation given to me when I was told to send ALL my stuff to Xbox, and that they were sorry, but I would have to wait another
 2 weeks to get all my accessories sent back to me. needless to say, I am starting to get pretty frustrated at this point in time. Now, I work in a call center myself, so I'm smart enough and level headed enough to know that this is not the fault of the gentleman
 I'm speaking with at support. He's doing his job, he didn't misinform me like the first lady, he didn't make the original busted Xbox One. It's not his fault, and I tell him that. But I also tell him that I'm starting to get pretty disgruntled with this entire
 situation. I explain my frustration that I'm looking at not being able to play my Xbox One until a month after I original got it (and I'm still out the 500 plus two games), that I wasn't eligible for the free game, and that now because of someone else's mistake
 I'm left in limbo. The representative commiserated, but said there was nothing that could be done, and that they would not be able to give me any compensation.</p>
<p>So here I am, typing this post, pretty frustrated with Xbox at this point. I can be understanding that there are hiccups anytime a new product is released. I can understand that I was one of the very very few people who appear to have received a defective
 console. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>But I can't understand being told that my defective Xbox One is not as worthy of compensation as someone with a different defect, or that no one from Microsoft has commented on this technical issue which
 appears to be affecting a growing group of users,&nbsp;or that because someone misinformed me that I'm out a further 2 weeks without my One.</strong></span></p>
<p>Why am I posting this? I don't expect for this to get me my Xbox One any faster, or for it to cause Microsoft to comp me anything. If nothing else, I needed to get some of this frustration off my chest, and hopefully to bring some light onto this particular

<p>Your slightly misinformed about the free game. You only get it if you have disk drive problems and can put up $500 extra for advanced shipping. They say you get it back when the switch is complete but me personally I don't have that kind of money after I
 just bought a $500 X1 and another $200+ in games and accessories. So I don't qualify for the free game either even though my disk drive was broken before I even opened the box. They need to rename this console the "XBrick-None"</p>

<p>I know how you feel. When my Halo 3 edition got the RRoD (only system out of all four of my 360's to get it), I was told to send just the console in and was specifically told to remove the hard drive which I did. Three weeks later my console was back &nbsp;except
 the usb slot on the face plate was damaged. &nbsp;When I called to inquire about this I was than told I was supposed to have removed the face plate before shipping it and that there was nothing they could do since it was my error. (I honestly didn't even know the
 face plate came off prior to speaking with them.) Long story short, you just have to be persistent and ask to speak to a supervisor. &nbsp;Make sure you get their name so that if you get disconnected or have to call back, you can request to speak with them instead
 of speaking to someone else and going through the initial steps all over again and don't be afraid to ask the supervisor to place a complaint.</p>

<p>@FAA BLAZNBUDZ Thanks for the clarification. That makes sense. Someone else on another forum explained it to me, and I get that now. It was never explained to me like that by anyone from Microsoft, which is a shame, because your answer makes sense. I too
 didn't want to front another $500 after all the cash I dropped on the system, so I didn't do the advance ship.</p>

<p>12/12 Update: Still don't have all of my stuff back from Xbox yet. Which is to be expected since I was given a 2 week timeline. So I'm not upset that I don't have everything.</p>
<p>But here's my concern. There appears to be very little communication behind the scenes at tech support. I chatted Support yesterday (12/11) just to see if there was any status update on my account. Again, I'm within the 2 week window, so I wasn't expecting
 anything. However, since I no longer have an open Service Order, I can't track anything online through MyService on the Xbox site. The support representative told me that there was no update on the account. So, as far as they could see (or communicated), nothing
 had been sent, etc. I get home from work yesterday, and there's a package on my doorstep from Xbox. I thought "Cool!", maybe they got it back to me early. Sadly, all that was inside was a Kinect.</p>
<p>So, I now have a console and a Kinect, but no controller, cords, etc. Adding to the confusion, the Kinect they sent me isn't even my original Kinect (the serial numbers aren't the same). So, when Xbox Support told me they would be sending me all my stuff
 back, that either wasn't true or not the whole truth. Because I was overnighted a replacement Kinect that wasn't my original, and still don't have anything back.</p>
<p>Like I said, my biggest concern at this point isn't compensation, or even to rush the timeline I was given. I'm just trying to understand what is ACTUALLY happening. Am I getting all of my original stuff back? If so, why did I get a brand new Kinect? If
 they sent me a brand new Kinect, why couldn't they have sent me ALL of the needed accessories I'm missing? Nothing is adding up, and unfortunately, it doesn't look like anyone can answer my questions or give me a complete answer.</p>

<h2>            ACLUI.dll error - Regedit.exe bad image</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I started a thread regarding a problem I have with saving MS Office documents. One of the MVPs directed me to edit the registry key and this is when I discovered another problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't open regedit (in any way) and an error message comes up saying "Regedit.exe - Bad Image. C:\Windows\system32\ACLUI.dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error". The MS Office problem started on Monday and I scanned my computer
 with Malwarebytes and it found no infected files. Please help :(&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
You don't mean " mouse " pad. You mean "<strong> touchpad</strong> ". Yes ?<br />
If it is touchpad you meant, try this ......</p>
<p>Right click on open sapce of desktop &gt; click Mouse Pointers &gt; here I cannot give you the exact step by step becuse if you don't have a Dell computer, you don't have the options mine has.<br />
But, in any event, find the button that will take you to&nbsp;<strong>touchpad settings</strong> where you can make adjustments&nbsp;. You can actually disable it.<br />
If you do have a Dell, post back</p>

            Well Microsoft must still be working on the Windows 10 store app (and other apps) because it's now Sept 29 and I still see no solution to the problem.&nbsp; Please just give us a simple fix that doesn't require we have 30 years experience as a software engineer...

<h2>            High Contrast themes on Windows 7 overwrites css styles in firefox and IE&#33;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>How can I continue to use the high-contrast styles in Windows 7 and not have it interfere with Firefox (3.6.3) and IE 8 (64-bit and 32-bit) browsers. Chrome displays the web pages as the web designers coded them.</p>
<p>Any and all colors and images defined in the css (style sheets, page level and embedded styles) are removed or replaced with the high-contrast theme settings. Images&nbsp;embedded&nbsp;on the web pages display (but most of my front-end work consists of css background
 images).</p>
<p>I am a web developer who codes in a dark cave-like office. I don't want the too-bright aero theme and I do not want, nor need, Micro$oft to dictate how my applications should work (and render CSS!) based on display settings nor how I should do my work (i.e.,
 in a bright environment).</p>
<p>What is the solution besides losing the Windows look and feel that a) is power saving (the monitors consume less energy displaying dark backgrounds over white) and b) easier on my eyes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Drew,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>High Contrast themes are basically intended to increase legibility</span><span>by
 heightening screen contrast with alternative color combinations. To a certain extend this can help in saving power and at the same time improve the performance of the computer. Aero themes consume more memory as compared to the basic or high contrast themes.
 This can slow down the computer performance if the theme consumes more than the allowed memory. In such case, you can choose the basic theme or the high-contrast theme to improve its performance.</span></p>

<h3> d.kent  say:</h3>
<h2>            DirectAccess and Outlook 2013</h2>
                    I have a Windows 2012 R2 server configured to use DirectAccess.&nbsp; Windows 8.1 Enterprise clients are able to connect to the corporate network and access file/print services.&nbsp; Outlook 2013 to an Exchange 2013 server, however, is a hit or miss proposition.&nbsp;
 If we do a fresh install of Office, Outlook works as expected.&nbsp; When we start installing Office updates from Windows Update, Outlook is no longer able to connect.&nbsp; If we delete the profile and recreate it, Outlook will successfully recreate the profile but
 when Outlook launches, it will not complete the connection.&nbsp; What could be preventing Outlook from establishing the connection over DirectAccess?

<h2>            Mouse Pointer lags or freezes when trying to move</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: the mouse is lagged behind when i move it</p>
<p>Hi<br />
<br />
I just reinstalled Windows Vista Home Premium on my Acer laptop, now I have problems with the mouse cursor, it lags behind or leaps when I move the mouse, like it freezes for a 1/10 second before it moves, (both with the touchpad and my logitech mouse). This
 is very frustrating. I have tried reinstalling the drivers in the "manage devices", I have tried different mouses, different USB-ports, but the problem remains unsolved. Moreover, from what I can tell from my performance monitor neither the CPU nor RAM are
 working at high capacity. Any ideas? Maybe some **** I need to do in regedit?? Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi AndyGriffin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the model number of laptop and Logitech mouse?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to update touchpad, chipset and display drivers then check if that works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to uninstall and reinstall the touchpad drivers and check the status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>start</b> and type
<b>devmgmt.msc </b>in the start search box and press <b>enter</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand <b>Mice</b> and other pointing devices
</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><b>Right click</b> on the
<b>touchpad</b> <b>driver</b> and choose <b>uninstall</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Reinstall the drivers from the manufacturer’s website</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Check if it works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue could be driver-related and updating the same may help in fixing the issue. Visit the laptop manufacturer’s website and download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible
 touchpad &amp; display drivers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on updating drivers, refer the following article:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Update drivers: recommended links</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Update-drivers-recommended-links</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back with the make and model number of the laptop and mouse do that we’ll provide you with the manufacturer specific download link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

    <title>Intermittent Stuttering of All Applications and processes in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> prosenjitmitra  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent Stuttering of All Applications and processes in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have been facing this issue for the past couple of days where in the system seems to slow down for a second or so and then resumes back normal speed. As far as i have noticed this affects the overall speed of the system. If the stutter happens while I
 am typing then the system appears frozen with the cursor not blinking and nothing getting typed on the screen. When the stutter stops the letters that I have typed during the stutter suddenly gets displayed. The stutter happens approximately ever five minutes
 or so. And the effect is visible in any running application. If a media player is running then the video freezes and the audio gets stretched. If playing a game then the video becomes very choppy and the sound matches the video. The mouse pointer movement
 slows down during the stutter and resumes normal movement speed after the stutter stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried monitoring the stutter's relation to any app in particular by noticing the running processes. During the stutters the process monitor also refreshes and what I have noticed is CPU and Memory usage climbs up to 90%, then falls back to usual values
 of 4-7% and 30% respectively. And i think the windows explorer process is the one that hogs the memory and CPU during the stutters. I have a full version anti virus up to date virus definitions and windows update is also enabled. Multiple virus scans have
 been performed with no identified infestation.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Core i5 7th Gen</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
