            Hi. I'm sorry to hear that you're having problems, but I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />Here are some steps I would take to try to resolve the issue:
<br />
<br />1) Connect the speakers.
<br />
<br />2) Right click the volume icon.
<br />
<br />3) Select "Playback Devices".
<br />
<br />4) Verify that the speakers are set as the default device.       
        </p>

            No, the logitech&nbsp;speakers are not listed, the only ones are the real tech that are on the computer.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            I also deleted the real tech speakers as my default, so I have no speakers, just the Logitech&nbsp;I have plugged into the computer that aren't&nbsp;working.

            First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

            Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble logging into Xbox Live from your Windows 10 PC. In order to use Xbox Live properly on Windows 10&nbsp;you need to be signed into the Microsoft Account as
 you're Windows profile before trying to sign in at the Xbox App or to use Xbox features. Are you signed into a different log in profile to the PC before trying to log onto Xbox Live? Let us know with a reply to determine how to best assist you.

<p>Hi Glenn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sounds like a driver issue. In order for me to isolate the sound problem on your device, I'd like to ask a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Which Windows build and version are you currently using? To check, click <strong>
Start</strong>, type <strong>WINVER</strong>, and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>What is the make and model of your device?</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Have you made any recent changes to your computer like installing updates?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you may check this article on how to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Fix Sound Problems">
<strong>fix sound problems</strong></a> and check if you've already attempted all the steps listed in it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'd like to ask for the Hardware Ids of the sound driver. To check the Hardware Ids, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>, right-click the audio device listed and select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Details</strong> tab, click <strong>Device description</strong> and select
<strong>Hardware Ids</strong>.</li><li>Right-click on the list of Ids, select all then copy and paste it into your next reply.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Your response will be highly appreciated.<br />

                    <span>&nbsp;I got a very strange call that they stated they were from Microsoft from Florida? They are in Seattle Washington are they not? Anyways they said I was been
 hacked and was red flagged? &nbsp;and that was scary that Microsoft would call me on a phone? Well they were trying to get into my computer, then I told them Microsoft dose not call anyone? then as he with an accent talking with me and I decided to go to Microsoft
 and check my account and found I had to go through some special security steps and changed my passwords got a new special code to log into my account, So this phone call I believe in my gut was a hacker himself cause I was at Microsoft and said I am at Microsoft
 now what happened to my account? They hung up never called me back, they said they tried to email me? not never received any email from Microsoft at all. Would that be a hacker faking they were from Microsoft? What would you think? Things got weird since I
 bought my new laptop. Why on laptop and not my desktop. Then I never ever received an y type of call from Microsoft. &nbsp;I do have that name and phone number on my ID caller. Did someone from Microsoft really call me to help me? I need help here thank you</span>

<p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>He did change it. Uninstalled McAfee and installed ESET NOD32. He came back today and said the problem was with my keyboard, that the "Fn" key wasn't working and that we need a new keyboard. I've never used the Fn key for anything. All I know is that I had
 Internet access before he came -- just a problem with hooking up with the printer downstairs -- and now we need a new keyboard? Doesn't make any sense to me at all.</p>
<p>This is so frustrating, but what can we do? I'm disabled and my housemate is elderly and one of us is going to trip and fall on the Ethernet cable if we don't get this taken care of.</p>
<p>Anyway, thank you for your assistance. I hope the keyboard clears this up.</p>

<p>This simply seems to be a regular Elite controller with a Gears of War motif. I'm sure it's using the same innards as the current Elite controllers (with no Bluetooth).</p>
<p>It does raise a little confusion since it comes with a GoW-skinned Xbox One S, and this is the type of console that would regularly come with a bluetooth controller.</p>
<p>My money is on <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NO</span></strong></span>, this controller will

<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp; Go to Device Manager by going to start /
 search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click
 on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should<strong>get them from Dell for the&nbsp;wireless adapter at least</strong> any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so
 from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;</span>&gt;<span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>The adapter is inside the laptop.&nbsp; You don't need to do anything with it to install it.&nbsp; Installing the drivers, firmware,
 and/or software for it and your version of Vista from Dell (whatever applies) will "install" it.&nbsp; You then need to go to Start / Control Panel / Network&nbsp;and Sharing&nbsp;Center and configure the adapter with the proper settings and establish the appropriate network
 connections.&nbsp; Some of this will be from settings required by your ISP and perhaps your router or modem (so you may need to contact them if you don't know the settings).</span></span></p>

            <p>Hello Laura,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us updated on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like to inform you that itâs the usual behavior and it would be normal to see No Internet access&nbsp;for the IPv6 connection unless you are using IPV6 On the computer. Your internet service provider does not provide you with ipv6 address thatâs why itâs showing
 you ipv6 no internet access but in future they will provide you with the ipv6 addresses when ipv4 addresses will be exhausted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if you want to troubleshoot refer the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/2fd4ea6a-96b5-4cd8-b6a0-4007f227ebe9">

<p><span>Also, if you connect to the Internet by using a router, there may be a problem with the configuration settings that requires that the settings

<h2>            Line Input detected, windows&#47;programs dont recognize sound but I hear it.</h2>
                    I've been recording audio all night through my line input on my motherboard (it has really good onboard sound). Under recording devices tab line-in was recognized and had the vu green bars moving showing me it knows there is sound coming in. I also have
 'listen to audio through this device' enabled. however after restarting my pc NO programs OR windows see any input sound. The recording device still shows a line input is plugged in but no sound. If I disable the line input there is still my music playing
 even if I uncheck listen to this device. It's almost acting like a passthrough to the front headphone output. How can I fix this, I changed no settings and only uninstalled an app that had NOTHING to do with audio.

<h2>            Windows 10, Asus Laptop, Explorer Freeze&#47;Crash After Sleep.</h2>
                    <p>I have an Asus S500ca Laptop<br />
Intel i3, 12GB RAM, 250GB SDD<br />
Windows 10 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything works fine, when I take the laptop out of my bag open and log on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until I click the taskbar, or search.<br />
Then Windows locks up completely for 15-60 seconds. (Mouse/Keyboard/Touchscreen)<br />
It often recovers from this or explorer crashes and reopens and can happen repeatedly throughout use.<br />
</p>
<p>Also freezes when I work with large excel files but I imagine that's a different issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs normally open:</p>
<p>Spotify, Firefox, Word, Excel, Visio, Matlab. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked a few things;</p>
<p>In event viewer no errors at the time of freezing, I run CCleaner periodically, I have disabled the PCIexpress power on my power plan (suggested in other forms).<br />
<br />
What could be causing this? How can I stop it?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:&nbsp; </strong>Try to put the computer in a clean boot state and check the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the system works fine in the safe mode, try to clean boot the system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Win10 edition - iPad players can no longer connect to PC game but Xbox users can</h2>
                    <p>Having played Minecraft Win10 Edition with a local map for many months, and just recently iPad users can no longer join our local map/game.&nbsp; Xbox users can join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>iPad users are logged into Xbox Live as normal.</p>
<p>PC user/host can see the iPad users in Minecraft as logged in.</p>
<p>Sending an invite to iPad users from Minecraft seems successful.</p>
<p>iPad users never get the invitation in their Minecraft game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This used to work perfectly in the past with iPad users joining a PC hosted game.</p>
<p>No changes have occurred with Firewall settings, or Antivirus.</p>
<p>Rebooting PC and restarting iPads do not help.</p>
<p>Xbox users can join without any problems.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;JelloBurger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It could be possible that what you experience, maybe more of a connection in between the game and your devices. In order for me to have a better idea, I would like to clarify the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you able to go to the internet using your mobile device, while being connected to your home network?</li><li>Is the issue the same when using other user profiles or when sharing files on your network, between you mobile device and you PC?</li><li>Have you tested other user profiles in game if the issue persists?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that this happens to a specific user on the game, I recommend that you reinstall your Minecraft. However, if you experience this regardless the user on the game, as an initial troubleshooting, you can run the network troubleshooter. You can
 do that by performing the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On your keyboard, press the <strong>Windows button + I</strong> to open the <strong>
Windows Settings</strong> screen.</li><li>Click on <strong>Update &amp; Security.</strong></li><li>On the left pane, click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> to open the list.</li><li>Next, look for <strong>Incoming Connections</strong> on the list and highlight it.</li><li>Once selected, click on the <strong>Run troubleshooter button</strong> and go through the prompts to perform the automatic repair.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If in case that you're using the cloud service of your <strong>Minecraft</strong>, or your
<strong>Xbox account</strong> to be able to use your characters for <strong>Minecraft</strong>, you might want to also refer to this article for further information on
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox service status</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you continue to have this issue even after performing the above steps, please reply to this thread. The system will notify me so I can get back to you and provide you more answers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Are you able to go to the internet using your mobile device, while being connected to your home network?</li></ul>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; All wired, wireless devices connect to the internet without issue.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is the issue the same when using other user profiles or when sharing files on your network, between you mobile device and you PC?</li></ul>
<p>Multiple profiles experience this (4 total).&nbsp; Only occurs with iPad, using Xbox profiles trying to connect to&nbsp;a PC Minecraft game.&nbsp; If these same users/profiles use the Xbox One, they are able to connect to the PC Minecraft Win10 game.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tested other user profiles in game if the issue persists?</li></ul>
<p>Yes, see above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior occurs regardless of user.&nbsp; The only commonality is that the users are on iPads trying to connect to a PC Minecraft Win10 game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping me posted of the results. Just to clarify, have your checked all versions of the game installed on all devices, if are they the same? Because all devices should have the same versions as much as possible. Games that are running of different
 versions,&nbsp;can cause games to sometimes not detect one another. At this point, I would recommend to ensure that all versions across devices are the same. If not, best to roll back the version of the game to it's last version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that you've already ensured that all versions are of the same on each devices and you still experience the issue.&nbsp;Please don't hesitate to keep me posted on this thread, for me to assist you further.</p>

            The discs are all from Memorex and from the same package of 48. I have 10 that did not burn, and 10 that did. &nbsp;Seems to be totally random. &nbsp;The ones that did not burn eject right away, go back in and eject again. &nbsp;Can I do anything with these discs or
 are they no good?

            One thing to check-- when you get the error message:&nbsp; Take the cd out of the drive, close media player (Save the songs you want to play as a playlist so you can easily come back to it), put the disc back in and open up Computer.&nbsp; See if you see the blank
 disc.&nbsp; If you do, double click on it and see if it prompts you on how you want to use the disc.&nbsp; Click the X at this point and try media player again.<br />

<p>Hi Robin -</p>
<p>a couple of other points - first, you refer to the error message 'Cannot <strong>
RIP</strong> one or more tracks...' when you are trying to perform a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
burning</span> task... this suggests wmp has read something already&nbsp;on the disc.</p>
<p>secondly - it has been assumed that you are trying to burn <strong>audio</strong> - but you have not stated this as the objective... is that the case?</p>
<p>I suspect this is most likely due to WMP's lack of consistency when it comes to burning - but there is also a bit of clarification needed - you'll need to check the disc properties as Allen mentioned - particularly if these are from a disc stack (cake) -
 as blank and used may have got mixed up. Set aside any discs that show as 'full' because they will no longer work.</p>
<p>Cheers, Ric.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Incompatible Program Detected after Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Incompatible Program Detected after Windows Update</h2>
                    I was running Windows 10 and Final Draft 10 successfully then my computer did an automatic Microsoft update. Suddenly, when I went to run Final Draft 10 there is an error scanning bar then an error window that reads that Windows is trying to find a solution
 to the problem. So I ran the &nbsp;Program Compatibility Troubleshooter and the result was that an incompatible program was detected. Again, the Final Draft program ran without problems before the Windows update. Now, I click on the Final Draft icon both on my
 taskbar and from the startup menu and nothing happens.

    <title>The Invasive &#39;Autoscroll&#39; feature. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daryl bwest  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Invasive &#39;Autoscroll&#39; feature.</h2>
                    <p>I have noted that this issue is not just peculiar to me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Auto-scrolling. &nbsp;That horrible little wheel that pops up when one goes online (...it does not appear when offline in Win 7 explorer...). &nbsp;I log online, via Google Chrome. &nbsp;Go to a regular site... say ebay, or facebook, or even a new site via some link and
 this nasty wheel takes over control of my mouse and then proceeds to madly scroll the page, out of control in whichever direction I am moving the mouse (optically). &nbsp;If that weren't bad enough, it often then opens up tabs... &nbsp;Sometimes hundreds of them at
 the top of the browser... &nbsp;At first I don't generally notice this until the browser starts slowing down.... &nbsp;I look up at the top of the header bar and see loads of tabs open and some still opening and loading.... &nbsp;**** is this stupid idea. &nbsp;Who thought of
 it? &nbsp;What purpose does it serve?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has become so frustrating that it completely destroys my enjoyment and efficiency online, I spend more time trying to gain control of the page, than I do reading or using it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked on forums and others have the same issue, but advice points to - control panel - mouse - uncheck auto scroll.... &nbsp; But my mouse properties (Win 7) does not have this option. &nbsp; Also I see plenty of advice for laptops, checking the properties of
 the touchpad... &nbsp;But I am just using a standard desktop, with a wireless mouse... &nbsp;I've tried using apps such as, X-mouse... &nbsp;Which did work, until I did a pc 'house clean'... &nbsp;But now, I cannot even get that to work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is singularly the most annoying feature I have ever encountered... &nbsp;It literally gives me headaches, it is time wasting and very frustrating. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE would someone help me get rid of this feature... &nbsp;There surely has to be a way to disable it... &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Daryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per description, Auto scrolling gets enabled when you go online.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Have you checked this mouse on any other system?</span></li><li><span>Have you tried to use any other mouse on the system having issues?</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the methods given below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Try to login into Safe Mode with networking.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.

            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for that advice and various methods to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It had occurred to me to try a separate mouse, but after consideration, this mouse has been working fine on this system and the previous, for several years now. &nbsp;Strange thing is, apparently the 'auto-scroll' feature has been around for a while, but yet
 I only started noticing this issue over the past year or so. &nbsp;At first I thought it was a Chrome app/addition/update causing this, but obviously after trawling for answers I now realise that it is a Win 7 app. &nbsp; I don't have another system up and running now,
 but the last system I used, worked fine with the same mouse. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The third-party 'X-mouse' app did solve this problem, albeit with a heavy learning curve, as that app was developed with script developers and gamer's in mind. &nbsp;But when 'cleaning house' whatever X-mouse does, gets removed by the cleaning software (IObit).(...with
 help from the developer, I am advised that - the issue centers around the 'middle button' and with that app the 'middle button' - which my mouse does not have - should be disabled, this does work, albeit a fiddly procedure...).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I did persevere with X-mouse (...although still unsure exactly what I was doing..) and I was online last night and noted, after a while that the 'auto-scroll' issue had gone. &nbsp;Everything was back to normal, with me being back in control of the mouse.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That in itself was frustrating, because of the complexity of the X-mouse app, I had no way of knowing exactly what config of the app had finally sorted out the problem. &nbsp;IE, that I fiddled with all sorts of parameters of the app.... &nbsp;Obviously something
 I did, solved it... &nbsp;albeit with a delay in noticing the change. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that the mouse/disabled auto-scroll is now behaving itself, I am reluctant to do any tweaking until the issue arises again (...no doubt after the next 'house clean'). &nbsp;When it does, then I will follow your methodical procedures, esp 'clean booting'
 &nbsp;to ascertain the likely cause, so that I can better understand the issue in future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I don't understand, as do many others with this issue, is why the developer of this frankly silly 'widget' did not think to include a 'disable' function in 'control panel/mouse settings'. &nbsp;It was just (arrogantly) assumed that we'd all love this app....
 Which clearly most of us<em> don't</em>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a common and growing trend amongst developers of software, especially those responsible for developing the scripts for Facebook or Chrome, who make sweeping changes, without informing the end user, or even bothering to undertake a consensus/referendum
 of opinion from the end users. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A case in point, is the recent 'tweaking' of the Facebook script by its developers, which has resulted in throwing certain apps like 'Social Fixer' off kilter, in effect breaking the excellent customising features of that app, to such an extent that people
 are really annoyed. &nbsp;Not to mention giving the developer of that app a headache in attempting to construct a work around. It is like some kind of battle going on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some software developers put these tweaks in an 'update' with a breakdown of the changes (..common with Third Party programs such as IObit, Avast and various game patches), this at least gives one the option of downloading or even setting a restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am of the firm belief - ''.... If it ain't broke, don't mess with it...'' &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
.</p>
<p>Anyway,&nbsp;I <em>am </em>very grateful for <em>your</em> assistance on this matter, which hopefully (after the next auto-scroll 'attack'...) will prove helpful. &nbsp;I will keep you posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, as it happens, the issue did return, of its own accord approximately five hour so hours after having sent you that last detailed message.... &nbsp;Only this time, I had not activated any cleaning programs, in fact I had merely been working online all the
 time. &nbsp;So I kind of feel that maybe it is not even related to the cleaning program. &nbsp; The X-mouse profile running had stopped. &nbsp;I spent the last hour or so, interrogating the windows event manager... &nbsp;But could not really determine any cause or likely culprit
 other than X-mouse had definitely crashed, for there was a 'crash log' shown. &nbsp; It was late, I was tired and thus not inclined to go through those procedures of yours at that time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did note that the profile name in X-mouse had turned red in colour, something I had not noted before. &nbsp;The developer had sent me an 'instant fix' download (...which really was just a profile, not really any different from manually inputting the parameters
 myself.... I think he did this because he felt I might not have been inputting or checking the right parameters....). &nbsp; This I activated, three times. At first no change, then the 'issue' resolved and I was back to proper mouse control. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course now, I am being doubly observant as to what gets activated by me, or anything automatic. &nbsp;I have just flashed up the pc for the first time today and everything is normal... &nbsp;No issue.... So far... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is comforting to know that you are 'watching my six' on this. &nbsp;I have started a log. &nbsp;As soon as I have enough details I will contact you with an update. &nbsp;Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Daryl</p>

            <p>Hello Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update on the 'Invasive Autoscroll'</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of this time, the occurrences of this issue have reduced considerably. &nbsp;The issue has cropped up one or two times, so I'm not convinced that I have totally solved the problem. &nbsp;However, by removing the 'Avast' anti-virus program from my computer, this
 appears to have certainly reduced the regular occurrences of this annoying feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it still would be better if someone actually put some effort into designing a 'disable option', or better still remove it altogether. &nbsp;It serves no useful purpose and if there are some people who feel they must have this feature, which as far as I know
 exists nowhere else, then it should be designed to be optional. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, as it stands, things are behaving themselves for now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>This 'autoscroll' issue is now seriously impacting upon my use of the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am becoming extremely angry about this issue.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want SOMEONE to explain to me WHY this is happening, WHERE does the horrible program reside and HOW TO REMOVE IT ENTIRELY. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is so intermittent, the X-mouse (XMBC) program seems to disable it, but it keeps returning without any warning and without me running anything.... &nbsp;Then any fiddling with the XMBC program results in no change.... &nbsp;I can't even work out what I'm doing,
 if anything on this XMBC prog that may or may not solve the issue, however temporary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot believe that no one knows how to combat this horrible gremlin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,&nbsp;</p>

 Internet services?&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not get <strong>Tabs </strong>being opened up automatically when I was looking. There you have a difference. You suggest the mouse driver as being the problem input. I have programmable mouse driver too.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But if <strong>Browser Tabs</strong> are being opened up automatically, at top of window, when you
<em>mouse pointer</em> in mid screen, then how can it be the <em>mouse pointer</em> that is opening the
<strong>Tabs</strong>, while you are not looking?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If <em>mouse driver</em> was the source of problem, then why UI behavior inconsistent while you use the mouse peripheral on desktop outside of application browser?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are the <em>mouse </em>and <em>keyboard shortcut</em> settings <em>on the browser</em>? Does the
<em>browser</em>&nbsp;<em>options menu</em>&nbsp;or <em>settings </em>allow the user to enable/disable
<em>mouse gestures</em> and <em>keyboard shortcuts</em>? (I'm not familiar with the browser you use, maybe you can find out.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Presently, I don't know what is the solution or remedy to this problem. These are some questions I can share.</p>

            <p>Hello Douglas Nigel B,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you may have read in my numerous rants on this subject, I am using the XMBC mouse software to assert command over the mouse. &nbsp;This it does for the most part, but like all programs that we use on our pc's, they are prone from perturbations from outside
 (web based) sources....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something was knocking XMBC's configs out. &nbsp;Which resulted in this somewhat intermittent invasion of the dreaded 'auto-scroll' feature. &nbsp;Which incidentally, is apparently only peculiar to Win7 and the Chrome browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue only happens online. &nbsp;Never off. &nbsp;With that in mind and following advice from Ashish here, on the last occasion that this occurred, which was yesterday, I re-booted the pc in 'safe mode with networking'... &nbsp;The problem persisted. &nbsp;This indicates
 that the onboard drivers were not at fault here. &nbsp;Which I suspected. &nbsp;I had this hunch, that Chrome was responsible for this. &nbsp;In fact it was the Chrome forum I turned to initially for support. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that done, I restarted the pc as per normal. &nbsp;And decided to go through all the extensions in the Chrome browser... &nbsp;I think that I may have resolved it.... &nbsp;lol, too early to tell for sure... &nbsp;But the issue did go away, after I disabled all but the
 most important extension apps.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a particularly hard issue to pin down, because it is so intermittent, I have no way of determining exactly what causes it to come and go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no mouse settings in Chrome. &nbsp;But XMBC is designed to give global control if need be over everything on the pc, including browsers when open. &nbsp;It can be configured with many 'layers' although mine is now just set to 'global default'. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the issue occurs, the normal mouse pointer turns into the 'wheel pointer' (...looks like a cassette tape hub), then when moved, either up or down (...though sometimes it only occurs in the 'up' direction) the wheel turns into a dot with an arrow, which
 turns in orientation, to whatever one does with the mouse.... &nbsp;This is controlled by the mouse optics... &nbsp;After the left button is depressed when clicking normally. &nbsp;Then the page scrolls according to the speed of movement and direction of the mouse. &nbsp; This
 can cause the page to scroll erratically and out of control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tab opening issue, by far the most annoying aspect of this issue, happens when the mouse is hovering over certain parts of the page, for example - On Facebook, if one scrolls/hovers down the notifications pane, then all the feeds on that pane start opening,
 of their own accord - no clicking of the mouse... &nbsp;You just hover over them and they open up... &nbsp;Sometimes many of them, if one does not notice at first.... &nbsp;The most I've counted is about forty !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that I've now solved it... &nbsp;But watch this space.....lol</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps you and others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Printing landscape and portrait photos on contact sheet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miranda rix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Printing landscape and portrait photos on contact sheet</h2>
                    Why can't I print a contact sheet of portrait and landscape photos all with the correct orientation? &nbsp;All photos print landscape regardless. &nbsp;This is not a problem with Win XP. &nbsp;Could this be a printer driver issue or does Win 7 not have this feature?

<p>Hi, thanks for your response. &nbsp;In answer to your questions:-</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Since when are you facing this issue?</i></p>
<p>This has always been an issue since installing printer on brand new Win 7 PC. &nbsp;It was not an issue on previous XP PC, nor on another XP PC on the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any software/hardware changes on your computer?</i></p>
<p>No, other than installing different drivers in an attempt to resolve the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i><span><span>Â·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>What is the make and model number of the printer?</i></p>
<p>HP Color LaserJet 2605dn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>I would suggest you to refer the following article and check if it helps.</i></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/printer-problems-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/help/printer-problems-in-windows</i></a></p>
<p><span>Thanks, but this did not help. &nbsp;I went through the suggested procedure after which I received the following message: "You have successfully completed the Add Printer Driver Wizard. &nbsp;You are about to add the following drivers: HP Color LaserJet 2605/2605dn/2605dtn
 PS, X64, Type 3 - User Mode. &nbsp;To close this wizard, click Finish." &nbsp;After successfully printing a Test Page, if I then try and look at the printer properties I get the following message: "The HP Color LaserJet&nbsp;</span>2605/2605dn/2605dtn PS&nbsp;printer driver is
 not installed on this computer. &nbsp;Some printer properties will not be accessible unless you install the printer driver. &nbsp;Do you want to install the driver now?". &nbsp;If I click on "Yes" and follow the wizard it appears to successfully install but still the same
 issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><i>I would also suggest you to update the printer driver from the manufacturerâs website and check if it helps.</i></p>
<p>I have installed the following 3 drivers:-</p>
<ol>
<li>HP Universal Print Driver PCL6</li><li>HP Universal Print Driver PS</li><li>HP Color LaserJet 2605/2605dn/2605dtn PS</li></ol>
<div>No 1 works the best as the other two default to Letter rather than A4 when printing photos (this only applies to photos and always defaults to A4 for other types of printing). &nbsp;However, the inability to print portrait photos on a contact sheet with correct
 orientation is common to all 3 drivers. &nbsp;I can't seem to find a "Full Solution" driver on the HP website.&nbsp;</div>
