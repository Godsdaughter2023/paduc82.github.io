<h2>            Was anyone able to get a Canon LiDE220 to work on a pre-installed Windows 10 laptop&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Laptop is going, scanner is dead. &nbsp;Therefore, purchased a Dell laptop with the latest Windows (10) and also plan on purchasing the LiDE 220 scanner to go with it. &nbsp;However I am finding
<em>many</em> reviews on <em>various</em> scanners that people are having issues with ANY scanner working on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a fix? &nbsp;(Specifically for the Canon LiDE 220 scanner)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am considering having to downgrade (is this even possible on a pre-installed system?) to an earlier Windows (8, 8.1 or 7) to have this scanner work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any feedback...</p>

<h2>            Controller disconnecting from PC</h2>
                    So over the last week my Official Xbox Wireless controller has been disconnecting via usb cable when gaming on my Windows 10 PC, at first I thought it was the USB cable so replaced the cable and issue persisted, so this morning I replaced with yet another
 new official Controller and issue still persists. (tried different usb ports on my PC and issue is still there (also have tried mouse &amp; keyboard in the same slots and had no issues) anyone have any solutions as I'm out of ideas and patience at this poin. (yes
 I can use bluetooth but that gives me button delay which is a massive hindrance on games I play. Thanks :)

    <title>Image Backup Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rodneyclayton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Image Backup Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I must start by saying I 'm a complete technophobe so I'm sure I'm going to ask stupid and naive questions.</p>
<p>I want added security by creating an image backup.&nbsp; After research I thought I understood the process and got as far as formatting a NTFS USB stick.&nbsp; The I got messages in "where do you you want to save the backup?" like "drive is not a valid backup" and
 other problems.&nbsp; Solving these is light years beyond my understanding and capability.&nbsp; My questions is, why can't I A) back up "C" drive to, say, documents, and then copy this (and regular updates) to a USB stick. Won't this be enough for an emergency recovery?,
 or, B) just backup the system image to "C" drive then copy this to a USB stick? This sounds too simple so I'm sure it's naive.</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation of any help (which must be in really simple language and in words of a maximum of one syllable!).</p>
<p>Rodney Clayton.</p>

<p>Rodney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is not designed to create system images on USB memory sticks, only on external drives [it can tell the difference even though they both connect using USB].&nbsp;
<em>There is <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/how-to-create-windows-10-system-image-on-a-usb/24e84aff-3916-4661-894b-f140005d3b9e">
a way of jobbing things to trick it into doing so</a> but if you are new to imaging you will probably want to do things the normal way.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.macrium.com/reflectfree.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Macrium Reflect [free]</a> just wants something big enough &amp; does not care if it is a USB stick or an external drive.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I have never tried creating a system image on something that is only just bigger than the drive usage [128GB, 117GB] &amp; I have never noticed any reports by people who have tried with such a narrow margin.&nbsp;
</li><li>So&nbsp;get an external drive that is big enough both for now and for the future [say, not less then 250GB -&nbsp;there&nbsp;are a lot of 500GB external drives going fairly cheaply at the moment].&nbsp; Only you can guess at your future needs.</li></ul>

<p>You're going to need to get over your one syllable limitation, because making and restoring a system image is complicated. It's also extremely important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Terminology: A system image (aka disc image, backup image or simply an 'image') is an exact copy of your hard drive from beginning to end. Another way to say it is that an image is a copy of your entire computer. When you restore an image, your computer
 instantly goes back in time to the moment the original image was made. The image itself is compressed, so it's significantly smaller in size than the size of your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A USB flash drive is a poor choice for storing an image, even if you can physically use one. You want to keep a rotating history of your disk images, and that will quickly overwhelm a flash drive. For instance, you could keep that last 10 images or the last
 week of images. A USB hard drive (also known as a portable drive) is a much better, more robust (meaning it will last longer) and less expensive choice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The very best favor that a computer user can do for themselves is to spend time on the web doing research on what a backup image is, how it works and how to make and restore an image. Then become familiar with the popular image backup programs, read the
 reviews, take advantage of the free trials and finally - get started. Having a recent backup image will save you from 90% of the suffering that people in this forum experience.</p>

<p>Here are some things to look for when you get to thinking about image software:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>the ability to create and save several different types of image backups</li><li>the ability to create incremental and differential images</li><li>the ability to schedule image backups to run automatically - even while you're sleeping</li><li>the ability to maintain a rotation (like I described above)</li><li>the ability to test the integrity of an image, after backing up and at any other time</li><li>a user interface that makes sense to you</li><li>the ability to create recovery media on a USB flash drive or a DVD - which you'll need to restore the image - from WinPE (the Windows Pre-Install Environment)</li><li>a comprehensive knowledgebase</li><li>a user forum</li></ul>
<p>... and that's just the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I'm a great believer in backing up (can you tell?) so I don't mind paying for backup software. Nevertheless there is good image software that's free.</p>

 clicked on the first one to log in which of course I could not remember the password. So now that I have reset the password and up-dated Skype itself by about 7 years or so. I am wondering how do I find out where the information re the other 4&nbsp; accounts&nbsp; would

<h2>            USB Composite Device Driver &#40;Code 38&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>We are facing a problem with a device driver to an&nbsp;USB-device.&nbsp;The USB device&nbsp;is&nbsp;a Cinterion&nbsp;EU3, which is connected to our computer.&nbsp;During certain circiumstances,&nbsp;we need to restart the USB device by the AT^SMSO (Switch Off Mobile Station) command. We
 can also control the shutdown of the USB device by certain control signals (emergency reset).</p>
<p>However, after a shutdown and restart, the USB device is not recognized correctly in Windows any longer. Windows reports Code 38 ("Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware because a previous instance of the device driver is still in memory").
 In other words, the removal (plug off) of the device seems to be the culprit. The driver(s) cannot unload itself completely during removal. The driver in question is USB Composite Device (usbccgp.sys).</p>
<p>The USB Composite Device is a standard Microsoft driver. We have tried to plug-in, remove and plug-in another composite device (keyboard/mouse) with no problem at all. So it might also be the case that the dependent Cinterion driver eu3eusbser.sys have an
 inherent problem that spreads to the composite device driver.</p>
<p>Please note that before shut off and removal of the device, we try to close all possible handles to the device. So this should not be a problem. Also note that just trying do disable/enable the composite device in Device Manager also gives the same driver
 loading problem, i.e. Code 38.</p>
<p>How should we continue the error tracing to pinpoint the problem?</p>
<p>--Carl-Fredrik</p>

<p>The recommended solution in the link is to restart the computer. This is, however,&nbsp;not a clean solution in our environment, since the user should not be affected by this. Also, the origin of the problem is not solved.</p>

            Hi Jessica,
<br />
<br />When you purchased the computer, was it upgraded from a previous version of Windows?
<br />Is the previous version key on Windows?
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select PowerShell (Admin)
<br />Copy/paste the following command into the Window then press Enter.
<br />
<br />powershell "(Get-WmiObject -query ‘select * from SoftwareLicensingService’).OA3xOriginalProductKey"
<br />
<br />This will reveal the original product key. Write it down
<br />Click on Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation
<br />Click on "Change Product Key"
<br />Type the Key into the boxes
<br />Click Next
<br />Windows will activate
<br />
<br />If still having issues, use the Windows Activation Troubleshooter

            Is it possible that the photo (including the border)&nbsp;is not exactly the <br />
correct aspect ratio to be a 4x6? The templates will "Crop To Fit" and <br />
if the ratio is incorrect the photo will be clipped.<br />
<br />
Try printing with a program like Picasa that has a 'Shrink To Fit' option.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

    <title>How do you clean registry&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carolhiggins6710  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you clean registry&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My internet service provider can't install their virus protection (McAfee) because we keep getting a pop up saying we have to remove a previous edition of it. &nbsp;I have never installed it before and it is not listed under control panel&gt;programs. &nbsp;They transferred
 me to McAfee who told me it must be in the registry and the registry has to be cleaned and to tell my tech at my ISP that. &nbsp;I did and they said they don't do that (despite the fact that I pay them for tech support). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is dangerous to attempt this on your own but my back is against the wall, as I can't afford to pay the exhorbitant fees people charge to service your computer. &nbsp;Does anyone know a safe way to do it on your own?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Pavilion g6 Notebook Laptop and Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>To Be honest, McAfee is pernicious and difficult to remove.&nbsp; You stand a decent chance of mucking up the registry.&nbsp; If I were you I would chose a different malware application rather than edit the registry.</p>

            <p>I had McAfee 3 or 4 computers ago and didn't like it at all, I had viruses and worms and trojan horses all the time and they were so difficult to talk to. I could not talk to them on the phone and on live chat or email they kept sending me instructions that
 were wrong for my computer or directions so complicated I didn't have a clue what they meant. It was horrible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is the company that goes with my ISP so I am already paying for it and can't afford to pay extra to another company and don't want to be double paying for a service to two different companies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the by, what virus protection companies do you like? I have used a bunch of them. &nbsp;My last one was Emsisoft and I was very happy with them.</p>

            <p>Happy to help</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my own experience (more than 40,000 BSOD'S) I would never install McAfee, Kaspersky, or Symantec.</p>
<p>Almost anything else will work including the built in (and free) Defender, the free AVG, and most paid malware apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are a normal user that only does email, and web surfing Defender is a good all around malware app.&nbsp; Its free and built into the OS so less likely to cause problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were to investigate a paid malware application (in the future) I would recommend ESET Smart Security.&nbsp; It includes a great malware app, a good firewall, and is set it &amp; forget it.&nbsp;

            <p>I wrote a reply to you but it isn't appearing so here is another one. &nbsp;I said I was embarrassed to admit I had forgotten about Defender, as I have never used it, I guess. &nbsp;I checked on it and it is running and up to date and did a scan just a couple of hours
 ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be able to get a good cleaning in a couple of months and then will decide if I want to change to McAfee........or not.</p>

            <p>I use a piece of software called CCleaner. The big factor is that it is free!!</p>
<p>It will go through the registry and clean out all orphaned bits that are left behind after un-installs, etc.</p>
<p>It works very well</p>

            <p>You are correct, you should not clean registry if at all possible, even with a tool.&nbsp; If you have to go that route, make certain you have a restore point.&nbsp; McAfee has on their site a tool that is supposed to clean everything, but I know for a fact that there
 are still files and folders left on the system.&nbsp; You can download Revo or Geeks Uninstaller, either one should eradicate it if you follow the directions correctly. My past experience with McAfee has also not been positive.&nbsp; Research your options, Windows Defender
 sure isn't bad. &nbsp; Just supplement it with an additional malware scanner and exploit shield.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a big fan of Emsisoft, it's&nbsp; light and user friendly.&nbsp; It's here to stay on my machine.&nbsp; I also have a stand-alone anti-exploit shield, and that's also here to stay.&nbsp; That's it for real-time protection.&nbsp; My machine can breathe again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>ESET online scanner is one of the better free on-demand scanners but it takes a LONG time.&nbsp; Still, its detection rate is very high, for all kinds of garbage.&nbsp; It's really good to have a-couple of on-demand scanners in your downloads.&nbsp; They stay dormant until
 you install/update them.</p>

            <p>Other have already said this , but I'll add my voice to theirs:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><div><span><br />
<span>Registry cleaning programs are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite what many people think, and what vendors of registry cleaning
 software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit it may have.</span><br />
<br />

            <p>I'll say flat out that no registry cleaner is worth the risk!&nbsp; Has anyone ever clearly demonstrated that computer performance is enhanced by "cleaning" the registry?&nbsp; Tools that have other, more useful functions (disc defrag., clearing of temp folders, etc)
 in conjunction with the registry "cleaner" can likely chalk up their performance increases to these non-registry cleaning functions.&nbsp; I believe CCleaner does create a restore point, but I would always double-check.&nbsp; Hey, why not use what's built into Windows
 already?&nbsp; It may not be as convenient or accessible, but it's there and it's effective.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried this PC "tune up" by a well known vendor.&nbsp; It was very slow and confusingly laid out, full of useless pie charts and graphics, and did the same things as my built-in Windows.&nbsp; It also had a registry thing-- I wouldn't dare use it!&nbsp; After about 2
 months, it was gone from my machine.&nbsp; Useless.</p>

            <p>This IMO is a bug.&nbsp; It happens even with a fresh install of Windows 8, 8.1. and 8.1 update 1.&nbsp; I can get the error every time by running Disk Cleanup and selecting 'Clean up system files'</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is always accompanied by this one:</p>
<p>
</p><p>AppContainer profile failed with error 0x80070091 because it was unable to delete folder C:\Users\Gary\AppData\Local\Packages\microsoft.windowscommunicationsapps_8wekyb3d8bbwe\AC or its contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking through this folder and comparing it to other folders in the Packages folder you can see that files that should have been deleted aren't.&nbsp; As the message states it's in the AC folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might be a permissions problem but they are set the way they are with a fresh W8 install.&nbsp; I even changed them to my account but that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because it is reported as an error IMO it's a bug.&nbsp; If the action is intended, because this folder seems to be somewhat special as it's the communicationsapp package it should be informational or a warning at least.</p>

            Hi Sundayose, where did you obtain that Windows 10 Pro upgrade licence key, is it from the Microsoft Store or some 3rd party web site?
<br />
<br />I you know that product key to be legit, have that product key at hand and contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you re-activate your Windows 10

<p>
</p><p>I had follow the instruction to do backup and restore windows 7, but I unable to reinstall my software, I only able to view the files that I backup. For eg, before restore windows 7, I had backup software like Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, microsoft officice...etc.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my previous resolution looks better and clearer but after I had reinstall windows 7, the resolution is out and I had tried to do the setting but it unable to restore like the previous version.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The backup process backs up user files so that you can restore them if needed. It does not back up program files. To avoid problems with programs it is mandatory to keep all software installation files on an external disk together with the purchasing details
 (where purchased or downloaded, price paid, licence numbers).</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can create an image of your installation via the Control Panel / Backup and Restore. You can use this image to restore the machine exactly as it was when you created the image. Your data will be set back as it was when you created the image.</p>

    <title>windows 10 skype problem&#58; it calls a previously called number - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taranui  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 skype problem&#58; it calls a previously called number rather than the number types in &#40;and displayed as being called&#41;</h2>
                    Skype for android works for me just fine, modulo some interface irritations, but skype for windows 10 is getting worse. at present i cannot dial a newly entered number. instead, it always places a call to a previously dialled number (perhaps the last number
 to which a successful call was placed). while dialing it does display the correct number that i wish to call, but it is in fact dialling a different number. this is clearly a bug.

<p>I have same exact issue. It's been there for a while now though (several months). It is really annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Version of Skype:&nbsp; Classic&nbsp; 7.40.0.151</p>
<p>
</p><p>O/S: Windows 10 Pro N</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only work-around is to Quit Skype and restart it. So, it is a software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps to repro (for your QA dept.):</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Login to Skype and make a successful call to phone number X. End the call.</p>
<p>2. Now, make a call to phone number Y (where X &lt;&gt; Y). Skype calls phone number X (it should have called Y).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please ask a developer to debug and fix the issue. It's a simple issue to fix. Please ask the QA team to test this before releasing the next version of Classic Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            Hi Kate
<br />
<br />On Community, we are just users like yourself helping each other out . . .
<br />
<br />It is possible you are logged into a temporary profile after that update . .. 
<br />
<br />Before you do anything or move any files around
<br />
<br />Restart (not shut down) your PC 3 or 4 times, this will fix this issue a lot of the time . .. 
<br />
<br />Otherwise: 
<br />
<br />Please open Windows File Explorer 
<br />Navigate to C:\Users 
<br />Do you see two user folders that look like yours?
<br />Open those folders and check inside Pictures, Documents . . . etc. and see if your files are there 
<br />
<br />If your files are there: 
<br />
<br />Create a new user profile with Admin privileges 
<br />Log into the new user profile 
<br />Copy all your data from the old profile to the new profile (Documents Library, Pictures Library . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If you still have not found your files, look for a Windows.old folder on your C Drive, expand that to open the users folder contained inside - check there for your files, icons . . .etc. 
<br />
<br />If you do find your files . . . etc. there, copy them out as soon as possible as Windows will remove the Windows.old folder in time
<br />
<br />NOTE VERY IMPORTANT: Do Not copy your files into the Temporary profile you are currently in, when the situation is corrected, your files will be deleted with the Temporary Profile and will not be recoverable !!

</p><p>I was able to print to a pdf, and then print the pdf successfully, so I know there is not a problem with my computer connecting to the printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened a new document in Word and was able to print that, so it seems the problem is only with documents from before the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

 So let's start witht he simplest to try and that is replacing the normal.dot template.</span><br />
<br />
 not find it, try searching for *.dot.&nbsp; It may be hard to find because it is a hidden file.&nbsp; You may have to go into folder options and be sure "show hidden files" is checked.&nbsp; Whenever you find normal.dot, rename it old.dot and restart your computer.&nbsp; Open
 Word and it will create a new normal.dot template, which is what Word uses as a default blank document.</span><br />

            <p>Thanks for your quick response. I saw that as a response to somebody else's question and tried it already - no help. (the file it found on mine was normal.dotm, not sure if that makes a difference.)</p>

            <p>I ended up running some sort of troubleshooting program which fixed the problem with Word, but now every time I open Word a notification pops up asking me if I want to allow it to make changes to my PC (which I do, because that's what solves the earlier
 problem).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get it to stop asking me that for Word without turning it off for every app? There was no "don't ask me again" or "always allow this program" box.</p>

            <p>Yes, what you are looking for is the UAC (User account control).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on start and type in UAC. This will begin a search and click on the top results 'Change user account control settings).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Once the new Window opens, slide the the slider down all the way to the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

<h2>            Cannot recover my old Hotmail account which contains my xbox account</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to recover my Microsoft&nbsp;live&nbsp;account for months because I cannot remember&nbsp;the password. Every time I go through the validation process, it keeps telling me that I did not provide enough information to recover the account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is very annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know how else I am supposed to recover it. I give as much info as I can but it is an old account so my information is outdated.</p>
<p>I just want to access the account to be able to get into my Xbox account.</p>

<p>Hi Max,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There many ways to recover your account since you have connected it to multiple applications and devices. To verify which support is befitting to help you with your Xbox account, we'd like to ask the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What recovery options have you tried already?</li><li>Do you still remember your Xbox Gamertag?</li><li>How old is the account and how long was it not accessed?</li></ul>
