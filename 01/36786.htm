    <title>How do I search for Excel files&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I search for Excel files&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've tried searching for *.xlsx. Ok, that's not supported anymore (apparently) as it returns no results (when there are clearly files with .xlsx filename extension).</p>
<p>So I finally figured out the advanced query syntax is ext:&lt;extension&gt; and tried ext:.xlsx. This also returned no results.</p>
<p>For some bizarre reason ext:.docx works but ext:.xlsx (breifly) shows a message below the search field, "No filter matches"</p>
<p>What does that mean?</p>
<p>How do I search for Excel files?</p>

<p>I figured out what I was doing wrong. I was attempting to search in a "Library" folder.</p>
<p>Neither *xlsx or ext:.xlsx work in any of the Library folders.</p>
<p>Both of these searches work fine if I go to C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents.</p>
<p>No idea why. Perhaps because Library folders are just pointers &nbsp;to folders &lt;shrug&gt;.</p>

    <title>After codec download can&#39;t view Tiff files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianormerod  say:</h3>
<h2>            After codec download can&#39;t view Tiff files</h2>
                    I had a microsoft codec installed on my Windows 7 x64 PC to view RAW files. When going to look at&nbsp;an image in &gt;Pictures / &gt;Libraries&nbsp;a couple of days ago a message box&nbsp;opened&nbsp;offering&nbsp;a new codec for download which it said would provide additional features
 (MicrosoftCodecPack_amd64.msi) which I duly downloaded and installed.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Having installed it I cannot now view TIFF files in &gt;Pictures / &gt;Libraries, the thumbnails appear OK but when I click on an image to open it, it shows as multitudinous coloured lines and the thumbnail changes to this appearance also. The same change to
 the thumb nail occurs if I right click an image.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can still open jpeg and RAW files normally. All is OK when opening files in Photoshop CS5.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried uninstalling the codec but the problem persisted, I have also tried 'repair' under &gt;control panel / &gt;programmes and also tried downloading a further copy of the codec. System restore just showed that I had&nbsp;uninstalled&nbsp;the codec (since reinstalled)
 .</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't refer to images in 'Libraries' very often (normally using Photoshop) but there are times when it is quicker and more convenient to look in 'Libraries'</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I resolve this please....... I suppose a reinstall of Windows would do it but I am looking for a less work-intensive solution if possible.
</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Was the codec re-downloaded after the restore?</p>
<p><span><span>What I mean is that the new codec was added to the one already there and the latter one was removed then a system restore. I would suggest
 you to reinstall the original codec and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>

            Hi and thanks,
<div><br />
<div>First I should perhaps say I am 67 years old and not the most computer literate.....sometimes I do things but can't remember exactly the sequence etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I think the codec was re-downloaded after the restore.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do now recall that when installing the updated codec I had left another programme open (can't remember what it was) and I had to shut it down quickly after prompted by the&nbsp;installation wizard ...could this have resulted in something being corrupted.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am a victim to excessive tidyness and have already cleaned out my recycle bin so no longer have the original codec.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did look this morning to see if I could go to a restore point before this incident but there are now no system restore points, why is this? ....the other days there was a list including removal of some software for a 'defective' product which I am returning
 to Amazon.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have also had a major problem with eight Microsoft updates which wouldn't install and which I eventually found I had to install individually.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your assistance.</div>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to Microsoft Community. I understand that there is a number of emails shown beside the Flagged items folder under Quick views though you have not flagged any emails at all. As an initial troubleshooting step,
we request you to repair Windows Essentials in your PC to isolate that there are no corrupted files in the system. To do this, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click the
<font><b>Start</b> or the pearl button located at the lower left part of the screen, input
<b>AppWiz.cpl </b>on the search box, then click <b>Enter</b>.</font></span></li><li><span>Search for
<font><b>Windows Essentials 2012</b> on the list and then select it.</font></span></li><li><span>Click
<font><b>Uninstall/Change</b>.</font></span><font color="#000000">
</font></li><li><span>Click <font>
<b>Repair all Windows Essentials programs.</b></font></span></li></ol>
<p><span>If issue still persists, kindly remove then re-add the Flagged items folder in Quick views. To do this, please follow the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Windows Live Mail.</span></li><li><span>Right-click on
<strong>Quick views</strong> then click <strong>Select quick views...</strong></span></li><li><span>Remove the check mark beside
<strong>Flagged items</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Click <strong>
OK</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Repeat the steps again to re-add the Flagged items folder; this time, tick the checkbox for Flagged items then click OK.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let us know how things turn out.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Regards.</span></p>

<div><br />
<div>Two things .. I have live essentials 2011 &amp; I have, in the past flagged Emails, and either unflagged or deleted them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did the repair and unselect/select as you suggested but the quick view flagged items still shews 7, but there are none if I try to display them</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have installed LE2012 .. no change.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just wondering .. could it be that deleting a flagged email leaves a 'flag' after the associated email is deleted.?</div>

            <p>Hello bandsp,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for updating us. I have tried to reproduce this issue and have flagged a message. The flagged message was shown in the "Flagged items" in Quick views. Without unflagging&nbsp;the message, I deleted it. I clicked the Flagged items and it was no longer
 there. I don't think it should remain or be shown in the Flagged item as it was already deleted. Have you tried removing your account from Windows Live Mail and add it back again to refresh the connection? If not yet, I suggest that you try to do so. You may
 refer to the article below for the steps:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After doing the above steps, please re-launch Windows Live Mail and get back to us with the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div>for various historic and family reasons I have about 15 email ids, and I did not fancy trying to remove and reinstate that lot, so I decided to look at every folder in every account .. I have some Gmail accounts and found that the hidden flagged emails
 were in some gmail id folders .. I deleted them there and now the QuickView Flagged is clear.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, it seems that deleting from the quickview 'Unread' and 'All email' folders doesn't actually remove them from the Gmail account folders (or something)</div>
<div><br />
<div>New lesson learned!</div>

<p><b>Well I never done this before but this is my plead to u the community, First off, Hi I am Lunixed (GT) I got my gamerscore reset on my 2nd account Lunixed (My first account was lost when my xbox broke and since it never when online i could not recover
 it), I know what your problaly thinking bad thing right now about me but it was just a mistake i did, See 4 years ago after my original xbox got the 3rrod I bought a new one but that console did not come with a hdd as I bought it from a friend and i figured
 why not buy the 120gb pack (at the time was really hot at the time) after a couple of months i saw a video on youtube about gamer score modding(note that i barely play online so i figured why not &lt;This was around late 2008 when i just got internet and became
 xbox live member) I did not think it would give the results that it did, anyways it got reset around late 09, Ever since then i have been i have made more than 10 accounts and never really cared about Lunixed until now that I am a senior on High school (i
 barely play xbox now) and well i really miss my my account, Im off to college soon and as i was talking to my clan they reminded me of the time when i no lifed call of duty 4 and met them and all the fun i had aswell in MW2 the clan battles we had and it was
 all on lunixed my first legit gamertag. &lt;end of life story lol&gt; so if u guys know how i can get out&nbsp; off the cheater zone and get a second chance on my account i would be thankfull, I think i do deserve a second chance as i have been an active member ever
 since i bought gold, for example i have bought tons of add ons,arcade games, and i have tons of games like all cods-all halos-fallout 3 and vegas- all assasins creed, gaming has been part of my life since i could remenber, My first xbox i bought was in my
 13 birthday so please guys help me and sorry for this really long story ^^.</b></p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer:</span></strong>
<p>1) The option to disable Auto Arrange.<br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with. Double
 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Let Microsoft know you want Windows Explorers features returned:</span></strong>

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>

<p>Hi TG_Silvertech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Older laptops that were designed and manufactured around 8 years back are probably not compatible with
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. The reason is that they have an old hardware that is made to run only the specific operating system that was released or existed on their time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>HP DV6-3133EE Entertainment Notebook PC</strong> is an old model that was manufactured to run best in Windows 7. If you can't use this computer anymore with
<strong>Windows 10</strong> installed, at this time, we recommend that you rollback to
<strong>Windows 7</strong> and stay with this operating system only.</span></p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t partition disk and install windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Earlier today my pc worked fine, but then I turned it off took a nap, woke up and tried turning it on again with the result that it just kept rebooting in a loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could go into boot setups and so on but it just wouldnt load windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a windows installation ready always on my USB, so I tried to reinstall. This process worked fine as well, but then I get to the format disk part, where I just keep getting the same error 0x8004242d or something. I even try manually converting the
 disk to GPT with diskpart in the console without any luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think maybe the disk is faulty, so I try my spare SSD which definitely worked last time I used it, now this disk shows the exact same problem. I am trying to install windows while having only the one disk inserted, and both disks just wont be converted
 nomatter what I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is UEFI, and I am trying to install windows 10 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be able to try and convert it later using my friends PC, but so far the whole is just a mystery to me.</p>
<p>As far as I know I didn't download any windows update or anything when I turned it on successfully the first time.</p>
<p>Could this be caused my some sort of virus messing up my system somehow or what is going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>Indexing properties and file contents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelmarr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Indexing properties and file contents</h2>
                    <p>Indexing option to search file properties and contents does not work. Searching finds the foldername and the filename with the searchterm and every file under foldername (it's only recursively finding files that have the same foldername regardless of content).
 It also finds any filename that contains searchterm. It does not find searchterm within the document.&nbsp; It only dumps file allocation table.&nbsp; Windows 10 Pro, x64 ver 1607, 10.01.14393, HP, AMD A8-4500M.&nbsp;

</p><p>Oh, it has been saying "these results may be incomplete" for over a year now but I just ignore that.</p>

            <p>I'd take that sign that the results may be incomplete to mean that the indexer routine hasn't finished running. &nbsp;There are hundreds of reasons this may happen -- sometimes it fails or gets stuck on a particular file and can't proceed gracefully, or there
 is corruption of the keyword index, just to name a few.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd first go into your index options and try to narrow down how much gets indexed (typically just your documents/pictures/whatever folders inside your user folder, but of course be sure to include any other place that you keep files you need indexed). &nbsp;Also
 avoid indexing folders like program files or system folders, since the internals of those binary files (executables, DLLS) can't be indexed and would just fill the index with junk data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you get that narrowed down (or not, if it's already how you want), I'd reset and rebuild the index. &nbsp;One good practice for the initial re-run is to set your power options to "do not sleep when plugged in", and let it run overnight. &nbsp;In the morning
 your indexing status should say "indexing complete".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another option you have for searching inside file contents (inside the document) is to tell it to perform a in-depth document scan even if the file being scanned is not indexed. &nbsp;This way even if the index didn't run on that file (or otherwise failed), you'll
 still get the results you want. Sure it'll be a little slower, but that beats the wrong results. &nbsp;See&nbsp;<a href="http://cmdrkeene.com/enable-full-file-search-in-non-indexed-folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Enable Full File Search in Non-Indexed Folders [Video]">Enable
 Full File Search in Non-Indexed Folders [Video]</a>&nbsp;for how to do that.</p>

                    <p>Dear Xbox,</p><p><br /></p><p>I am a player from Finland, and just browsed through Xbox apps. There is an application called "Free Movies @ HD" By TD&nbsp;Media. It shows pirated movies, like Star Wars - Rogue One shot from a&nbsp;camera at the movie theatre. This is called bootlegging. Anyways, I&nbsp;reported this app&nbsp;to Microsoft&nbsp;Support, but I&nbsp;did not get any answer. This is amazing:&nbsp;how Microsoft allow this kind of application in their Xbox One Store that shows pirated movies? </p><p><br /></p><p>Kr,</p><p>Player from Finland</p>

<p>Xbox store is full of these apps for films and tv ive tried them all some are good others rubbish but they all seem to work and are allowed. Same situation on Windows 10 store loads of tv and movie apps all work as well. Im not sure why MS is allowing this and the clampdown is not working. Hopefully they will respond soon because MS will be fined a lot soon if nothing done but also people who carry on using them. But In truth Xbox owners are only downloading an app that&nbsp;MS seems to allow on to the console so in truth is the console owner breaking any laws watching pirated stuff on their console if the app has been allowed direct from MS&nbsp;xbox app store.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone.&nbsp; This same exact error and behavior of Windows firewall seem to be linked to another issue with Group Policy Client service.&nbsp; Here is a re-post with the solution from
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/why-wont-windows-connect-to-the-group-policy/b73107f8-8447-4599-87a5-65ecc6a63aa0?page=2">
Microsoft community forum</a> (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/why-wont-windows-connect-to-the-group-policy/b73107f8-8447-4599-87a5-65ecc6a63aa0?page=2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/why-wont-windows-connect-to-the-group-policy/b73107f8-8447-4599-87a5-65ecc6a63aa0?page=2</a>)</p>
<p>NOTE: before trying this solution make sure you are having the issue with Group Policy Client service, i.e.:</p>
<ol>
<li>Non-admin users cannot log in to the computer</li><li>When admin logs in, a message appears informing you that Windows cannot connect to Group Policy Client service</li><li>Group Policy Client service does not appear to be <strong>Started</strong> in computer services.msc snap-in</li></ol>
<p>If you have all three symptoms listed above, then the fix may resolve the Firewall error code 0x6D9</p>
<p><br />

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had this issue on my laptop since November, and it really bugged me.&nbsp; I sifted through the event log and found the pattern of events that preceded the issue, and, probably, caused it.<br />
<br />
In short, the pattern is as follows: Windows updates run automatically as scheduled, and when reboot is initiated after the updates are finished, the computer crashes (probably during reboot sequence).&nbsp; When it boots up, it reports that the last shutdown was
 unexpected, and the issue begins to occur.<br />
<br />
I spent 2 days trying to dig out a solution from the Internet, to no avail, until I came across
<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/list-services-running-under-svchostexe-process/#advanced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this page</a>.&nbsp; It doesn't say anything about this particular problem, but it gives more information about SVCHOST process that starts many services, including Group Policy Client.&nbsp; It looks like during reboot a vital registry settings were lost during crash
 and Group Policy Client "don't know" how to start.&nbsp; Let me explain:<br />
<br />
There are two places to look in the registry:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services</strong> this path should contain
<strong>gpsvc </strong>key (a folder), which is responsible for service parameters and configuration.&nbsp; I found that the key was intact, so, you do not touch anything here - just check that the key exists.</li><li><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SVCHOST</strong> This is the most important path you should look into, as it must contain the keys and values referred in the key #1.&nbsp; Below are descriptions what must be present there.</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>There must be Multi-String value called <strong>GPSvcGroup</strong>. My laptop was missing it.&nbsp; So, you should create multi-string value named
<strong>GPSvcGroup </strong>and assign it value <strong>GPSvc</strong>.</li><li>Next, you must create a key (a folder) and name it <strong>GPSvcGroup</strong> - this key normally should be there, but, again, it was missin on my laptop.</li><li>Then open newly-created <strong>GPSvcGroup </strong>folder and create 2 DWORD values:</li></ul>
<ol>
<li>First called <strong>AuthenticationCapabilities </strong>and you must give it a value of 0x00003020 (or 12320 in decimal)</li><li>Second is called <strong>CoInitializeSecurityParam </strong>and it must have value of 1.</li></ol>
<p>Once you complete all steps above, reboot the computer and the problem will be fixed.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro Screen Flicker in 2018 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> travel troll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro Screen Flicker in 2018</h2>
                    <p>I am still having the same issue in 2018.</p>
<p>All the existing threads don't have any solutions attached on them, apart from going to "Flickergate.com" and complain about it.</p>
<p>That website says to contact MS support for help and replacement as MS has admitted to the issue being widespread. But I am unable to contact MS support as the device is out of insurance by now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be a hardware related thing, as it's clearly heat related (people sticking it into freezers in news articles, and personally proven correct). So is there a way to get a replacement (different NOT-Surface-Pro device)?&nbsp;<br />
Or is it just... garbage dump time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also NOTE: If you're about to answer something related to "updates" and "drivers" and "install stuff", please go to the other thread with 2400 comments of that type that also do not work. This is a hardware problem. No install will fix it.</p>

<p>It's not necessarily heat related as it happens on mine within seconds of starting it up, when it's stone cold. It also sometimes goes away after it has been on for a while, or when I reboot. If it was a heat related problem it wouldn't stop when the device
 warmed up, nor would it happen when the device was cold.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly one of the biggest mistakes the general public make is assuming they know what the cause of a problem is, yet ironically they never have a solution. When posting anything about any device it's more helpful just to post the nature of the problem rather
 than just assuming you know what the cause is as it can be misleading. </p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, in my case it definitely is NOT heat related. Yours may or may not be but don't just assume it is as you may be looking in the wrong place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have contacted Microsoft support center. It is as if they have heard the problem the first time. I was asked to pay S$39 for the on line diagnosis and then I was told that if it can not be solved, then Microsoft will do a 1 for 1 swap (refurbished unit)
 at a price of S$638.&nbsp; I think there is a design problem here since it has affected so many different users. Microsoft should have known this and rectify the problem instead of keep asking customer to pay. I hope this problem can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>You're being asked to pay for a diagnosis, not to contact them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can blame that on the millions of people who phone up with every tiny little issue they have. It costs money for people to man phone lines, even our small business loses thousands of hours a year answering stupid questions. Just this morning one customer
 rang us because he didn't know how to open the box.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Everybody wants these services but nobody expects to pay for them, but the cost of them has to be paid somehow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not much. Corona provides more power to the USB ports and unofficially supported original Memory Units via USB to MU adapters on the front USB ports.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trinity does away with original MU support via adapters and lowers the power available on USB ports, I find. Attaching HDDs via the transfer cable on a Trinitiy using the new 360/360 S compatible cable is best done via the rear USB ports as the fronts don't
 provide enough power.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Corona's been discontinued for a while. If you buy one, you're not going to have warranty support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I possess two Corona consoles (Halo Reach, Gears of War), and three Trinity consoles (MW3, Star Wars, Halo 4). The MW3 is my primary console and it's been fine.</p>

<p>Thanks for your quick reply. Not sure if I really like the white console but for 150 its a steal, I have a 320gb on the way as well. My old fat box gpu died couple months back and I'm itching to play again.</p>

<p>You are backwards. &nbsp;The trinity is the ORIGINAL revision of the slim console. &nbsp;Your Halo REACH console is a trinity. &nbsp;Your GOW3 console is a trinity. &nbsp;The MW3, Star Wars, and Halo 4 consoles are corona (specifically Corona v1, Corona v1, and Corona v4).
 &nbsp;Trinities were discontinued around June 2011, when Microsoft switched over to the corona design (no expandable memory slot -- build into board now, lower power consumption, and removal of the separate HANA chip).</p>

<p>Hmmm. Yes, he's correct. Trinity was first, Corona second. Not sure what you mean by "expandable memory slot" though. Are you referring to the Internal USB MU on 4GB consoles, or something else?</p>

<p>Do corona and trinity have the same fan noise level? Is it possible to somehow lower the fan noise without sending the console for a repair? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Right Click to New drop down is delayed or lagging</h2>
                    <p>Best way to describe it is whenever you right click to go to new drop down it delays/takes awhile to load, i thought this was my machine but i confirmed it with my coworker too so it must be a windows update<br />
<br />
<br />
here is a gif of what i'm<br />
<a href="https://gyazo.com/9d79203e335b664faad712a3e28a26f1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gyazo.com/9d79203e335b664faad712a3e28a26f1</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>the thing ive noticed is that if you keep doing it ~ it gets faster and faster so essentially it goes away but for the first 3 times you do it in a different file location it delays<br />
<br />
please look into this, this is a nightmare to deal with as im do alot folder layout and structures so this delay really sets me back</p>

            I recommend you perform a repair upgrade to see if that resolves the problem.

    <title>Re-install Software on Replacement for Stolen Computer&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> craig t. dedo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Re-install Software on Replacement for Stolen Computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>May I&nbsp;re-install software that I have valid licenses for on the computer that I bought to replace a computer that was stolen during a burglary?<br />
<br />
Would a re-install of existing software trigger audits by firms such as Microsoft?<br />
<br />
In other words, if I install software on the replacement for a stolen computer, do I get a free install or do I need to purchase an additional license?<br />
<br />
Here is what happened.<br />
<br />
Early on the morning of May 29, burglars broke into my house and stole several items of high-end electronic equipment, including my latest desktop PC. As soon as i discovered the burglary, I reported it to the police. The next day, I gave the police a complete
 list of the serial numbers of the stolen equipment. The fact of the burglary and the equipment that was stolen is now a matter of public record.&nbsp; The serial numbers of the stolen equipment are on the national registry of stolen equipment.<br />
<br />
The stolen computer included installations of several expensive, high-end software packages, including Microsoft Office 2007 Ultimate, Microsoft Visual Studio 2008, Microsoft Project 2007, and Microsoft Visio 2007.<br />
<br />
A week ago, I bought a replacement unit for the stolen desktop PC. I need to re-install the software packages on the replacement PC. I checked the EULAs and they are silent on this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have all of the original DVDs and Product Keys.<br />
<br />
I have no idea who to contact at Microsoft or anyone else to get an answer to this question.<br />
<br />
Does anyone reading this forum have any idea whether I can legally re-install the software without having to buy new licenses?</p>

If you have the original installation media and product keys/CoAs - then the software is yours.&nbsp; Install it.</p>
<p>(Although I wouldn't call Microsoft Office 2007 all that "high-end".&nbsp; *grin*)</p>
