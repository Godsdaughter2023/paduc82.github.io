<h2>            How can I delete, rename, or move files or folders open in another program I cant find&#63;</h2>
                    


Im running Windows 7 Ultimate. 


What do I need to do to fix this problem:  Too often when I try to delete, rename, or move a file/s or a folder/s whether on my desktop or documents, libraries or any typical place one would creat a custom folder, I recieve an error message telling me I cannot delete that file or folder because it is open in another program. 


This drives me nuts because I don't know what the heck, or where the heck this folder exists anywhere else on my laptop. 


I tried searching files and programs to see if there are duplicate areas where the file may share with another path, but nothing.  I also looked at the properties of the file/folder but it doesnt show me anything relevant, even if I uncheck the read only box. 


I am the sole user/administrator of my laptop.  I created an administrator priviledged profile I use exclusively, nothing else.  I run a home network with 5 computers and have dealt with various issues in the past but, this problem began recently aft

            <p>When you have the issue happening, open task manager. <br />
Then you can view the processes that are open and see if the program or file is opened by another process. If so, then select End Task.
<br />
Then go back to Windows Explorer and see if you can delete the file now. <br />
<br />
You might also be able to delete the file in Safe Mode. <br />
To get to Safe Mode:<br />
a) Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
<br />
b) Select an option when the Windows Advanced Options menu appears, and then press ENTER.<br />
c) When the Boot menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear in blue at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</p>

If you are running a Webserver, you may see the App pool listed under users. <br />

<p>An <em>application pool</em> is a group of one or more URLs that are served by a worker process or a set of worker processes. Application pools set boundaries for the applications they contain, which means that any applications that are running outside a
 given application pool cannot affect the applications in the application pool. </p>

<p>Hope this helped to answer your questions. <br />

<p>Hi Waheed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you've encountered is an outcome of some files or components that are broken or missing on the system. To sort out your concern, we’d like to know if you’re still encountering the issue regarding the
<strong>Power Management</strong> of the Ethernet connection on your device? If so, we suggest that you go to the device manufacturer’s website and install the latest software available for your PC.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, we encourage that you keep your computer updated. Go to<strong> Windows Update</strong> by clicking<strong> Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Windows Update</strong>. Download and install the latest update available for your device.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if the suggestion works for you. <br />

<p>That LAST thing you want to do is get any hardware driver updates from Windows Update - very bad advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the issue you are having that compels you to change the power management for that device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which power management option are you wanting to change and why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message says "The network connection is disabled... enable it from the General tab..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look on the General tab is the device enabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look in Device Manager at your Network adapters is the device showing any error (yellow or red) and if you right click the device are you is it enabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't figure it out do this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
If a Dell what is the Service Tag number?<br />
<br />
Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the search box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

<p>The symptom of the problem is the computer is not sleeping - so I would suspect video drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you or do you not see the Sleep option from the Shut down menu and if you see it and choose to Sleep does that work or does it not work:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cc1014d-9b27-4131-a2dc-654eca583435" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cc1014d-9b27-4131-a2dc-654eca583435" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Dell has some kind of Intel video component so do this so we can see what you have now - this will give us the current situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the search box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before updating any drivers make a manual System Restore point so you can undo the adjustments if things get worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to the Dell Support page and enter your Service Tag number:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/4</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell only offers one video driver for your system so download it, install it, reboot and test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it still doesn't work do this again so we can see what you have after the Dell update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the search box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your screenshot says you have Intel network I218-LM so that is another driver you can update from the Dell site in the Network section:</p>

            <p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<p>When the setup menu appears, select the custom (advanced) option, select the disk partition where you would like to install Windows 7 32 bit. Click Next.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-6a.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-6a_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d498%26amp%3bh%3d365" /></a></p>
<p>You will receive the following warning:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The partition you selected might contain files from a previous Windows Installation. If it does, these files and folders will be moved to a folder named Windows.old. You will be able to access the information in Windows.old, but you will be able to use
 your previous version of Windows. </em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So even doing a custom install, your personal files are still preserved. It is still recommended you do a manual backup, because you might explicitly format the drive during setup which will delete all information on the drive. Click
<strong>OK</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-7_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d491%26amp%3bh%3d347" /></a></p>
<p>Setup will now start the installation. During the installation, your machine will be restarted several times.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/setup-8.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2011%2f04%2fsetup-8_thumb.jpg%3fw%3d491%26amp%3bh%3d351" /></a></p>
When the installation is complete, you can complete the Out of Box experience such as selecting your laptop, create a username, password, your time zone. You can then proceed to download the latest updates for Windows and reinstall your applications and drivers.<br />
<br />
You can then recover your personal files from the Windows.old folder and reinstall all your applications and drivers.<br />

<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to external storage before doing so. You will have to reinstall all your programs after installing
 Windows 7. Here are the steps: </span></p>
<p><span>1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor - i</span><span>﻿t scans your PC for potential issues with your hardware, devices, and installed programs, recommends what to do before you upgrade,
</span><span>and whether you can install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7. </span>

<p><span>2. Backup all your files and settings to avoid losing docs, photos, and other information. Windows Easy Transfer is a free tool to copy files (not programs) from your PC, and then transfer them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't want to
 use Windows Easy Transfer, you can copy your files to a USB drive, or CD/DVD. Note: Easy Transfer will not work when changing languages, or when going from 64 bit to 32 bit (it will work going from 32 bit to 64 bit).</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</span></a></p>
<p><span>3. Locate the installation disks and any associated product/license keys for all your programs because you'll need to manually reinstall all programs. If you downloaded some programs from the Internet you can redownload them.
</span></p>
<p><span>4. Put the Windows 7 disk into your DVD drive, then restart and boot from the DVD.
</span><span>Click Install Now</span>, and a<span>t the setup screen, click Custom (Advanced) and proceed.
</span></p>
<p><span>5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer (or another backup method you used) to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to reinstall all your programs. Then you're done - enjoy Windows 7.

<p><strong><span>Hi,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>As you are getting an error message stating that the system files could not be fixed so there should be some corrupt files present on the computer
 which are causing issues.<br />
So the next suggestion is to do an Inplace Upgrade (Repair) on Windows 7.&nbsp; This can only be done if you have a Windows 7 CD (not a Manufacture Recovery CD)</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Repair Installation\In place upgrade:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may reinstall your copy of windows 7 while keeping your files, settings, and programs by performing a
<strong>repair installation</strong> or an <strong>in-place </strong>upgrade with the following steps: (<strong>Note</strong>: &nbsp;This does not always resolve all issues, especially if the corruption was caused by a 3rd party program or service, you might need
 to do a clean installation if this is unsuccessful.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An In-Place upgrade is actually a repair installation using the upgrade option.<br />
<br />
Note: After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting
 process is time consuming and may take several hours to complete.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Please make sure you backup any and all important data before proceeding. You may refer to the below links for backup and
 restore -<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-your-files</span></a>
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-files-from-a-backup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Restore-files-from-a-backup</span></span></a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Always make sure you have the means to reinstall your programs, either through an install disk or having access to the installation
 files</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to perform an in-place Upgrade -</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Before you perform an in-place Upgrade follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Disable or uninstall all security software’s on the computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remove all third party CD and DVD burning software.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on Start, in the start search box type appwiz.cpl and press enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;On the left side click on “Turn Windows feature On or Off”.&nbsp;<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Uncheck the following three components and then click on Ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- .Net Framework 3.0<br />
- Remote Differential Compression<br />
- Windows DFS Replication Service</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Start the in-place Upgrade.<br />
</span></strong><span>Steps to perform an in-place upgrade:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Exit all programs running and then insert the Windows installation disc into your computer's DVD/CD drive. You must start Windows
 installation while running your existing version of Windows.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. On the Install Windows page, click Install now.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. On the Get important updates for installation page, we recommend getting the latest updates to help ensure a successful installation
 and to help protect your computer against security threats. You will need an Internet connection to get installation updates.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. On the Type your product key for activation page, we strongly recommend that you type your 25-character product key to help avoid
 problems during activation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. On the Please read the license terms page, if you accept the license terms, click I accept the license terms.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. On the “Which type of installation do you want?” page, click Upgrade to begin the upgrade. You might see a compatibility report.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Follow the instructions.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Once the upgrade is complete, follow the steps as below -</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click on Start, in the start search box type appwiz.cpl and press enter.&nbsp;<br />
2. On the left side click on “Turn Windows feature On or Off”.&nbsp;<br />
3. Put a check mark against the following three components and then click on Ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- .Net Framework 3.0<br />
- Remote Differential Compression<br />
- Windows DFS Replication Service<br />
<br />
Warning:&nbsp;Before you perform an in-place upgrade, you should be prepared for a worst case scenario that results in your existing data on your computer being deleted. This data includes personal data, settings, hardware driver information, and software programs.
 If a worst case scenario occurs, you may have to reinstall all programs. Make sure that you back up personal data to disks or to other external storage devices before you perform an in-place upgrade.<br />
If all else fail Use the following&nbsp;link for the setup log files for Windows 7:<br />

<p>The alpha was released so DICE &amp; EA can test their servers,&nbsp;its not a game-play test, they will be testing that part of the game in Sep on the open beta. Also when you downloaded, install and played the alpha you agreed to Terms &amp; Conditions, that any bugs
 you come across will be reported via the alpha forums on the battlefield website.
<br />
<br />
If you are having problem accessing the game with your current PC spec. You need to check that your PC meets Min Requirements and if it does than you should in form DICE or EA. This will help gamers more then just posting a warning&nbsp;to fellow gamers&nbsp;here.</p>

<p>What did you guys expect, Your playing a Alpha build ( an unfinished version of the game). It was released so DICE can get some feedback on how the servers preform and various PC hardware. The information DICE will gather from players will allow the programmers
 to fix issues. &nbsp;</p>

            Could be a combination of things. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Startup tab
<br />
<br />Disable programs that might be starting up with the system.
<br />
<br />Which Antivirus utility are you using?
<br /> What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />How long has this been happening?
<br />Have you installed any new software or hardware drivers since you started experience this problem? If so, what are they and are they designed for Windows 10?
<br />
<br />Have you checked the manufacturers website or contact support find out about compatibility, updates or support for Windows 10?
<br />Do you have a system restore point created you could go back to? 
<br />Does the problem occur in other user accounts on the computer?
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703?
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from?
<br />
<br />Here are somethings you can do to further speed up your system:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/make-windows-10-run-faster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/make-windows-1...</a>
<br />
<br />As for Microsoft Word or Microsoft Office
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list, select Microsoft Office or Microsoft Word
<br />Click Change on the command bar
<br />Follow the on screen wizard then choose repair.
<br />
<br />See if that helps
<br />
<br />If you see no improvement, I recommend you perform a reset and choose the option to keep your files:

            If you have to press F1 to boot, that is normally a sign that the CMOS battery on your motherboard needs replacing (it looks like a watch battery)
<br />
<br />With regards to your Computer running slow and Word not responding:
<br />
<br />Press Ctrl + Alt + Esc to open task Manager
<br />On the processes tab, with your system at rest, what are the percentages on Disk, CPU and Memory?

<h2>            Might using &#34;Last Known Good Configuration&#34; work for my DVD problem&#47;s&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've asked previously how to fix this problem, but certain "Fixes" I'm not comfortable attempting such as messing with the Registry. The problem is that my laptop no longer recognizes my playing or attempting to use a DVD for backup. CDs work fine.&nbsp;DVDs
 had worked fine for playing or backup up till maybe 3&nbsp;+/- months ago&nbsp;My laptop is an ACER Aspire, W7 Home Premium OS, Norton360 Premier &amp; Cox HS Cable. I've tried just about every fix, suggested or otherwise, but so far nothing has worked. Would there be any
 possible benefit in doing a Restart, clicking on F8 and bringing up the menu that includes "Last Known Good Configuration" and seeing what comes up, happens, etc ??? Thanks for any help.</p>

            In the first Screenshot you have 14 tabs open in Opera, that is consuming 63% of your CPU and 1.5GB of RAM, I would suggest closing some tabs or trying a different browser
<br />
<br />While for the most part the rest does seem to be normal. Windows Defender is using a bit, but I assume that is because of the number of tabs open in the browser also!
<br />
<br />From your second screenshot, you have a good system and if you sort out the browser issue, it should run like a dream . . .

<br />
<br />Could be a StartUp problem :
<br />
<br />If using an SSD or hybrid hard drive be sure it has the latest firmware.
<br />
<br />Try the Clean Boot method to see if a startup program is involved - if so it is a process of elimination : (And check in Process Explorer which shows more details than Task Manager.)
<br />
<br />Right Click the start button - Command Prompt (Admin) - at the prompt type in

<br />
<br />Do all of these :
<br />
<br />If you had a 3rd party antivirus on the OS you upgraded OR if you have one now uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1/10 is a full antivirus. Despite all the hype out there Windows Defender and the Windows Firewall are true superstars.

<br />Tips to improve PC performance in Windows 10 &lt;-- read this link
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/400201...</a> 
<br />
<br />The below is additional help with some of the methods in the "Tips to improve...." link.
<br />
<br />Windows Key + X - Command Prompt (Admin)   OR   Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />
<br />SFC /scannow
<br />
<br />Note if that shows uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />When that completes run these :
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />Note if that shows any uncorrected errors - do the below regardless.
<br />
<br />Then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />Be sure you are running the latest available BIOS and drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot  - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Hi Asif, can you shut down your Opera browser and take a screenshot of the task manager again please
<br />
<br />The only other things using system resources are Windows Defender and MSERT ( Microsoft Emergency Response Tool
<br />
<br />Also I would check in Control Panel - Power Options, which Power Plan is set
<br />
<br />With the processor you have it should be set to Balanced, Then Windows and Intel software will manage SpeedStep and Hyprethreading so your processor speed is ramped up when needed and will be at rest when not under pressure . . .

<h2>            &#39;system restore&#39;- date and time keep changing to dec. 2004</h2>
                    please help... we have just opened up our 2 day old dell pc, running with windows 7 home version. the date &amp;time were correct when we logged off last night, but on logging in today, the clock and date had altered back to dec.2004,&amp;the time was at mid afternnoon.
 we have been able to alter the date , and the hour, but we cannot alter the minutes, so the clock is running 40 mins fast!. on the old dell ,we ran windows xp, home edition, which allowed you to select 'system restore' and would take you to a calender to clic
 on for previousmonths/days, &amp; you could click a problem away. we can't find this facility, but as we are absolute tehcnophobes it is very lightly that we are missing something. thanks for any advice/help.

<p>Hello JonGrimley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know how important this is to you. I'd be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you sign in with an email address instead, then you have a Microsoft account, not a Skype Name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to add "contact me' buttons and Skype URI link, you need to get your Skype ID using this
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10858/what-s-my-skype-name?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
FAQ link.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for trying to help.&nbsp; This is infuriating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I follow your link, and try every option for which I could have Skype installed, none of them follow through the way the instructions suggest they should. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, on my iPhone, when I'm signed in, it clearly says in settings that my Skype Name is ***@******.***.&nbsp; However, using this doesn't work for the Call For Action button. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,<br />
</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<p>Hi again Susan,</p>

</p><p>Forget it.&nbsp; I'm going to create a new Skype account, specifically using a Skype ID and my own email address.&nbsp; Doing it the Microsoft email way obviously isn't going to let me create the button I want for my website, and I'm over it.</p>

<h2>            Computer very slow after failed update.</h2>
                    I haven't updated windows 10 since I got this computer, which I have had for almost 2 years now. Last week I got a code for a trial of Xbox Game Pass, and I went to the store and saw that I could play Xbox Play Anywhere titles on PC. I went to download
 State of Decay 2 on the Microsoft store and it said I needed the new windows update to play it, so I followed the link and downloaded the updater. The updater went almost all the way through and at 86 or 87 percent failed. At this point, it had been 2 or 3
 hours time to update and I just gave up, turned off my PC and went to bed for the night. The next morning I turned on my PC and after it started I noticed that I was taking a little longer than normal to open Chrome and File Explorer than normal. I blew it
 off and then attempted to play a game. I'm not sure exactly what game but it was either PUBG or Rainbow Six: Siege, but that doesn't really matter. When I got into the game it ran at 20-40 FPS lower than it normally did. I then tested it with other games and
 they all ran slower as well. I then updated all of my drivers and restarted the computer multiple times. None of it helped. I am currently running Windows 10 Home x64 Version 1607. I have tried every possible way to update the computer to see if that would
 fix it and they all gave me an error. I tried the Windows Update Diagnostics, and every time I run it it comes back with the exact same response, it finds an error and tells me to restart and run the update again. Every time the update fails again. I don't
 know what happened to my performance or how to fix it.<br />

            Hi Cauy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is install Media Creation Tool from this link, choosing the button to Install Tool Now and then open the installed app and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the latest version (which you need anyway) and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If these do not help then report back any verbatim error message or behavior.  
<br />
<br />If you want to temporarily block the update then try running the Hide Updates tool downloaded and installed from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />If it wont' find and hide the Update then you can set a Metered Connection to turn off Windows Updates for awhile until the version matures and you can try again using the method I suggest which always works best:   <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Almost everyone with major version upgrade problems who Clean installs the same version does not have those problems.  This Clean Install should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />Detailed steps:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:

<br />
<br />Click Next

<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a Drive with Limited Space
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-upgrade-to-windows-10-creators-update-on-a/d7cdba8b-c59b-4a23-86e2-6635a7e44489">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.

            I tried to use the Media Creation Tool before with no avail, but I tried it again 3 times, one with internet connection, one without, and one using an iso. Every time it failed, and all it said was "Windows Update failed installation" and no error code.
 Also, i did everything on the link you sent to "overcome hurdles"&nbsp; except "sfc /scannow" because every time I try it says "Windows Resource Protection could not start the repair service.", even in safe mode.

<br />Also did you do the step to "Change what to keep" to only files or nothing?  I'd back up my files and choose to save nothing which almost always works.  If it doesn't then it's a badly corrupted install that is choking the Upgrader.
<br />
<br />If Windows Resource Protection won't even start to check System Files then this is  a heavily corrupted install which may not be able to Upgrade.  
<br />
<br />I would wipe the drive to do this Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.

    <title>Rainbow lines after opening laptop from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Rainbow lines after opening laptop from sleep</h2>
                    <p>After opening my laptop screen when it had been sleeping, I get a bunch of rainbow colored lines on my screen and the only way to get rid of it is holding down the power button and forcing my computer to shut down.&nbsp; I did some research on the problem and
 it seems like to main way to fix it is to simply roll back the driver.&nbsp; However, when I go to Device Manager and click Intel Graphics under Display Adapters,&nbsp; the roll back button is grey and I can't click it and roll it back.&nbsp; So that leaves me stuck with
 this rainbow screen every time I open my laptop from sleep, and I don't have a fix for it.&nbsp; Can someone help me fix this?</p>

            Hello Michael, <br />
<br />
We'd like to get more information regarding this so we could further check and provide a more established workaround.
<br />

Any recent changes made to the system that might have caused the issue? <br />
<br />
And do confirm the current build your Windows 10 is running, as this information is vital for us to proceed with the investigation.
<em>(Type <strong>winver </strong>into the Cortana search box, then hit <strong>Enter</strong>.)
</em><br />
<br />
Moreover, uninstall your current driver and manually download and install the driver from the hardware vendor’s website to ensure that you'd have the correct driver on your PC.

    <title>HP stream 7 GTA San Andreas app - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drecolier  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP stream 7 GTA San Andreas app</h2>
                    <p>I have previously purchased this app from another computer. When I try to install it on a newly purchased HP stream 7 I got an error message "Sorry this app can't be installed because your PC might not meet some of the requirements. Go to the app's description
 page to check for any requirements listed under Details."</p>
<p>Under details the only requirement is x86 x64 or ARM processors. The stream 7 has 1gb RAM which I believe is enough for this app. Finally I tried running wsreset.exe but this did not change anything. Please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>EAccess violation error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banditfire  say:</h3>
<h2>            EAccess violation error</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone help me solve this? </p>
<p>I have a laptop running windows 8, Norton 360 security with AMD on a HP.</p>
<p>On turning my computer I got a EAccess violation&nbsp;error&nbsp;, at first it was ok but I read up about it on the internet trying to figure it out, however there were so many examples of this happening that I wasn't entirely sure which one was relevant to my problem,
 the most likely being to do with software updates, I had just received messages from AMD about driver issues.&nbsp; when i closed down the net and opened my desktop everything apart from the recycle bin and PCHelper had somehow been removed, i could access stuff
 on the win 8 App tile screen but stuff such as e-mail apps, news, weather etc had also been removed, some stuff was there but even video files etc had gone. An error message appeared telling me to system restore to a restore point. I did this but everything
 that was gone stayed gone except App tiles that couldn't be used to open what they were for. I have found most stuff through extensive searching but still missing a lot of the basic stuff that came with the computer from the store.&nbsp; The online forum stuff
 doesn't really offer more than just&nbsp;the most basic advice. Looking through my files i can see a lot there, but not there to access if you know what i mean.&nbsp;</p>

            That doesn't look good... You got the bugcheck BAD_SYSTEM_CONFIG_INFO because of an unknown error condition. &nbsp;This occurs when the registry is severely corrupted. If you can't restore from a backup or use system restore to restore the system to a point
 in time prior to the start of the problem...
<blockquote>Try restarting the computer by selecting "last known good configuration" in the boot options. If the restart does not fix the problem, the registry damage is too extensive. You must reinstall the OS or use the Emergency Repair Disk (ERD) that you

<p>In my driver for Windows 7 64 bits, I tried to use KeSaveExtendedProcessorState/KeRestoreExtendedProcessorState to save and restore extended processor states.&nbsp;</p>

I used&nbsp; RtlGetEnabledExtendedFeatures((ULONG64)(-1)) to get the enabled extended features, and use it as the first parameter for KeSaveExtendedProcessorState, and I used MmAllocateContiguousMemory(sizeof(XSTATE_SAVE), highAddress) with&nbsp; highAddress&nbsp; = 0xbfffffff
 to allocate the nonpaged memory used to save the extended states,&nbsp; and raised IRQL to DISPATCH_LEVEL before KeSaveExtendedProcessorState. I got BSOD with following message:</p>

2) Visit the Windows Vista Compatibility Center to perform the following tasks. <br />
3) Determine which software and devices are and are not compatible with Windows 7.
<br />
4) Locate links to drivers and upgrades that will make your computer compatible. <br />
5) Provide input to help us improve the upgrade experience. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
To get started, visit the following Microsoft Web site: <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility</span></a> (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility</span></a>)
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Run the program in compatibility mode<br />
When you select the compatibility mode option, Windows&nbsp;7 emulates the selected operating system when you run that particular program.
<br />
<br />
<strong>To run the program in compatibility mode, follow these steps: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start&nbsp;, and then type the name of the program in the Start Search box. <br />
2) In the Programs list, right-click the program name, and then click Properties.
<br />
3) On the Compatibility tab, click to select the Run this program in compatibility mode for check box.
<br />
4) In the list, select an operating system, and then click OK. <br />
5) If the program still does not work correctly, go to the next method. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong> <br />
Run the program as an administrator<br />
<br />
<strong>To run the program as an administrator, follow these steps: </strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start&nbsp;, and then type the name of the program in the Start Search box. <br />
2) In the Programs list, right-click the program that you are troubleshooting, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.
<br />
3) If the program now runs correctly, the program requires administrative permissions to function. For more information about how to force a program to automatically run with administrative permissions, see the "Step 2: Run the program as an administrator"
 section of the following Microsoft Knowledge Base article:<br />
<br />
(<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931362/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/931362/</span></a> ) Advanced methods to troubleshoot a program that does not run as expected after it is installed on Windows 7<br />
If the program still does not work correctly, go to the next method. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
Contact the program vendor or the hardware manufacturer <br />
If a program will not run in Windows 7, or a piece of hardware does not function as expected after you install Windows 7, contact the program vendor or the hardware manufacturer for guidance about how to troubleshoot the issue. Typically, the software vendor's
 Web site provides a support section that you can use, for example, to search for an error message that you may receive from the program.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Frequently, the software vendor will be able to resolve the incompatibility issue by providing one of the following resolutions:
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
An update to make the current version of the program compatible with Windows&nbsp;7 <br />
A version of the program that is compatible with Windows 7<br />
Information about any configuration changes to make the program compatible with Windows&nbsp;7
<br />
For compatibility of the drivers check this link with windows 7 : <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If these steps fail, You'd have to wait for manufacturer's to update the drivers and then you may visit the manufacturer's website and download the drivers.<br />
<br />
Hope this information helped !<br />

    <title>Sub Account Cannot Log In to Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sub Account Cannot Log In to Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>My son cannot log in to his account which is a sub account of mine. When we try to log him it, the email/account that is associated with his user account is one that I do not recognize. We have had this account for a couple of years and this is the first
 time that we've had this problem. How can I change his profile to once again be linked to the email account that I utilize to manage the primary profile?</p>

<p>Hey Burly,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear your son is having troubles accessing his account. Let's see if we can get this resolved.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So this just recently started happening? <strong>Are you seeing any error codes by chance?
</strong>Are you able to login to Xbox.com with your sons account?<br />
<br />
If you want to change the Microsoft account associated with his gamertag, you will need to regain access to his account.<br />
<br />
Let us know, and we can go from there. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>how do i change the photos app walpaper back to default&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zubayrchohan  say:</h3>
<h2>            how do i change the photos app walpaper back to default&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I was trying the customizability options on the Photos app, and one of the options is to make a photo the wallpaper for the app (the actually app screen, not the live tile, although that is an option too).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I change the wallpaper photo back to the default photo? I do not see an option for this.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft community where you can find all the answers related to windows.</div>
<div><br />
As per the description provided, it looks like you are having issues with Photo App . As I get it right you need to revert to the default wallpaper in photos app.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, we cannot revert to the default photo once a particular photo is set as Wallpaper.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Reply to us if you face any issues with Photo app or any other Windows Issue, and I would be glad to assist you.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Have a nice day!</div>

<div>Hope this information helps. <br />
