            <p><strong><span>Hi
</span></strong><span><span>Richiebug<strong><span>,</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>1. Do you have updated display drivers installed on the computer?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the computer?</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><b><span>Method
 1: </span></b></span></span></span><span><span><span><b><span><br />
</span></b></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>I would suggest you to disable and then enable the game spider solitaire on expanding games – internet games feature
 from the Windows on or off features option and check if this resolves the issue. You will have to disable the feature then click ok. Now open the game check. Again you may enable the game (internet spades) and check if you face the same issue.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Refer the below link to view the window for disabling and enabling games -

<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>You
 may perform a SFC (System File Checker) scan. It will list any issues and will also recover any files if needed.
<b>Follow the below steps to</b> <b>p<span>erform a SFC Scan</span></b>&nbsp;-<br />
<br />
a. Click <b>Start</b>, click <b>All Programs</b>, click <b>Accessories</b>, right-click
<b>Command Prompt</b>, and then click <b>Run&nbsp;as administrator</b>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<b>Allow<br />
</b><span>b. </span>Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
<b>sfc /scannow&nbsp; <br />
</b>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time.<b><br />
</b><span>c. </span>If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process to continue.<b><br />
</b><span>d. </span>If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations".<b><br />
</b><span>e. </span>After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Check the below mentioned link for further guidance on SFC scan

<p>Hi AndreiF7,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your computer is in hybrid shutdown mode that's why it appears not fully turned off. To sort out this behavior, I suggest disabling the hybrid shutdown in the Power Options. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the <em>Cortana search</em>, type in <strong>powercfg.cpl</strong>, and hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Once the <em>Power Options</em> window is up, click <strong>Choose what the power buttons do</strong> on the left pane.</li><li>To activate <strong>Shutdown settings</strong>, click <strong>Change settings that are currently unavailable</strong>.</li><li>Uncheck <strong>Turn on fast startup</strong>, then click <strong>Save changes</strong>.</li><li>Shutdown your computer, then turn it back on.</li><li>Once up, re-access the<strong> Power options </strong>and <strong>re-enable the Turn on fast startup</strong>, then save the changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please observe the lights on your computer and see if the lights remain on when you shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>
        </p>

<p>Thanks for the update, Andrei. It seems that your computer just enters into hibernation when the fast startup is enabled. In that case, please turn off the fast startup again in order for your computer to fully shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to let us know if you need further help.</p>

<h2>            MS Help and Support Center in XP</h2>
                    <p>Sometime in the last couple of weeks my PC's Help Center&nbsp;has lost the ability to also&nbsp;search in MS Knowledge Base. The only change I have made in that time is to add Remote Desktop. I have tried the usual sfc scan but it still does not search as it did.</p>

1) I get the first two listings OK - Suggested Topics (X results)</p>
<p>Full-text Search Matches (Y results)</p>
<p>But for the third list, which is the Internet KB box, (0 results)</p>
<p>2) No, I do not get any error messages.</p>
<p>Just to confirm, I m using XP Pro SP3 with all updates. And of course, as you can see, I have an Internet connection!</p>

Yes, I have as stated, XP Pro</p>
<p>No, in Set Search Options I only have check boxes for Suggested Topics and Full-Text Search Matches. The MS KB is not there and the Tools Centered ..... is not there. But, there is one more check box below the two that are there, WITHOUT any form of description.
 The space on the page&nbsp;to the right of that box&nbsp;is devoid of anything.</p>
<p>Yes, I can run gpedit.msc.</p>
<p>No, the only&nbsp;folder under Administrative Templates is Windows Components. There is no System shown. In the 8 folders under Win Comps they are all Not Configured.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;then closed Groip Policy, opened Help and Support Center and reopened Group Policy - the result was the same as above.</p>
<p>If it is possible to add screenshots to this discussion, let me know and I can send some.</p>

<p><br />
I have made the changes/checks in this and your previous message and <br />
rebooted . No change to Help! The search options still only shows an <br />
isolated checkbox with no text where the search KB choice should be.<br />
<br />
I have made other checks -<br />
1.&nbsp; my wifes desktop and my portable both run the same OS with all updates. <br />
Those two both have a complete Help and Support Center with all the search <br />
options. The GP for them has even less templates and are also all 'not <br />
configured'.<br />
2.&nbsp; On this desktop (which has the problem) I see that two recent automatic <br />
updates show failures. KB2727528 and KB2761226<br />
On the other two computers the updates are shown as OK<br />
<br />
I have now installed both the updates using the manual method and the <br />
failure icons have been replaced by success icons.<br />
<br />
There is also an MS security essentials update shown as failing - KB2310138 <br />
but I have used the Update menu directly on&nbsp;MSE and it did not report any <br />
problems. I found many, many community complaints about that update! I could not find a download for it so could not manually install it. So I don't know if that now has any relevance?
<br />
</p>
<p>At the end of all that, the HSC still does not find KB results and the options still does not include it! (Task Manager shows helpctr.exe as a running process)</p>
<p>Perhaps you have more ideas to test first, or the HSC needs a reinstall - I believe that is possible?</p>

            Is this a new observation/information:<br />
<br />
<i>The search options still only shows an isolated checkbox with no text where the search KB choice should be.</i><br />
<br />
<br />
In your GPE, set the option from Not Configured to Enabled, exit GPE, reboot, then change it back to Not Configured, then take a look.<br />
<br />
Usually with H&amp;S problems I also ask this question:<br />
<br />
Have you now or have you ever used any third party applications on your system where the product description includes such descriptive phrases as:<br />
<br />
cleaner, mechanic, detective, doctor, cure, optimize, inspector, clean up, tune up, speed up, fix up, compact, compress, faster, power, boost, booster, eraser, muncher. one click fix, new, intuitive, mistakes, stops crashes, stops errors, improves, saves you
 money, risk free, guaranteed or any third party program that has an icon resembling a gear, cog, tool belt, wrench, spanner, screwdriver or swooping arrows?<br />
<br />
If you want to reinstall your H&amp;S you can do that too:<br />
<br />
Using Windows Explorer, browse to and locate c:\windows\inf\pchealth.inf, right click the file and choose to Install.<br />
<br />
If your XP is installed in the WINDOWS folder on your C drive, you should be able to find the file in the following folder:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\inf<br />
<br />
If you do not see any .inf files in the c:\windows\inf folder, click Tools, Folder Options, View and tick the option:<br />
<br />
Show hidden files and folders<br />
<br />
Then UNtick the option:<br />
<br />
Hide extensions for known file types<br />
<br />
(You can undo those adjustments later if it is your desire)<br />
<br />
Now you should be able to see all the .inf files in the folder (you can undo this Explorer adjustment later if desired).<br />
<br />
When you reinstall your Help and Support Center, you may be prompted to enter your XP installation CD as it looks for the installation files.&nbsp; Most people do not have an XP installation CD, so you need to tell the installation where to find the files it needs
 by looking in other places on your hard disk.<br />
<br />
If Help and Support was working before, the files are on your system somewhere and you just need to point the installation process to the files and their locations.<br />
<br />
You may want to look below at the list of files that the reinstallation is going to need and locate the files on your system before you start the installation so you will know where to tell the installation to look when it needs a file.<br />
<br />
When the installation starts, if it asks for a file and you don't have an XP installation CD, change the "Copy file from" dialogue (by clicking the Browse and Retry buttons) to point to the appropriate folder for each requested file so the installation can
 find it on your hard disk.<br />
<br />
Usually, the files are in these folders.<br />
<br />
HelpCtr.exe&nbsp; (c:\windows\system32\dllcache) or c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries<br />
racpldlg.dll (c:\windows\system32) or c:\windows\system32\dllcache)<br />
UploadM.exe&nbsp; (c:\windows\system32\dllcache) or c:\windows\pchealth\UploadLB\Binaries<br />
pchdt_w3.cab (c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries)<br />
HCAppRes.dll (c:\windows\pchealth\helpctr\binaries)<br />
atrace.dll&nbsp;&nbsp; (c:\windows\system32)<br />
<br />
If those files are not in the same place on your system, you need to just stop the installation part for a minute and use the built in Windows Search function to find the file, then when you find where it is, you can resume the installation and point it to
 the folder that contains the file it needs.<br />
<br />
Perform a Windows Search on your system for the file you need and then point the installation to the correct folder on your system so the installation can find the file.&nbsp; If you just can't find the file, let us know what file you need and you can download it
 from some nice person's SkyDrive so you will have it (just leave the installation hanging/waiting until you get the file(s) you need).<br />
<br />
After reinstalling the Help and Support Center, reboot and make sure the Help and Support Service is running and set to Manual or Automatic Start.<br />
<br />
To do that, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
services.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the Services applet.<br />
<br />
Locate the Help and Support Service, highlight it, right click it and choose 'Start' (or click the right pointing arrow on the top toolbar).<br />
<br />
When the Help and Support Service is running, you will see the word 'Started' in the Services Status column.<br />

<h2>            Section of clip deletes automatically when splitting a clip</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: In Movie Maker, why is it deleting a lot my clips when i split a clip?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, i just started editing a video and i was quite a bit into it and had been splitting a lot of clips before this problem happened. But then, when i started editing the video the next day, the first time i tired to split a clip it just deleted a whole giant
 section of clips after it, but left just a little bit of the ending. I don't know how to fix this, but all i can think to do is to save it as a movie and try editing it again(which would take a really long time, since the movie is really long). PLEASE RESPOND
 QUICKLY! Thank You!! </p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My son's birthday today and he received 2 x £10 Xbox vouchers. He has come home at end of day desperate to load the money onto FIFA.&nbsp; I have redeemed the vouchers to my account and then, via Microsoft family, have tried to add funds to his account but keep
 getting error message.&nbsp; I have added money once before to his account without a problem, a few weeks ago via credit card. Seems to be nothing to do with the vouchers as I don't get an option for how to add the funds eg. credit card/gift voucher etc. Have seen
 several similar postings with the same problem but no answer how to resolve other that trying every few hours/days.&nbsp; Seriously Microsoft ?&nbsp; I have never bought vouchers before that cannot redeemed simply and immediately. Well fed up !</p>

<p>Hi Alexey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked myself from the US marketplace and a few Xbox 360 games that are on the Deals with Gold site are not listed properly with the discounted price and DmC is not the only game not showing the correct discounted price. I checked and all of the Xbox
 One deals are shown discounted properly but a couple of the Xbox 360 games may just need some more time to update the correct price on the Xbox 360 marketplace.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest waiting a few days and check back later as I have already asked someone to look into this matter.</p>

<p>Hello Gypsy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're unable to format your SD card from <em>File</em> <em>Explorer</em>, I recommend using the
<strong>Disk</strong> <strong>Management</strong> tool. Please make sure that you're signed in as administrator before following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button.</li><li>Select <strong>Computer</strong> <strong>Management</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Storage</strong> &gt; <strong>Disk</strong> <strong>Management</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your SD card and select <strong>Format</strong>.</li><li>Enter the <strong>Volume</strong> <strong>label</strong>, set the <strong>File</strong>
<strong>system</strong>, and select the check box for <strong>Perform a quick format</strong> before clicking
<strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong> again to complete.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            Items too large for Inspiron mini 10 - Windows XP</h2>
                    <p>Hello all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Inspiron Mini 10 - Windows XP and I have recently put it through a factory reset just to give it a new start as it seem to be runing slowly.&nbsp; Now that it's back the speede it fine however I have a problem with my screen.&nbsp; Everything it too
 big i.e. the icons, start button etc.&nbsp; It means when I have any program up I have to scroll all around.&nbsp; I have changed the zoom level for each individual programme however it doesn't help.&nbsp; I have been in control panel and tried to change the screen resoluntion
 however it doesn't allow me to scroll from one setting to another, which I guess was the solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have this problem before the factory reset, so I'm guessing it must me a easy soluntion which I'm not aware of.&nbsp; Is there&nbsp;a drive which I've missed off?&nbsp; I have downloaded all the updates which windows has sent through.&nbsp; Not sure what else do to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help I would appreciate it.&nbsp; Microsofts soluntion was 'buy a new PC', not helpful!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            Yup, you need graphic drivers. Click on the link LemP gave, then go to Drivers &amp; Downloads, expand the Video category, and the download you want is Intel Graphics_Media. The other downloads in that category are not needed.<br />

</p>
<p>If that doesn't work ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years, Dell has had a number of different methods of doing a "factory reset," so I don't know what you might have done ... but it sounds as if you didn't reinstall the drivers, specifically, the driver for the video adapter.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Fails to install CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION</h2>
                    <p>I have now tried 4 times to Upgrade from Windows 7 64 bit to Windows 10 with no success.&nbsp; The last two attempts were using the ISO creation tool (which has to do the compete download each time!).&nbsp; I have disconnected all USB devices, disabled WiFi.<br />
<br />
Dell 1749 Laptop</p>
<p>Windows 7 Pro 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to update my Surface Pro, and two ESlate tablets without issue.&nbsp; I'm about to give up on my Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Installation goes through to "Installing Drivers and Features" and then gives the frowny face error :&nbsp;-/ and references CRITICAL_STRUCTURE_CORRUPTION.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It also says it will restart for me, but it doesn't.&nbsp; After 2 reboots, it finally restores&nbsp; my Windows 7, and it appears to be functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't seen any suggestions beyond "use ISO Creation Tool", which I have obviously done already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like to get Windows 10 Installed, but unless I can get a definitive answer to this issue, I'll just have to stick with 7.&nbsp; I just can't afford to spend several more hours trying to get this going,</p>
<p>

            <p>The crash is caused by the same problem plaguing most Upgrades which is&nbsp; factory installed bloatware which is the worst install of Windows one can have.&nbsp; Specifically this has been traced to Alcohol 120% driver, Android emulator, Daemon Tools (not even compatible
 with WIndows 7), and others listed in <a href="http://www.myce.com/news/upgraded-to-windows-10-and-getting-error-critical_structure_corruption-heres-the-fix-77333/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Microsoft has bought Minecraft for 2.5 billion. .. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft has bought Minecraft for 2.5 billion. ..</h2>
                    
<p>First off, is any game really worth that much? They can't possibly make the money back just by selling the game, unless they take a split out of YouTube commentators. Secondly, &nbsp;this is a good thing for Xbox owners, &nbsp;maybe we'll start seeing updates a lot
 more.... but the other platforms, they're worried about what Microsoft will do to the game... Sony uses think they'll pull Minecraft from Playstation (highly unlikely) and some are worried about updates being held back, as a timed exclusive for Xbox (could
 happen).&nbsp;</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this?&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only report I saw that mentioned the math gave a complicated goofy rich people argument...and here it goes:</p>
<p>- MS makes more money by buying the developer and selling the game and sequels (and licensing fees, merch, whatever) than the interest that the 2.5bil in the bank would make just sitting there doing nothing.</p>
<p>The studio was going up for sale anyway so they also keep if away from competitors. They said "Microsoft expects the acquisition of Mojang to be break-even on a GAAP basis in fiscal 2015, which ends next June."</p>
<p>So...hey, it's makes sense to them...</p>

We can analyze the minidumps if you make them available from the SkyDrive or other
<br />
file sharing sites (such as MediaFire). If you have problems uploading the minidumps
<br />
copy them to the Desktop or the Documents folder and upload them from there.<br />
<br />
Zip or upload the contents of C:\Windows\minidump
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files.&nbsp;<br />

<br />
Many Bluescreens are caused by&nbsp;BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and other major device drivers<br />
which are not the most current even though the computer is new. Check manually for updates<br />
using the methods for updates as&nbsp;indicated in the troubleshooter linked above and/or the

<br />
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code<br />
<br />
</strong>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer,
 call the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen. <br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and provide a link to it so we can analyze it.

<strong><br />
</strong><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t boot into Windows after last 1803 cumulative update &#40;as - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sre.bmi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t boot into Windows after last 1803 cumulative update &#40;as of 8&#47;24&#41;</h2>
                    <p>The current cumulative update is causing my system to be unable to boot into Windows. I've confirmed that the problem does not occur until I reboot after the update is applied. This is on Win 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, I am able to restore my computer back into a working state by using a Windows Server 2016 Essentials backup image. Immediately after the restore, the computer works again. Apply the 1803 cumulative update only, reboot, and it fails to load Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it fails, I'm stuck at the logo screen (an Asus logo in my case) with the spinning dots. The dots will spin for a short amount of time, then will freeze. Once frozen, the reset button is unresponsive - so whatever it is, it's causing things to crash
 pretty badly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this helps, but the diagnostic LED on my motherboard reads AA when this happens. This indicates that this is in the boot phase after the AHCI handoff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a few reboots I end up in an endless automatic repair loop. I went to the command prompt to pull up the log file and it says that bootres.dll is corrupt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what exactly is causing this, but I am able to consistently reproduce it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So a few questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Is there a fix so I can successfully apply the update?</li><li>Is Microsoft aware of this?</li><li>Anything that I can do to help fix it?</li><li>Or do I just restore and refrain from ever updating Windows again and hope that a new update is released later that doesn't have this issue?</li></ol>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Ok, I may have resolved this on my end. I did a number of different things, so not 100% sure which.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I updated my BIOS to the latest version. I noticed that the update has Intel execution stuff in it, so I updated my BIOS to a version that had the latest vulnerability fixes
</li><li>I found there were updated X99 chipset drivers (2018 ones) and updated those too
</li><li>Updated my graphics card driver while I was at it </li><li>Updated my Logitech drivers while I was at it </li></ol>
<p>I was then able to do a Windows update and no more spinning balls of death. Interestingly KB4343909 is no longer showing up when I check for updates (and it didn't install) and I had originally thought that was causing the crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I discovered that its prerequisite KB4100347 was also causing me to lock up. I was finally able to successfully install that without lock ups.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My gut feeling is that if this is resolved, it was done by the BIOS updates or the chipset update, but I'm leaning towards the BIOS update. I already did steps 3 and 4 and crashed, so don't think those were the fix.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plug for Microsoft -&nbsp; I love having a Windows Server 2016 Essentials setup. Restoring from backup is pretty painless (boot off USB, select an image, go watch TV for an hour or two) and it takes away the risk of trying something and failing and messing everything
 up because you can always go back to the last known good point and try again and again and again until you figure it out. I must have restored 5 times before resolving this.

            You installed MacAfee, the worst antivirus anyone could possibly install on their PC? Where did any one advise you to install MacAfee?
<br />
<br />
I gave you very specific instructions how to save yourself from the virus attack based on helping tens of thousands of others in the forums for ten years daily.
<br />
<br />
Are you going to begin those steps now? Uninstall MacAfee first. Then Run the best scanner I gave you.
<br />
<br />
May I ask why you gave me a bad rating when I gave you the absolute best advice for how to handle this attack on your PC?&nbsp; If you don't want my help then you'll need to take it to a shop and pay $150 minimum I was trying to help you save.

<h2>            What can I do with the Microsoft Office Japanese Language Pack&#63;</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
I would like to be able to use various systems on my PC in Japanese, particularly writing Yahoo e-mails, writing when using Skype, and when using Word. I have Windows Vista Home Premium. If I buy the Microsoft Office Japanese Language pack, will that fulfill
 the above requirements?<br />
<br />
Thank you!

            KaraokeKing,<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />

There are several different ways you can go here, depending on exactly what all you need to be able to do.&nbsp; You can enable any language in any Windows, but different versions of Vista have different capabilities.<br />
<br />
There is no barrier to using Japanese language applications on Vista<br />
Home, including the Japanese version of Microsoft Office, or other applications.<br />
The Japanese font files, and NLS Support for many other langauges, are<br />
available and installed by default in every installation of Vista, no matter<br />
whether Home, Business, Enterprise or Ultimate.&nbsp; You can enable Japanese keyboard in Control
<br />
Panel, under Regional and Language Options, Keyboards and Languages.<br />
<br />
To install the Windows Japanese Language Multilingual Interface ("MUI"), you would need to upgrade to Windows Vista Ultimate.&nbsp; The MUI is not supported on the Home Edition.
<br />
The MUI makes all of Windows' own menus, icon labels, help text, etc appear in the given langauge -&nbsp;such as&nbsp;Japanese. If you had a Japanese speaker who cannot read or understand "Start" or "Control Panel", then you would need the Japaense MUI. If you have a
 bilingual English/Japanese speaker who can understand "Start", "Applications", and "Microsoft Office", they can then use the English language version of Vista Home to start the Japanese version of Microsoft Office (or whatever).<br />

<h2>            Skype won&#39;t Logout</h2>
                    Hi. I can't sign out of skype or exit skype like I'm suppose to be able to. I right-click on the skype for desktop icon in my taskbar, left click on sign out and nothing happens. So I manually go into Skype and then log out from the window itself. Then
 I try to exit skype by right-clicking on the icon again, then left clicking on the exit skype command and nothing happens. I have to force quit skype all the time.

<h2>            Error Code 0x80240020 on Windows 7 Ultimate - Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>I am receiving error 0x80240020. I have tried all types of fixes including Microsoft's automatic fix. I have disabled my firewall and anti-virus. There has been no changes to my registry, or any type of installed software.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a system restore to the last critical update on 8/16 however I got the same error when trying to find updates. I can not install printers on the machines because it wants to connect to Windows Update but it can not.</p>

<p>
</p><p>3. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer
<em>since you bought it</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">when</span> you bought it?</em> (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>
