<h2>            Windows 10 - random windows open&#47;close by themselves</h2>
                    <p>For the past few months random windows have been opening and then immediately closing by themselves. &nbsp;It's like quick flashes on the screen. &nbsp;You can also see the blue lines in the task bar at the bottom come and go as if something is opening/closing. &nbsp;Restarting
 the computer has no effect. &nbsp;I'm not sure what's going on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a short, 10-sec video so you can see what I'm talking about:&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/TGdVqaOq544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">YouTube</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/TGdVqaOq544?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/TGdVqaOq544?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any idea what the problem could be?</p>

    <title>Windows 7 device driver upgrade &#34;search automatically&#34; option - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> skris88  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 device driver upgrade &#34;search automatically&#34; option immediately fails</h2>
                    I guess I am truly testing the capabilities of Windows 7 as I am running it off an old, slow desktop PC, and my Internet access (due to overuse) has been cut down to 64kbps (8bKps)!<br />
<br />
(And it's fast!&nbsp; The shut-down/re-boot time is amazingly quicker than even XP.)<br />
<br />
Having said that, I have done this many times with Windows XP and Vista, I install Windows, then connect up a USB Wi-Fi dongle, and access the Internet through that.&nbsp; I then right-click on my Other devices/Ethernet Controller (for which a driver has not automatically
 been installed), and select Update Driver Software....&nbsp; It's worked without a problem - on XP and Vista.<br />
<br />
I've done the same now with Win7-RC, and am surfing the Internet without a problem (if a little slowly).&nbsp; However the option "Search automatically for updated driver software" takes but ½ a second to respond with an "Windows could not find driver software for
 your device" error.&nbsp; It does not appear to even check the (fully working, but slow) Internet at all.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The previous screen did say, "Windows will search your computer and the Internet for the latest driver software for your device, UNLESS YOU'VE DISABLED THIS FEATURE IN YOUR DEVICE INSTALLATION SETTINGS."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is a fresh install, and I have not knowingly
 set any such option (with XP there used to be an "always check Internet/check Internet this time only" choice).<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Is this a time-out issue (½ a second?!!) or some other pre-release bug?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Before anyone says, Yes I could download the drivers onto the C: drive and point the Upgrade Driver app to there, but that is not the goal of this; also some people may be using Win7 via dial up modem access.... ;-)<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<p>correction on DaveD350's reply<br />
<br />
to change Device Installation Settings do as follows:<br />
<br />
Click <strong>Control Panel<br />
</strong>Click <strong>System<br />
</strong>Click <strong>Advanced System Settings</strong><br />
Click <strong>Hardware Tab</strong><br />
Click <strong>Device Installation Settings<br />
<br />
</strong>as many things in Windows 7, there is multiple paths to the same settings</p>

    <title>PC Only boots to repair mode after Windows 7 Service Pack 1 install. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_mole  say:</h3>
<h2>            PC Only boots to repair mode after Windows 7 Service Pack 1 install.</h2>
                    <p>Using Windows 7 32bit professional. I have a working system, that is fully patched with everything except Service pack 1. Everytime I apply service pack 1 (tested this 4 times with clean installs) the system will only boot into the repair system, it will
 not boot the system, it boots into recovery mode before I can even try safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The service pack appears to install cleanly, upon initial reboot, the system goes through the 3 stages ok, "applying updates".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the machine reboots (automaticallly reboots after stage 3 of the install completes) it will only reboot into repair mode and I have to use an image back to restore the system from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I've said, I'm certain this is Windows 7 Service Pack 1, I've done 4 clean installs, ran the machine for hours, all stable, worked through each patch manually, no problems. This situation only happens after service pack 1 is installed.</p>

</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<strong><span>Method 2: </span><span>Troubleshoot problems installing a service pack for
<span>Windows&nbsp;7</span> or <span>Windows&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2008&nbsp;R2</span></span> </strong>

</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span>&nbsp; <b>Disable the security software temporarily.</b></span></p>
<p><span>You may also temporarily disable security software’s and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable those security software's on the computer after checking.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a></span><span><br />

<p><span>If disabling the security software resolves the issue then, please contact the specific security software manufacturer to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note: </span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Clean Boot</span></b></p>

<p>1b. I have done a clean install of Microsoft Windows 7 professional 32bit on the day I logged this problem, March 15 2012: I have also done 4 clean installs on this same day to verify the problem was at the service pack 1 install. To aid debugging I have
 done additional clean installs March 16th 2012</p>
<p>2. I have no antivirus installed at the moment for testing. The first install I had when I logged this call I was running Microsoft security essentials. after reading the advice on this thread I did subsiquent clean installs not installing any antivirus
 software </p>
<p>3. the initial install came with no antivirus installed. I used AVG during it's initial install, and no virus was detected. I did not use the machine (powered off) for a while. I decided to use it again, did a clean install and hit this issue. This machine

<p>A <em>very </em>bad move, my friend. Your computer should NEVER be connected to the internet without a fully-functional anti-virus application installed!</p>
<p>Chances are you're seeing the effects of a hijackware infection now, possibly compounded by a rootkit (or bootkit) infection.&nbsp; See...</p>

            <p>look - please put a little bit of thought behind these answers rather than trying to find a quick way out and blame something&nbsp;without actually diagnosing the solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>it would be a massive help if you could actually read the information I've given before randomly saying "oh it's a virus"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've patched the machine using windows update BECAUSE microsoft offered these updates to as "recommended updates" and I can't install anything else through windows update WITHOUT installing service pack 1 - this isn't me "wanting it" this is me taking an
 update microsoft is forcing me to use (and rightly so) and having my machine crash each time I apply it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't a "root kit" I've done multiple clean installs, all this is detailed in the information above if you could read it properly instead of looking for the one line "I'm not using antivirus" and jumping on it as an easy blame option. I'll spell out
 the information again clearly bellow so you can get a better understanding that this is a problem with the application of this recommended microsoft patch rather than an root kit
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.) the initial problem occured I was running Microsoft Security essentials - I tried a CLEAN install without antivirus AFTER the problem</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.) I have just done ANOTHER clean install, used microsoft security essentials again, disabled it before service pack 1 install, SAME PROBLEM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have done ANOTHER clean install used AVG antivirus, installed service pack 1, SAME PROBLEM, this is not a "virus".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.) I've now run this test from a private enterprise network which is using symantic endpoint protection at a network level - the same issue has occured.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please stop looking for an easy "get out" of resolving the problem. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are no virus, I've done multiple clean installs from two different official Microsoft microsoft Windows 7 32bit CD media. I've downloaded service pack 1 using microsoft windows update, I've downloaded microsoft windows 7 service pack 1 on another computer,
 virus scanned it moved it o the local machine and run it , same problem each time.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had exactly the same issue yesterday, only I just tried to install it once.&nbsp; It did fine after most of the updates, but it got to service pack 1, went through 3 stages of "applying updates" just fine, automatically reboots, and ends up in startup repair.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In trying to troubleshoot this problem, I came across this thread.&nbsp; I only bothered to try it once since you showed that multiple tries doesn't typically do anything.&nbsp; Then I read the advice "You have a rootkit on there since you connected to the internet
 without an antivirus."&nbsp; After he also said that you shouldn't have tried to install it outside of windows update, which was obviously not the case, I knew that he hadn't actually read the question, and my gut feeling was to disregard his advice.&nbsp; Long story
 short, I should have.&nbsp; I was paranoid, though, because a computer on my network was fairly recently hijacked after some idiot enabled remote login from some obvious default username and password.&nbsp; So I booted Kaspersky Rescue Disk (basically a linux live CD
 with virus scan utilities, it is much more effective at finding rootkits because they never get a chance to load and disguise themselves when you're booting off of a CD) and let it scan my entire file system and hard drive for any viruses or rootkits.&nbsp; Like
 8 hours later, it came back reporting that I didn't have anything suspicious.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I did a number of things differently this next time, I don't know which of these steps fixed it, but I'll just tell you all of them, no matter how improbable it seems that that was the fix.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I decided to wipe everything off of the hard drive completely, more than just reformatting it, because once again, I was paranoid.&nbsp; I got most of the way through overwriting my SSD (I have a SSD rather than hard drive) with random data from the
 system rescue disk (inside of terminal, I ran dd if="/dev/urandom" of="/dev/sda").&nbsp; It got presumably most of the way through it overnight, but then I started messing with it and it became unresponsive, so I hard rebooted it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I then booted Linux off of another external media (I have an eSATA drive with Linux installed, but you could do the same with an ubuntu live cd/dvd/flash drive).&nbsp; From the terminal, I filled the hard drive with all zeros (sudo dd if="/dev/zero"
 of="/dev/sda" (or something like that)). <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -After the zero fill was complete (it took forever, probably because it's a 512gb ssd), I used a partition editor within Linux (I used gparted, I think there are others). I created a new MS-DOS style partition table, then I created three partitions.&nbsp;
 The first was an NTFS partition for my windows installation, the next was an ext3 partition for a Linux dual boot that I had in mind, and the third was a swap partition for the aforementioned Linux install.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -When I went to install Windows, I selected my already formatted NTFS partition to install Windows on.&nbsp; As a result of my partitioning, Windows did not create a system reserved partition on my hard drive. I'm not sure what you have to do to keep
 Windows from creating the system reserved partition, but since this is where the system restore stuff is located, not having it might be significant.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -When I first booted, I copied a driver for my ethernet adapter and Microsoft Security Essentials onto the computer, and installed them.&nbsp; Those were the only two pieces of software that I put on there.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I then went through and installed updates, while scanning my computer with MSE.&nbsp; In retrospect, this was probably a bad idea, because two of my updates did not install correctly, possibly because windows was trying to install them as MSE was scanning
 the system directories of windows.&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -I then just went through installing all updates. I didn't so much as change the background, open a browser window, or anything in the meantime.&nbsp; I just let it go through many check for updates, install, restart cycles.&nbsp; This is vastly different
 from what I did the first time around, because then, when I was installing updates, I was also installing all of the drivers that I could find, MATLAB, MS Office, Cygwin, and all of the other software packages that I use.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -When it got to SP1, it went through without a hitch.&nbsp; It restarted several times, but actually worked when it restarted.&nbsp; One interesting thing is that by my memory, initially it said something like stage 3/7 before (not sure, maybe I'm crazy),
 anyway, this time, it only showed step 1/3,2/3,3/3. <br />
<br />
Everything seems to be in good working order for me now.&nbsp; Best of luck, I hope something I said helps someone figure out what is causing this (and how to prevent it).&nbsp;
<br />

<div>That symptom can be caused by interference from an antivirus program. Which antivirus are you running? Some of them cause problems with Windows Mail over time. As a minimum, email scanning in the antivirus should be turned off, although that may not be
 sufficient to eliminate all bad effects. In a worst case scenario, your antivirus may need to be uninstalled/reinstalled or replaced. A free antivirus that is 100% compatible is available here:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Virus, Spyware &amp; Malware Protection Microsoft</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your mail account may be corrupted. One thing you should try as a possible quick fix is to delete that corrupted mail account, restart Windows Mail, then recreate that account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Email scanning in any antivirus should be disabled, for reasons explained here:</div>
<div><a href="http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thundercloud.net/infoave/tutorials/email-scanning/index.htm</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As an alternative to replacing your antivirus, consider upgrading to Windows Live Mail, because it is less prone to suffering bad effects from overly intrusive antivirus programs:</div>

<p>Hi Gary</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips.&nbsp; I deleted McAfee and it didn't fix the problem, so I reinstalled it but disabled the email checking portion.&nbsp; Hope I don't get a Viris!!</p>
<p>Regarding your suggestion to uninstall Windows Mail, how do I do that?&nbsp; I want to save my Contacts and approx. 15 emails.&nbsp; I recall when Dell had to reimage my hard drive.&nbsp; Even though the Dell guy told me how to save everything, he forgot several essential
 things and for one thing, it was a serious pain to reconstruct my email contact.</p>

<div>I didn’t know that your antivirus program was McAfee, or else I would have advised you that simply uninstalling it is insufficient to remove all its tentacles. You have to use their special crud removal utility:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you decide to replace McAfee, we can recommend a free antivirus program which is more compatible with Windows Mail.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did not suggest uninstalling Windows Mail since it can’t be uninstalled. Simply install Windows Live Mail and it will import all your Windows Mail data and take over the default mail program function.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Even with WLM, you must disable email scanning in the antivirus, for the reason explained here:</div>

<p>Hi Gary</p>
<p>Thanks for the tips.&nbsp; I deleted McAfee and it didn't fix the problem, so I reinstalled it but disabled the email checking portion.&nbsp; Hope I don't get a Viris!!</p>
<p>Regarding your suggestion to uninstall Windows Mail, how do I do that?&nbsp; I want to save my Contacts and approx. 15 emails.&nbsp; I recall when Dell had to reimage my hard drive.&nbsp; Even though the Dell guy told me how to save everything, he forgot several essential
 things and for one thing, it was a serious pain to reconstruct my email contact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great news.&nbsp; I used the McAfee Crud Removal tool, and had the Road Runner help desk verify my server settings, and now Windows Mail works!!!&nbsp; The final hangup was, on Windows Mail, Tools, Accounts, Properties, Servers...&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to check "My server Requires

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you get the error code, 0x80070426&nbsp; when you try to use the Windows defender. Also that the SFC scan was unable to fix it even in the safe mode. That being said, please try to do a DISM scan and check if it helps. Ensure that the computer
 is connected to the internet when you do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a Windows PE image. The DISM tool replaces the Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe),
 PEimg, and Intlcfg tools. DISM consolidates the functionality found in those three tools, as well as delivers new functionality to improve the experience of offline servicing.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the given steps to run a DISM scan:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) Press Windows + x on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select Command prompt (Admin) to open Administrator Command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3) In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, please try to run a clean boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in</span><strong><span>Clean Boot
</span></strong><span>state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>DISCLAIMER:
</span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>

            Sorry, I was unable to check if this worked, after the update (and after I posted this question) I saw my Killer network drivers were out of date, after uninstalling the old drivers windows did not let me instal the new drivers, also access to windows
 device manager was denied and I am the only user on the PC and admin, I had to reformat my drive and there are no issues now, luckily windows 10 was on a USB the reformat was easy and quick.

            <p>I also have this issue, and have been working on it for a number of hours. I'm replying to this particular post however, as I notice the original poster @Misterz100 has "killer network drivers" .. I too have the same, and am using a Gigabyte Gaming-5 motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have noticed that if I reset the motherboard bios to its default settings, I get one good boot, with no errors at all. when I reboot again however, the errors reappear. (I can reset bios to default again, and get a clean boot).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows defender service states that it is running, however it is using an increased amount of memory. It can be found under "processes" in the task manager, under "Anitimalware service executable" which points to "C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MsMpEng.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows Defender service is also set to "Automatic" in the services application, and the Windows Defender Network Inspection Service, is set to "Manual".</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the original post, these issues started after being forcibly upgraded to build 1607. At first I couldn't even log in to my system, as it just came up with a black screen. I managed to resolve this by going in to safe mode, and found a program that
 set to run at start, which had become incompatible after the update. That update seemingly removed all of my restore points as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your suggestions here with the dism.exe, and sfc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am hoping that I don't have to resort to the extreme of reinstalling from scratch. &nbsp;Do you have any further suggestions?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>And also tried updating Intel Drivers, and a registry edit as per this reddit thread;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/4vufpo/windows_10_fully_freezes_after_anniversary_update/</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nothing seemed to have fixed the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the windows backup systems, or recovery systems seemed to be working, so I used a 3rd party tool to create an entire clone of my drive, and also backed up all of my documents seperately. I then created a Windows 10 Installation USB drive using the
 tool found at;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>From there, I booted in to windows, ran the installer off the USB, and told it to do an "Upgrade" .. it took around 3 hours to perform this. I am currently running Version 1607 (14393.0) which is what I was running before the "upgrade".</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that my error message has gone away, there are still some errors in the event viewer, but not nearly as many. The only thing I appear to have lost (Other than 24 hours of time) is my drivers, which I had downloaded in preparation for this anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't provide further updates from here, it's because everything has continued working. Hopefully my troubleshooting can assist someone else in getting this poorly deployed update to work for them.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>I finally was able to isolate the problem to an adware or spyware that was not install by me. I forgot the exact name of the adware because I didn't take note of it before I uninstalled it. But the trace can be found in the Startup Menu from System Configuration.</p>
<p>The procedure is to start the system using a clean start procedure provided above by another user. follow by turning on the startup application one by one to identify the culprit.</p>
<p>Too bad that I did not wrote down everything I did to share with everyone because I was in a hurry to get this problem solved on my computer that I had taken 2 days to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>One thing that is easily identifiable when one look at the names in the startup menu, it contains the letters "ad" related to advertisement. I google the name of the software and it said that it is not harmful, but it is because it acts as another anti-virus
 program that disable Windows Defender, and that is why we were not able to update Windows Defender definition files.</p>
<p>Once again THANKS!</p>
<p>

I had to reinstall windows in the end because whatever it was was stopping other programs from working.<br />

                    I know some Devs leaving windows platform for android and ios and windows users are worried about it according to me uwp apps have a bright future for multiple reasons one the most important reason uwp apps runs on multiple devices from HoloLens,Xbox one,
 SurfaceBook,iot to potential upcoming Surface Phone it will bring all new and existing developer who now don't interested in uwp. Surface Phone and HoloLens will game be game changer for Microsoft and for uwp future. If any developer will see my post than
 plz hopeful for uwp and bring your apps to msft store.&nbsp; And about me i am waiting for Surface Phone and Andromeda OS i will be most happy when i hands on Surface Phone and i am currently having Lumia 950 using as my daily driver.

<p>Well, if you don't have Administrative privileges to your system, I am afraid there is not much we can do to help you. If you are able to log into your local Administrator account on the system, then you should be able to make the desired changes. Otherwise,
 this is between you and the Network Administrator. </p>

    <title>Windows Mail new mail notifications keep playing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zbwdo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Mail new mail notifications keep playing</h2>
                    Hi -- I am using Windows Mail in Windows 7 (I know, I know, but I really want to be able to keep local copies of my email, and I can't find a way to migrate my Windows Mail messages (thousands of them) to Outlook 2010 64-bit).&nbsp; I have developed a strange
 problem.&nbsp; I have WinMail set up to check for new emails every minute, and play the default new mail notification sound.&nbsp; However, when I read my new mail, and there is no new mail, the new mail notification sound still plays every minute....&nbsp; The only way
 the notification goes away is if I shut down WinMail.&nbsp; Then if I reopen it, and there is no new email, there are no notifications until I get a new email, then I get the notification sounds every minute again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have tried shutting off the notification and then turning it back on, and I have tried turning it off, shutting down WinMail, then bringing up WinMail and turning it back on.&nbsp; Any other ideas?&nbsp; Is there a way to download and install a fresh copy of all WinMail
 program files (if you think that would do the trick)?&nbsp; Thanks much!<br />

            Thanks Bruce.&nbsp; I did that but found something interesting.&nbsp; Now, WinMail isn't downloading any new mail at all.... Neither on its own or when I tell it to Send and Receive Mail.&nbsp; :(&nbsp; When I try the latter, it just tells me "Some errors occurred while processing
 the requested tasks.&nbsp; Please review the list of errors below for more details.&nbsp; Alas, there are no errors in the Errors tab.&nbsp; Interestingly, if I tell it to Receive only, it works....&nbsp; Oy! Any thoughts?&nbsp; Thanks so much!<br />

            <p>If WMUtil was unable to make any impact on the issue, you can try removing the account, closing and reopening WinMail and then adding it back again.&nbsp; Also go to Control Panel | Sounds and set another sound for new mail notification and see if that makes
 any difference.&nbsp; Also, if you are using the Sidebar in Windows 7, do not use the mail gadget, if there is one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try importing into Outlook by going in Outlook to Alt | File | Options | Advanced | Export and click the Export button and then select to import from another program and then you have the option to choose from OE or WinMail (it's the same option).&nbsp;
 See what that does.</p>

            Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
Bruce, in the spirit of keeping an open mind, I tried that.&nbsp; What happened, though was that all emails came over as from me (not the true originator) with the date and time that I copied them over.&nbsp; That's not acceptable.<br />
<br />
Steve, I tried importing into Outlook.&nbsp; Some things came over OK, some folders were empty, meaning hundreds of messages lost, and some folders lost hundreds of messages while only a few messages were replicated hundreds of times.&nbsp; That's not going to work,
 either!<br />
<br />
I don't know how this got so hosed up -- I have used WinMail just fine on other machines, and this was running fine on this machine when I installed Windows new on Friday, Saturday, and most of Sunday.&nbsp; Unfortunately I don't know what I did Sunday to hose things
 up.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I wonder if I should try a restore?&nbsp; I have a decent restore point.<br />

            <p>You can try restoring and seeing what will happen.&nbsp; In WinMail you can also go to File | Export and choose MS Exchange and that will export to Outlook.&nbsp; That might give better results than importing from Outlook.</p>

            <p>I'm glad you got it resolved.&nbsp; Keep a copy of the files that you hacked because if there is a Windows Update that changes that dll, then it will get replaced and you will have to copy it back.&nbsp; That has only happened twice since Win7 came out, so it's not
 likely to happen.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer was purchased around 2010.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a Gateway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The unit automatically updated to Windows 10 approximately May 2016. &nbsp;If there's a method to confirm the date, please tell me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update was from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10 (no other versionsin between).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update occurred automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are no third party anti-virus, anti-malware or firewalls installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unaware of Norton of McAfee ever being installed or of a free trial. &nbsp;I am vigilant that these try to hitchhike on updates (like Adobe), but I try to always decline them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">KB3163018 and/or KB3173428&nbsp;listed in&nbsp;</span><strong>Installed Updates,
</strong><span>&nbsp;but my history only goes back one month. &nbsp;The failed installs have pushed notification of other updates off. &nbsp;</span>Is there another method for me to verify if these updates were installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Adobe Flash Player is installed <strong>v22.0.0.209</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firefox v48 is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unaware of any registry cleaners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if I've answered all your questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>2. What anti-virus application was install on the Win7 computer&nbsp;when you upgraded to Win10 in May, was your subscription (if any) still current, and was it still installed after the upgrade completed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Is KB3156421 listed in <strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>
Update History</strong></em>) and if so, when (exact date) was it installed according to
<strong>Installed Updates </strong><em>(not <strong>Update History</strong></em>)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. How about KB3172987, KB3149135, and/or KB3163019?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chances are the Gateway computer came with a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Both are
<em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here.</p>

<h3> metoobossman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect voice issues</h2>
                    
<p>Hiya! I am having problems with Kinect voice. I have done everything and re-calibrated it all, wiped the cache etc but no results. I use voice commands for everything, TV, games, etc. It works fine if i have the volume down but as soon as it gets turned
 up it cannot hear me at all. I do not use my tv sound, everything is ran through a surround sound unit as i love playing games and watching movies with full quality sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It just will not hear me unless it is quiet! It sort of defeats the object of having a media hub that puts out dts for everything when you can't use it if the sound is even slightly above quiet. The sensor is not too close to any speakers and am getting
 really frustrated!! Can anybody help??!! Only reason have it is for all this and it is sooo unreliable!!</p>

<p>see when you calibrated it.. your surround sound was on so it know it will "hear" sounds coming from behind you so when you give it commands.. it is thinking those are normal background sounds so it ignores them...</p>

<p>I use to have problems with Kinect too until I got an HDTV mount for it, it use to be kept at the bottom of my Sony KDL40EX720 near the TV's built in 2x10w sound bar. But since it's not sitting close to the speakers and when I calibrate it, and since I got
 the HDTV mount for the Kinect, it picks me up well. When calibrating, try testing it with your speakers as QUIET as possible WITHOUT the Dashboard saying your speakers are too quiet. It may pickup background noise but noise is better than not being able to
 pick up anything at all. </p>
<p>And just to let you know, Voice Commands ISNT perfect. I have to change my locale to Australia (I'm NZ, Australia is only 2 hours behind NZ time) because Microsoft still has it locked for NZ locale. Even Google and Samsung allow you to do voice commands
 for NZ locale on their Samsung S5. And it works well. I can say Xbox Home/Friends/Messages/Play... and it works fine. But I do have to sometimes repeat myself.

<p>ill try mounting it but ive already tried elevating it and dropping the centre speaker so they are well out of the way of eachother and its still a pain. Watching a film is a nightmare. Cant use voice at all unless i mute everything. Its terrible, especially
 for the price i paid for it. Thx though</p>

<p>Little tip when calibrating the Kinect that i learned was when it says to &nbsp;turn the volume up higher than normal, really crank it up. Not blow your speakers up, but a lot louder than your movie or game would ever be. This way my kinect got a lot more sensitive
 to sound. Maybe even too sensitive at times, as i've been on the phone in another room with the door open and the kinect reacted to what was said.</p>
<p>This worked for me at least, and i have no problems getting it to recognize my commands even when gaming or watching a movie at high volume (And i also game on a big surround system).</p>
<p>Hope it works out for you.</p>
<p>Oh, and remember if you adjust any sound settings on the console itself or adjust/move the kinect it needs to be recalibrated to work properly..or might at least.</p>

<p>What AngryVato said... my Kinect responds superbly to voice commands. The biggest thing people seem to 'get wrong' is the volume level combined with "background noise".</p>
<p>To elaborate; When you calibrate your Kinect, you can actually turn up the volume 'too loud'... the Xbox will even tell you that the volume is too loud and ask you to turn it down. This is what I did when I calibrated mine. Find that 'too loud' point and
 just turn it down a number or 2 from there.</p>
<p>Also, the calibration procedure will tell you to "please remain quiet" during certain points in calibration. This means that YOU should remain quiet... many people have said that it's actually better to have 'typical'&nbsp;background noise. Furnace, A/C, fans,
 anything that might cause background noise, if it's possible, have one of&nbsp;(preferably the loudest of) those things&nbsp;running. Why? Because when it asks you to be quiet, it is setting its sensitivity to you, so that it can differentiate between you and typical
 background noise... not complete silence.</p>
<p>I think someone mentioned that you shouldn't use the rear speakers of your SS system for some reason. I say nonsense. During the calibration process, the sensor actually uses the satellite speakers for a baseline measurement. If it can't 'hear' a speaker
 that is normally there during the calibration, how can it determine if a sound is coming from it (and not you or something else)&nbsp;when it is in use? I&nbsp;have a 5.1 SS system and I always calibrate with it set up just like it is when I'm gaming.</p>
<p>Anyway, these pointers are what I follow when I calibrate (which some say you should do multiple times and actually continue doing it regularly). I can tell you that I have never had to yell (which actually makes it less likely to hear you). I have my wife
 and 2 dogs who typically will be running through the house and causing a ruckus at times... the dogs... not my wife lol. It's generally quiet, but not always, and my Kinect rarely misses a voice command. Even when I speak in a relatively low tone, during a
 noisy time.</p>
<p>Hopefully something in there will help you out. I&nbsp;do all of the above and&nbsp;rarely have trouble with mine.</p>

<p>the kinnect is complete garbage, i feel microsoft owes EVERYONE a refund for it. if i say GIZMO it pulls up the xbox voice commands....however if i say xbox it only does it after saying it several times, i've calibrated several times. there is no fix to
 this garbage piece of hardware. if i yell at my dog to stop, "gizmo stop" it stops my dvr progression. sometime's it won't accept me saying xbox, other times it won't accept my wife saying it, it is completely random.

<p>thx guys but i have tried calibrating it soooo many time and get the same result. My surround sound is 1100 watts and ive done the maximum but ive also done the minimum with the same result. If my 6 yr old is in the room talking or playing with toys i cant
 use kinect to change channel unless its silent. In a quiet room with earphones it would probably be faultless but im a normal person with a kid and it just cant hear or distinguish between me and any other type of noise. On the verge of getting a ps4!!!! It
 just seems like a gadget that doesn't perform in a normal environment so its seeming more and more pointless.

<p>OK, i have a 5 yr old Acer, celeron laptop. it runs all videos OK, but i updated from win7,
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before update, also, downloaded a codec update from Majorgeeks.com. Before updating.. to 10..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thats the reason it isn't displaying, Try downloading. VLC media player,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just type it in search, in web browser. dont get the app from windows store, do actual download from their website..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Test video in the program, by opening it, then find it in open file, that way it is running VLC drivers only, and see what happens..</p>
<p>
</p><p>If &nbsp;that doesn't work, you need a codec fix.. codec is the thing that runs in background that recognizes files..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps :)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting Windows Live Mail forum. I understand that you want to recover your Storage folder after upgrading to Windows 8.1.
<span>All deleted emails are stored in the email account's 'Deleted' folders’ for a short period of time for. Check if these folders contain any of the deleted emails.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>- In Windows Live Mail &lt;Email account&gt;/Deleted Items<br />
- In Explorer, %USERPROFILE%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\&lt;Email account name&gt;\Deleted Items</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>'Storage folders' Deleted Items only contains items deleted from Windows Live Mail’s user created folders. If Windows Live Mail is functioning properly and the
 deleted messages are not present in the email account's ‘Deleted Items’ folder or not archived elsewhere in Windows Live Mail or the user's hard drive they are most likely gone.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>

            I will check the deleted file folder. No, unfortunately I did not back it up. I keep 99.999% of my files on SkyDrive and didn't think about the storage folders. I was hoping that it would have kept the file.

            Hello Tony Howell, <br />

<p>This thread was created in the incorrect forum; the Microsoft Moderation team has moved this thread to the Files and Folders Forum.

Thanks</p>

By any chance symbols were included in the file name.<br />
There are certain symbols that are not allowd to be used as name.<br />
Such as ....</p>
<p><strong>\, /, :, *, ?, ", &lt;, &gt;, |</strong></p>

            <p>I don't think it's that. I just saved it in a different folder near the root and it still does it.</p>
<p>If I save as, and choose a different name it will save then. Thanks for trying though!</p>
<p>I can only get it to happen in Photoshop CS4 or 5 too</p>
