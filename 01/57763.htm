            I'll download it and get back to you after I have it installed. I remember having to do some odd stuff to get it working properly. Also, don't use the main download. It uses Pando Media Booster which can slow down your Internet connection. I'd recommend
 uninstalling it if you have it actually.<br />
<br />
I remember having to do this: http://www.flyffworld.com/forums/t115922/ to get it to work.<br />
<br />
Ok so I did the steps listed in that guide:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>Step 1) Run Flyff and let it update but don’t click “Start” yet.<br />
<br />
Step 2) Download the Gameguard.des file I’ve uploaded.<br />
<a href="http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?mtuznownxim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?mtuznownxim</a>
<br />
(Save it to desktop so you can easily access it)<br />
<br />
Step 3) Copy and Paste the Gameguard.des file into the Flyff installation folder and replace the old file.</blockquote>
<br />
After that's done, right click Flyff and make sure it's set to run in XP (Service Pack 3) compatibility mode and also tick the run as administrator check box. Now go ahead and run it. If you have problems running it in full screen, try setting it to windowed
 in the options.<br />
<br />
It worked for me: <a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/V_EgJkHzTGD_mERZgNquyg?feat=directlink" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Picasa link</a> <br />
<br />
This works for Windows 7 64-bit, but I'm not sure about 32-bit. Good luck!

            This doesn't resolve the issue. While attempting repairs it restarts and shows "Missing Operating System again". I tried to Rest the PC using the Media and It says " A required partition is missing" or "The Partition is locked". I tried to use CMD from
 the troubleshoot window and it displays no files or directory in my C drive. I had tried this several times and everything failed to get windows 10 on my laptop.

<h2>            Error 0x800704cf the network location cannot be reached AGAIN</h2>
                    <p>Error 0x800704cf is back again. It relates to ALL Microsoft applications made on Windows 10 API. Other programs have no problem with Internet access at the same time. The problem appeared either after a period of slow Internet connection, or after some update.
 I can't identify it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last time I've fixed it by full reinstall of the Windows 10. I don't feel happy to repeat it again, because it takes weeks to recover all 3rd party software back to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody knows a reason, please share. From what I have tried, with no success, is : (1) reset application in Settings, (2) disable IPv6 for Ethernet adapter.</p>

<h2>            Splitting videos in Movie Maker deletes most of the project</h2>
                    After editing my project for a while, splitting the videos into smaller parts so that I can subtitle them, sometimes I will get the issue that if I split a certain clip, it will delete most of the project, and soon after my Movie Maker will crash. The
 part I split disappears, and the blue bar on the left that shows how far into the movie you are skips all the way to the end, signaling that the time has been drastically reduced in the movie.

            <p>Well - as all my directories and files were marked "read only" by windows 10 your help was not helpful.&nbsp; Having had experience of your paid support when you promised me the issue would be fixed - IT wasn't -&nbsp;I do not have any confidence in your claim that
 you will "assist&nbsp;to resolve this issue".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have taken control of ownership and taken full control, tried changing the attributes many times without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to "reply" using windows 10.&nbsp; So have rolled back to 8.1 and already things are a lot better!&nbsp; I'll wait for you to sort out windows 10 - perhaps by disabling your spyware by default, removing unnecessary rubbish like "One drive" which I don't
 need or use, giving back control over "user account control" and windows updates, and removing "read -only" attributes for starters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why oh why does microsoft persist in releasing unfit operating systems and expect users to put&nbsp;them right - no wonder it was a "free" upgrade....</p>

<h2>            Surface 2 &#38; Micro SD cards</h2>
                    I installed a 64GB&nbsp;micro SD card into my Surface 2. Along with various other files, I also have a few movies saved on the SD card as well. However, some movies play perfectly while others, upon attempting to play the movie, I receive an error message advising
 that the file is not compatible. I've checked each movie file and they are all the same file type, either m4v or avi type files, both of which play perfectly. For some reason, certain files, although the same file types, will not play. Is there some program
 I need to utilize to eliminate this issue? Same file type, same process in downloading to the SD card, same type of rip process yet certain movies will not play. Any ideas? Thanks!

            <p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suppose you are using the Video app. It could be possible that some files are not processed correctly on the Video app even if it is of the same file type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check if this is an issue with the Video app, I would suggest you to follow the steps to run the troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Try running the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Apps troubleshooter</a>. This tool can automatically identify and fix some problems with apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can install video player apps from the Store. Eg: Metro Media Player.</p>
<p><a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/metro-media-player/8ea516f1-eada-4d0e-931c-557878093350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/app/metro-media-player/8ea516f1-eada-4d0e-931c-557878093350</a><br />

    <title>Bad audio after upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> snappedmanx6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bad audio after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Immediately after upgrading, all sound is distorted and slowed down, as if it were running at 50% speed and a bunch of crackling noises too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done numerous troubleshooting steps to fix this but nothing works. Getting latest drivers (published by Realtek this week if I remember correctly), installing them in compatibility mode, disabling enhancements, changing default format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was ready to email Realtek and ask them for a solution but I got an idea. My GTX770 has audio with HDMI. I tried it. Also broken. So this must be something to do with Windows itself, and not the driver from what I can tell.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using a ASRock P67 Extreme 4 Gen3 which comes with on-board Realtek audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

    <title>can&#39;t watch netflix or hulu in split screen in tablet mode windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> surfaceuser13  say:</h3>
<h2>            can&#39;t watch netflix or hulu in split screen in tablet mode windows 10</h2>
                    My bedtime ritual was to use the split screen mode in Windows 8 to play a game of solitaire and watch something at the same time.&nbsp; In desktop mode I can open two smaller windows as long as I don't get to close to the edges. In tablet mode, Hulu and Netflix
 both pop into full screen mode if I try to watch while playing. I can open each app in split-screen, but the moment I hit "Play," it takes over. Am I missing something, or is this something that can be addressed in an update?

            <p>That's SOP. I did that before posting the question. Updating to Windows 10 is what caused the problem. Any plans to reinstate the usability of tablet mode in a future update? I have seen others make that request as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Probably not (to both).&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to suggest using an attached monitor (Miracast?) but then remembered that you can't have Tablet mode in that configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;eg&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, one thing you can do is watch both in the Task View,&nbsp; e.g. swipe from the left to see that--provided you don't try to open each in their own Desktop--then you can only see one at a time.</p>

<p><span>Hi Marilyn Philips,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Windows Vista Community Forums</span></p>
<p><span>As you’ve said that you cannot move the messages into your Inbox when you mark it as not junk and it gets deleted, you can go ahead and try selecting all the
 messages in your<span>&nbsp; </span>junk folder <span>&nbsp;</span>and move it into your inbox in one go. Later, you can delete the messages or move them back to junk folder which you mark as junk.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>The other option is, you can add your favorite sender to the
<strong>safe sender’s list</strong> so that from the next time onwards, those messages sent from them come directly to your
<strong>inbox.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>The steps are as follows:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try the above steps and post back to us if you have any further issues.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Start by selecting
<strong><span>Tools</span></strong> from the top menu and then
<strong><span>Junk E-mail Options…</span></strong> from the drop-down list</span></p>
<p><span>2. On the
<strong>Options</strong> tab you’re presented with the different ‘levels’ of&nbsp;<span>spam filtering</span>&nbsp;that Windows Mail offers. The default is
<strong>Low</strong>, which means that when Windows Mail isn’t totally sure if something is spam, it will ‘play it safe’ and leave the message alone (which is to say it will put the message in your Inbox rather than filter it as Junk).
</span></p>
<p><span>If you get a fair bit of spam and are willing to put up with the occasional legitimate email being marked as Junk (which
 is called a false-positive), you might want to switch to the <strong>High</strong> level of filtering. If you choose the high setting, be sure to check your Junk E-mail folder fairly often to make sure no actual messages were incorrectly flagged. See step
 5 below for information on restoring legitimate email from the Junk folder. Also, it’s a very good idea
<strong>not</strong> to permanently delete suspected junk e-mail instead of moving it to the junk email folder, because there’s a very good chance you’d be automatically deleting messages that are not spam</span></p>
<p><span>3. The final option is to only accept email from people (or domains – like gmail.com) that you specify (your safe senders list). Only use this option if you know exactly who will be sending you&nbsp;email
 messages</span><a href="http://www.simplehelp.net/2007/02/09/how-to-configure-the-windows-mail-junk-e-mail-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>
</span></span></span></a></p>
<p><span>4.</span><span> Select the
<strong><span>Safe Senders</span></strong> tab. One default setting that you might want to change is the
<strong><span>Automatically add people I e-mail to the Safe Senders List</span></strong>, which is turned off by default</span></p>
<p><span>5. And finally, select the
<strong><span>Phishing</span></strong> tab. Microsoft has included anti-phishing (more</span><span> filters as a part of Windows Mail. You may wish to place a check in the
 box labeled <strong><span>move phishing E-mail to the Junk Mail folder</span></strong>, but be sure to check your Junk Mail folder once in a while for false-positives</span></p>
<p><span><span>6. If you find that Windows Mail has incorrectly identified a message as spam, and your settings are such that Junk mail is
 moved to the Junk folder, use the <strong><span>Not Junk</span></strong> button to restore messages to the Inbox</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>Hope this information helps</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thanks and Regards</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Using Windows 10 to backup files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alanml  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using Windows 10 to backup files</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to use the Windows 10 procedures to back up my files.</p>
<p>I have an external hard drive that will hold 149GB.</p>
<p>The size of my User file is about 83 GB.</p>
<p>I went to Update and Security and selected Back up.&nbsp; I then set the button to the "on" position under "Automatically back up my files"&nbsp;beneath the heading "Back up using file history".</p>
<p>I then selected "More options" and designated the external drive for the back up drive and selected "every three hours" and "until space is needed" as the frequency for making the back ups and how long they are to be kept.</p>
<p>Under "see advanced settings" I can see that "File history is on"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soon after this, when I looked at the contents of the external drive, I saw a folder named "file History" and it kept getting larger until it was about 84GB.&nbsp; I thought this was my back up and that I had it set up correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day when I looked at the external drive I found that there were three folders:</p>
<p>One was the previously seen File History</p>
<p>A second was a folder titled with my User Name and it is about 65.5 GB</p>
<p>A third file titled MediaID.bin has about 528 bytes</p>
<p>
</p><p>These three files have filled the external drive and it does not appear to be making any new backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I double click on the second file titled with my User Name I get a box with options for recovering my backups so I think this is my backup.</p>
<p>So what is the File History file for?</p>
<p>Is it taking space that should be available for the back up?</p>
<p>Why are the back ups not being made every three hours as I specified?</p>
<p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
<p>Should I turn the "File History" option off?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>File History</strong> regularly backs up versions of your files in the Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, and Desktop folders and the OneDrive files available offline on your PC. If the originals are lost, damaged, or deleted, you can restore
 them. You can also browse and restore different versions of your files. If you want to restore an older version of a file, you can browse through a timeline, select the version you want, and restore it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>MediaID.bin</strong> <span>is a file created as a result of your backup. If you move your backup files to any other location, make sure you copy
<strong>MediaID.bin</strong> along with it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know if you have any questions.</span></p>

            <p>I appreciated your answer as well as your recent inquiry to see if it was helpful.&nbsp; However, your answer did not address my specific questions regarding why my 149GB external drive was full and scheduled backups were not being performed.&nbsp; I have since learned
 that the second large file on my external hard drive in addition to the File History was a second backup file being created by the Backup and Restore feature.&nbsp; When I set up my backups, I did not realize that the File History and the Backup and Restore are
 two separate ways to create backups in Windows 10.&nbsp; I had turned on both features.</p>
<p>In my search for answers, one site I read said that the Backup and Restore feature was never intended to be used for making&nbsp; backups in Windows 10 and that its purpose is only for recovering backups made using Windows 7.</p>
<p>Another author, however,&nbsp;said that the correct way to backup files in Windows 10 is to use both the File History and the Backup and Restore features to create separate backups on two different external drives.&nbsp; Also, this&nbsp;author said that the Backup and&nbsp;Restore
 feature is&nbsp;needed in order to create a system repair disk and a system image.</p>
<p>So at the present time I have File History&nbsp;creating and&nbsp;updating a backup on my&nbsp;149GB internal storage&nbsp;hard drive and it&nbsp;is using about 84GB with about 65GB free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have the Backup and Restore feature creating and updating a backup on my 149GB external hard drive.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;created a system repair disk, but when I tried to create a system image, I got a message saying there is not enough free space on the external drive.</p>
<p>At this point I still have several questions:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Is the Backup and Restore feature on Windows 10 intended for making backups as I am doing or is the intent that I should just use the File History method?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If only the File History feature is intended to be used for backups&nbsp;in Windows 10, is it unnecessary to make the repair disk and system image as offered in the Backup and Restore feature?</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  DTM87675 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You have a couple options:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />How to: Create a system image in Windows 10
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />How to restore a Windows 10 system image to an existing or larger storage device 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-restore-a-windows-10-system-image-to-an/e20992ca-5641-4f7c-bb09-3895d0732162">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />		Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.
<br />a
<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

            Hi DTM.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try imaging or cloning it over using the best free imaging app here:
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>

<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Cloning+a+disk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/C...</a>
<br />
<br />If those aren't satisfactory then create the bootable media to do this gold-standard Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  Be sure to unplug all other drives first.
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi DTM87675 , this will be no problem, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

                    when I go to my photos all that shows is a icon with mountains on it. If I click on it my photo shows up. I can't tell which pictures are what unless I click on each icon one at a time. If I go to my adobe photos the pictures show up. If I open the adobe
 album in my photo gallery all I get is the icon with the mountain. There is also a new icon that wasn't there before that says zbThumbnails.info, the icon is just a white piece of paper. I tried changing my photo album to be opened by adobe but all it does
 is change the icon to the adobe icon.<br />

<p>I have 3 xbox ones and 3 elite controllers and one of them has a broken right bumper as well. I purchased the 3 controllers in January of this year so they are out of warranty. Support told me that my only option is I can send it in for replacement. If I
 had damaged it I could possibly see it but I can't see spending another $150 for a controller when all it needs is a $5 part that failed. It is apparent that it is a common problem on these controllers for all the hits on the internet. I was really happy with
 the controller.</p>

            Hi MC.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You'll need to determine if the fault is with the battery or charger.  
<br />
<br />Check the manufacturer's Support web page for your full model number to  see if there is a battery issue or recall for it.   
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you might need to replace the battery or charger.   However I will tell you that most OEM after-market batteries and chargers have problems so I would only buy the official manufacturer's battery from the PC maker to be sure.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
