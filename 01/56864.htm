<h2>            Network&#47;Homegroup problems after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have two PCs and a laptop on a home network. Before upgrading all three devices to Windows 10,&nbsp; I used to be able to connect all three and share files between each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following the upgrade I can see the other devices on the network but cannot access them from any of the devices.&nbsp; All three are connected to a shared wireless printer and access the internet through the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that it might be something to do with Homegroup. PC 1 says that PC2 has set up a Homegroup which I can join if I get the password from PC2. But PC 2 says its not a member of a Homegroup - so there is no password and becasue there is no HOmegroup
 I cannot leave it! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Nightmare!&nbsp; </p>

            <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hi Matthews,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Thank you for your interest in Microsoft Communities.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I can understand how frustrating it can be when things don’t work as expected. I'd be glad to help you.
</span></span></p>
<p>Before you follow the instructions, I suggest you&nbsp;to&nbsp;remove all other devices from the old HomeGroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>1. Turn OFF *all* other computers/devices from your Network except the computer that you want to use to create a HomeGroup.&nbsp; Leave all of these devices OFF until Step 6. There can only be 1 computer on when trying to create a HomeGroup in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>2. On the computer you want to use to create a HomeGroup:</p>
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If it's hardwired - disconnect the Ethernet cable for 30 seconds, then plug it back in.
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. If it's a wireless connection, turn off your wireless connection for 30 seconds, and then turn it back on.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Restart the computer that you are using to create a HomeGroup.&nbsp; Type your password, hit 'Enter', and wait a full 5 minutes for everything to load.
</p>
<div><br />
4. Go to your Control Panel and check your HomeGroup options. You should now be able to create a HomeGroup.
<div><br />
5. Follow the instructions to create a HomeGroup and wait 5 more minutes. Then reboot again.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6. Turn ON the other devices that you want to join the HomeGroup. Access your HomeGroup options from the Control Panel. You should now see an option to join.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Hope this information is helpful. Please reply in case you have any further issues, I will be glad to help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

            <p>I had similar issues where there was no HomeGroup anymore but Windows thought so. It would only give me the option to "join a homegroup".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got the following message by typing 12345678 as the password and got the following message:</p>
<p>Windows no longer detects a homegroup on this network. To create a new homegroup, click OK, and then open HomeGroup in Control Panel. (Which doesn't work)</p>
<p>Finally I did this.<br />
Shut down other computers on LAN.<br />
Go to Control Panel/Network and Sharing Center<br />
Select "Change advanced sharing settings". <br />
Turn off Network Discovery (reboot if necessary).<br />
Go to Control Panel/HomeGroup, if all went well you can now create a new group. WRITE DOWN THE NEW PASSWORD.<br />
Turn on Network Discovery (see above)<br />
Reboot</p>
<p>Now you can turn on the other computers and join the new HomeGroup. You may have to Turn Network Discovery on and Off to get the proper join invitation.</p>
<p><br />
Also:<br />
Turn Windows Search on to enable Windows Media Streaming Service. I turned Search off because I installed an SSD.</p>

            <p>So far this advice has been of no use for us.&nbsp; We have already tried turning our system off and on, trying to create a neu homegroup, even changing the system we created the homegroup on from the desktop to our tablet.&nbsp; Where before we HAD a homegroup, the
 November Threshold 2 update destroyed that homegoup, along with the user profile on the desktop system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far we do NOT see any option to create a homegroup, only a notice that we have been invited to join.</p>
<p>The password we try to use is not accepted and when we try the troubleshooter, it simply pops up a note saying</p>
<p>Windows can't create a homegroup on this computer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When both systems are on we CAN see them in the file explorer, we just cannot access them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This entire November update has been a horrific series of problems for us and we truly regret suffering through it.</p>

<p>Consequently it does NOT in ANY way address the network issue, in fact it discusses a different error completely:</p>

<p>Your response to the OTHER error is useless on THIS thread for the 20 people all experiencing a Network problem with Windows 10.&nbsp; You replied to it on THAT thread, and had absolutely no reason to also post a link to it here, since the OP had already told
 you that it was the same computer on the other thread.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Consequently you have wasted my time, have NOT even addressed the problem we 20 are experiencing on this thread, and further, try to defend your unhelpful act by talking down to me, telling me that i must start a different thread rather than simply joining
 the 19 other people who all have the same problem here in order to even have the problem addressed at all.<br />
<br />
So thank you for absolutely nothing.&nbsp; You replied to a DIFFERENT error yet erroneously linked it as a reply on this, the WRONG thread, and insulted some one who pointed it out to you.<br />
<br />
I can certainly start another thread, with the SAME problem, if you think you really need to have MORE threads discussing the same issue, especially an issue that has NOT been addressed since it began.<br />
<br />
If i do start an entirely different thread with this same network problem, i want an assurance that it will be courteously and professionally addressed and followed up on until the problem is corrected, which means absolutely
<strong>not</strong> by you.<br />

</p><p>Unsubscribing to this thread.&nbsp; The problem is annoying but we have gone without a functional homegroup since November of 2015 when the Windows 10 update destroyed it along with the user profile on our desktop system.<br />
<br />
We have already waited far too long for no useful reply and an insult on top of it.</p>

<h2>            My Windows 8 Netflix app isn&#39;t working&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 3 and whenever I load Netflix the tiles don't load properly and whenever I search a movie or show it just shows me a blank screen.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />Here I leave you several solutions
<br />
<br />if they do not serve you at the end, leave a link with more information
<br />
<br />Solution 1: Clean the screen
<br />Use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with water or eyeglass cleaner but don’t apply liquids directly to the screen. To learn more, see Clean and care for your Surface.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 2: Restart your Surface
<br />Note
<br />You'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface. You can use a Surface Typing Cover or a USB or Bluetooth:registered: keyboard or mouse.
<br />
<br />Sometimes, all you need to get your touchscreen working again is a restart:
<br />
<br />Press the Windows logo key .
<br />(If you're using a mouse, select Start .)
<br />Press the Tab key to select Power, and then press Enter.
<br />(With a mouse, select Power.)
<br />Use the arrow keys to highlight Restart, and then press Enter.
<br />(With a mouse, select Restart.)
<br />
<br />Solution 3: Install the latest updates
<br />Note
<br />You'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface, as in Solution 2.
<br />
<br />Your touchscreen might not be working because you don’t have the latest updates. For more info on installing Windows updates, see Install Surface and Windows updates. If your Surface does not restart automatically after you install updates, restart it manually. To restart your Surface, go to Start , and select Power &gt; Restart.
<br />
<br />Important
<br />
<br />After your Surface restarts, keep checking for updates until you see Your device is up to date.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 4: Force a shut down
<br />See Force a shut down and restart your Surface to find out how.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 5: Disable and enable the touchscreen driver
<br />Note
<br />You'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface, as in Solution 2.
<br />
<br />If a two-button shutdown doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Select the search box in the taskbar, enter device manager, and then select Device Manager in the search results.
<br />Select the arrow to the left of Human Interface Devices.
<br />Right-click HID-compliant touch screen, and then select Disable.
<br />Right-click HID-compliant touch screen, and then select Enable.
<br />Note
<br />There may be more than one HID-compliant touch screen listed. If so, complete steps 3-4 for each one.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 6: Reinstall the touchscreen driver
<br />Note
<br />You'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface, as in Solution 2.
<br />
<br />If disabling and re-enabling your touchscreen driver doesn't work, try this:
<br />
<br />Select the search box in the taskbar, enter device manager, and then select Device Manager in the results.
<br />Select the arrow to the left of Human Interface Devices.
<br />Right-click HID-compliant touch screen, and then select Uninstall.
<br />Note
<br />There may be more than one HID-compliant touch screen listed. If so, complete steps 3-4 for each one.
<br />
<br />Restart your Surface.
<br />Your Surface will automatically download and install the touchscreen driver when you connect to the Internet.
<br />
<br />Solution 7: Reset touchscreen calibration
<br />Note
<br />You'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface, as in Solution 2.
<br />
<br />If solutions 1-6 didn’t work, recalibrate the touchscreen:
<br />
<br />Press the Windows logo key .
<br />(If you're using a mouse, select Start .)
<br />Enter calibrate, use the arrow keys to highlight Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input, and then press Enter.
<br />(With a mouse, select Calibrate the screen for pen or touch input.)
<br />
<br />Press the Tab key until the Reset button is selected, and then press Enter.
<br />(With a mouse, select Reset.)
<br />If the Reset button is dimmed, your Surface touch calibration is still at factory settings. Skip to Solution 8.
<br />Press the Tab key until the Yes button is selected, press Enter, and then follow the on-screen instructions.
<br />(With a mouse, select Yes, and then follow the on-screen instructions.)
<br />After your Surface removes the recalibration data, test the touchscreen to see if it responds appropriately.
<br />
<br />Solution 8: Check for electromagnetic interference
<br />Sometimes, other electronic devices nearby can interfere with the touchscreen or make the cursor on your Surface move around unexpectedly. The culprit could just be a nearby power strip or a lamp on your desk, or it could be something like large equipment or banks of computers.
<br />
<br />To find out if this is the problem, take your Surface to another room, another building, or outdoors. If the touchscreen problem occurs only in certain locations, you’re probably getting electronic interference.
<br />Turn off all the other devices in the area, and then turn them on one by one to figure out which device is causing the problem.
<br />If you don’t find the source of the problem, check nearby rooms for more powerful equipment that may be producing electronic interference.
<br />
<br />Solution 9: Restore or reset your Surface
<br />Note
<br />You'll need a keyboard or mouse connected to your Surface, as in Solution 2.
<br />
<br />If you're still having problems with the touchscreen, try restoring or resetting your Surface, in that order. To find out how, see Restore or reset Surface.
<br />
<br />Note
<br />If you upgraded your Surface from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10, a reset will reinstall Windows 10, unless you choose to restore factory settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />Solution 10: Send your Surface in for service
<br />If the touchscreen still isn’t working after these steps, your Surface needs service. Go to Get my Surface fixed.

    <title>NTFS event ID 55 and the Shadow Copy Service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjdenver12  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTFS event ID 55 and the Shadow Copy Service</h2>
                    <p><span>I recently upgraded an XP system to Windows 7 (custom build) and after a few days I started seeing the NTFS 55 errors telling me that my file system structure was corrupt and unusable.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Running chkdsk (no fix/repair) finds no errors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Running chkdsk with all repair options turned on (including looking for bad blocks) finds no errors except for an error about the MFT and free space.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The system is running fine – no problems – but these errors are unnerving.<span>&nbsp;
</span>All Windows 7 updates are loaded</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I first did the upgrade I was getting a volsnap 25 error on every reboot, wiping out my restore points.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This was fixed by creating an unfragmented pagefile.<span>&nbsp; </span>
This might not be relevant except that it also involves the shadow copy area.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These NTFS errors often occur when nothing in particular is going on, and often after coming out of sleep mode.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here are the System Log events immediately prior to the NTFS errors.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It appears that the Volume Shadow Copy service is always starting just prior to these errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’ve allocated 20GB to system protection, and this space was finally filled up on 4/20.<span>&nbsp;
</span>My restore points look fine.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, when I check my restore points I can create a sequence that results in a single NTFS event ID 55 error.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would certainly look like these NTFS errors are strongly correlated with the Shadow Copy service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since chkdsk never finds any problems with the disk, should I assume that these NTFS errors are bogus?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Would it help (or at least be interesting) if I deleted everything in the shadow copy area (System -&gt; System protection -&gt; Configure), rebooted and started fresh?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I’m running Norton security suite.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I’m also using Macrium Reflect for backups, although I’ve not seen any NTFS errors before or during backups.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thoughts or suggestions?</span></p>

It's been, what? Over two weeks since I re-enabled System Protection on my C: drive, and since then I've performed many system backups (both differential and full, using Macrium Reflect) and have done several program/product installations -- including installation
 of Windows Security Updates -- and have not experienced any more Event 55's.
<div><br />
<div>The only logical conclusion I can draw is that it was the old System Protection (System Restore points) that was causing the problem. &nbsp;Once all System Restore points -- on ALL DRIVES (sigh! Sorry about that) -- are deleted, the problem goes away.</div>

<div>Problem resolved.</div>

            <p>Hi Maggiem,
<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you for the update.</p>
<p><br />
Since you are facing the issue only while installing ImageBrowser EX, I would suggest you to perform a clean boot and then try to install ImageBrowser EX and check if it helps.</p>
<p><span><br />
Clean boot</span><span> will check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Note:</span></b><span> Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps from
<b>Step 3</b>: to reset computer as usual.</span></p>

    <title>Windows Update Doesn&#39;t Work - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> windowsuser95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update Doesn&#39;t Work</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have bought a refurbed Dell Inspiron 5000 that came with Windows 8.1. After some problems with updates, I used the restore disc to completely reinstall. First thing I did was run windows update, which found something like 132 updates, then failed to
 install any.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually installed the 8.1 rollup which is apparently required to install any future updates. It was troublesome, but with help in another thread it worked. Then I manually downloaded and installed the malicious software tool, ran a complete scan, and
 manually downloaded and installed the latest windows defender updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Windows Update just runs forever at checking for updates. I have let it run for over 12 hours with no progress or error. It just hangs. Windows Defender is also unable to update. Just sits at about 1/3 full at searching.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Window Update Diagostic tool, which found errors and fixed them, but I still cannot update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help me obi-wa... microsoft community, you're my only hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Ran "sfc /scannow" with no integrity violations found. However, there was a new entry in the logs saying "The start type of the Windows Modules Installer service was changed from demand start to auto start.", which I have to assume was done by the
 sfc tool, because I had not touched any services.''</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: Ran "Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHelath which resulted in:&nbsp;System store corruption detection and repair has completed. Status: 0x0, Total instances of corruption found: 0, total instances of corruption repaired: 0.</p>

            <p>Hi Jerico,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the automated tool to reset and it made no difference. I then followed the manual (extreme) directions, and had 13 different errors with regard to being unable to register the dll. Updates still did not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've since installed Debian, and am currently installing WIndows as a VM, hoping that makes a difference. Just sick of not having a safe computer to go online with. apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get full-upgrade. No errors. Has anyone at Microsoft heard of this?
 Maybe they could use something like apt instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll leave this thread open in case I encounter the same issue when trying to update Windows in a VM, but I plan on applying one only one update at time, this time, so I'm hoping that will make a difference.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>is due Windows Update client is not updated.<br />
<br />
you need start your PC totally disconnected from internet (to avoid Windows Update service connect to Microsoft Servers) and then install this updates manally....<br />
<br />

<strong>KB3172614</strong> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3172614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
once both updates are installed, you can connect to internet again, and Windows Update should start to works normally again.</p>

            <p>Hi Melorix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm back at the same stage I was when I tried to install on bare-metal, can't get windows update to work. I tried your suggestion, disconnected network, attempt to install both kb's.... both just sit forever at "searing for updates on this computer"..
 they never get to the actual installing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is like my fourth attempt. It seems like a lot of people are having this problem. Is 8.1 just totally broken?</p>

            that is due Windows Update service is stucked, try to stop it manually from Services window and also disable Windows Update manually temporally, that could helps, but you will need to finish manually&nbsp;or restart PC if the updates are stucked too.

            <p>Ok... maybe found a cluein the windows update logs. It's still stuck at checking for updates, but in the windows update log it says tz -5. My timezone is tz -6, windows is set correct, host machine is set correct, but windows update seems to think it's in
 tz -5. Anyway to force windows update to .... know what time it is? I've read this can affect updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Edit: Nevermind. I changed a setting in vbox and it fixed the tz error. I'm upgrading to Windows 10. Sick of this ****.&nbsp;</p>

            And Windows 10 upgrade hangs at 99%. Holy mother of God Microsoft. If this is how your updates work at least have OEM's keep their images up to date. &nbsp;

            Ok. Windows 10 installed on the VM using the offline disc creator option. I think I'll blow out this Linux install and try again, with Windows 8.1, then immediately try upgrading to 10 with the offline installer. Just ignore Windows 8.1 updates entirely.
 Mother of god this has been frustrating. I bought this computer three weeks ago.

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update checking for updates forever</h2>
                    <p>Windows 8.1 Update checking for updates forever. About 5 months ago, Windows updates have slow down. Before it would check for updates in less than 5 min.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>5 months ago it took 30 min., </li><li>4 month ago it took 1 hour, </li><li>3 month ago it took 2 hours, </li><li>2 month ago it took 4 hours, </li><li>1 month ago it took 7.5 hours. </li><li>But now, I have left it running for two days after Tuesday 12/13/16. I shut it down and restarted it than left in running for three days and still no updates. My Windows defender is saying it is out dated. Last update was on 12/12/16.
</li></ul>
<p>I downloaded Windows defender offline updates and installed them on 12/16/16. Had to redownload them on 12/18/16.</p>
<p>I scanned for viruses with Windows defender and Antimalware. I ran F-Secure as well but nothing is found.</p>
<p>I tried running the Windows update troubleshooter tool. No errors found.</p>
<p>I stopped windows update service, bits, windows installer and cryptic services and restarted them per other topics on this forum but that did not solve it.</p>
<p>I ran sfc / scannow and no errors found. I ran dism with online health check and no errors.</p>
<p>I have not made any hardware changes or installed new programs in this time frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Why are updates taking longer each month to download? It seems to be doubling each month but now it seems to be forever since they do not want to update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something else to try to fix this?</p>

                    <p>Hello there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The achievement "Guardian of the underworld" seems to be broken for a lot of players. ( people on trueachievements are talkin about it too&nbsp; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tracker won't go up after reaching 94%.. I already played the whole addon ( the fade of Atlantis Part 2 ) 2 times and it's still not popping up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contacting the Ubisoft Support.. they only told me about contacting the xbox support cause they can't help me with my achievements. 🤣</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never tried to contact the support and couldn't find a way to do.. so I'm using this for trying to get help for me and a lot of people having problems with this.</p>
<p>

            I didn't have this issue with this achievement but I already have with other achievement in other game. What I did was close the game and re-open. Other time I had to erase the save profile from my Xbox but I don't suggest you to do the same. Sometimes
 is just a simple bug and the achievement will pop later. I hope you can solve this problem so you can reach 100%.

<h2>            Streaking&#47;smearing graphics when scrolling in Windows 10 File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having the same issue with Windows File Explorer since I purchased Dell XPS 15 9570 a litlle less than a year ago. There was numerous problems with the system and it took Dell almost a full year to fix everything, changing multiple parts several
 times, however, one of the issues still persists, which is the streaking/smearing/laggy graphics when scrolling in Windows 10 File Explorer. Regardless of me repeating to Dell that this might be a software/OS related issue, Dell has changed the motherboard
 with integrated CPU and graphics 3 times (not solely because of this issue, but nonetheless). After a year of back and forth with Dell and fixing one issue after another, the computer now does work flawlessly on the hardware side and Windows 10 has been clean
 installed two weeks ago (and is up to date with the latest version of 1809), however, the scrolling issue persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The streaking/smearing/laggy graphics when scrolling is only present in Windows 10's File Explorer and nowhere else. I have extensively tried to find solution online but I cannot find the exact problem explicitly related to the File Explorer. Here is the
 link to the problem: <a href="https://youtu.be/3umLNBRpSt0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://youtu.be/3umLNBRpSt0</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/3umLNBRpSt0?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/3umLNBRpSt0?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue with scrolling is only present when using the touchpad. When I connect the external mouse the issue is gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the system:</p>
<p>Dell XPS 9570</p>
<p>4K Touch 15" Display</p>
<p>Intel i7-8750H 8th Gen 2.20 GHz</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />My name is Lee; an Independent Consultant, I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />My computer used to have this problem. The solution or the problem I found was intel graphic was causing this problem as the driver hasn't been updated. It could because one of the driver files is conflicting with the touchpad 
<br />
<br />You can use this intel official driver auto detect program 
<br />
<br />Link: <a href="https://www.intel.sg/content/www/xa/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intel.sg/content/www/xa/en/support/...</a>
<br />
<br />And for the graphic please also use official Nvidia auto detect software for the latest patch.

<h3> guigarox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cart&#227;o de d&#233;bito</h2>
                    <p>Mês passado eu<strong> efetuei</strong> a compra de um jogo na loja da microsoft utilizando o meu cartão de débito&nbsp;(cartão poupança) da&nbsp;Visa (tem o selo visa Electron). O jogo estava na promoção da XBox live gold. Porém, 1 mês depois tentei realizar uma nova compra e não consegui utilizar o mesmo cartão. Ao requisitar suporte através do chat online o atendente me disse que a microsoft não aceita cartões de débito.<br />
<br />
Como eu consegui comprar da última vez com o meu cartão poupança e porque agora não estão aceitando sendo que quando tento efetuar uma compra, nas opções de pagamento me aparece a seguinte mensagem: escolha a sua forma de pagamento (cartão de crédito/débito). Toda vez que tento finalizar a compra, só recebo a mensagem de "Verifique com o seu banco", mas não acredito que o problema seja lá, visto que consegui comprar da última vez. Alguém pode me ajudar???<br /><br />Se isso realmente não for mais possível, alguém pode me indicar uma maneira alternativa de conseguir comprar os jogos pela xbox live&nbsp;utilizando apenas esse cartão (de forma indireta)?</p>

            Hi Nytroxe,<br />
<br />
<br />
The Blue Screen error is caused by an outdated driver, a recently installed application that causes conflict on the system, or due to missing updates. Stop errors (also known as blue screen or black screen errors) can occur if a serious problem causes Windows
 to shut down or restart unexpectedly. Improper shutting down of the computer or forcefully turning off your device might also cause a startup issue.<br />
<br />
Kindly verify the changes made to your computer prior to the issue.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, you can boot your computer in Safe mode. Safe mode starts Windows in a limited state, where only the bare essentials are started. If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the
<strong>F8</strong> key as your computer restarts. You need to press <strong>F8</strong> before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you'll need to try again by waiting until the Windows logo appears, and then shutting down and restarting
 your computer.<br />
<br />
For your reference, you can check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.<br />

    <title>I lost all my files after creating new administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> archai benjamin  say:</h3>
<h2>            I lost all my files after creating new administrator account</h2>
                    <p>Guys.. I need you help. I'm using sony vaio laptop&nbsp;windows 7 started&nbsp;and last night,&nbsp; when I was trying to enter the password on my administrator account but I was getting error message saying "your account has been disabled please see your system administrator".
 I was sure that I entered the password correctly because if I try to enter different password, the error message was "password is incorrect".
</p>
<p>After searching on the web for solution, I tried the safe mode with networking and it let me go to desktop screen. Then, I accessed control panel &gt; user&gt; and I created new administrator account without deleting the old administrator account. I followed correctly
 the steps, then after restarting my laptop, I was shocked that I worked BUT ALL MY FILES WERE DELETED. Even my disk partition was gone and its like the laptop was reformatted. I was sure it was not reformatted.
</p>
<p>Guys, i hope I explained the situation very clear. I need your help because my files are very important to me.
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance. </p>

Run the disk manager (diskmgmt.msc), then have a closer look at the disk structure, the existing partitions, the drive letters and the unallocated blocks on the disk.

<div>Thanks for the reply sir!</div>
<div><br />
Anyway, Before creating new administrator account, it was like this...
<div>&nbsp;(C:) Capacity 200, free space 110GB&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;(D) Capacity 100, free pace 80GB</div>
<div><br />
<div>But after creating new administrator account (no choice but to create new admin account as the old admin account won't let me access because it was disabled) then, it looks like this now,&nbsp;</div>
<div>(C:) Capacity 300, free Space 280 GB. Its like my laptop was totally reformatted even its not.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>So, I &nbsp;lost all my files. Is there any way to retrieve my files from my old admin account? I checked on the control panel, only I can see my current admin account and nothing else. I checked program files and all the software I installed before including
 microsoft office were gone.&nbsp;</div>

<div>Awaiting for your reply.&nbsp;</div>

            <div>In essence your report says this:</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Before</b>: Windows is installed on drive C:. Drive capacity is 200 GBytes, 90 GBytes are used.</div>
<div><b>After</b>: Windows is installed on drive C:. Drive capacity is 300 GBytes, 20 GBytes are used.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is physically impossible for this to happen without using advanced partition management tools or divine intervention. I suggest you consider one of the more likely options, e.g.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Someone other than you did a thorough job on the machine.</li><li>Someone swapped hard disks.</li><li>You are looking at the wrong machine.</li></ul>
<div>About your lost files: This is a good time to review your backup policy. Lots of people skip this step until they suffer a major disaster.</div>

I am sure no one used my laptop.&nbsp; And I know it was my fault that I didnt back up my files but now I want to know only if there's any solutions about my prob. I want to try to retrieve my files that were vanished.

<h2>            Manually sorting photos on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Have just bought a new PC - because my XP and Vista platforms are no longer being supported by the boys at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Have now spent the better part of 4 days trying to manually sort my thousands of photos, only to find out that the new 10 does not allow it. How absurd !!!&nbsp; This after years of beta trials and&nbsp;input by users like me who are not comfortable applying patches
 to a system developed by the so called experts. Suggest they move their operation from Redmond to Tumwater or is it Dumbwater?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ranting is over - Microsoft get this fixed ( and putting photos on the cloud is not an option)</p>

<h3> rickmetzusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Data usage on Windows 10</h2>
                    On Windows 8.1, I used to be able to right click on the WiFi connection, see my data usage for each connection, and reset the counter to 0 any time I wanted to.&nbsp; I use a device from AT and T and a device from Verizon.&nbsp; Is this possible on Windows 10? When
 I right click on the device I am connected to, it does nothing.&nbsp; I like to monitor this because I pay for data usage on each device.&nbsp; The devices have data counters built in, but the Verizon device is used for another computer.&nbsp; I want to see data usage on
 the device for the Windows 10 computer.&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10&nbsp;because it was free, and was supposed to have security enhancements.&nbsp; I now regret doing so.&nbsp; I had 8.1 pretty well figured out, and it worked fine.

            <p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 lets you see how much data you have used over&nbsp;any type of internet connection Ethernet, WiFi, Dial-Up etc., so that you can&nbsp;stay in full control of&nbsp;how and when your data should be consumed. Here is how you can see&nbsp;how much data has been consumed
 overall and by individual apps in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click/touch on the Start&nbsp;icon and select <strong>Settings</strong> from the menu.</li><li>In the Settings window that opens up, select <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Under the Network &amp; Internet&nbsp;category, choose <strong>Data Usage</strong>&nbsp;from the left side. You would be able to see how much total data has been used and how much data has been used through Ethernet, WiFi or some other type of connections.</li><li>If you click/touch on <strong>Usage details</strong> under the data usage statistics, then it opens a new screen where you can see the data usage details for all the individual apps. For me the Free Download Manager used the most of the data followed by
 Mozilla Firefox.</li></ol>
<p>Knowing how much data has been used by your Windows 10 PC is great those on limited internet connections that either stop working after certain number of gigabytes of data usage or they get extremely slow. In addition, you can also see which of the apps
 are busy using your internet data&nbsp;and remove those apps that you do not really need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            This does not help.&nbsp; I can't see where you can re set the usage. It tells how much data is used be each application.&nbsp; I want to know how much is used on my wifi connections, and reset it when my provider re sets it.&nbsp; In other words, when my billing cyle
 starts with Verizon and A T and T

            <p>I am in the same situation.&nbsp; I need to know how much usage from two separate sources.&nbsp; It was easy, it was simple in Windows 8.&nbsp; This is maddening.&nbsp; It was one of the better features of Windows 8.&nbsp; It should be easy and SIMPLE to put that feature back in
 Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, with all of the usage "hogged" by Windows 10, I am about to "go out of businesses" with my Verizon MiFi.&nbsp; I cannot afford to use the computer.&nbsp; This month, I am already up to 25.3 GB.&nbsp; I need this NOW!</p>
<p>

            I am having trouble with the data hog also. I live in a rural area and some of the things I do to control data usage may help. I control windows updates by assigning metered connection to my internet connection (WIFI), except when updating. It is also
 important in Windows 10, because of new updating features (sharing updates) to share on your local network. Sharing over the internet is default and will constantly use data. I also avoid any kind of cloud and use a local account, not my Microsoft account.
 This is what I find necessary when I pay for all the internet data I use. Next step is to get rid of Windows.

            Unfortunately for those of us with limited/metered data - we are unable to reset the data to be in sync with our billing periods etc. in Win 10&nbsp;&nbsp; Being only able to see the last rolling 30 days even by the application is not enough for those of without
 unlimited data.&nbsp; Need greater visibility and ability to see by day or a custom range.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Hello Niranjan, as Rick pointed out; the option to monitor your "overall" data usage and reset it when you wanted to&nbsp;(daily if you needed to) is a handy tool that was available on Windows 8.1 that I used every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe, to remove an option without user consultation is a poor business practice and it should be re-instated or your clients should be asked if they would like it returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The data usage options that you have on windows 10 are indeed a "Great Enhancement" that&nbsp;would have complimented the "overall"&nbsp;data usage option.</p>

<p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 lets you see how much data you have used over&nbsp;any type of internet connection Ethernet, WiFi, Dial-Up etc., so that you can&nbsp;stay in full control of&nbsp;how and when your data should be consumed. Here is how you can see&nbsp;how much data has been consumed
 overall and by individual apps in Windows 10:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click/touch on the Start&nbsp;icon and select <strong>Settings</strong> from the menu.</li><li>In the Settings window that opens up, select <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Under the Network &amp; Internet&nbsp;category, choose <strong>Data Usage</strong>&nbsp;from the left side. You would be able to see how much total data has been used and how much data has been used through Ethernet, WiFi or some other type of connections.</li><li>If you click/touch on <strong>Usage details</strong> under the data usage statistics, then it opens a new screen where you can see the data usage details for all the individual apps. For me the Free Download Manager used the most of the data followed by
 Mozilla Firefox.</li></ol>
<p>Knowing how much data has been used by your Windows 10 PC is great those on limited internet connections that either stop working after certain number of gigabytes of data usage or they get extremely slow. In addition, you can also see which of the apps
 are busy using your internet data&nbsp;and remove those apps that you do not really need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

<p>I see that the only option is to see data usage for the past 30 days. The complication to trying to figure out data usage from a particular date of the month to the present date is that data accumulates at the present and subtracts at a date 30 days ago.
 This DOES NOT make it easy to see how much data is used (as with 8.1). This along with no data sizes for individual updates and no data "clock" on my wifi connection is all meant to hide the information. WHY?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - do I need a full version or can I use an upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    I am installing Windows 7 on a Parallels virtual machine; I previously installed XP but setting up a new VM.&nbsp; Since I have the original XP windows disks, can I set up the new machine with the upgrade version of Windows 7 or do I need to purchase a complete
 version?

            The upgrade for Windows 7 requires a previously installed version of Windows on the partition you are installing to or it will not allow you to enter the key.&nbsp; You can either install Windows XP and then upgrade to Windows 7, or do the following.&nbsp; This
 worked for me:<br />
<br />
1. Install Windows 7 selecting the "Custom (Advanced)"&nbsp;installation, but when it asks you for the key, leave it blank and uncheck the activation check box.&nbsp; The installation will finish.
<br />
2. Boot to your new Windows 7 installation, insert the Windows 7 upgrade DVD, and run the setup.exe program.<br />
3. Select the "Upgrade" option and continue.&nbsp; Now when it asks for your key you can enter the upgrade key and it will be accepted.<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes a little longer, but it works.
