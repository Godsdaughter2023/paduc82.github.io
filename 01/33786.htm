            Hi,<br />
<br />
You need to contact HP Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums where<br />
there will others that have had the same issue.<br />
<br />
You can try the Vista drivers.<br />

            <p>According to HP's support pages on their web site, there are no suitable drivers to support the Laserjet 1012 with Windows 7</p>
<p><a href="http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;objectID=c02535920" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h20000.www2.hp.com/bizsupport/TechSupport/Document.jsp?lang=en&amp;cc=us&amp;objectID=c02535920</a></p>
<p>There is the possibility of a work-around: with Pro and Ultimate versions, XP mode can be installed and the printer installed unser that. -OR- Virtual machine software suchh as Sun/Oracle VirtualBox can be installed and Vista or XP installed and the printer
 installed under that. You would then set the printer up as a networked printer.</p>
<p>In the long haul, a new printer seems best.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

 Other than that, if you like what you see or just want to play, feel free to send me a message and a friend request!&nbsp; Mic is required and please don't be a squeaker...at least 16+.</p>

<br />
<br />Is this drive your system drive, an external drive or another internal drive on your PC?
<br />
<br />What error(s) do you get when trying to access that drive?
<br />
<br />When you run check disk, you say it is deleting a file, what is the name of that file and does it keep deleting the same file?

<br />It seems there is a lot wrong with that drive . .. 
<br />
<br />Did you run chkdsk with just the R switch: chkdst D: /r
<br />
<br />If so how long did that take, did it complete successfully ?

            Microsoft Windows Backup utility is being deprecated.  
<br />Therefore, it may or may not work properly with the latest updates and unfortunately we don't know which update will actually really retire it.
<br />But have been seeing a lot more problems with as of late, so pretty sure it is almost done.
<br />
<br />That being said, you can use alternatives.
<br />I love Macrim, very reliable and very easy to use.

            you and me both... i relied on the windows backup and restore so much and would nag about it to friends and family to use.
<br />They seem to get rid of features that other (3rd party) companies are doing and doing better.  Macrium case in point... their utility is better.
<br />Every Microsoft Product is like that.  I am teaching SharePoint this week and was saying how if you want good workflows and forms that no more infopath or SP designer you have to use a 3rd party like nintex. 
<br />Also wonder to if they have money invested in these "other" companies.
<br />So basically after all my rambling ;) no I don't have a definitive answer, sorry. 
<br />Best of luck.

            Part of it due to the fact that Microsoft is moving much of its investment in online backup services such as OneDrive. The company considers local backup old and unreliable.
<br />
<br />File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free) or Easeus To Do Backup.

    <title>Password recovery - SMS Language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Password recovery - SMS Language</h2>
                    <p>Dear Skype,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently used the password recovery with a recovery code sent by SMS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To my surprise, the SMS text message I received was not in my language. It was in Dutch, one of the languages spoken by people in Belgium.</p>
<p>I set up all my applications and software in English and I expect all communications sent to me in the same language.</p>
<p>I find it totally unacceptable that you make assumptions on the language I speak and&nbsp; expect that my language preferences are reflected in the communications I receive from Skype, Microsoft, or its affiliates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, only the recovery number was relevant in the communication. However I hope you are soon going to solve this discrepancy issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>
<p>

            <p>Haali Media Splitter, also known as Matroska Splitter, is a tool for separating the video and audio streams within a video file. It is often used by freeware video software, and may be automatically installed by that software when it is installed. Unless
 it (like any software) has been hacked it is perfectly safe, and will do nothing unless you or certain video software accesses it.</p>

</p><p>Vgefox is right to be cautious about software that got installed and you know nothing about. It is a pity that some authors of software don't make it clear what other software gets installed at the same time. As Ned Kelly said just before they hanged him,
 "Such is life".</p>

            Hi there!<br /><br />The Skype web plugin allows you to make one-to-one calls and group voice and video calls. However, we have begun to roll out plugin-free calling on Skype, which allows you to do all of these without downloading or installing an app or plugin. This capability is in Preview and currently only available on Skype for Web, Skype on Outlook.com, and Skype on OneDrive.com when using Microsoft's Edge browser.<br /><br />The following calling scenarios are plugin-free:<br /><br />All Skype one-to-one group calls from and to Edge browsers.<br />All Skype one-to-one calls from Edge – Skype for Windows 7.17 or later, or Skype for Mac 7.19 or later is required.<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12316/what-is-the-skype-web-plugin-and-how-do-i-install-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12316/what-i...</a>

</p><p>I have been unable to access msgs on my app for weeks now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter how many times I reset the app, cold boot the xbox, keep things turned off, keep things turning on, etc, etc, etc, Whenever I start up the app on windows 10, I get the 'Try again - we had trouble getting your conversations.' Of course, no indication
 of what the trouble was, what the problem was, nahhh.. Just the "hey, our software isn't working now - too bad."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Xbox msgs work just fine. App and the Beta app don't work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After weeks of this, I'm getting extremely annoyed. It's messages, not rocket science...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Omen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you fully rebooted your PC and have you checked to make sure you have the most recent system update? The Xbox app can experience issues if the most recent update isn't downloaded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try to see if your messages load up on account.xbox.com?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's just the app that can't load up your messages then re-installing it may help. Here is how to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click Start, and then type Windows PowerShell on the search box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Right-click, and then select Run as administrator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Type the following command to uninstall Xbox app: Get-AppxPackage *xboxapp*| Remove-AppxPackage&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4. Hit Enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Launch Windows Store and download Xbox App.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a try and let us know the results.</p>

<p>lol, I hadn't realized this question was split from the other thread, I just saw it disappear so I thought it was deleted and the thread locked. Sorry about the duplicate post elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, re above: windows 10 just updates automatically, so I am assuming it's all up to date, plus the fact that it works for other accounts on my laptop, but not mine, leads me to think it's account related not laptop related.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I CAN access my msgs via the web site (via my profile - I JUST realized that was an option and I sent and received a few msgs there).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the app, and re-installed it, same issue as before, no change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the contacts permission set to off, I thought maybe it's complaining about that, I tried it with giving it permission to that, no difference.. So same problems, unfortunately..&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I get a window saying windows cannot find wlmail please be sure it is spelled correctly... I am in some crazy loop here. The wlsetup and installer claim that the programs included in Win Essentials 2012 are installed and only allows me to close the installer.
 I have tried some advanced uninstall techniques, including an Advanced Uninstaller program that does a pretty extensive cleanup, but I still end up with Windows Live folders and files no matter how I try to uninstall Win Live Esssentials.<br />
In messing with both the bootstrap installer and the offline installer I have at one point got as close as to see the windows live mail in my 'programs' but when i select it it tells me that I am missing a dll. &nbsp;...something like W*Core.dll. I tried simply
 adding that file but of course i got some stupid program that pulled a fast one on me. (required me to buy a 'fixer' program. Grrr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keet deleting and reinstalling the Win Essentials 2012 as it suggests I do to fix the missing dll problem, but it seems to be an endless loop.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your time. I would love to just upgrade to Windows 10 which would supposedly solve the Live mail issue with a simple app, but I'm on a 2012 Alienware MX17-R4 laptop and it has known configuration issues with Windows 10 (according to Dell)... and
 I get caught in a similar loop unsuccessfully trying to install Win-10, ending with an error about not enough space in a partition. Frustrating because I have more free space on these partitions than it says I need. If it isn't one thing its another...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I absolutely love this laptop and couldn't afford to replace it with anything even close to comparable. Apparently a machine made in late 2012 is becoming a relic that won't play nicely with where software is going these days. (Actually appropriate
 for me because my brain has known compatibility issues with modern software as well...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is really blowing my mind is that when I try to visit Windows Live Mail via Web based I can only get to the Outlook.com program. I've made an Outlook email account, but cant get it to pull up my .live in 'add email accounts' because I can't get past
 the password screen. lol. This is turning into a huge joke and I'm beginning to realize that I don't really give a rats **** about email anymore anyway... except for retrieving passwords! The irony... &nbsp;</p>

<p>I get a window saying windows cannot find wlmail please be sure it is spelled correctly... I am in some crazy loop here. The wlsetup and installer claim that the programs included in Win Essentials 2012 are installed and only allows me to close the installer.
 I have tried some advanced uninstall techniques, including an Advanced Uninstaller program that does a pretty extensive cleanup, but I still end up with Windows Live folders and files no matter how I try to uninstall Win Live Esssentials.<br />
In messing with both the bootstrap installer and the offline installer I have at one point got as close as to see the windows live mail in my 'programs' but when i select it it tells me that I am missing a dll. &nbsp;...something like W*Core.dll. I tried simply
 adding that file but of course i got some stupid program that pulled a fast one on me. (required me to buy a 'fixer' program. Grrr.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:<br />
</span><span><strong>netsh wlan show profiles<br />
</strong></span>Check if your desired profile is available.<br />
&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Windows Live Mail error 3219 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jimdirt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Live Mail error 3219</h2>
                    <p>Now first off , i want to make sure to whomever replies that i am not using the Web Based Email&nbsp; , i am using Windows Live Mail version 2009 ON MY PC , as i have seen several posts about this and replies are given to work around this using IMAP ONLINE&nbsp; ,
 i do not use ONLINE webpage based email</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said , i just got this error and can't receive emails for my Hotmail account&nbsp; , i do not like nor do i want to "convert" to Outlook&nbsp; , its the same crappy Outlook it was in Windows 95&nbsp; , it looks like garbage and its functionality is less than
 useless</p>
<p>
</p><p>With that said&nbsp; , how can i get/force/make my Windows Live Mail v.2009 work on my Windows 7 Pro&nbsp; PC again (not online Outlook , or anything else online) i want it to open and work within my Windows 7 PC as it has prior to today</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any "helpful" suggestions or answers as to how to get what i currently have , working again , as i do not want to "migrate" to junk" that Microsoft is trying to FORCE its customers to use&nbsp; , i don't want it , and will not use it&nbsp; , it's just like Windows
 10 (which i will never switch to) , its functionality is poor at best and its just a outdated product that i never liked in the 90's and i like it less now , especially since its the same clunky poorly designed junk email program it was back then&nbsp; , how Microsoft
 considers this as a "upgrade" is beyond me&nbsp; , its a downgrade (Windows 10 and Outlook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as i mentioned&nbsp; , does anyone have any HELPFUL suggestions or preferably a FIX to get my Live Mail working again , as it did before today without using some "online" web based email&nbsp; ???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any Help that does not direct me to how to fix OUTLOOK ONLINE would be appreciated&nbsp; , as i don't use Outlook and i don't get my email thru webpages&nbsp; , so i need a reply that is pertinent to my actual issue using Live Mail within my PC (a program&nbsp; not a online
 webpage based email)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time i click HELP in Windows Live Mail to find a solution , it directs me to sign in to a Outlook Web Based email , and i refuse to use it , and it gives no HELP to the actual issue or error , so like usual Help is no help at all</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks ..... Jim</p>

<p>That version of the program was released in 2008. It was superseded in 2010 by a new version for use on versions of Windows later than XP. Another new version was released in 2012 for Windows 7, so yours is way out of date.&nbsp;The latest version is&nbsp;available

<p>Let's try and get this straight. IMAP is a protocol (a standardized set of commands) that mail clients like Windows Live Mail can use to synchronize mail messages and folders with those on a mail server like Hotmail. Until now, you've been using a similar
 protocol called DeltaSync to do the same thing. Hotmail accounts are being migrated to new servers that don't support DeltaSync, so IMAP is the obvious alternative. There's no such thing as '<em>IMAP online</em>'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because your version of the program is so outdated, I'm not sure whether you'd be able to follow the instructions in this article:

<p>OK , i first wanted to say , i use version 2009 because that is the only version that is any good when using/attaching photos&nbsp; , the 2010 2011 2012 versions are dumbed down&nbsp; , kind of like how Windows 10 took away almost all user control instead of giving
 us more like we need/want , and how generic Outlook always has been&nbsp; , i wish Windows Movie Maker was not part of Windows Live because i only like version 6.0 , the others took away a lot of user functions for editing , again , which is why i use 2009 Live
 Mail&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It allows photos to be resized with text added and other features that all the other/newer versions do not have anymore (why ????) , so i really need to work around this version of Live Mail&nbsp; , i was not trying to be a jerk , it just makes me mad when i
 go to use my email and it worked fine 30 minutes prior , then it does not work anymore because Microsoft decided for me what i needed to use , and did not give me the option to not "migrate" downhill and backwards like it seems they are forcing everyone to
 do&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , it seems if its not broke , Microsoft will break it and force everyone to "upgrade" to stuff that is not a upgrade&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anyway , thanks for taking the time to reply and i will try to look over what you linked , and see if i can get it to work...again , not trying to be a jerk , just pissed because i don't want this&nbsp;&nbsp; , everything was fine/perfect as it could be the way it
 was&nbsp; , i think before Microsoft implements any more changes, they should email EVERY user , even if it takes 3 years to talk to everyone , then that's how it should be&nbsp; , but EVERY user should have a say and a choice on how their PC is used/run/controlled
 , as this is a huge inconvenience to me and i would guess , many others who feel the same way from what i have read by all the complaints in these forums and when doing a Google search ....and by the way , Bing kind of sucks as well for a Search Engine , it
 takes you everywhere , but to what your actually searching for&nbsp; , which is why i only use Google , and Firefox&nbsp; (can't stand IE either , sorry) , that way i have control over what i want or dont want to view</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now that is out of the way</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the IMAP goes , i was reading other posts about this issue , as it seems a lot of people besides myself are not happy about this "migration" to something none of us want or like either&nbsp; , but in reading the replies from you guys , they kept saying
 it was for Outlook that the Help in Live Mail keeps directing me to , its a web page/based email , and they were talking about the IMAP to do with that , which my email is physically on my PC as opposed to your Outlook which is on a website/page/internet based&nbsp;
 , which is completely different from what i have , so i was assuming that is what they were discussing is the WEB BASED email as opposed to what i have&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; , sorry for the confusion&nbsp;&nbsp; , i will read thru this when i get a chance (i have to get up early and will
 be gone most of the day tomorrow so i can't do it right now)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it will fix my email and i won't have to go thru this again.....ever...., as mentioned numerous times&nbsp; , i do not like nor do i want to waste time with Outlook&nbsp; , its always been a poor email and by the looks of it , its been 21 years and it has
 not gotten any better , in fact now i think it looks and is less functional than it was in 1995 , but so is Windows&nbsp; , go figure ... both look like they were designed by a 16 year old , FOR a 16 year old&nbsp; , Win 8-8.1-10 have nothing i like at all , its sad
 that there is not 1 function in any of them that i like , but if i had the choice i would still use XP-SP1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the ramble&nbsp; , i will try your solution within the next few days and see if it works , if not i will let you know my findings ....Thanks .... Jim</p>

            If you find an answer please make sure to post it as&nbsp;I am&nbsp;having the same problem but using Windows Live Mail 2012 instead of 2009 . I hope too that it is not a force on because I believe too that Microsoft is failing at "bettering" its products and think
 the days of Windows XP are much better and the golden years of Microsoft. And hopefully they actually read all of this to realize they aren't bettering themselves.

            <p>I was able to get the IMAP working with my Live Mail 2009&nbsp; , but it is really slow and clunky now , it hangs and takes forever to download or send emails , it does work again , but its nothing like it was , but its still 100 times more functional than Outlook,
 its just not the "fix" i was hoping for&nbsp; , is there any way to make it work like Live Mail worked with DeltaSync ?? , as that is far superior to IMAP from what i can see&nbsp; , IMAP seems to be hanging on every action , even after the emails download , i click
 on them to read and they just sit there , then after 10 or more seconds they finally open , same goes for deleting a email , i click "delete" and it takes 10-20 seconds before the email actually deletes&nbsp; , so i am not really impressed with IMAP&nbsp; , it is about
 as useful as Windows 10 or Outlook&nbsp; , Windows 3.1 was better than either of these programs&nbsp; , anyway&nbsp; , any suggestions as how to get the sluggishness out of IMAP ?? , it acts like i have 500mb of ram not 4 gigs when getting emails&nbsp; , all other programs work
 fine (all programs that were not "forced" up/downgrades that is) , its that slow ....Thanks ...Jim</p>

            <p>I have been reading several posts about slow email , and all the ones that are slow are IMAP&nbsp; , everyone says it is only used for people with Apple that can't use Pop3&nbsp; , everyone says it is antiquated and slow....so my question is , WHY is Microsoft forcing
 us to use this junk , if what we have been using all along with Windows Live Mail is better and more efficient ??? , yet they take that away ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I need to FIX my email not make it as crappy as outlook&nbsp; , so can someone tell me how to Fix this speed issue IMAP has now created in my prior perfect working 2009 Windows Live Mail ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can i use besides IMAP ??? to make my Live Mail work now that Microsoft broke it for no reason other than to force me to use junk that never worked before and after all this time is still junk , and why it forces its customers to use inefficient junk
 instead of what was tried and true and actually works and functions perfectly till they took it away from us , for no logical reason and replaced it with what they replaced IMAP with , which is&nbsp; what Live Mail used for years and actually worked , now they
 went backwards to IMAP again and now nothing works ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone give me something i can use aside from IMAP ???????</p>

<p>DeltaSync was introduced in 2006 as an IMAP-like protocol that synchronizes both mail and contacts with Hotmail accounts. Calendar sync was introduced a couple of years later. It connects client and server using HTTP (as browsers do). Better synchronization
 protocols were introduced later, and the latest versions can be used on different platforms like iOS and Android as well as Windows. When Hotmail became Outlook.com in 2013, the writing was already on the wall. Now that Outlook.com has become Outlook Mail
 on a completely different platform, Microsoft took the decision not to invest the considerable engineering effort required to provision&nbsp;half a billion accounts for DeltaSync for the (relative) handful of users committed to DeltaSync - those with Windows Live
 Mail and those with Office Outlook versions 2007 and older. I have seen a figure of 3.5 million for the number of users of Windows Live Mail worldwide, which is&nbsp;peanuts in the big scheme of things.]</p>

<p>So as i mentioned you are using something from 1986 , but you think its better ???&nbsp; , every post i read about IMAP says its LESS efficient than Pop3&nbsp; , so why waste the time ??? , because its NOT better thats why&nbsp; , or better yet why not leave the Pop3 accounts
 alone altogether ???&nbsp; , you know like why not leave support for XP and Windows 7 , i will tell you why , because its BETTER&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So in all your nostalgic rambling , as typical of replies&nbsp;&nbsp; , you mentioned nothing about my main question , which is what can i use that works like Pop3 , since as mentioned , its better and faster&nbsp; , i will not use Outlook , so i need something that works
 with Live Mail , like what worked with it before that did not need to be phased out , except to FORCE people to use the IMAP junk and no other reason</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the majority of your customers use it , its because they were forced to use it&nbsp; , i would bet if given a poll (i never got one) the majority of customers would trash Windows 8 on , and opt to keep XP and 7 as is , and would also keep Live Mail ,,,,
 again as mentioned , "if" given the choice&nbsp; , as a example , my mom is 92 and almost blind , and she hates 8 , 10 , and Outlook&nbsp; , so we have her set up with Windows 7 and Live Mail , which now she can't use and now struggles to see her emails ....thanks for
 nothing&nbsp; and making someones life miserable&nbsp; , this is how your poor decisions affect others not in your 16 year old's age test group ..!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No one "transitioned" to Outlook&nbsp; , everyone was "forced" to switch&nbsp; , given the "choice" i would bet the numbers of people wanting to keep Live Mail would far outnumber those that "like" or "accepted" Outlook&nbsp; ... big difference&nbsp; , that , you can't sugar
 coat with your biased misinforming the customers&nbsp; non-fact "fact"&nbsp; , the reality is , its a Microsoft Agenda , not a customer response that enacted this "transition" you claim was necessary&nbsp; , the thing is , nothing is necessary in any of this&nbsp; , that i know
 is fact ,, i know no one that likes Outlook , or prefers Win 8 or 10 to XP or 7&nbsp; , no one ,&nbsp; a lot are leaving Microsoft because of this "transition"&nbsp; ... just sayin ... so don't include the majority of the populous in your inclusion of "they" wanted this
 transition&nbsp; , i will bet the minimal numbers are for your "transition" not the other way around as you claim&nbsp; , and as seen by the responses to my questions , i would say it proves , i am in the Majority , not the Minority
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if you polled the "public" instead of just the people that work for Microsoft , you might get a more accurate response for your polls&nbsp; , as mentioned , i was never "asked" , i was "told" i need to transition&nbsp; , big difference&nbsp; , the majority of people
 will do what you say if you say its in their best interest , but , if you ask them their opinion , they will most likely use what works best for them , and the majority would not have "transitioned" ,, again , big difference in how the "transition" is implemented
 or how its "forced" on people&nbsp; . people were forced , not asked&nbsp; , i know i was not , and complained many times i received the automated "force" email stating i "must change"&nbsp; , not once was i or anyone else "asked" if they wanted to change&nbsp; .. again , big
 difference </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sooooo , how do i get my 2009 Live Mail to work like it did before the forced change ???&nbsp; , i need a actual answer please !!! , and 2011-2012 Live Mail is not as good as 2009 , its less user friendly and much less functional , and is dumbed down from 2009
 which is why i use 2009 , because its good&nbsp; , the others , not so much</p>
<p>
</p><p>What Microsoft needs to do is just give us what we had , that actually works , back&nbsp; , that would fix the problem Microsoft created , instead of typing on a forum about issues we did not cause , but need to fix , because it was a poorly thought out idea
 to "transition" , when what worked fine could have been left alone&nbsp; , maybe Microsoft needs to "transition" to its customers needs , instead of the other way around

    <title>Xbox 360 slim internal wifi connection problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scuttle muffins  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 slim internal wifi connection problems</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, This is the 7th time this has happened to me. This is the problem and&nbsp;what I have tried to correct it.</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>My Xbox 360 Slim will not find any wireless networks. My router is a NetGear and it is less than 12 feet away from the console. So obviously the Xbox shouldn't have to play too dificult of a game of where's waldo for my xbox 360 slim.</p>
<p>How I have tried to fix it:</p>
<p>I have reset my router, reset my modem, reset my xbox, pulled the internal Wifi chip out and put it back in, specified the unlisted network, reset my Xbox to the factory defaults, tried 3 different routers, and have even tried making my xbox find the router
 through a USB set up. Nothing is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens exactly:</p>
<p>I am playing a game online, get the notification "disconnected from xbox live", I go to network connections, it shows my router with no bars, so I disconnect and scan for wireless network, No Wireless Networks Found pops up, I reset router and modem, scan
 again, No Wireless Networks Found pops up again, and I continue messing with it for hours. No error messages pop up at all. I even went as far as to call my internet provider and&nbsp;they can't help. Called the router company and they couldn't help.&nbsp;Just will
 not find my router or any router for that matter. I live in a suburb so I would find something else even if it was three faulty routers. So there has to be something wrong with the internal wifi chip. I even have three computers in my home that can find my
 router without issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there are all the facts, Please someone help. I am so sick of this problem. It sometimes fixes itself but I am sick of it happening at all since I bought the xbox brandnew and pay every month to use xbox live. This is rediculous!</p>

<p>I doubt I still have a warranty on my Xbox and if I did I have no proof of purchase as my receipt is long gone. Aside from that I still have never broken the Microsoft Seel on the back of my xbox. The internal Wifi is in the same position as the 250GB hardrive
 just the opposite side. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Well if it is a hardware problem I will just try to find a way of purchasing another internal wifi unit or an external one for that matter.

<p>To Killswitch: I updated the Firmware and still nothing</p>
<p>To Jameser: I needed help not a hand slap. I can send it in regardless if I wanted. I wanted other oppinions as to any other posibility than the transponder not working anymore.
</p>
<p>Vibroplex: I unhoooked everything except for the power and tv cord. </p>
<p>Anyways thanks to those who tried to help, I ended up just running my xbox internet through my laptop. like a giant Wifi adapter. Seems to be a lot faster anyways.

    <title>Recently burned cds not recognized by several cd players - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eddill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recently burned cds not recognized by several cd players</h2>
                    <p>Since I've had my Dell Computer (several years), I've burned a lot of cd's successfully.&nbsp; The only problem I've had in the past was getting Windows Media to get the names of the albums/song titles.&nbsp; I tried to fix it but failed and gave it up. Everything
 I burned was deemed an "unknown".&nbsp; </p>
<p>In the past couple of weeks, I've burned dozens of cd's which won't play on two of my cd players.&nbsp; All of my other burned cd's played on them without a problem.&nbsp; Only a couple of things happened recently during this time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When trying to play a disc on windows media i.e., "now playing" , it would give me a message "SERVICE UNAVAILABLE - DNS FAILURE&nbsp; The server is unable to serve your request.&nbsp; Please try again later.&nbsp; And then it gives me a reference number which changes
 each time I get the message.&nbsp; I can still get the desired album to play because they will be shown on the playlist and will play.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Because I've never been able to have the name of the album/songs part of my burned cd's, they always rip to "Unknown".&nbsp; Because of that, if I didn't burn them right away, I'd wind up with intermeshed selections from different ripped albums making the
 burning process a jumble.&nbsp; So I always ripped and burned one at a time.&nbsp; Recently, although it has seemingly reverted back again, the files ripped when from "Unkown" to an actual album CALLED "Unknown" under "U".&nbsp; This allowed for there to be several ripped
 albums existing with the title "Unknown".&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I discovered this problem accidently.&nbsp; I was doing most of my listening of burned cd's ON my computer with Windows Media and even with the SERVICE UNAVAILABLE message everytime I chose "now playing", I was able to play without a problem.&nbsp; Then I
 took some of these newer burned cd's and tried to play them on two of my old cd players who have had no problems playing all of my other burned cd's.&nbsp; I got either an error message or more frequently, a "no disc" message, suggesting that maybe these recent
 cd's didn't close properly.&nbsp; The question is, how can I prevent this from happening again and is it possible that I can somehow "save" those that are now unplayable by somehow getting them to close "after the fact".&nbsp; I thought I'd figured out a way to take
 one of those cd's and put in back into my computer and causing it to close properly but now I'm not sure how I did it to seemingly make it work.&nbsp; If it's already burned but not closed, how could I position it to get it to close.&nbsp; Simply put in it the computer
 and eject it manually (when these cd's were burned the computer was set for "automatic eject".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's it.&nbsp; I've got a LOT of recently burned cd's that WILL play on my computer (even with the weird error message) and on my dvd player connected to my TV, but will NOT play on either of my two stereo cd players....I get "no disc" messages.&nbsp;
</p>

            Hello Eddill,
<div><br />
<div>I have also experienced this issue in the past. For me, it had to do with the brand of CD I was burning.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Have you tried using a different brand of CD's to see if the disc is still not detected by some players?</div>
<div><br />
<div>I would also suggest burning the disc at a slower speed. Sometimes if you burn at the full speed, some older CD players have trouble reading the discs.</div>

            I think that what he is saying is that he has installed the windows 8 pro volume license version.

<div>We don't get the option under settings to "add windows 8 feature".</div>

            Here is a possible work around. &nbsp;If you have the msdn subscription, use the windows 8 iso. When prompted to enter a key, use the windows 8 pro retail key instead. This will actually install the pro version of windows 8. &nbsp;Then you can use the key provided
 by Microsoft for windows media center.&nbsp;

I tried the steps but when I search for "add features" I only get the "Turn windows features on or off" dialog. I do NOT have media center installed so I cannot enable it through that dialog. I cannot find where to enter the media center key no matter what
 I try. It seems as though the control panel item itself is not installed! This means that I cannot install media center AT ALL!

            <p>MSDN versions of Windows 8 pro don not have 'Add Features to Windows 8' available. No idea why this is crippled in subscription versions of the OS but it makes for a very annoying experience and looking at the forums I have not seen any solution or even
 an indication the MS understand the issue. One suggestion was to reinstall a lower version of the OS (non-Pro). Reinstalling an OS is very rarely a practical solution for anyone.</p>

<p>Can someone please look into this?</p>

<p>I can play the game online, I can play with others and I can apply to join a group in LFG but when i'm confirmed I get no notifications, or option to join the group it just stays at "Confirmed"&nbsp; It worked fine in the past with no issues now I can't get it
 to work for the life of me.&nbsp; I'm very irritated at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My NAT type is OPEN.</p>
