<p>What about the HP Notebook? I can't use fractions on there. The calculator for the Notebook is really modern, with the simple yet approachable look. I just wish I could make and or use fractions! If there is a way, please inform me. If not, HP better work

<h2>            How to disable Windows Hello for HP elitebook 840 i7</h2>
                    &nbsp;I used HP Client Security for fingerprint recognition, and this worked perfectly. Since an update Windows Hello was added as a feature, but ever since it doesn't work properly anymore. I saw a possibility on the Surface for removal of Windows Hello, but
 I don't have that option in my menu. How can I disable or deinstall Windows Hello??

</p><p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to ask some questions so that we can assist you:</p>
<p>1. Were you successful in installing the Windows Update? Or did you encounter errors?</p>
<p>2. When you mentioned that Windows Hello doesn't work properly anymore, can you describe what happens when to try to use Windows Hello?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Rolando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<br />
<p>1. Were you successful in installing the Windows Update? Or did you encounter errors?</p>
<p>No errors occurred, but in the beginning I did not have Windows Hello and at a certain stage this feature was added.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When you mentioned that Windows Hello doesn't work properly anymore. Can you describe what happens when to try to use Windows Hello?</p>
<p>It does not recognize my built in scanner for fingerprints. This problem did not occur when HP client security was doing the validation of the user. Now Windows Hello is doing this task, but I would like to return to the situation that HP client security
 provided access. </p>

    <title>How to print multiple pages to one page in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> femkepilkes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to print multiple pages to one page in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>What am I trying to do: I have a presentation in PDF format (opened in Reader) consisting of&nbsp;16 pages and would like to print on both sides, and print 2 pages on one sheet so that in total I use&nbsp;4 sheets of paper.</p>
<p>The print option&nbsp;in Windows 10 provides only a limited number of options to print your pages. Printing of both sides is an option in the print menu, but I do not know how to print multiple pages onto one print sheet.</p>
<p>

            <p>Those function are normally controlled be the capabilities of the actual application you are using and/or your printer. &nbsp;You need a more advanced PDF application to do what you are trying to do if the inbuilt reader app doesn't display that capability. &nbsp;The
 free apps built in to any OS tend to offer the basics only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take a look at some alternative 'Freeware' first to check capabilities, e.g. Foxit Reader, PDF-Xchange Viewer</p>

<h2>            Unable to cut and paste or click and drag files in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a strange problem.&nbsp; I am unable to cut and paste (using mouse or keyboard) and cannot drag and drop files on my Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; This is a relatively recent problem and I am not aware of any virus, new software, etc. being installed.&nbsp; If I connect
 my portable via Homegroup to the desktop PC I can cut and paste successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This affects ALL files of ALL types.&nbsp; Cut and Paste and Drag and Drop works OK in Word, Excel, ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen lots about the magic 'just click ESC' but this does not work!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to 'copy to folder' using right click I get an error "The target can't handle this type of document" irrespective of the file type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing Ctrl C then Ctrl V just gives an error 'Ping' sound but no message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a Safe Boot makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run virus checking, sfc /scannow and lots of other standard type fixes with no error message or success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any ideas?&nbsp; I'm beginning to despair ... :-(</p>

</p><p>Hi Greg, </p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you with your concern regarding being unable to copy folders with Windows 10, you may try the suggested troubleshooting below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use the <strong>DISM Commands. </strong><br />
Fix Windows corruption errors by using DISM. <br />
We would suggest for you to run DISM commands from Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
Follow these steps:<br />
1. Press <strong>Windows + X</strong> keys and click Command Prompt (Admin).<br />
2. Type the following commands in command prompt one by one and press <strong>Enter
</strong>after each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth<br />
<br />
You may also try checking for add-ons which may have been affecting the inability of your Windows 10 PC to perform the basic function of copying and pasting of files.
<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes. <br />
<br />
Thank you. </p>

            <p>A bit more information that may allow someone to identify the problem, and ideally a fix!, for me:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I can copy and paste (and drag and drop) text in applications (Word, Notepad, ...)
<ul>
<li>This is both using mouse and Ctrl C/Ctrl V</li></ul>
</li><li>I can create new items on the desktop (shortcuts, new text document, ...)</li><li>I can delete files and then restore them from the bin</li><li>I use EverDesk and <strong>CAN </strong>drag and drop files in there with no problems</li><li>I can download files and they save successfully</li></ul>
<p>All of the above applies whether I'm using my C: drive (Samsung SSD) or my J: drive (a normal SATA drive) or plugged in USB drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem <em>seems </em>to point to Explorer.exe but I cannot be sure.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the suggestion but I am trying to fix this <strong><em>without </em>
</strong>a reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed Double Commander and it is able to drag/drop and copy paste files on my PC with no problem.&nbsp; Clearly the problem lies with File Explorer&nbsp;to my mind.&nbsp; Is there anyway to
<em><strong>ONLY </strong></em>reinstall this component?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you read the tale of woe you'll see that I have already run a variety of DISM, SFC, ... type checks to no effect.</p>

    <title>Xbox One headset adapter to PC line in for audio on PC creates static - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jwbjnwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One headset adapter to PC line in for audio on PC creates static noise&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was wondering if anyone could explain what is causing my problem.</p>
<p>I have my xbox one by my desk hooked up to my monitor and I use my PC to record what I play using an Elgato HD. When I am playing multiplayer I am recording the chat as well. Here is the setup I use for that:</p>
<p>- Mic/headphone splitter in the headset adapter</p>
<p>- AUX cable from the headphone port of the splitter connected to the line in port of my sound card connected to my pc.</p>
<p>- Then have turned on the setting to listen to the line in port on my pc audio so I can hear the audio through my headset connected to my pc.</p>
<p>- In the Elgato settings, I have the live commentary enabled set to the line in and the html audio disabled so that the audio with the chat get's recorded.</p>
<p>With this setup, I am getting static noise from the line in. This is no fault of the Elgato, or the soundcard or the adapter as I get no static from other devices playing through the line in such as from another pc or from my phone
 etc. The adapter is perfectly fine as I have no static when my headset is directly plugged into the headset. The aux cable is fine and the splitter is fine, but is it something to do with digital/analog that is causing this? This is really confusing me what
 the issue is. It doesn't bother me much when playing games and the recording isn't bad as it's not that noticeable when me and my friends are all talking and action is going on in the game etc, but it is *** well annoying. It is not a mic in, as that would
 be mono audio otherwise, this is a line level in that I am using and I am only getting the static from the adapter connected to the line in port, no other device is giving me static.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help in what exactly is causing this as this is the most convenient setup with minimal cables. Thanks, Jase</p>

            Hi,<br />
Welcome to Microsoft answers.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You can&nbsp; right click on the Desktop, goto Properties, and the Settings tab. You can change the secondary and primary montors there.
<br />
Make the monitor the primary and then turn off the secondary. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
Warning: if you boot the laptop without the monitor attached, you will lose their settings and the moniter will become primary again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you look under the "advanced" setting of the Settings tab, depending on your graphic card, it may include a
<br />
configuration routine that will allow you to set up a permanent profile to use the moniter only if it is attached. But that varies by video card.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you have an external mouse and keyboard fro your laptop, you can also just close the lid of the laptop.
<br />
That will shut down the laptop but continue to run on the moniter.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
For more information logon to:<br />

    <title>Increase font size in menu bar, favourites drop down list. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthonywood  say:</h3>
<h2>            Increase font size in menu bar, favourites drop down list.</h2>
                    <p>I have seen the answers online to increase font size in menu and favourites drop down list but your recommendation also increases the font size in all web pages, hotmail etc etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only want the menu bar to be bigger, the favourites drop down list to be bigger and any messages at the end of a program to be bigger. Let me explain: at the end of solitaire for example, it asks what do you want to do with the game in progress? Similar
 messages often come out and they too are all in small font size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how can I increase all these and keep web pages and files such as word as they are now, ie not increase them further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be that way on my Windows 7 64 bit but I have recently had the hard drive replaced and then started from scratch, fortunately I had files saved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last thing is the task bar at the bottom is very light...almost white. I would like to get it blue like it used to be but again the online directions alter the background appearance of my screen and I don't want to change that from its pale blue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow if you can help me, then as always I would be most grateful, but please keep any instructions simple. I am not really tops at computers just scared stiff when it doesn't work the way I want it to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks, Anthony</p>

<h3> alexgiles1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Operating system couldn&#39;t be loaded because a critical system driver is missing or contains errors.</h2>
                    <p>After turning off my (custom built) PC using the on/off switch (rather than using shutdown) and then turning it back on, it presented me with a blue screen telling me my device/pc needs to be repaired, The operating system couldn't be loaded because a critical
 system driver is missing or contains errors. Error code 0xc000007b.</p>
<p>
</p><p>IN startup repair i have 3 options: continue (which sends me in a loop back to the beginning), turn off your PC (not particularly helpful) and Troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i try "reset this PC" ( and "keep my files") i am told "there was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In advanced options i have the six options:</p>
<ul>
<li>System restore - "no restore points have been created on your computer"</li><li>System image recovery - " windows cannot find a system image on this computer"</li><li>Startup repair - "Startup couldn't repair your PC"</li><li>Command prompt - I've tried sfc scannow, DISM, disabling automatic startup repair and other ways of rebooting things, non of which have worked</li><li>Startup Settings - I've experimented with most of the recommended settings non of which have worked</li><li>Go back to previous version - "we ran into a problem and wont be able to take you back to the previous version of windows. Try resetting your PC instead"</li></ul>
<p>This is my last resort before paying someone to try and fix it.</p>

            Sounds like your computer is in an inoperable state. You are best of performing a reinstall.

Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a custom install.

Step 1: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326

When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. 

Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will auto

            Hi Georgefk,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
•&nbsp;Which is the operating system installed on the computer?<br />
•&nbsp;Please give us the complete error message?<br />
<br />
If the device is not recognized by the computer, then install the driver in XP or Vista compatibility mode. Follow these steps to do the same:<br />
<br />
1. Locate the executable file for the driver installation program.<br />
2. Right-click on the file, and then click Properties.<br />
3. In the PackageName Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab.<br />
4. Click to select the Run this program in compatibility mode for check box, click Windows XP or Windows Vista in the Run this program in compatibility mode for list, and then click OK.
<br />
5. Double-click the executable file to start the installation program.<br />

    <title>Continuous exeuction of pagefile.sys on starting windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandarchaudhary  say:</h3>
<h2>            Continuous exeuction of pagefile.sys on starting windows 7</h2>
                    The pagefile.sys on my computer keeps swapping lot of data on starting my computer. This has happened to me when I have used applications which require more RAM then allocated to them as a result pagefile.sys executes to free up more memory for the application.
 But since then everytime I start my computer pagefile.sys keeps on executing for a longer duration than usual and it swaps a lot close to 1 MB/sec.<br />
It takes sometime before pagefile to swap all the data and vanish from the resource manager but this is unusual as this did not happen before and it heats up my machine tremendously.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or help is welcome.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            Hi Mandar,<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions:<br />
1.Do you have the page file set to a specific size? or is it set to "system managed" so that it can grow as needed?<br />
2. What is the amount of RAM installed in your computer?<br />

            Hi Babu,<br />
<br />
I had an issue with my graphics driver as I had accidentally uninstalled it. Then I reinstalled it and currently I am not having the issue of pagefile.sys running continuously. I have observed that when I try to load very big CSV file into machine learning
 software packages it exceeds the memory allocated to the software package and then the pagefile.sys starts running to make more free space for the application. However, the pagefile.sys should run only once to make free memory for the application but I have
 observed that every time I start my computer after such incident the pagefile keeps running and heats up my machine. I have also tried to change the increaseUserVa in bcdedit. It worked once but not every time.<br />
<br />
Any inputs on this matter.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />
<br />

            I have tried what you mentioned but the problem still persists. Is it possible this might be happening because of a malware in the system. I ran a system scan and it did not detect any virus or malicious software.<br />
<br />
Please let me know your suggestions.<br />

            <p>That's a great question. In the months leading up to the release of a new operating system, Microsoft asks hardware manufacturers to create device drivers it can include with Windows. The drivers that hardware manufacturers supply typically provide a basic
 level of functionality. If you want newer versions of drivers, you need to get them from the hardware manufacturers directly. Windows doesn't automatically check for updated drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does happen from time to time that a hardware manufacturer will provide updated drivers to Microsoft to be added to Windows and provided to users through Windows Update. This is unusual, however, and typically means that the original driver has a particular
 problem and the hardware manufacturer wants the fix to receive the widest possible audience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An aside: People like to think they always need to have the newest drivers, probably because that's what they hear from Level 1 tech support that doesn't know any better. The fact is, you only need to update a driver if the newer version addresses a specific
 problem that your computer is experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every driver update has Release Notes or some other form of change log that describes exactly what issues the update addresses. If none of them apply to you, you're not going to benefit by updating. I know that sounds contra-intuitive. Just because something
 is newer doesn't mean it's better.</p>

<br />I'm Nathan, a fellow Microsoft customer and expert user here to help. 
<br />
<br />The 1803 update made some changes with networking such as disabling SMBv1 and removing HomeGroups. 
<br />
<br />I would suggest looking at the following websites guide to try and resolve this issue: <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes so I can advise further. 
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,

    <title>Windows 8.1 upgrade from 8.0 on Samsung Series 9 laptop results in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cassisi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 upgrade from 8.0 on Samsung Series 9 laptop results in infinite reboot loop - where is the pause&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After update downloads from the Microsoft Store, it installs, and when it reboots it ends up failing with "ACPI Bios Error" and immediately rebooting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no way to break this cycle: bios keystroke (F2) does not work probably due to the speed of the cycle and the Windows keys (Shift-F8) don't either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My point of concern is that at this point in the installation cycle I should be able to insert an appropriately formatted/installed USB stick and boot off that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, even after finally getting into the BIOS and setting the USB stick to be the first item to check in the boot priority list, this is ignored. Moreover, going back into the BIOS again shows that the order has been changed back. Specifically, the SDD
 entry is forced to the front: all other changes remain.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone confirm if this is a deliberate feature of the SecureBoot + Windows installation? i.e. am I right in suspecting that Windows (or UEFI) is deliberately forcing the SDD to boot, regardless?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><u>Why did Microsoft decide to automatically reboot on the error rather than pausing and providing the option to reboot into UEFI?</u></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Without this, the laptop is unrecoverable</strong> - unless you do the steps below or send it back to Samsung.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Manual workaround for anyone hitting this is:</p>
<p>1) Remove the back of the laptop, locate the SSD drive (a rectangular board against the edge covered by a diagonal black bracket with 2 screws), and remove it carefully</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Turn on and you'll get the Samsung prompt which includes pressing F4 for Recovery mode</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Do so, and immediately push back in the SSD drive - be quick and be careful</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Choose to restore and wait for it to boot into the restored Windows (8.0)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) Immediately run the "SW Update" software and install the BIOS/Firmware update - this, btw, is the cause of the problem: a buggy Samsung BIOS, not that they've admitted it (yet) and reboot when prompted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) Turn it off and put the laptop back together </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can now probably repeat the 8.1 upgrade download and install process - I wanted a clean install so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7) Obtain your ISO of 8.1 and associated key</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>8) Use Rufus to write a GPIT/FAT32 USB stick (google "Rufus USB" and choose the "GPIT for UEFI" option)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>9) Use Windows 8.0 to boot into the UEFI (firmware) and ensure USB is set before the HDD/SDD&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10) Insert the USB stick and boot</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11) I then chose to format the C: drive (do not touch the other partitions)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>12) And finally 8.1 installed cleanly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>13) Then on first login download the "SW Update" software off Samsung's website, install and run it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>14) Ensure you choose manually all the drivers, ignoring the other rubbish</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And you'll now have a 100% clean and working 8.1....</p>

            Thank you for sharing this. We've hit this *exact* problem. We similarly have not managed to break the reboot cycle with any key press.
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately in our case the restored W8 fails too boot in just the same way (the restore point may be past the windows update which was a prerequisite for 8.1, but I'm speculating here), however Windows did now offer safe mode options after the first
 failure post power cycle, and provided us access to the BIOS. This meant we could disable secure boot and quick boot, but the BIOS could not see any other boot devices so we could not set a priority order for USB (from either port) nor NIC. (None of the safe
 mode options would boot either.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>We have performed a clean 8.1 install on the SSD in another laptop, then transferred the result back to the S9, but that fails to boot too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>We are now attempting a W7 install in another laptop, if that boots we will try the Samsung update, failing that it's going back to the manufacturer.</div>

            <p>I have a Samsung Series 5 Ultra notebook with a solid state drive, purchased&nbsp;April 2013 (now out of warranty).&nbsp; Shortly after buying it I tried updating from W8 to 8.1 and ran into this exact problem.&nbsp;The dealer couldn't solve the problem and returned the
 machine to Samsung under warranty.&nbsp; 2 new motherboards later it was finally returned to me functioning, but&nbsp;still with W8 which I have used ever since with no further attempt to upgrade.&nbsp; For various reasons I recently tried to reinstall factory settings&nbsp;using
 the&nbsp;Samsung/Windows utility and&nbsp;hit&nbsp;exactly the same (ACPI_BIOS Error loop) problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After researching it, I saw that it&nbsp;is a not uncommon problem&nbsp;on this and other Samsung models,&nbsp; But disappointingly, even after all this time, no useful advice on how to deal with it&nbsp;has been issued by either Samsung or MS.&nbsp; The only self-help I could find
 is the manual workaround described above by cassisi.&nbsp; Although his/her model is different&nbsp;the problem&nbsp;appeared to be very&nbsp;similar so I thought I'd give it a try.&nbsp; However the process on my machine seems to work a little different and&nbsp;I was not initially successful.&nbsp;
 On the the third try however, the process worked, so&nbsp;may therefore be of interest to others with&nbsp;similar issues.&nbsp;This was my process/experience:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Unplugged power, disconnected battery (with paperclip in hole at back of machine), removed back of machine and disconnected the ribbon that&nbsp;connects&nbsp;the SSD.</p>
<p>2. Reconnected power and&nbsp;started machine.&nbsp; Waited until the following message appeared: "All boot options are tried.&nbsp; Press &lt;F4&gt; key to recover with factory image using Recovery or any other keys for next boot loop iteration"</p>
<p>3. Quickly reconnected the ribbon that connects the SSD and pressed F4, which brought up a "Recovery" window with a "Please wait" message and then a EULA which I accepted.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;This brought up a screen offering a choice of "Backup" (of drive C: contents) - requiring connecting of adequately sized external storage media; or "Recovery".&nbsp; I selected "Recovery"</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Recovery settings were: "Recovery point"&nbsp;- only one available&nbsp;was 10/13/2012; "Inspecting Recovery point" - Off; "Partition settings" - Off; "Maintain User Data" - Off (not needed as I had no data left on the machine)</p>
<p>6. I clicked the "Recover" button, a "Recovery" window reopened with an Yes/No option to continue warning - that all C: contents would be deleted.&nbsp; I clicked Yes and the 0-100%&nbsp;"Recovery in Progress" window appeared showing progress</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; When 100% was reached the message changed to "Configuring user environment after recovery" and then to "Recovery is completed&nbsp;and the system will restart.&nbsp; The system will begin initial configuration after rebooting...." An&nbsp;"OK" button was provided to
 acknowledge this message and there was no other option but to click it.</p>
<p>8. The system rebooted and a screen appeared to select display language.&nbsp; I chose&nbsp;English and clicked Next (the only option)</p>
<p>9. A screen appeared top select Country/region, Language, and Keyboard layout.&nbsp; I made selctions and clicked Next (the only option)</p>
<p>10. A screen with License terms for Microsoft software and Norton appeared., which I accepted</p>
<p>11. A "Let's go through a few basics" screen appeared very briefly, followed by a "Personalize" screen, to pick a screen color and provide a PC Name, which I did and then clicked Next (the only option)</p>
<p>12. A "Settings" screen appeared offering a choice between "Express" and "Custom" settings.&nbsp; I chose Customized and went through 3 screens selecting desired settings, and clicking Next (the only option)</p>
<p>13. A "Sign in to your PC" screen appeared to enter User name, Password and Password hint.&nbsp; I entered these and clicked "Finish"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Finish" appeared to be the only choice to conclude step 13, but it was the fateful one.&nbsp;The first two times I attempted this process the system restarted itself after clicking Finish and went straight into the same looping error message/reboot.&nbsp; The third
 time however, a brief message flashed on the screen. "We'll continue&nbsp;right after ?? restarting??" (it was too quick to see&nbsp;the last word).&nbsp; And the next few screens successively started&nbsp;telling me about&nbsp;W8&nbsp;and eventually ended up with the "Metro" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected with my home network after entering the security key and was then able to connect to the internet.&nbsp; Heeding cassisi's advice above I immediately looked for SW Update and updated it.&nbsp; For this I had to enter the serial number of the machine (which
 was on the original box which I still had in my basement).&nbsp; I then received messages that I had to activate W8 with a product key, and that if I didn't know what it was I could buy a new one from MS.&nbsp; Since I had no note of the original product key (it wasn't
 on the box, or the invoice, or any of the minimal documentation provided with the machine) this led to a 30 minute&nbsp;telephone call&nbsp;with a Microsoft support agent who, after some effort, was able to provide a product key that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm crossing my fingers that everything is back to "normal".&nbsp; I have downloaded SW Update and appear to have a functional machine again, instead of an $800 piece of junk metal and plastic (good because I can't afford to replace this machine after
 only a year and a half).&nbsp; Theoretically I think I should be able to upgrade to W8.1 now,&nbsp;but I will&nbsp;reload my application software first and continue working with&nbsp;it for a&nbsp;while before I take that plunge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a shame that Samsung hasn't stepped up to the plate to address what is obviously a problematic and buggy arrangement in BIOS or UEFI, or both, in its not inexpensive machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this tale may give&nbsp;heart to anyone in a similar position to myself, who may feel like they have no&nbsp;options but to&nbsp;spend another $800 on a new machine, $350-400 on an (unnecessary)&nbsp;new motherboard, or&nbsp;just throw in the towel and junk&nbsp;what, with a little
 more persistence,&nbsp;may still be a&nbsp;serviceable machine.&nbsp; And many thanks to cassisi, obviously&nbsp;very knowledgeable&nbsp;on the technical side, who took the time to explain the basic process in steps an average person can understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One&nbsp;final question to cassisi, if he/she is still around.&nbsp; Having now run SW Update, do you think I should now be able to update from Windows 8 to 8.1 without a repetition of the ACPI-BIOS error?</p>

            <p>With Samsung model NP270E5E with the same problem the only way I've managed to enter the Recovery — with SSD ready to disconnect, after powering on, somewhere during the sign «Samsung» I quickly disconnected and reconnected the SSD, and after several tries
 it worked and I managed to enter the Recovery program.</p>
<p>But recovery didn't help, the problem remained.</p>

            <p>Glad this&nbsp;was of help to someone. To summarise, the incompatibility of Windows 8.1 with my laptop was resolved by updating the laptop's BIOS (aka "firmware") via the usual Samsung update utility. This must be done before attempting to upgrade to Windows
 8.1 - or the machine will get stuck in a tight reboot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, I recently upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, provided you run the Samsung update utility and carefully confirm there are no BIOS/Firmware updates available to install, I see no reason why an upgrade to 8.1 or even 10 should trigger this particular issue.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would like to know if you're still having this issue with trackpad. In line with this,
<span>if your touchpad isn’t working, it may be a result of a missing or out-of-date driver. To get this sorted, I've got a few handy solutions that you can try:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>On Start , search for Device Manager, and select it from the list of results. Under Mice and other pointing devices, select your touchpad, open it, select the Driver tab, and select Update Driver. If Windows doesn't find a new driver, look for one on the
 device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</li><li>If those steps didn't work, try uninstalling your touchpad driver: open Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) the touchpad driver, and select Uninstall. Restart your device and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</li><li>If that didn't work, try using the generic driver that comes with Windows. Here's how: in Device Manager, right-click (or press and hold) your touchpad driver &gt; Update driver software... &gt; Browse my computer for driver software &gt; Let me pick from a list
 of device drivers on my computer, select HID compliant mouse, select Next, and follow the instructions to install it.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>Thanks for your help. I updated my driver and I was able to use the trackpad with my mouse being plugged in...however now I have lost the setting in Touchpad settings to disable while my mouse is plugged in. I updated driver and it was no longer there, I
 uninstalled and it was no longer there and I tried to install from my computer files and the setting is gone.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I did not experience such an issue but found methods that I think would be helpful for your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try the steps in the following methods and hopefully one of the following methods should fix the issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Update the graphics card driver, Ref: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</p>
<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌</p>
<p>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or click Continue.</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Device Manager, locate the Display updaters, and then double-click the device name.</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; Use Graphics card control panel to change the settings of the Dual monitor settings instead of Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalize &gt;Display settings.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong> You need to follow this below link to setup dual monitor as an admin</p>
