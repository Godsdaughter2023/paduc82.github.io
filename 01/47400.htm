            Its an imation Apollo m100, it worked last night i was using it to open a PowerPoint, it opened fine and then made the ejecting sound like they make when you insert or eject a usb, but I never ejected or even touched it. I tried safely ejecting but it
 wasn't recognised on the computer anymore. Found it in device manager and updated driver, says driver is updated but still error 10 device cannot open. Have even tried using a different cord and still no luck.... Thanks for your help. The comp it was always
 used with was a windows 7 (toshiba) thank you again &nbsp;

<p>Hi, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>deleted the file mcepg2-0 file. It was the only database file in there. It definitely made a difference so far cause before media center / videos would not work on my computer</p>
<p>now it does, thanks, saw this fix on the web as well but really wanted to be sure before I deleted something important.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I appear to have accidentally opened an email with malware. Since then, when I try to run Windows Defender, I get the message:&nbsp; c:\ Program Files\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe&nbsp; "Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the

            <p><span>Hello Gary,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Are you the administrator of the user account?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if similar issue persists on another user account?</span></li><li><span>What are the troubleshooting methods performed to resolve the issue?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to the following reasons:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>No&nbsp;permission to access the file or the file location.</span></li><li><span>The file is on a location that is not currently accessible like a network location or an external drive that is not currently
 connected to the PC.</span></li><li><span>The file has been moved or deleted.</span></li><li><span>The file or shortcut is corrupt.</span></li><li><span>The file may be blocked by Windows.</span></li><li><span>Your antivirus software may be blocking the file.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to give full permissions to the user profile by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the properties of the main
<strong>User Profile </strong>folder where the files are located (such as Documents, Pictures, etc.). You can open the properties of a particular folder by
<strong>right-clicking </strong>on it and select <strong>Properties </strong>from context menu.</span></li><li><span>Go to the
<strong>Security tab</strong> and click <strong>Advanced</strong>.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Click on
<strong>Change permissions</strong> located at the bottom of the window.</span></li><li><span>Check the box at the bottom of the window
<strong>Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this object</strong> and then click
<strong>Ok</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you.</span></p>

<p>I went through the process you suggested above although some of the names were different. I right-clicked the Defender &gt;Properties&gt;Security&gt;Advanced tab and checked the Permission entries - there seemed to be a duplicate entry for each Principal: ie SYSTEM,
 Administrators and my name log-in (6 in all). All of these were designated 'Full control' - the first three Inherited from 'None' and the second three Inherited from C:\'my name'\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\IE\QuickLaunch\User\pinned\task...</p>
<p>There is no "<span><strong>Replace all child object permissions with inheritable permissions from this object</strong></span>" at the bottom, only "<strong>Disable Inheritance</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this help? It doesn't mean that much to me.</p>

<p>Also:</p>
<p>It is a standalone computer - no network.</p>
<p>There is an external drive, but I only use it for backups, file history etc.&nbsp; Not sure how Windows Defender could have moved itself over there.</p>
<p>The full name of the security window referred to above is: ‪C:\Users\Gary\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch\User Pinned\TaskBar\Windows.Defender.lnk</p>
<p>There is and has been no other antivirus software on the computer.</p>

            <p>I'm having a similar problem, on Win 10. I'm trying to click the button "Open Windows Defender" in the settings of the Action Center's Update &amp; Security panel and I get this message: &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>"Windows cannot access the specified device, path or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also can't alter other options in under the Windows Defender tab. My main intention was to to add exclusions to Windows Defender but looks like I can't set the settings whatsoever.</p>
<p>Your solution did not work for me. I tried restarting explorer.exe with administrator privileges but no success.
<br />
What do I have to do to alter windows defender settings if I'm (an) the administrator?</p>

            <p>Hi DoubledDYZ,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b> Boot into safe mode and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP:
</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b> If the issue does not occur in safe mode, you may put your system in clean boot state (in normal mode) to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not persist you may continue with
<b>step 2</b> from the above link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Make sure you reset the computer to normal mode after the troubleshooting completes. Refer the section “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state”
</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If beep sound comes when the computer is muted then sounds like could possibly be internal (hardware).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 freezes during boot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markus_dressler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezes during boot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>(please excuse my English since it is not my mothertongue. Also this is my first post here so apologies in advance if it is not the correct place)</p>
<p>
</p><p>my laptop (HP Pavilion DV7 6116sg with Win 10) worked - apart from a dead battery two years ago - flawlessly up to a week ago.
</p>
<p>Then it froze completely (hard reset required) in the middle of a game. </p>
<p>A day later, it froze at the beginning of the game.</p>
<p>After hard reset, Windows did not even boot up to the login screen - the spinning dots freeze just before it should appear and all HDD activity ceases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has an Intel HD 3000 onboard GPU and a AMD Radeon HD 6770M. When playing graphics-intensive games a lot of heat was generated and the fan did not seem too effective to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode still works. So I suspect a (hardware?) problem with the dedicated AMD-GPU.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled and read a lot on this topic, but found absolutely no way to verify the assumption that it is really the AMD that causes the problems. Also I did not find a way to do a regular boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I tried so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>RAM memory check (HP System diagnostics / BIOS): OK - passed</li><li>HDD SMART/short/long DST: OK - passed</li><li>Checked Windows system files integrity with sfc / scannow : OK - passed</li><li>Tried to deactivate fast boot via system control panel &amp; registry: This option is missing on my computer / made no difference</li><li>shutdown -g -t 0 : made no difference</li><li>disabled AppXSvc via registry: made no difference</li><li>tried to delete AMD Radeon-device from device manager: made no difference</li><li>CMOS battery check - i guess it must still be ok since BIOS has the correct date &amp; time</li><li>tried to identify driver conflicts / problems with several tools like DriverEasy etc. - no difference</li><li>tried RegCleaners like CCleaner etc. - no difference</li><li>deactivated all non-Microsoft-services via msconfig - no difference - but interestingly the "diagnosis system start" (2nd option on the "general"-tab of msconfig) works; similar to safe mode</li><li>opened the machine and blew all
<p>and some more drastic measures like</p>
<ul>
<li>tried to restore a system recovery point via the Win 10 UEFI / troubleshoot-screen (Windows starts the "Automatic repair" which fails): Windows could not restore one of the three existing recoveries<br />
</li><li>tried to reset the system: That also produced an error message in the troubleshoot / advanced options
</li><li>reinstalled Windows completely from external USB device made with MS Media Creation tool on formatted C: partition: Windows installed flawlessly and also booted perfectly the first time. But the first restart fails - it again freezes just when the login
 screen (Hello) should appear and HDD activity ceases... arghh...<br />
</li></ul>
<p>So, after several days &amp; nights of trying everything I could find on the net so far I am now close to giving up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still have no idea if it is really the GPU-hardware causing the trouble. Can I test that somehow?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I try anything else to get my laptop up and running, i.e. booting normally? Did I miss something important?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, if all else fails, can I somehow tell Windows to use only the onboard Intel GPU so that at least I can use the laptop in some way? My BIOS only has the settings "dynamic" and "fixed mode" for the two GPUs, nothing more.
</p>
<p>(I do not know yet if i can physically remove or disconnect the AMD GPU; but I guess not - will ask HP that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input/suggestion is very welcome! Thanks a lot in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Markus</p>

<p>Hi Markus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you’re encountering system instability issues like abrupt shut downs, especially while doing something demanding like playing PC games, your computer may be overheating. This can happen for several reasons. Your laptop’s case may be full of dust, a fan
 may have failed, something may be blocking your computer’s vents, or you may have a compact laptop that was never designed to run at maximum performance for hours on end. If the laptop was never designed to be opened by users, we suggest that you consult a
 computer technician for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we can help you with anything else, let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thank you for your answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Overheating was my first guess, actually, since the mache could get very hot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I wrote, I already opened my laptop and blew all the dust out - there was not that much, surprisingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fan still works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I guess, as a 17"-laptop with a dedicated GPU I suspect that it was designed as a "gaming" laptop that can - at least, run some time with full GPU load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for my problem, I now managed to boot Windows 10 normally using the latest leshcat-drivers that are strongly recommended on the HP forums for the combination "Intel HD Graphics 3000 + AMD Radeon 6770M" (http://leshcatlabs.net/ ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it gets interesting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Starting either FurMark or the game mentioned above, the system instantly freezes completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when I disable the AMD-GPU before in the control panel, both applications start without freezing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I guess my AMD-GPU-hardware really failed, maybe due to several overheatings in the past.</p>
<p>Do you concur?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any news?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Same problem here... on 23 june I was working with dedicated GPU (amd6770) and at some point all freezes.</p>
<p>On restart Win10 didn't boot and freezes at spinning dots.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Firstly I think my gpu was gone due to the overheat, but now that I found other users with the same identical problem, I think it's the |WIN10 creators update + auto-updated video drivers| mix that causes the problem.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I <span><span>temporarily resolved cleaning all video drivers and install leshcat ones, but AMD doesn't work anymore... and I force the pc to use integrated gpu in the AMD panel.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have 9.17.10.4459 INTEL drivers for HD3000 (win10 force to auto-update it every time I restart) and 16.301.1901.0 leshcat ones for the AMD HD6770m, but I'm able to use my pc only with intel.</p>
<p>Every time I try to launch an application with dedicated GPU the pc freezes almost instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some program being unusable because they work only with dedicated GPU, if I try to launch them with INTEL give this error:</p>
<p><strong><em>"LoadLibrary failed with error 1114: A dynamic link library (DLL) initialization routine failed"</em></strong></p>
<p>I think due to bad INTEL drivers<strong>...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: https://askubuntu.com/questions/932547/disabling-discrete-graphics-before-during-installation &lt;-- as this guy asked, also my AMD gpu stay in stand by when using pc and led the pc to drawing max power generating a lot of heat and causing the battery
 to drain extremely quickly.</p>
<p>As he says It's like the AMD is triggered but if used give the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Perhaps uninstalling the Creators Update could help? <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/032a0ac7-85fb-4064-b0c4-e74ac10eea7c" title="Markus_Dressler">
Markus_Dressler</a> did you try this?</p>
<p>You wrote that </p>
<ul>
<li>"<em>reinstalled Windows completely from external USB device made with MS Media Creation tool on formatted C: partition: Windows installed flawlessly and also booted perfectly the first time. But the first restart fails - it again freezes just when the
 login screen (Hello) should appear and HDD activity ceases... arghh..."</em></li></ul>
<p>But the reinstallation was with Creators Update or without? </p>
<p>First time it booted flawlessly, did you try to use AMD GPU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>----------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please someone from MS help us to resolve this big problem.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Can&#39;t copy image with right click &#62; copy image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ghulai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Can&#39;t copy image with right click &#62; copy image</h2>
                    I tried to find a solution but so far I couldn't find any<br />
<br />
For some reason I can't right click &gt; copy image from a website to paste it anywhere (social media, FB messenger, twitter DM..etc). I know that I can save it and then send it but I'm trying to fix this issue if possible.&nbsp;<br />
EDIT: I can right click &gt; copy image but nothing really happens, it doesn't copy<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 family.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the description of the issue, I understand that you are facing Start up error issues, with the error message related to
</span>schannel errors </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly provide us few more details on the below questions to understand the issue better.</p>
<p>1. Was&nbsp;the Update for Windows 10 successful without any error.?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to login to the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you to follow the below recommended methods and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 1</span></p>
<p>Try to employ the System File Checker tool and see if there are any issues with System File integrity which can be fixed automatically.</p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2</span></p>
<p>If the above recommendation did not help, use the <strong>DISM</strong> commands and check.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 3</span></p>
<p>If the above recommendations did not help, I would suggest you to d<span>ownload the ISO file for Windows 10 from the referred link and perform a repair using the same Installation Media and see if the issue can be resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 1: Follow the below link to create an ISO image for Windows 10.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Step 2: Perform the repair using the bootable media as suggested in the below link.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1)">Alternatively, if the update fails to register and download the requisite drivers for the device, you can also use the vendor id of the device and look for it in the Microsoft Update Catalog.</span><span>&nbsp;

            Hi Montgomery.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is there a Reset button at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Flight Simulator app &gt; Advanced Settings?  Try that first.
<br />
<br />If not and there's also no Reset in the app, then I'd uninstall it, restart PC and reinstall it again - from a fresh download if possible.  
<br />
<br />You can also contact the game's maker's Support site to see if there are needed patches or newer version.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<p>Hello Greg,&nbsp; Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; Not listed in apps, since I think, but cannot confirm that most of this game is based back in the dos days.&nbsp; I am going to try a couple of other things.&nbsp; One trick is to use the Shift &amp; Print Screen keys, which makes
 a BMP I think, then open word and paste it there, and then it will print.&nbsp; If that does not work, then I can just write down the things I need from that screen.&nbsp; I was hoping to keep them as logs so I know how many hours, landings, etc. I got but it's not
 that big a deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I reset the PC back to factory three times to get the program to install in the first place.&nbsp; Then found patch which cleared up install and activation errors.&nbsp; KB928080.&nbsp; Not printing the flight log is not a big deal.&nbsp; As stated, this is not the steam
 edition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to attempt to reload steam edition on a different hard disk to see if both of them can work.&nbsp; Am reluctant because I got this one working 99%.&nbsp; FSX, in fact all the flight sims were a good program from MSFT.&nbsp; They made a lot of money from them.&nbsp;
 It's sad they quit making updates and sold off the studios to a third party.&nbsp; MSFT did a great job with this product.&nbsp; The other current sims out there are complex, and I know this one, and don't want to start over with new planes, and a program I don't know.&nbsp;
 That is why this thing still lives.&nbsp; Lots of people use it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for your help.&nbsp; FWIW-The original program was published back in the days when DOS was the operating system of the day.&nbsp; It has been updated time and time again by MSFT, until the last version of FSX in 2006 was published.&nbsp; Three
 updates: SP1, SP2 and an add on which included SP2 was published for the Gold Edition.&nbsp; Then it was sold to a third party.&nbsp; There are still errors in the game, sent them a long e-mail.&nbsp; Have not checked to see if they are aware of them or what response they
 provided.</span></p>

            Hello again -
<br />
<br />Just to clarify;  If a program is installed it now goes into Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features which is replacing Control Panel &gt; Programs and features.  It's possible the game is so old it only goes to CP so you can do a search for the (now hidden) CP to check, but I doubt it. 
<br />
<br />Have you tried installing it in Compatibility Mode which can smooth out some old programs' install and function?  See here:  
<br />https://www.****/articles/set-compatib...
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15078/...</a>
<br />
<br />Keep in mind also that you can hold the Windows (flag) key and use PrtScreen to take a snap of the screen at any time, then past it into Paint or a document to Save.  You can also use the Snipping Tool to save a screenshot of the logs:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>  (The Snipping Tool is so valuable they're talking about discontinuiing it, too!)

<p>It shows up in CP, not apps.&nbsp; As mentioned, it's mostly a DOS base I think, and as such is not handled directly by the OS.&nbsp; I tried the Shift+Print Screen and the Windows key+print screen, neither worked.&nbsp; The rest of the program works fine, so I am not
 going to worry about it.&nbsp; Someone else has the answer who plays the game on W-10Home.&nbsp; There is a large FSX community on YouTube, and I have communicated with those folks, so I might ask them if they know since they use it all the time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to attempt the steam version install on my D drive, and see what happens.&nbsp; Hopefully if will not blow up my FSX C drive install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time, but I don't think this is an easy fix.&nbsp; And I would rather have the game working, than try a reinstall and it break in such a way it wont work at all.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            thumbnail previews not showing.  I have done everything I can, followed all directions still not displaying icons.</h2>
                    <p>http://www.thewindowsclub.com/thumbnail-previews-not-showing-windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the file folder options, I have the "always show icons never thumbnails" box unchecked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then they say to look under ADVANCED SETTINGS, but there is not a page or a link to take me to there.&nbsp; At that point, in PERFORMANCE OPTIONS it tells me to check box that says "SHOW THUMBNAILS INSTEAD OF ICONS."&nbsp; Which does not make any sense to me, because
 that seems like the exact opposite of what they just directed me to do before.&nbsp; Either way, I cannot find how they expect me to get there.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed some other site's directions to get into the BIOS and mess with the settings there, I think it was basically resetting everything.&nbsp; I cannot remember exactly what it was, I was just following directions.&nbsp; Whatever it was that I did, it is still
 not allowing me to see images before opening them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some other problems with it, are that if I scroll down the list of icons, I can see a quick flash of the image.&nbsp; It is just right past when the image first appears.&nbsp; Sometimes one of the hundreds of image icons will display within a folder, but the others
 are left blank.&nbsp; This is particularly problematic because I run a business where I need to be able to see and access the images.&nbsp; I cannot just shoot in the dark and hope for the best.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The previews do not display on my desktop background either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Alright, so that did not work when I tried to follow your instructions.&nbsp; I think that maybe the cause must be something else.&nbsp; There was a problem that I encountered, but it was further down the list, so I am going to state back to you what I did to see
 if there was something I did incorrectly or something I missed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed thumbnail files from the FREE UP STORAGE SPACE location.&nbsp; The first time I did it, it froze halfway through, and then after doing it again it was much quicker to purge the files.&nbsp; I did not work, so I checked again, and it told me the space was
 empty.&nbsp; So, it looks like I got that part right.&nbsp; After restarting the computer, I opened one of the many folders containing images and the thumbnails did not display.&nbsp; I went into the VIEW setting, and confirmed that large was the size of image displayed.&nbsp;
 Then I looked at other options, like extra large, and smaller, to see if the image would display that way, and no images would display regardless of size of thumbnail.&nbsp; I then set the size to large before closing the folder.&nbsp; I did not use a scroll wheel to
 change size, because I am using a laptop that does not have a scroll wheel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the command to clear the Windows Cache by pressing the Windows Key + R and then I typed in the code you provided, and then pressed enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I only have one computer login option, so I am sure that it is why they did not request the Administrator questions to be answered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open command console with admin privileges&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>taskkill /IM explorer.exe /F&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>CD /d %userprofile%\AppData\Local&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>DEL IconCache.db /a&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>start explorer.exe via Task Manager&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am a little unsure about what exactly I was supposed to do in this part above.&nbsp; &nbsp;So, what I did was I typed it all in without pressing enter to drop it down to the next line.&nbsp; That failed.&nbsp; Then, I typed each line
 of code, followed by pressing enter, and each code was accepted, I believe, until the last one, which I have come to believe was not you asking me to enter that in as code, but as a separate command to be executed via Task Manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I got the section below performed correctly, it was straight forward enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Rebuild the icon cache.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Press Windows key + X&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Click Task Manager&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Click the Processes tab&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Select Windows Explorer&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Click End task&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Now this part below, I struggled with.&nbsp; I do not thing I was able to do this part correctly.&nbsp; So, I will walk you through what happened, and maybe you can explain to me how I am supposed to do it correctly.&nbsp;
 First things first, I was unable to transition from the last task into the upcoming task.&nbsp; After ending Windows Explorer, I could not open the start menu, because I could not scroll down the to bottom of my screen and open up the start menu, because I had
 just killed Windows Explorer, so that was no longer an option.&nbsp; I also tried to escape or get into it another way by pressing control tab, which would not let me leave that screen.&nbsp; So I shut off the computer and restarted in order to get to the next process.&nbsp;
 I am not sure if that was something that interfered with the correct way I was supposed to go about this, but that was the only way I knew how to.&nbsp; If I did that wrong, please inform me of how to do it and I will try it over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So once I restarted the computer, I checked a folder to see if the image icons had appeared.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; Then, I followed the following directions, and that seemed to have worked fine.&nbsp; I exited that, and restarted the computer.&nbsp; Now the last few remaining
 icons in one big folder have been deleted.&nbsp; However there are like four random icons that are still showing, that were never deleted.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open Start, type: CMD&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Right click CMD&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Click Run as administrator&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>DEL /F /S /Q /A %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer\thumbcache_*.db&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Exit then restart.</span></p>

<p>Thank you for your response,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was not able to get the folder files to reset the image previews after performing both sets of directions for this problem.&nbsp; When I enter the folder titled PHOTOS, I do not have problems accessing those images from there.&nbsp; I never had problems accessing
 those images.&nbsp; However, I do have problems accessing images from other folders.&nbsp; All of the problem folders I have are folders that I created.&nbsp; They are all filled with images that I moved there from somewhere else.&nbsp; &nbsp;When I access those folders, there are
 some random ones that display, and those few ones that display are the same ones as before I attempted to fix this problem.&nbsp; The other ones will flash briefly, too fast for my brain to process what the images are.&nbsp; If I scroll down over following images, I
 cannot see what those images are either, because they flash so quickly that my brain cannot process what they are.&nbsp; All of the things I have done so far will not display them.&nbsp; The image that I see is a box, with white interior, and a document with the right
 corner folded over.&nbsp; Is it possible that the image was stored the wrong way in order for me to see it?&nbsp; Or is it possible there was a firewall or some other barrier that is preventing me from viewing the picture?</p>

            Here is another one you can try.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />Still no progress? Then I suggest you perform a repair upgrade:

                    Can anyone tell me how I can see the total running time for a file in WMP?&nbsp;I've just gotten Vista, and this media player just shows the elapsed time down beside the progress&nbsp;bar.&nbsp; I have no idea why they would remove the total running time from the display?&nbsp;

            Hi Petef1,<br />
<br />
When you load a video file in Media Player, if you'll click on the elapsed time counter on the screen, it should adjust the counter display to read elapsed time as well as total time.&nbsp; Clicking it again should also change it to remaining time.&nbsp; I hope this
 helps!<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting!<br />

<h3> cts3806  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does archiving in Windows Mail interact with gmail&#39;s web-based archiving&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm confused about the best way to manage old emails. If I archive mail using Windows Mail, the mail appears to stay in the gmail inbox, as if it were new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Likewise--I think--if I archive mail in gmail, nothing happens in Windows mail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get these two archiving methods to work in sync? If not, what's the recommended way for efficient archiving, without repeating efforts using two different interfaces?</p>

            <p>Remember that gmail is a special type of service that doesn't work like any other email services ever in history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail doesn't have folders, it has labels. &nbsp;Sure it "looks" like folders, but a message can be tagged with unlimited labels. &nbsp;When viewed through a regular email program, the same message will appear to be duplicated in all the folders for which it is tagged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gmail.com also has options for "what to do when another email program marks a message as archived or deleted". &nbsp;You can pick if you want Gmail to just remove the label (thus causing the message in question to fall into the "All Mail" folder), or in the cases
 of deletes, whether or not you want it to go to the same "All Mail" or truly delete it (Gmail really tries to convince you to never delete, that's the goal of Gmail is to archive it all and find it again later).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have mine setup so that archiving in Windows Mail puts it in the Archive folder (in the mail app) but I have Google's IMAP settings linked that "folder" to the All Mail folder on the gmail web interface.</p>

            <p>That is super-helpful; thanks. Sounds like those gmail settings are exactly what I need to explore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to have the mail, when archived by Windows Mail, also be archived on the gmail server? (that may be what you are saying, though gmail folders/tags confuse me: If it is tagged "all mail" , but not "inbox" , does that count as archived, from
 gmail's perspective?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you delete in Windows Mail, that *does* delete from gmail servers, right?</p>

            <p>I apologize for just responding.&nbsp; Indeed when you archive in Mail, it will archive in Gmail.&nbsp; In the IMAP folder list, Archive is "all mail" (basically mail that has no other label like "inbox" or anything else).&nbsp; And yes, also, as you said:&nbsp; mail in "all
 mail" is considered archived.&nbsp; So you're right on both counts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for deleting in Windows Mail, you can pick.&nbsp; I prefer to make delete a "real delete" but you can also make delete = archive, based on Gmail.com's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the setting on Gmail that I use:</p>

<h3> x sir mccloud x  say:</h3>
<h2>            getting disconnected every 5 mins</h2>
                    
<p>i have 3 xboxes in the house and two computers, which for the last 2 years ran fine with no problems. Last week we had a stonrm and it fried our router that is provided by pctc where we get internet from.. they came and brought a brand new one installed
 it like the old one and left after they seen everything connected.. as soon as they left i started watching netflix and come to find out it kicks me offline within 10 minutes.. alot of messing around i find out its not only netfliix i can sit on the dashboard
 and within 10 mins it will disconnect. i can connect right away again but will end up disconnecting again.. so i called the pctc and told them the issue they said they would send another tech over here to look at it.but before that figured i would call xbox
 live and see what they had to say about it.. was on the phone with them for 2 hrs for them to tell me that it has to be on our internet providers side. told me to ask them about the pppoe settings. today came when the pctc tech showed up and he just looked
 confused and said he has no idea and blames it either on all 3 of the xboxes breaking at the same time or xbox live.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; now i goto test connection and all that and then it reads: you can connect to xbox live, but your current network configurationj may limit your online experience. select more info for a description of the problem and how you can fix it.</p>
<p>suggestion 1: nat error. consult your router or modems manual for steps to enable upnp, or open port 3074 if your router or modem doesnt support upnp.</p>
<p>because of a setting on your router or modem your nat type is moderate. this may cause problems with multiplayer games and chat. visit www.xbox.com/nat-help for more help.</p>
<p>and i know everyone going to say change your nat type.. which i did and so did the pctc tech that came over today and still does it (personally i dont know if he should be even called a tech) anyways i have a friend that got his degree in networking and
 he tried changing the nat type to and still no go. and while we were on the phone with xbox hey tried haveing us change that also. and thats when they said that it must be on the pppoe settings.</p>
<p>now i play xbox alot and watch netflix all the time been a member for 5 years now. but for the last week havnt even turned it on because i cant do anything without internet anyways. so am i suppose to just sit here and keep relaying conversations to xbox
 live and pctc telling them that the other company says its there fault.. i dont care whoes fault it is i just want it fixed so i can play call of duty again and watch netflix..</p>

<p>CAN ANYONE HELP ME OUT WITH THIS PLEASE!?!?!?!</p>
<p>thanks for your time and any help anyone can give</p>

            <p>Hey there McCloud!<br />We could try and see if we can find a solution for you. Are you experiencing the same issue on all of your xboxes? Before we go into any <span lang="en"><span>technical details could you please read: <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/155724.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">START HERE!</a> And post back in full detail (the piece in <strong>bold</strong> under the title "<strong>Make a pos</strong>t")</span></span>. Also, Are you using the wireless external network adapter on anyone of your consoles? If so, is it the black or the white adapter?<br /><br />Thanks!</p>

<p>yes it is happening on all 3 xboxes.. one xbox is one of the newest model with the built in wifi, and two of them are running with ethernet. and all of them do the same thing. the wierd thing is the computers stay connected 100% of the time without any problems
 its only the xboxes that have the problem. like i said before last week it all worked perfectly fine. and after got that new router it just wont work. not sure how much more detail that i can give from the above post that i have written..i dont really know
 much about this but i would really like to be able to use xbox live again.. i mean if i cant use it theres no point to me or the other two ppl in the house to keep renewing membership. which i dont want to do because i love xbox live so i would really hope
 i can get this figured out.. if you have any more questions on any details just ask on this post. ill be checking in all day. thanks for your help.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I deselect file types associated with wmp12 in control panel&#63;</h2>
                    Under Set Program Associations in the Default Programs control panel applet - I cannot deselect any of the check boxes for file types associated with WMP.&nbsp; I can select the few not already associated.&nbsp; How do I get around this?&nbsp; Words cannot describe how
 horribly WMP 12 is sucking compared to earlier iterations, tragically I have not yet found a simple, easy to use better media player alternative.

            <p>Probably cos you have no alternative installed.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good (and incredibly bad)&nbsp;alternative players on the internet. Google and you'll find out !</p>
<p>If you already have installed an alternative :&nbsp;right click on a music file you want to play and in the pop up menu choose Open With. You'll get a list,&nbsp;select your newer, shinier player, make sure the Always Open with&nbsp; box is checked and then each time you
 click on said file type your new player will, well, play it. You will need to do that for all file types that, in the past, you've used WMP for.
</p>
<p>If you're still looking then&nbsp; <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">VLC</a> is an excellent (free)&nbsp;multimedia replacement for WMP and can play 99% of media files that you throw at it, out of the box. During the installation you can associate whatever files
 you wish it to open when you double click on them.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

    <title>Laptop stick restarting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dutchbirblady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop stick restarting</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is only a month old but now it already appears to be broken beyond repair. It keeps crashing, and the attachable keyboard I have keeps disconnecting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today it ran very slowly so I tried restarting it, but for the past 30 minutes it has been stuck on restarting, the keyboard doesn't work and I do not know what to do anymore. I've tried the F8 option but that didn't work either as my keyboard isn't functioning
 and I can't get a keyboard on screen while the laptop is restarting. I'm scared to do a bios reboot through another computer because I'm afraid I'll lose all of my files, since I didn't think my laptop would have this issue within a month of acquiring it (but
 then again, who does?) so I didn't back up everything I need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please help me out? I'm at wits end right now.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Dutchbirblady
<br />
<br />Press and hold the power button on your laptop for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down.
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />
<br />Restart your laptop
<br />
<br />When windows boots
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot 
<br />
<br />Run the Keyboard troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve this for you 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager 
<br />
<br />Expand the Keyboards section 
<br />
<br />Right click your keyboard and choose 'Uninstall' 
<br />
<br />Then restart your PC

    <title>Can&#39;t login to MSN Messenger - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t login to MSN Messenger</h2>
                    WhenI try to login to MSN Messenger it crashes shortly after because I'm getting like 700+ Friend requests? How do I clear them all and make them all go away so I can login?<br />
<br />
For you MSN peeps that are moving this, it's a security issue because they are unwanted spam friend requests.. basically it's denying me USE of MSN Messenger because I can't start it.

So your settings were already set to only allow people you know to send you messages?&nbsp; In the box says "Allow List", are there only names of your friends you want to contact you?&nbsp; In the box that says "Block List" it should say "All Others".&nbsp; Make sure those
 things are in there.&nbsp; If those things are set correctly, try running a virus scan to see if you have picked up a virus that attacks Messenger.<br />
<br />
Here are two good online scans:<br />

    <title>Error 651 &#38; IP Configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jillmnlc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 651 &#38; IP Configuration</h2>
                    <p>I was working on my computer earlier today, and stepped away for a few minutes. &nbsp;When I returned, my internet connection was gone; there was a little yellow triangle with an exclamation point that has since been replaced with a red X. &nbsp;I restarted the computer
 and router, cycled through various troubleshooters. &nbsp;Two error messages keep coming up: &nbsp;1) error 651, and 2) "Local Area Connection" doesn't have a valid IP configuration. &nbsp;I also restored the system to a point before I started to experience connectivity
 problems. The computer is on Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other computer on the existing network is working fine, as are all of the other devices (tablet, printer) connected to the network. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated!</p>

            <p>I assume this is a wired connection. Here are the first few steps I would take:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check in the Control Panel / Network and Sharing Center / Change Adapter Settings if the adapter is enabled and if the cable is plugged in. You need to set the View to
<em>Details</em> to see these items.</li><li>Take the CAT5 cable from one of the working devices and use it for the problem device. Make sure to use a router port that you know to work.</li><li>Mark the following command with your mouse, then press Ctrl+C to copy it.<br />
cmd.exe&nbsp; /c&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /all&nbsp; &gt;&nbsp; "%UserProfile%\Desktop\ip.txt"</li><li>Click the Start globe and press Ctrl+V to paste the command, then Enter to run it.</li><li>Open the file IP.txt on your desktop and report the following items:<br />
- DHCP enabled<br />
- IPV4 address<br />
- Subnet mask<br />
- Default gateway<br />
- DNS server<br />
</li></ul>
