<h2>            Desktop freezes when I try to Login</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I am having the worst experience with Microsoft that I have ever had to experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start this out, I am going to list in order how this goes:</p>
<p>I power on the Computer</p>
<p>It goes through the usual start up</p>
<p>Gets to the page that says, "Hi there, welcome back!" (displays admin log in)</p>
<p>I type my password *****************</p>
<p>I press enter/next</p>
<p>***computer freezes*** ((same goes when i press "I'm not (admin log in)))</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep having to restart the computer but it keeps doing it over again.</p>
<p>I do not have safe mode activated on this (since upgrading), I do not have the Windows 7 install disk, I cannot get to the main screen due to the freeze, and if i let it sit for a couple of minutes, it will give me the loading icon for the mouse then restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot get this fixed, the upgrade said my computer is compatible.</p>
<p>Computer is a custom built PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly, when I had Windows 7, this problem had not existed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, you need to send me someone to fix this **** you call a "Upgrade"</p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Apologize for the difficulties that you're experiencing regarding this issue and also for the delay in getting back to you. Do not worry. Let me
 help you in fixing this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let's try doing a Startup Repair using the Windows 10 disc and check if it helps.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Download the Windows 10 ISO on a working computer and perform a startup repair:</span></li><li>
<span>Click </span>
 to download official&nbsp;ISO media for Windows 10 from Microsoft. </span></li><li>
<span>Boot from the Windows 10 DVD/USB. You may refer to the Computer manufacturer BIOS manual for options to set the boot priority.&nbsp;</span></li><li>
<span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until
 the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. Note: On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears, Use the arrow keys to choose Repair
 your Computer in the Advanced Boot Options and then press ENTER. If prompted, select the Windows 10 installation to be repaired, and then click Next
</span></li><li>
<span>Select the Language and a keyboard input method and click Next.
</span></li><li>
<span>Select a User name and type your Password and click OK.
</span></li><li>
<span>Under System Recovery Options, click Startup Repair. Note: If the repair process detects a problem when it starts Windows 10, it will run Startup Repair to automatically fix the problems.
 Allow this process to complete. Startup Repair might prompt you to make choices as it tries to fix the problem, and if necessary, it might restart your computer as it makes repairs.
</span></li><li>
<span>On the Startup Repair window click Finish.
</span></li><li>
<span>Restart your computer if prompted.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            Microsoft Store Refund</h2>
                    <p><span>I tried to make a purchase this morning through my Microsoft account. For an app called Ifax. to try and send some files to large to send in an email. When I tried to make a 1 month, unlimited fax purchase, it said "Oops, we are sorry, could not process".
 So I tried 2 more times with same answer. and figured out another way to send the files. Then I see that it went through 3 times. I do not need any of the services purchased. How do you get a refund on these services? please Help.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>if it were only that easy. when I click the chat link, the web pages flip back and forth repeatedly between, partner services and the login screen , until it says Ive tried to log in too many times and tells me to try again. I am so aggravated with this
 whole process, being difficult to contact anyone. I believe i wont be buying anything from the microsoft store any more</p>

            Please define "launching the scanner on Windows 10"?&nbsp; With Windows 8 I had a desktop icon.&nbsp; When I upgraded to Windows 10 there is nothing.&nbsp; I hit the scan button on the Canon printer/fax/scanner and it and it says "set the PC to start scanning"&nbsp; I don't
 know how to do that.&nbsp; The printer function works fine so during the upgrade the device must have installed.

<h2>            Task Scheduler&#58; task gets triggered by event but does not start</h2>
                    <p>This is an intermittent issue.&nbsp; Sometimes it works fine and other times it doesn't and I need some assistance tracking this down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it works, there is the initial event id 108, followed by the subsequent events showing the task starting and completing, highlight here:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5ada099-b425-4b81-a63c-a3ce1aac627c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f5ada099-b425-4b81-a63c-a3ce1aac627c?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When it does not work, there is the initial event 108&nbsp;showing the event getting triggered, but no other events show up at all.&nbsp; No failures, errors or warnings, nothing:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9012fbbf-c2d6-4d55-9119-8ee019e9150e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9012fbbf-c2d6-4d55-9119-8ee019e9150e?upload=true" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Any assistance with this is appreciated.&nbsp; How do I troubleshoot this?&nbsp; Is there any additional logging I can enable or analyze?</p>

<p>I know a thing or two about the Task Scheduer but so far I am unable to wrap my mind around your problem. Here is why:</p>
<ul>
<li>I do not recognise the screen snapshot your posted. What is it?</li><li>What event is supposed to trigger the scheduled task?</li><li>What is the scheduled task supposed to run?</li><li>You write <em>"there is the initial event 108&nbsp;showing the event getting triggered"</em>. How can an event trigger another event?</li><li>Do time-triggered tasks work reliably?</li></ul>

    <title>Need Skype ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> britturner  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Skype ID</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having a lot of trouble with Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a unique Skype ID to give to a potential employer but I can't seem to even create a Skype account without having to use Microsoft. Microsoft does not provide a Skype username but instead uses my first and last name along with my e-mail address as
 an ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The e-mail address would be acceptable but there's no way for me to switch it to public which means people cannot look me up by that. Instead, they have to search by my first and last name which are both common. This is a BIG problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my employers cannot find me out of the millions of people, this could mean I would lose the means of contact which is integral to my position.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there's any way to fix this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Brittany&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Stop Windows 10 upgrade install after files already dowloaded</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had reserved my free Windows 10 upgrade and this morning was notified that it was downloaded and ready to install. &nbsp;However I have changed my mind and do not want to upgrade. &nbsp;How can I get rid of the message "Your upgrade to Windows 10 is ready - You
 need to restart your PC to begin installation" in Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to stick with Windows 7 Ultimate that I have. &nbsp;It's working like a champ and I see no need to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I went to system drive and found hidden $Windows.~BT folder. I changed its name, restarted PC, then made sure that "Upgrade to Windows 10" update is hidden so it won't be downloaded again.</p>

<p>I do not find either of the above listed updates in my "installed" list so that solution won't work. However, I know I have that ~BT folder because I saw it when trying to see what was eating up space on my drive.</p>
<p>I do not want to upgrade yet because Autodesk products are not yet certified for use with 10.</p>

<p>I have a Windows 10 install I would like to cancel as well. I did ask for the reservation, but somehow I went and turned my PC on one morning, got a BLACK SCREEN, and it actually installed Windows 10. I didn't know what was going on at first, but I finally
 discerned what had happened and after some research I found the Microsoft feature to backup to a previous Windows system. In my case, it's Windows 7 Pro 64 bit. I disliked&nbsp; many things I found in Windows 10 and I did use the option to backup to Windows 7 a
 day later. I found an innocuous little message warning me that I might have to reinstall "some" programs after the backup. I did run into one. There may have been more. The backup to Windows 7 seemed to go okay outside of the program reinstall it caused.&nbsp;
 I worried what Microsoft may have left behind from the Windows 10 install so I did a complete system reload from a current Macrium Reflect image backup. That went well, but I kept getting Windows 10 nag messages. I uninstalled KB3035583 and that got rid of
 the nag messages. This morning I happened into Windows Update and found it is ready to install Windows 10 if I click "Restart". I couldn't find how to attach a pdf, mht, or doc file I have of the notice in Windows Update, but a quote from it is "Your update
 to Windows 10 is ready" "You need to restart your PC to begin installation. This might take awhile, but we'll let you know when it's done." This is followed by a "Restart now" button.&nbsp; I read in one of the forums I researched that the install won't actually
 start until I press the Restart button and apparently that's true because it is still there after several reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I don't know what to do. I don't want to go through all of that again. I read that I should hide the update in Control Panel, but I can't find how to do that. Windows won't let me check for updates because it's in the middle of the Windows 10 install.
 Hiding it would be short term in any case because I don't want to leave the Windows 10 files lying around. Any help would be appreciated<br />

            Hi, &nbsp;I reserved my free copy and the Windows 10&nbsp;upgrade wants to install now, but I cannot install now.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to install it in the next 3 to 10 months, when my job confirms Windows&nbsp;10 is compatible with all our systems (VPN, CRM, etc.).&nbsp;What should
 be done in my case?&nbsp; I don't want to completely opt out of the upgrade, just postpone for months (but before the free upgrade expires in July 2016).&nbsp; The postpone option only allows 3 days to postpone.&nbsp; I am afraid if I postpone for 3 days, it will start automatically
 installing in 3 days.&nbsp; Help!&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>If you look in this list of replies to your original problem you will see I went through what I believe is almost exactly what you say worked for you.&nbsp; However, about a week after I had done a complete system restore and uninstalled
 I did not hide the update, but I don't have updates automatically installed, and I didn't see anything come through for any updates.&nbsp; A couple of hours ago, 10 AM CST 8/23, I called a Microsoft number that I had recorded the call as requiring a $35 fee years
 ago.&nbsp; The line was still active and a recording indicated extremely long wait times.&nbsp; It took my phone number and promised to call me back in approximately 146 minutes.&nbsp; Needles to say, I'm desperate.&nbsp; I'll put a post in this thread if and when I get the call
 back. </span></span></p>

            <p>dear Divya M</p>
<p>
</p><p>the solution you suggested above is not working at all.</p>
<p>
I've cleared all the files mentioned above, done a Windows cleanup, uninstalled a number of known KB-patches and I still get this window constantly nagging me at my Windows Update, which doesn't allow me to process any other regular Windows Updates.
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35392499-6fd0-45f6-84dc-dfff43283769" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And I also get this schedule window that I can't seem to get rid of either.</p>

</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ca49e628-8903-4c0a-afdc-7a44d426a782" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>For additional reference, I have ensured all of the following KBpatches are uninstalled:</p>
<p>KB3035583</p>
<p>KB2952664</p>
<p>KB2976978</p>
<p>KB3021917</p>
<p>KB3044374</p>
<p>KB2990214</p>
<p>
</p><p>GWX seems to be gone from my PC but both the above two windows are still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>CAN MICROSOFT PLEASE INFORM US ABOUT HOW WE CAN GET RID OF THE TWO WINDOWS MENTIONED ABOVE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your cooperation.</p>

    <title>duplicated cd identifier - especially locally produced CD&#39;s - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jhbjack  say:</h3>
<h2>            duplicated cd identifier - especially locally produced CD&#39;s - causing incorrect track info to be downloaded for locally produced CDs</h2>
                    <p>I find that most locally produced CDs are incorrectly identified by the online database - probably as they (illegally?) use the same
</p>
<p>CD identifier code embedded&nbsp;on the CD as the UK version with the same title.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the case for for example all the NOW That's What I call Music CDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The frustration is that for every single locally produced CD I have to capture the track info.</p>
<p>I can also never use the rebuild function, as that overwites all the track info I painstakingly captured over the years!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there perhaps a local music database one can direct Windows Media Player to, that includes the local CDs instead of the UK versions?</p>
<p>Or how can we convince (or force) the manufaturers to use a unique identifier for the locally produced CDs that will enable the universal database</p>
<p>to seperately identify the locally produced CDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this question in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sorry to inform you that you will not be able to direct Windows Media player to a local music database as the task is automatic. Media player connects to the
 online database which has the information on the particular track. It searches for the exact information for the track and retrieves it. If the information is not available on the local database it will search for it on the World Wide Web.</p>

            <p>Hi Rohit</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>But now I am even more confused! </p>
<p>If the music database is accessed per track, then how is it possible that for a CD produced in South-Africa every single track is identified incorrectly?</p>
<p>Unless of course, the incorrect track info is burned to the CD by the manufacturer, in effect using the track identification info that was originally intended for the UK version of the CD as is for all&nbsp;the individual&nbsp;tracks on the CD, causing all tracks
 to be identified incorrectly.</p>
<p>Or do I understand the workings of the database lookup incorrectly?</p>
<p>Is there track identification info burned to the CD as part of every track, which is used by the database to identify the tracks? I assume the database does not "listen" to the music, but uses some identifier - which in the case of local manufactured CD's
 now appear to be either incorrect or false..?</p>
<p>I assumed each CD was identified, and the tracks on the CD stored in the database, which I could understand.</p>
<p>But for every track to be incorrectly identified the error seems to be even more complex..</p>
<p>Please asssit, as this situation is extremely frustrating..!</p>
<p>Thanks. Jaco</p>

<h2>            Secondary drive locked with Bitlocker after factory reset</h2>
                    <p>I had to perform a factory reset on my Dell Inspiron 17-1779 after Dell updates were installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; My machine has an SSD primary drive and a secondary SATA drive. I can not access the secondary drive after the reset because it is locked with Bitlocker.&nbsp; I
 have gone to oneDrive and get the message "You don't have any BitLocker recovery keys in your Microsoft account."&nbsp; When I go to the "more info" I get instructions like find where you wrote it down...I never wrote it down because I didn't activate it.&nbsp; I have
 never heard of Bitlocker before, and now I am having a nightmare!!! My secondary drive is where I backed up my documents and work!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sincerely hope someone can help me!</p>

            Hi camntx
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try booting in your BIOS firmware then try disabling Secure Boot then restart. 
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Hold the Shift key and click Restart.
<br />
<br />Choose Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options.
<br />
<br />Click Startup Settings.
<br />
<br />Click Restart again.
<br />
<br />Once your computer restarts, press F7 on your keyboard to select Disable driver signature enforcement. Your computer will now restart automatically.
<br />
<br />If the issue persists after disabling the driver signature verification, disable Secure Boot temporarily in your computer's UEFI/BIOS. You can contact your computer's manufacturer or check the device manual for the steps on how to do this.
<br />
<br />Important: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. 
<br />
<br />If you can't find the toggle to disable Secure Boot, a firmware update for the UEFI/BIOS may be required. This can usually be found in the manufacturer's website.
<br />
<br />After disabling Secure Boot, boot normally into Windows and check if you can access the drive.       
        </p>

<p>I disabled "Secure Boot" first thing,&nbsp; and I have made several attempts to get to Trouble Shoot screen in every way I know, including the one above. My machine restarts, gives a blue screen flashes like it's going into the "Recovery" "Troubleshoot" screen,
 then goes into normal start screen with password! Also "f7" does nothing. I may have do a clean install of Windows, although I don't think that will unlock my secondary drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have contacted support at BitLocker, hopefully they can give me some kind help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, Andre.</p>

            Ultimately, it sounds like you will have to perform a clean install and restore your files from a backup if you have one.

Someone knows how to deal effectively with this? Thank you in advance<br />

<div>I was playing a game today, which suddenly crashed to a black screen. So I decided to reboot my pc, but this time said screen appeared right after the Win 8 logo and before the login screen, so I had nothing to do.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I searched the web, but nobody seems to have quite the exact black screen I do. They describe a flickering black screen witha visible cursor. Mine is pitch blavk with a brownish sidebar, no cursor. A lot of guys had problem with the NVIDIA graphics driver
 310.90, which I was also using, so I decided to remove it from safe mode. After doing so, I managed to enter my desktop. I had an automatic windows update, that I installed before rebooting again, and low and behold the black screen returned.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Okay, so I went back into safe mode, and could see, that the 310.90 driver was back. Odd. I removed it again, and rebooted. Black screen. Okay, back to safe mode, but this time the driver had been thoroughly removed. I guess the next thing I should do
 was try an old restore point. Black screen. Older one. Black Screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At this point it got really tiring, so I went for the Refresh option, go back to a clean install. Once again I managed to get onto my desktop, thinking everything would be fine. I installed Google Chrome, but as soon as I tried opening it, the black screen
 returned.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All right, I thought, no Google Chrome anymore. Another refresh, but now the black screen is there again. I've run a scan no threats. Basically I have a clean install with my documents now, but I can only use safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I don't want to Remove everything just yet, as I currently don't have an external device for my documents.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My specs are as follows:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Intel Core2 Quad Q6600 2,40GHz</div>
<div>Geforce GTX 460</div>
<div>4GB Ram</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be appreciated</div>
                </div>

It seems like you are having a tough time as you are unable to boot to the computer since you get a black screen.</div>

            Hi Pinaki,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your reply. I checked msconfig, and I have no non-microsoft services running at all.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for the Event Viewer, I have no red errors in the application log.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Could the issue in fact be with my monitor? I might be off on a limb here. It's an old model, and unable to run high resolutions, but I never changed the resolutions myself, so in this case there would have to be a NVIDIA driver or windows update changing
 the resolution.</div>

            Hi Pinaki,
<div><br />
<div>As I don't have any services running aside from the Microsoft Services there is nothing for me to disable. The article clearly tells me to check the "Hide all Microsoft services" box, after which no services are listed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>And there are no items in the task manager either.</div>

            Wow, so I decided to reset my pc, as I didn't have much on it, and what I had I moved onto a USB device.
<div><br />
<div>As it turns out, even resetting my pc didn't work. And now, I can't even get into safe mode. I now get a message saying Windows couldn't complete the installation in safe mode, and that I should reboot. Well, that means I can't get into either normal mode
 nor safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again, I suspect a windows update is behind my trouble. It may not have started it (at least not on it's own), but the fact it's trying to install something outside of windows, tells me an update might be the culprit.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't know, unless you can come up with any suggestions, by now it seems as if I'm left having to format my hard drive.</div>

Do you have a second monitor you could hook up?&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot of nVidia&nbsp; users seem to have a problem with the primary monitor being blank (not black, sounds like yours is blank) while the secondary works (even if it is not attached).&nbsp;&nbsp; You could also try using the
 Second Screen dialog via your keyboard to see if you get any change that way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. press Win-P, CursorUp, Enter.</p>

Good luck</p>

            Well, it's not entirely blank, it does have a strange brownish sidebar. I do not have another monitor atm, but I will definitely hook it up to one when I get that chance

<h2>            AudioStream recording software&#63;</h2>
                    Hey Microsoft, is there a free safe software that can record streaming audio from my system? I found NCH SoundTap and it worked great... its just that my trial expired and I cant buy it. SterioMix thing does not work on my System... so far SoundTap is
 the only thing that can record streaming audio.

 set as UK, we both have email addresses ending in .co.uk. What is going on here? I've spent 3 hours trying to sort this out, and I'm getting so frustrated I'm about 2 minutes away fron cancelling the family gold subscription, what's the point if I can't add
 my childs's profile to it?</p>

<p>Hiya, please check both XBOX Live accounts billing information. It could be that one account was made with details for a United States account or another region. If that's the case both accounts would need to be from the same exact region in order to initiate
 the process of adding your son into the XBOX Live Gold Family Pack.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">It doesn't matter what locale you select on your console (via System Settings) or on your e-mail account. What matters is the region that was selected during the account creation
 process. So if your son selected US instead of UK that would be the cause of the issue.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">There are only nine XBL regions that can currently migrate and the UK or US are not on that list. Your only recourse, if your sons region is other than UK, is for him to create a
 new UK account. So long as you don't change consoles the other profiles on it will be able to share content, avatar items excluded.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If both accounts indeed have UK set as their region then a call to support may be necessary to see what they recommend.

<p>Yeah what he was trying to say is that the e-mail address doesn't mean that your account couldn't have been made even by mistake using a USA account creation. That's all, hopefully you get this figured out by calling support.</p>

<p>I got this to work with a couple of .org email accounts and a UK region.</p>
<p>I used the chat support on xbox.com - worked OK.</p>
<p>- create parent account on live.com</p>
<p>- note parent region - shown via login.live.com (and not via other login methods) and you can edit if wrong</p>
<p>- create parent account on xbox.com</p>
<p>- create child account on live.com</p>
<p>- note child region (and fix if nec) as above</p>
<p>- create child account on xbox.com</p>
<p>- associate with parent - will require logging in as parent account</p>
<p>- get prompted for credit card to prove parent age</p>
<p>- bob's your uncle...</p>

            <span>Hi WarrenTY,<br />
<br />
1. When did the issue started?<br />
2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue started?<br />
<br />
Did you try the suggestions from the following link:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/my-computer-continues-to-run-when-i-shut-dow/e2e6ef2a-1e42-43b7-8bd5-77429c27cb93">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/my-computer-continues-to-run-when-i-shut-dow/e2e6ef2a-1e42-43b7-8bd5-77429c27cb93</a><br />
<br />
<b>Method 1<br />
</b>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if the issue persist.<br />

<br />
Note: </b>Follow step 7 from the clean boot article KB929135 to put the computer back to normal mode.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2</b><br />
I would suggest you to open task manager and end all the process and check if that helps.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>According to,</p>
<p><a href="https://help.ea.com/uk/article/fifa-13-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://help.ea.com/uk/article/fifa-13-system-requirements</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>your game should be compatible with Windows 7. Please check your system meets the other system requirements.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the game was working fine then stopped working it would seem unlikely to be a compatibility issue with Windows 7. Did you make any software or hardware changes to your system around the time it stopped working? Were any Windows updates installed at that
 time?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It is possible that the game installation has become corrupt. You could try uninstalling and reinstalling it. I'm not familiar with how/where your game stores saved games/preferences so you may want to investigate this and back up as appropriate before proceeding.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>What exactly do you mean by, "...stopped working..."? Does it not open, or does it open then crash? Please provide any error messages in full.</p>

<p>Turns out I had logging enabled all the time :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most likely something happened between July 5th and July 10th [incl.] (I was AFK during that time; 6th was public holiday).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my logs:</p>

</p><p>Hope that'll help. I can still keep the crashed instance running for a few days. Just in case..</p>

<p>I suggest you download an install the latest drivers for your onboard Intel graphics to see if that resolves the issue. &nbsp;Though Linux builds do come with a release of the drivers, they are known to be buggy and should be updated. &nbsp;Common problem on Intel
 chipsets in Windows (plausible to occur in Linux) are blackouts, whiteouts and crashes though other things might cause this as well. &nbsp;Of course updating the distribution to the latest might include a newer version of the drivers which may or may not include
 the latest drivers.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though different chipset than yours, installed dependencies and modified the package to allow installation.</p>

</p><p>I'm now installing&nbsp;skypeforlinux (5.4.0.1). Let's see how it goes. It seems like skype tends to crash like that when it's left activated (i.e. GUI not minimized) for a few days, like friday-to-monday. So if it's going to crash again I guess I'll see it on
 Monday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, skype is now installed on my workstation. Let's see how it goes from here on.</p>

<p>I got an email from MS claiming this issue has been answered. While it's answered it's not fixed yet... I have 2 computers with the same behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there anything to be done about that or is it a 'wont-fix' case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's OK to say 'it's a wont-fix' -- sometimes there are things we cannot change. I'd just like to know whether it's still worth to be expecting anything from this case.</p>

<h2>            Error&#58; User Accounts Control &#34;This app is blocked for your protection&#34; while trying to access D-link wireless Data Modem USB Card DWP - 157</h2>
                    <p>I have&nbsp;D-link wireless Data Modem USB Card DWP - 157. It was working in window 8. I have installed it as administrator. When I open the D-link manager as administrator it opens and works. But when I use the modem as user the D-link manager does not open.
 Though I can connect to the internet with the USB Modem since the D-link manager does not work I can not make call or sms also can not see the data download details.</p>
<p>It gives a massage &nbsp;- User Accounts Control "This app is blocked for your protection".</p>

            <p>Hello Sumit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are facing issues with accessing D-link modem on your device, we will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know if you have logged in to your system as an administrator?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to sign out from the current account, restart the computer and log in with Administrator account and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to bring the User Account Control to never notify and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow: </span></p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key, type <strong>UAC, </strong>click on <strong>Change User Account Control Settings</strong>.</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From <strong>UAC </strong>window, I suggest you to bring down the level to default (<strong>Never Notify</strong>) and check if it helps.&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>NOTE: </strong></span></p>
<p><span>User Account Control (UAC) can help you prevent unauthorized changes to your computer. It works by prompting you for permission when a task requires administrative rights, such as installing software or changing settings that affect other users. We
 don't recommend turning User Account Control off. If you do turn it off, you should turn it back on as soon as possible.</span></p>
<p>

</p><p>Hope it helps. Get back to with an updated status of this issue for further assistance.</p>

<h2>            Recent Windows 10 Update - messed up everything&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My brand new Windows 10 system of just a few months did a large automatic update the other night. &nbsp;Before this "update" it was running perfect and fast and everything worked. &nbsp;It now feels like I'm working on my old Pentium system from the 90s and nothing
 wants to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of my Edge favorites were wiped out</p>
<p>My physical printer is no where to be found. &nbsp;I can't reinstall it because the Add a Printer doesn't find any printers now.</p>
<p>Using the File Explorer is a joke. &nbsp;I can click on a file 4, 5, 6 times and nothing happens.</p>
<p>My Windows now says "Not Responding" very frequently.</p>
<p>I can't drag windows around sometimes because I can't select them so I can't move them</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the heck did you guys "update"? &nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as importing favorites, I had none to import because they were all in Edge, it's a new computer. &nbsp;I wasn't using any other browser.<br />

<p>Yeah .. ME TOO .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks microsoft ... right in the middle of my work day I come back into my office and I see an "updating do not turn off" ... after about an hour I was finally able to use my computer again only to find that my second monitor was no longer working , and
 I have been all day trying to resolve this to no avail. A whole day has been wasted ... and I am falling behind. Thanks Microsoft .. at least give people the option to "update" or not ... do NOT take over their computer. I have no idea when I will be bale
 to figure out what they have done or how I need to resolve this .&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Recording gameplay through steaming without a capture card&#63;</h2>
                    Hiya, I was hoping someone could help me out with this. I make YouTube videos of myself playing PC games - I use a little video camera to capture me and I have software on my PC that constantly records the screen to capture gameplay. I've recently started
 playing my Xbox One more though and wanted to also record videos. My internet isn't the best so I can't stream on twitch or anything, hence the videos on YouTube. I know most people usually buy a capture card or something like that. But I'm rather low on funds
 at the moment and not exactly a tech genius anyway. I was wondering if there's a way to stream my gameplay visual and audio from the Xbox One over to my PC monitor, so that the software on there can record it as if it were a PC game. I didn't know if it would
 be as simple as plugging in an HDMI cable from the Xbox or my TV to over to the PC monitor, or if I needed an app/additional software, or if it's just downright impossible and I need to buy a capture card. Could someone let

<p>Why not stream your xbox one to your pc via the xbox app? &nbsp;That's if you have windows 10 of course, if you don't then you can't do it. &nbsp;Poor internet makes no difference to this since you're not streaming through the internet, but through your local network.</p>
<p>If you can do this, just use recording software to record the image as shown on your computer, with video overlay if you want that.</p>
