<h2>            Slimtype BD E DS4E1S  won&#39;t read disks after updating windows</h2>
                    My laptop has a Slimtype BD E DS4E1S&nbsp; drive.&nbsp; After doing upgrades with windows 7, it now cannot read any disks.&nbsp; Tried everything MS suggests, but nothing worked.&nbsp; Don't ask, the disks were read in the same drive, before this issue started.&nbsp; The computer
 is only a couple of months old.&nbsp; The troubleshooter shows no problems with the drive.&nbsp; It just keeps telling me to insert a disk, as no disk is detected.&nbsp; Already tried changes to registry (MS), and uninstalling, reinstalling the driver with no results.&nbsp; Any
 suggestions?

You don't need to backup the schedlgu.txt log file.<br />

Why don't you make a backup of that folder with your good tasks and take it to a system that has no Scheduled Tasks, copy the folder contents onto that system and see how it works.<br />

Make sure that when you make your 'backup' of your STs, you are not creating 'shortcuts' instead.<br />

                    I recently printed a photo in "poster mode" on my Canon printer, and now Windows Photo Viewer is stuck in Poster mode. Everything else prints correctly from my PC, and I can print photos from Adobe Photoshop Elements, but not Windows Photo Viewer. I am

    <title>Storage Space Re-balance&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dan boyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Storage Space Re-balance&#63;</h2>
                    Hi!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>OK, so I got the Windows 8 upgrade on both my Laptop and Desktop at home. &nbsp;I love the idea of Storage Spaces, esp. after I had already bought a dedicated RAID5 card with on-board memory and battery backup. &nbsp;The problem is, besides my main drive I only
 have a 2TB WD20EARS drive, a 2TB Seagate 5900RPM Green drive, and a 1.5TB WD 7200RPM drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So, 2TB+2TB+1.5TB.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>I had data on all three drives, but the two 2TB drives were manually mirrored.</li><li>I started by formatting the first 2TB hardrive, then creating a new Storage Space, thin provisioned, no resiliency using that 2TB drive.</li><li>Next, I copied all data from the second 2TB hard drive to the new Storage space.</li><li>I formatted the second 2TB hardrive and added it to the Storage Space, for a total of 4TB.</li><li>I copied all the data from the third 1.5TB hardrive to the 4TB Storage Space.</li><li>I formatted the third 1.5TB hard drive and added it to the Storage Space, for a total of 5.5TB</li><li>Next, I created a new storage space using the three drives, Thin Provisioning, and set resiliency to Parity.</li><li>I now tried to MOVE the existing data from the simple (no resiliency) storage space to the new Storage Space with Parity resilience, basically just&nbsp;restructuring&nbsp;the same data on the same drives.</li><li>After about 126GB of data transferred at around 18MB/sec, the parity storage spa
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How do I re-balance usage across hard drives, and why doesn't Storage Spaces do this automatically?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I then thought I would be sneaky. &nbsp;I plugged in a 500GB external hard drive, and MOVED about 300GB of data (the same data I had copied over to the first 2TB hard drive, the one 100% full) over to the external drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked the drive pool, and the first 2TB drive now stated it was still 99.9% full, and the other two drive's usage percentage had not changed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is weird, isn't it? &nbsp;What is going on here?</div>
                </div>

            OK, so after digging around some more, I decided to run Windows 8 Optimize manually on the simple (no resilience) Storage Space. &nbsp;Optimization went through the process of slab-consolidation and trimming. &nbsp;When it finished, I checked the status of the storage
 space in control panel. &nbsp;Now, instead of the first 2TB hard drive being 99.9%, it is 85%. &nbsp;Much better. &nbsp;Interestingly enough, the hard drives were re-organized&nbsp;as well, so the 1.5TB hard drive with 4.89% was now the middle of the three instead of at the end.
 &nbsp;So instead of:
<div><br />
<div>2TB -- 99.9%</div>
<div>2TB &nbsp;-- 72.4%</div>
<div>1.5TB -- 4.86%</div>
<div><br />
<div>it looked like this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>2TB -- 85% &nbsp; (parity being written here?)</div>
<div>1.5TB -- 4.86%</div>
<div>2TB &nbsp;-- 72.4%<br />
<div><br />
<div>I tried now moving data from the simple Storage Space to the Parity Storage Space. &nbsp;Sure enough, data was copied onto the the 1.5TB hard drive, as the percentage started rising. &nbsp;Also, it seems the first 2TB hard drive is having the parity bits written
 to it as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After moving about 300GB of data from the simple Storage Space to the Parity Storage Space, the first 2TB drive was close to 100% again. &nbsp;I again manually ran the Windows 8 drive optimization, and after trim, the space&nbsp;dropped&nbsp;down to around 75%. &nbsp;Now
 at least we are getting somewhere.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Windows 8 may not automatically re-balance the drive, but if you are doing as I am, adding parity resilience to existing drives, it may be&nbsp;necessary&nbsp;to manually run disk optimization several times during the process. &nbsp;I will report back once all the data
 has been&nbsp;transferred, the simple storage space has been deleted, and final&nbsp;optimization&nbsp;has been run.</div>

            To all googler who spend hours searching the net for a solution to the rebalance problem in a parity configuration (Like me ;). At the moment (January 2013) there is no Microsoft tool that does the job (includes PowerShell commands). To ensure that all
 hard drives can get the same level, you have to copy all the data once, and then delete the originals. That takes a while, but is currently the only way.

            Hi! &nbsp;So, it seems that when chunks of data are copied, Windows 8 rotates the drive data gets copied to (and assumingly creates parity on another drive). &nbsp;Once I added another couple drives,&nbsp;everything&nbsp;seems to be working fine.
<div><br />
<div>I now have a total of six drives in the pool, and the data seems to be getting balanced across the drives MUCH better than before. &nbsp;Also, it seems copying data&nbsp;to the parity&nbsp;storage space is getting faster the more drives I add, except for one older WD
 Green drive. &nbsp;Once data hits that drive speed crawls to about 5-7MB/s. &nbsp;Otherwise, I am pushing between 25-60 MB/s copying TO the storage space.
<div><br />
<div>I am thinking of adding a couple 3TB WD Red drives to the pool in a couple weeks, which should increase speed even further.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am a little leery of pulling a drive offline and&nbsp;replacing&nbsp;it with another to test how Windows 8 rebuilds the drive. &nbsp;Anyone have any experience with this?</div>

            <p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As&nbsp;you have accidently broken the transceiver,&nbsp;it's not possible to connect Wireless mouse through&nbsp;virtual Bluetooth transceiver. Bluetooth pairing and wireless are having different technology.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hence I suggest you to contact the Microsoft hardware support link below and check.</span></p>

<h2>            Create Process Failed code 740 The requested operation requires elevation </h2>
                    After installing trial version Everest (Hardware identifying software), I received message, "create prosess failed code 740 The requested operation requires elevation". This was followed by a crash after x'ing out.&nbsp; Funny things have been happening. Mouse
 went out the other day (possibly unrelated), keyboard driver lost yesterday. Then uploaded regcure and all he ll broke loose. I have since dumped Mcafee(which was on), installed and run AVG and a- quared and found nothing. I have also run microosoft's malware
 last week and found nothing. last night when I was trying to get rid of regcure-which I downloaded from link in- microsoft site, It would stack a hundred windows on my screen, and then I was told it was no longer at the location. I don't know where it is.
 . I know this is a lot of stuff, but just trying to lay it out for someone. I am afraid I am digging deeper.

            Is the Everest product certified for Windows 7? I note on their web page the bold claim that it suits all versions of Windows, which I tend to doubt since Windows 7 places numerous restrictions on software, especially when it comes to probing the hardware.
 I would use System Restore to take Windows back to a point before the Everest installation.<br />

            Hi osokaman 
<br />
<br />This can be done, only if the Windows Pro is a Retail licence, that means it was purchased separately to the PC it is installed on . . .
<br />
<br />If the Windows Pro came pre-installed on that PC, it is an OEM licence and is locked to the motherboard it was originally activated on . .

            Hi Osaka.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> You can try moving the Pro License to the Home PC.  This will be much easier if you had signed into both with your MS Account and it was linked to the Digital LIcenses on each.  
<br />
<br />If you know for sure the Pro license was linked to your MS Account, then you can change Home to Pro and run the Activation Troubleshooter to move the Pro license to it.  
<br />
<br />To change from Home to Pro after Version 1803 if you don't yet have a Pro Digital License on the device go offline by choosing Airplane Mode in Action Center at right end of Task Bar.  It will then allow inserting the Pro generic version key VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key to change to Pro.
<br />
<br />Then run the Activation Troubleshooter.  If you had linked the Pro License to the Account it should find the old license and if all else is correct with the activation it should ask if you want to move it to this Pro install.  
<br />
<br />In the past we could not move Factory or builder OEM licenses but the Troubleshooter is programmed to make an exception if all else is correct.   
<br />
<br />But I would still save a System Image backup before doing this so you can easily go back if necessary:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>

            Hi osokoman
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You can't swap either Windows 10 Home or Pro if one of these licenses are OEM. 
<br />
<br />Only a retail license can be transferred. 
<br />
<br />If one of the licenses are retail such as the Pro, you could upgrade the Windows 10 Home machine to Pro, but one machine will be without a license. In this case, the existing machine running Windows 10 Pro.
<br />
<br />You can only transfer the Windows 10 Pro to the new computer if its retail license and you will need to remove it from the old computer. Reactivation by chat support or telephone would also be required.
<br />

    <title>Strange Surface Pro 3 Easter Egg&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zaphod-b  say:</h3>
<h2>            Strange Surface Pro 3 Easter Egg&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday when I logged on to my Surface Pro 3,&nbsp;the tablet began giving verbal confirmation of my touch actions:&nbsp; "Home." "Left swipe screen 37." And other similar stuff. Every time I touched the screen the tablet would respond with a&nbsp;verbal confirmation
 - very strange. &nbsp;I was unable to actually access the Surface home screen to be able to restart so I had to hard-power-off with the power button. The Surface worked&nbsp;normally after the restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what was happening but I think I may have fat-fingered my login and unintentionally invoked some kind of software development capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one shed any light on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            if the touch actions still worked as normal, how would a blind person know which button was selected? the principle is that you can select things with touch and then execute them via a hardware key (someone please correct me if I am wrong :))

            Hi <strong>San Martin</strong>,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Step 1:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
You may try performing a system restore to revert back to the correctly working settings<br />
<br />
System Restore: frequently asked questions<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<strong>Step 2:</strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To fix the problem, do one or more of the following, and then try again:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Verify that the CD burner is connected properly.</div>
<div>Check for the physical connections of the DVD burner, ensure that the connections are tight and there are no loose connections present.</div>
<div>b. Clean the disc and verify that it is not damaged.<br />
c. Try a different brand of blank discs.<br />
d. If another program is currently burning files to the CD, wait until the burning process is complete.<br />
e. Quit other programs that might be using the CD burner.<br />
f. Restart Windows Media Player.<br />
g. Restart your computer.<br />
h. Use the Windows Error-checking tool to check for file system errors and bad sectors on your hard disk. For more information about the Error-checking tool, see<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Check-a-drive-for-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Help and
 Support</a>.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 3:<br />
<br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>I would suggest you to run the fixit from the below provided link and check if it fixes the issue.<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 4:</strong></div>
<div>
<div><strong>If the issue persists, reply back with the details.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Suddenly Windows time changes to an strange value.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very strange. I have a miniPC with windows 10 Home loaded with an application that is intended to be used unattended.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After an electricity cut off, time changes suddenly. For example, today morning I synchronized time with a server, having the exact time, including seconds. Well, I have just connected remotely to the PC and it has&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">6:53
 pm, while the server and my own PC have&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">7:17pm !!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">Why is that possible? I have enabled NTP update, and even I have started Windows Time service. Of course this is not a time zone problem so I am stuck with this.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">I am running SFC now just in case but I cannot imagine what's wrong with this. It does not detect any error at the moment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">Do you have an idea of what's going on?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">Thanks</span></p>

<p><span>Hi Jaime,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Usually this issue occurs if the Windows Time service is corrupted or the CMOS battery is drained. Though you have mentioned that you have tried restarting the Windows Time service, please ensure
 that the startup type of the service is set to automatic. <span>&nbsp;</span>I would suggest to try the methods given below and let us know how it goes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Re-register Windows Time DLL file.</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on Start and type CMD.</p>
</li><li>

</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Reregister Windows time process.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If none of the above methods works, the issue could be with the CMOS battery which is responsible for maintaining the system time and date. In that case, I would suggest to consider
 replacing the CMOS battery.</span></p>

<p>Hello, it did not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed also when I reboot the PC, clock desynchronize again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, just synchronized the clock, at 8:05 pm (real time), then I rebooted, after pc started the clock had the time 7:55 pm..... I waited until the pc reach 8:00 pm and rebooted again, and, surprise!! pc returned to 7:55 pm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>CMOS battery&nbsp; keeps time and date even when the PC is permanently powered?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started happening when electricity cut off... maybe some files get corrupted. Is it possible the time get affected by this? How can I repair system files when no Internet connection is available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC is brand new, so I don't think CMOS battery is damaged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>This problem is unsustainable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, the time was showing a time in monday... for example, if real time was 2:00 pm on tuesday, clock showed 6:20 pm on monday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today early, the same problem.... then I synchronized the time again at 8:30 am, but now, I just connected to the PC (at 11:00 am), clock was stuck at about 8:50 am.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that clock get stuck at the last time I synchronized, however, when I remain connected to the computer remotely, the clock works perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a utility called ReimageRepair. Do you think this could help? do you know another tool from Microsoft?</p>
<p>

<p>I correct myself. Even when I am connected to the computer remotely, the clock desynchronizes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, today, at about 8:10 am I connected to the PC remotely and the time there was yesterday 9:15 pm. I synchronized again and I kept connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, I saw the remote PC screen, at 8:51 am, and the remote PC had 8:17 am. I could not see when the time changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a patch, my software installed in that PC includes a call to a server to get the server time and if the time differs from the PC time by more than 10 seconds, the local time will be set to the server time. That's no the idea but that patch will solve
 the problem and customer will not realize about the time problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestion about this, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello again...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there is a Windows problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see. In my country, summer time ended on last saturday (April the 6th). Now we entered winter time until next September the 8th, when summer time will start again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have compared time configuration with my home computer to match exactly both. The only difference is that the problematic PC Windows 10 is in English, and in my home PC is in Spanish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, this is the main clock configuration screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92616214-97b6-47eb-80ab-80889c827056?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/92616214-97b6-47eb-80ab-80889c827056?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Screnshot above belongs to the problematic PC. The settings are exactly as my home PC, but see the time shown above (9:12 PM). It is actually 8:12 PM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, continue seeing the settings. When clicked to see additional date, time and regional settings and then, set time and date, I see this screen:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6c130a5-e0fc-4a0f-8299-303c5a92700d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e6c130a5-e0fc-4a0f-8299-303c5a92700d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, note the text saying: "Daylight Saving Time ends on sunday, May 12th, 2019 at 00:00. The clock is set to go back 1 hour at that time."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The equivalent text in my home PC is rather different: "Daylight Saving Time starts on sunday, September 8th, 2019 at 00:00. The clock is set to go forward 1 hour at that time".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our time zone is UTC-4 and in both PC is configured the same way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, other strange thing. When I click on Internet Time, I see this screen in problematic PC:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e49e3871-93d9-4fb7-b31d-5050722d54c5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e49e3871-93d9-4fb7-b31d-5050722d54c5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Look at the message telling that the clock was synchronized with ntp.shoa.cl on April 12th at 21:03. However, in my home PC, the message is the same, but the time shown is 20:03.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See? Windows operating system insists in adding 1 hour to the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is up to date, and when I check for updates, it does not find anything new to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve the issue momentarily, I unchecked the checkbox that says "Adjust for daylight saving time automatically", but that is not the idea, because I will need to connect to that PC remotely every time the time is changed in my country.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further help, please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jaime</p>

<p>Hello... thanks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tell you that I could fix a time zone problem (the problem that modify the time by 1 hour).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have fixed the DST problem by manually updating registry.<br />
</p>
<p>The fact that took my attention is that this key:&nbsp;<span>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Pacific SA Standard Time\Dynamic DST]&nbsp;</span>only listed until year 2016. How could this happen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other PC's had correctly set even until year 2020. That was the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of that, TZI value of&nbsp;<span>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Time Zones\Pacific SA Standard Time]&nbsp;</span>key also contained an invalid value.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated that key with the value of other PC and it is working now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, a problem still persists when time is modified by some minutes in past. But it could be a hardware problem, couldn't it? I can test by reinstalling windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mini PC came with Windows 10 preinstalled. The link you gave me, will set everything to factory installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The registry is a database in Windows that contains important information about system hardware, installed programs and settings, and profiles of each of the user

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. Some programs can modify the registry values incorrectly which can cause Windows to stop working or

    <title>Star Wars Fighting Game that Resembles Soul Calibur&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Star Wars Fighting Game that Resembles Soul Calibur&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, here's an idea I've been discussing with a friend of mine for quite a few years.</p>

<p>I'm sure most of the gamers that are into fighting games have tried at least one Soul Calibur game in their life. Whether they've liked it or not, I do not know. One thing I do know is that I have enjoyed every Soul Calibur game that has come out, especially
 4 and 5. One thing that caught my eye was the inclusion of a Jedi and two Sith in the fourth game, me being a Star Wars guy and all. The one thing that disappointed me however, was the inability to create your own Jedi. You're able to create your own character
 and give him the fighting style of nearly every other character in the game, but you can't make one that can fight like the few Star Wars characters we have. That really brought me down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My friend and I started talking and came up with this crazy idea that I'm sure many other Star Wars fans have had. Why not create a Star Wars dueling game with a boat load of Jedi and a boat load of Sith. Get the characters from the movies, comic books,
 shows, and books, and pit them against each other! If it were made just like Soul Calibur 5, that'd be crazy. Hell, even giving us the chance to make our own guy and have him take on the likes of Darth Maul and Mace Windu would definitely be intense. What
 do you guys think? Does an enormous Star Wars game with 50 or more characters, each having their own fighting style and secret finishing techniques, and the ability to create your own character sound like something you'd buy?</p>

<p>Contact Disney + Tecmo Koei. Call it Empire Warriors/Old Republic Warriors. Have it play like a Dynasty Warriors Game, but with Star Wars properties.</p>

<p>@Tater - man if there was a star wars game that let you choose from heaps of characters and dropped you into some kind of map/situation (preferably a little less generic then Dynasty Warriors) I would love that to pieces!</p>
<p>If it were a game pitting character against character though I would hate it, running around with a buddy slicing things sounds much better.</p>

<p>If you have a PC you might like Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy. Acrobatics, different sabers and fighting styles, cutting limbs off, multiplayer siege and duels not to mention a great single player story and tons of mods to play with and to top it all
 off its a damn good game.</p>
<p>Any Star Wars fan should check it out, I seriously don't know why they haven't made more games like this.</p>

<h2>            Install failure Win10 pro 64 retail</h2>
                    <p>In December I built a new computer and tried to install Win10 pro 64 retail on it using the&nbsp;USB flash&nbsp;drive I bought from New Egg.&nbsp; I kept getting a problem message "stop code: PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA"&nbsp; "What failed: WimFsf.sys".&nbsp; I had a friend take
 it to his work where he managed to load the Win 10 that they use on their machines.&nbsp; I want to reinstall windows, but I am still getting that error.&nbsp; I am using "USB: KDI-MSFTWindows 10PMAP".&nbsp; I have also tried the UEFI choice in the boot device window, but
 it fails differently.&nbsp; My current install is not damaged by these attempts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a number of reports of the Microsoft Installation flash drives being defective over the last couple of years...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There s a trick for creating and using the installation flash drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Legacy Bios the flash drive needs to be "Initialized" as "MBR" and Formatted "NTFS"...</p>
<p>For UEFI Bios the flash drive needs to be "Initialized" as "GPT" and Formatted "FAT32"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A free tool called RUFUS will create either as you choose, from a downloaded Microsoft ISO...</p>
<p>You can do this instead of creating a flash drive with the Create Media Tool by selecting different options...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Create Media Tool can sometimes create the wrong type of drive, especially if it is uses on a different machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to use "Boot Options" at the POST screen to select a "UEFI USB Drive" as opposed to simply "USB Drive"... Sometimes the machine recognizes the flash drive correctly, and sometimes not... This is due to the Bios itself, and not Windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things are not quite the same as the floppy disk and CD installation days... The newer UEFI Bios stuff really threw a wrench into that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... One way to tell if your machine is using UEFI Bios is the presence of a small FAT32 "EFI" partition on your OS HDD\SSD...</p>

                    <p>Here we go, my Chrome is working well but Edge is not. It said "<span>Hmm, we can't reach this page.</span>" While I type this, Chrome and Internet Download Manager are downloading so well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mail is not working. <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
When I tried to add an account it said.. "Can't connect to the service. We can't connect to the service you need right now. Check your network connection or try this again later."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Calendar is not working. When I tried to add an account it said.. "Can't connect to the service. We can't connect to the service you need right now. Check your network connection or try this again later."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to run windows update, is it working? For me, it is not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I use modem as an internet connection then all apps like Edge, Chrome, Store, Windows Update are going well. Why? Please explain to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is from microsoft and the wifi driver.</p>

            <p>Hi Rifqi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunate to hear you are facing issues after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are few things we can try to work on this issue. I suspect that this might be do something with the Wireless drivers. However lets break it down by trying the necessary steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try installing all updates in Wired mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Run the Network Troubleshooter to verify the issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hit Windows key +X</li><li>Select Control Panel</li><li>Search "troubleshooting"</li><li>Click on Network and Internet</li><li>Run Network Adapter troubleshooter.</li></ul>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>Check for drivers for the network adapter from the manufacturers website. Download the latest ones and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3:</p>
<p>Run Sfc scan to verify the health of the system files.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</a>
</p>

</p><p>Keep us posted on the status of the issue.</p>

            <p>Method 1: didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: yes, I found that the manufacture is not provided proper wireless driver for Windows 10, sadly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: on progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my only chance is waiting the manufacture for the latest update, isn't it?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Mass Effect 3 voice over lines in French&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I've recently bought Mass Effect 3 for XBox360 through the microsoft store, and downloaded it on my xbox360. Booting up the game, everything seemed fine, but as soon as I started, all voice overs were in French. Checking the settings, I can't change the VO language from French. This shouldn't really be an issue, seeing as the rest of the game is displayed in English, but please help me find a way to change the voice-over language.</p>

<p>I thinking that is the only thing that could have happened. The settings for the game itself are hardwired for French. I thought I could maybe DL some language package from the addon's but no luck. One other thing that may have happened, long shot though,
 is that my VPN was activated on my laptop when I DL the game from Microsoft. If the VPN made Microsoft think I was in a French speaking location it may have defaulted to a French version. Does VPN take over the ip for all devices the home once its activated
 I wonder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>oh well I was hoping to learn French one day anyway haha</p>

 with my save file and as the opening cut scene plays...the voice overs are in french...and for whatever reason I can't change it to english. No console settings were changed when I bought both games and there was no mention on the store page that the voice
 overs were french only. A response to this issue would be nice Microsoft.<br />

    <title>How do I restore missing file idstore.sset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markgiard  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I restore missing file idstore.sset</h2>
                    <p>I can't create a Homegroup on Windows 10.&nbsp; DON'T RECOMMEND THE TROUBLSHOOTER; i've already run it at least 20 times, it tells me nothing is wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;I get an error message that "Homegoup can not be set up on this computer".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Troubleshooter does not help!&nbsp;
 I've&nbsp;determined that Peer Networking Grouping isn't running.&nbsp; When i try to start it I get&nbsp; "Error 1068: Dependency Service or group failed to Start" .&nbsp; I then determined (can't remember how) that it's because idstore.sset file isn't on my&nbsp;my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then
 I&nbsp;was advised to check that&nbsp;ipv6 is on but I can't find how to easily check this on Windows 10; &nbsp;all of the advise is for earlier versions of windows.&nbsp;&nbsp; so:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; How do I restore the missing file idstore.sset?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; How do I turn on IPV6?</p>

            <p>Hello Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We appreciate the time and effort you have put in to resolve the issue. I would like to assist you with further information from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that some services depend on other services. If a system component is stopped or not working properly, dependent services can be affected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I would suggest you to try to stop and restart the
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> on the key to bring up
<strong>Run</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Type “<strong>Services.msc</strong>” without quotes and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password, or click Continue</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Right click the "<strong>Peer Name Resolution Protocol</strong>" service and choose
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the "<strong>Log On</strong>" tab, please ensure the option "<strong>Local System account</strong>" is selected and the option "<strong>Allow service to interact with desktop</strong>" is unchecked.
</p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click on the "<strong>General</strong>" tab; make sure the "Startup Type" is "<strong>Automatic</strong>". Then please click the button "<strong>Stop</strong>" under "<strong>Service Status</strong>" to stop the
 service.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Then please click the button "<strong>Start</strong>" under "<strong>Service Status</strong>" to start the service.
</p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the default location for idstore.sst is:</p>
<p><strong>C:\Windows\ServiceProfiles\LocalService\AppData\Roaming\PeerNetworking\idstore.sst</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you have identified &nbsp;idstore.sset to be missing or corrupt, I would suggest you to&nbsp;deploy<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;the
<strong>System file checker</strong>. System File checker (SFC) scan is done to check if there are any corrupted system files that could be causing this issue. Kindly follow the below given steps:</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong>, select

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for keeping us posted and we appreciate your patience on this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I would suggest you to perform a Reset of the operating system and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue here. I am an insider with build 14257 in the latest release. idstore.sst is missing. In the past I had problems and the MS support recommended to switch between the Microsoft account, which I am actually starting with and a local account
 and back. As far as I remember the problem was that the system did not install updates any more.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any new ideas how to solve the problem? It is a bit nasty because I think this problem causes that I cannot go on all folders of my NAS.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sbp2port.sys is a Windows driver. A driver is a small software program that allows your computer to communicate with hardware or connected devices. This means that a driver has direct access to the internals of the operating system, hardware etc. It
 seems that the program might have corrupted in the USB drive that you are using to install Windows 10. However, we would need some more information regarding the issue.</span></p>

            Where did you get your install media.

<p>1.MSI z390 MEG Godlike</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.while 64 bit and the message i get for 64 is above, the message for 32 is either of these..,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;a. File: \windows\system32\boot\winload.efi</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Status: 0xc0000359</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;b. File: \windows\system32\drivers\usbhub.sys</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Status: 0xc0000098</p>
<p>
</p><p>the second one(b) was a recent one</p>
<p>
</p><p>(the entire error screen asides that area is the same stating that windows failed to start. Recent Hardware or software change might be the cause</p>
<p>followed by step by step for using window installation media to repair, and the rest)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I did not create the bootable media(hence why its difficult to pin it by a simple google search)</p>
<p>i bought it directly off the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>(it arrived on oct 20, due to obtaining the parts for the PC over time, as they came into market)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT: and if nothing else works, ill take a look into creating the bootable media. Which is what i was avoiding for convenience, but in this case didnt seem to turn that way easily. and since it was ordered physically from the Microsoft Store. creating a
 Bootable media isnt fully, or an easily accessible option.</p>

<p>If nothing of note that i can do to fix the issue without creating a W10 installation USB. then ill try to Create a different USB. unless im able to still use the W10 Pro USB i had bought from the MS Store.(or need to create a W10 USB, then attempt the W10
 Pro USB)</p>
<p>
</p><p>only real question i have is in the case of the W10 Pro USB i had bought.(on the idea of getting it running on the PC i had just built, which the Mobo/Cards/RAM/CPU should be able to run, since the cards are W10 operable, and CPU/RAM are compatible with
 the Mobo)</p>
<p>
</p><p>if there seems to be nothing of note that i can do. i will attempt to make a W10 USB.(and possibly the W10 Pro USB afterwards, cause the point was to get Pro Running.)</p>
<p>as i had mentioned before, it would start on pro, and then instantly cut off to the error screen, and on 32(which isnt what id go for) would load for a bit, then immediately head to error screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if there is nothing else, then thank you very much for your attempts.(since it was a MS Store bought Pro USB, and not File/key Download from the store. i cannot simply find or access the download for Pro's Files. but ill look just incase on the mail)</p>

<p>When you use the Media Creation Tool to create USB boot media (selecting create for another PC) then the media you create will be for Home and Pro combined. During the install you select Home or Pro and 32 or 64bit.</p>
<p>You don't pay for the installation media but the licence key you received with what you purchased from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still think using new media is your best way forward.</p>

<p>Just Note incase anyone may need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At This Point i am pretty sure the Windows 10 Pro USB i had bought Directly from the Microsoft Store(website) had some bad sectors in the memory, which had probably had issues with the files.</p>
<p>hence why it would start, but then fail(instantly on 64 bit/Delayed on 32 bit).</p>
<p>
</p><p>i dont know how common this is.., but so far seemed to be only in this case.</p>
<p>i ended up getting a new USB(since one i had, didnt have enought Storage Space)</p>
<p>(would of used the Same Windows USB i had bought. but i do not know how to Remove its write Protections so the Windows Media Creator would make the Windows 10 Install)</p>
<p>ill see about getting it to do Pro, like another User had mentioned, which isnt something apparent to a new builder like me. in either case thank you very much to both Manjunath_H/Neilpzz for your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ill be off now to continue the installation.</p>

<h2>            Halo&#58; Combat Evolved PC Controller Problem</h2>
                    <p>I use the left analogue stick to look in Halo: CE PC, and unfortunately the character keeps looking down and to the right. This is not the case with any other game, whether I am using the X-Box One controller on my laptop or X-Box One. What is the problem
 and how do I fix it?</p>

<p>Hi Godzilla,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Within the game look for controller sensitivity settings, if this is happening in only this game. There may be settings to adjust this. Have you also made sure the controller is up to date?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>
