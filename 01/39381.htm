<h2>            how to retrieve windows 10 product key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 in December from 8.1, everything worked fine until this morning. i turned on my computer and it wouldnt go to my desktop and instead took me to a screen with options for Windows to fix the problem. After resetting it did not work.
 In the screen option screen, I was able reset &nbsp;windows but after it proceeded something happened and it decides to back out of the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That same options menu, Im able to access the command prompt and i looked online (on my phone) to see how i can retrieve my product key but the wmim and powershell options refusea to work. now that i have access to the commans prompt i can at least robocopy
 my documents to an external, then do an install, but now how do i enter my product key if i cant rerieve it?</p>

            If your OS was activated you do not need the key.&nbsp; You can simply skip the step where it asks for the key by clicking "do this later" and it will check with the online activation server, verify your credentials and complete the install.&nbsp; Keys are handled
 differently in win 10.&nbsp; We all have a generic key that is nothing but a place holder.&nbsp; The important bits are kept on the activation servers.

    <title>Microsoft LifeCam Studio AV out of Sync in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gednotjed  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft LifeCam Studio AV out of Sync in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When making an AV capture file in LifeCam Studio the video and audio are not synchronised, however when capturing AV within Windows Movie Maker the video and audio plays ok.&nbsp;Steps I have taken already include removing the Windows Camera app which I did using
 windows PowerShell (x86). I did this incase there was a conflict. Also I have&nbsp;repeatedly checked the situation with drivers;&nbsp;there are&nbsp;two&nbsp;drivers available from Microsoft that can be installed into&nbsp;Device Manager under 'imaging devices', these are&nbsp;LifeCam3.6&nbsp;and
 LifeCam4.25 respectively.&nbsp;There is another driver in Device Manager under 'Sound Video and Game Controllers/Studio Microsoft LifeCam'&nbsp;this is version 6.5.6004.0.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you uninstall all drivers and let widows 10 update automatically it will install by default the LifeCam Studio4.25 under 'imaging devices' and 6.5.6004.0 under 'sound&nbsp;and audio' in device manager,&nbsp;this being is&nbsp;the latest version available form Microsoft.
 But, this installs without a desktop icon so there is no way of starting the software. (the .exe in the programme files doesn't work either). I learnt that if you install LifeCam3.6 first followed by a windows update, the windows update&nbsp;replaces 3.6 with 4.25&nbsp;in
 the device manager, with the benefit that the icon placed on the desk top from the&nbsp;original 3.6 install remains intact and operative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that Movie Maker functions ok&nbsp;with standalone&nbsp;4.25 (i.e without access to LifeCam Studio) but this means you can't access the LifeCam Studio independently of Movie Maker and remember Movie Maker is no longer supported so can't be relied on. Moviemaker
 lets you access LifeCam setting from file menu/about/moviemaker</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I know I'm&nbsp;fully up to date with the current driver but the LifeCam Studio web capture does not function correctly.&nbsp;In the end I want to use another Video editor (actually Adobe Premier Elements) and that software cannot function in regard to webcam
 capture while there is this issue of synchronisation in LifeCam Studio3.6 or 4.25&nbsp;on windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just yesterday I checked on my other pc which is running windows 7 but won't run Movie&nbsp;Maker due to the graphics card. On this set up LifeCam Studio3.6 is working fine with the video&nbsp;and audio nicely in sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Apologies for&nbsp;such a long posting but I&nbsp;trust I've clearly described the issue........ Windows 10 LifeCam4.25 will not produce AV in synch independent of Movie Maker and more importantly, other video Editors can not
 function alongside&nbsp;LifeCam Studio webcam&nbsp;with these issues pending.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty desperate to solve this issue and would be most obliged&nbsp;to receive help from the Microsoft community especially any technical camera/video people out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying to my post Guru. I thought I'd made it clear that I had already taken the steps you have suggested but evidently not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was only by trial and error persistently and repeatedly uninstalling and reinstalling drivers by the variety of methods available (including what you have described Guru)&nbsp;that I arrived at the situation where I had LifeCam Studio working with its controls
 accessible. I can tell you now that I managed to get through to a Microsoft support technician who remotely accessed my pc. After thoroughly checking my pc&nbsp;for errors and attempting to update all appropriate drivers the technician&nbsp;checked out the situation
 with&nbsp;his line management and the development team. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The situation is that at present there is no suitable windows 10 driver for Microsoft LifeCam Studio. The development team are said to be working on this issue and until they produce a driver update there is no way of making progress on the issues I have
 raised. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Non the less I am great full you took the trouble to respond to my posting. As you are a support engineer you could check my case out (No 1329706415) and perhaps give a more in depth&nbsp;resume of the current state&nbsp;of play re&nbsp;a driver update for Windows 10 and
 confirm the information I have been provided with. It would really help me to have an approximate date or month when&nbsp;a Windows 10 driver for Microsoft LifeCam Studio may be available.
</p>
<p>

    <title>Diarium App Synching - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aleya e  say:</h3>
<h2>            Diarium App Synching</h2>
                    <p>I have been using the app Diarium to keep a short log-type journal for the last month or so. I chose this app because it claims to be able to cloud sync with either Microsoft OneDrive or Google Drive, and I like having a backup/remote database on my computer
 in case anything happens to my phone. The app claims to be synced every time I click the sync button, but I cannot access the actual entries in OneDrive or Google Drive - I have tried syncing it with both. I do not receive any error messages when syncing.
 I was able to find the Diarium database and media index in OneDrive (under Files&gt;Apps&gt;Diarium), but these files cannot be opened, and I cannot see their content. Please help me access my Diarium entries on my computer so I can continue using the app and be
 sure my entries are able to be accessed remotely. Thank you!</p>
<p>Here is a photo showing the successfully synced symbol in the top right corner, and a message that the local and remote
 databases are in sync.</p>

<h2>            Skype Audio Not Working When Being Called</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Skype for work calls and I've noticed that sometimes when someone calls me or I call them, that the audio settings are changed and they can't hear me. When this instance happens I just re-start my computer, call them again, and everything is completely
 back to normal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what is causing this issue as all of my settings are correct and are going through the correct input channels. I do use ActiveDial as another online phone system but I don't understand why this would have any affect on Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please help?&nbsp;</p>

            This is an issue that has been going on for years now, regardless of Skype versions and mac OS version. I suspect a hardware compatibility issue with Skype. Nearly every time I am called on Skype by my mother who uses a MacBook Air (2011 I think), the
 audio does not work (I cannot hear her, but she can hear and see me and I can see her OK) and she needs to quit and restart Skype. After restarting, the call then works as expected. Putting the computer to sleep, without quitting skype, and trying to call
 again a bit later will bring back the audio issue (her mic not working). As a result, virtually every call has to be done twice because of mic not working. I hope this can be fixed.

<p>Hi Juan_0789,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When someone calls me on Skype and they cannot hear my audio I always just restart my computer and the issue is resolved. So that I already know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is preventing this from happening in the first place. How do I know or adjust my settings so that when someone calls me on Skype they can always hear me?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it is working properly I don't touch my settings at all. Then someone calls me for work and all of a sudden my audio doesn't work. &nbsp;This is the situation I'm trying to resolve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have a solution - thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Don</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tradition of 'hating' any new version of the Windows OS started with Windows XP. This was the first version that was released after the DOJ Anti-Trust lawsuits against Microsoft and the hate Microsoft phenomenon was in full swing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>XP did not even start to become popular until sometime after the XP Service Pack1 was released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here a link to an article that documents much of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The XP Tablet PC Edition was released in 2002 and experienced the same hatefest.&nbsp;This was also a&nbsp;very&nbsp;long time before the Mobile (and Apps) Revolution that we are currently experiencing first began. This revolution started in late 2009,&nbsp;about a year before
 the first iPad was available,&nbsp;when the worldwide Mobile computer shipments first exceeded the standard Desktop PC shipments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The XP Tablet PC Edition was mainly designed for Digitizer Pen Input. The Touch input was very primitive. It was a superset of XP and was initially only available as an OEM Pre-installed option. It was not included in the retail version of XP until the XP
 Service Pack 2 was released.</p>

            <p>The issue was Microsoft trying to shoehorn a mouse/keyboard interface into a touch interface. It wasn't pretty and the tablets of the time simply didn't have decent power to run well. User interface elements were small and designed for precision. Hidden
 commands everywhere in the OS and apps assumed you have a keyboard always available and a mouse always available. Heck, mouse-hover events continue to be an issue to this day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had a few XP-based tablets at my previous job. They ended up being quickly abandoned because they were frustrating to use and there was very little software adapted to a touch interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The iPads are a combination of good marketing, and a touch-first interface, which makes them much more pleasant to use than XP Tablet edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8, we have a reversal. Although I think a touch interface is more usuable with a mouse than a mouse interface is with touch, we have the opposite complaints: The Windows 8 Store, with touch first apps, is great on a tablet, but the Desktop is
 clunky with touch. But I think that's why the Surface Pro and similar Windows 8 tablets are gaining some traction: The touch first interface is there which is pleasant to use, but if you absolutely need Desktop software on your tablet, you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The flop of XP tablet edition wasn't irrational hate, it was simply a combination of pre-mature technology and lack of touch-first software. Luckily, all the good stuff continues to be carried forward, such as the excellent handwriting recognition. How my
 computer can decipher my chicken scratch is nothing short of magic.</p>

            Why didn't software companies make software to run on XP touch devices? Whatever you say i still think that Windows XP running on a tablet is better than some IOS OS running on an iPad.<br />

            Because the market of touch devices was too small to care about. When the iPad came out, the iPhone was already riding high and could run iPhone apps as well as touch-first iPad apps.<br />

            <p>Hi Paul, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which printer component are you trying to uninstall? </p>
<p>2. Is this issue confined to HP printer software? </p>
<p>3. What is the complete/exact error message? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It looks like there could be some registry errors while uninstalling through Windows Installer. You may run the Fixit and try to uninstall the software.

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10  mobile not working for the 5th time</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows phone with the mobile 10 operating system Skype is not working it was working yesterday it has been reloaded it has been updated and still does not boot on my phone I can receive no messages on it I cannot have it to be utilizable when I
 try to start the app.</p>
<p>What in the hell is the deal.</p>
<p>There is no tech support or anyone to call to ask what is the solution to this before I spend another hundred and $250 for another Windows phone which I have a loyalty to why don't you try to fix this application as soon as possible what are you and Bill
 Gates doing to not make this work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix this and fix it fast.</p>

<p>Be sure you know your Skype username and password and then try this. Go to All Settings on your phone. Go to Apps, then Apps and features. Scroll down to Skype and click it. Click the Advanced option link. Click the Reset button.</p>
<p>This deletes your phone's local database for Skype. The next time you launch Skype, it will ask you to sign back in. Once connected, Skype will download your database from the Cloud. It will take several minutes to populate all your contacts and messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: a uninstall and reinstall of Skype does nothing to your local database but a reset will dump it and reload next time it's used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please tell us how it goes and give a Yes if this solves your issue.</p>

<p>I went through the same rigmarole where only the blue splash screen showed, then Skype vanished to black.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to click <strong>Reset</strong> twice in the Apps settings to actually reset it. It may have just been coincidence that you thought an update fixed it.</p>

<p>Try it in this order just for grins. Do the reset. Uninstall the app. Reboot the phone. Open the store and reinstall. Launch Skype and log in. Make note of where and how it fails if it does and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The logic is the reset deletes your local data. Uninstall then removed the app so nothing should be left of Skype. The reboot is a precaution.</p>

<h2>            Laptop only connects to 5g not regular WIFI</h2>
                    My computer will only connect to 5g wifi not any other wifi. It shows the other wifi connections but will not connect. I know it is not the modem because other laptops will connect to the non 5g wifi and works fine. When I connect to 5g it works but frequently
 disconnects and reconnects. This is not a huge problem at home since I have 5g but I got the Lenovo Yoga to use for work and we do not have 5g wifi there.

            <p>You probably do not have rights to this folder.</p>
<p>Just because you are the owner or are administrator, permissions can still be set so that you have no access rights to a folder.</p>
<p>It would help to know whether you have XP Home or XP Pro and, if XP Pro, whether you have Simple File Sharing enabled or not...&nbsp;&nbsp;however the following should work for whatever you have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To see the current permissions on the folder, bring up a command prompt window</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "cmd"</p>
<p>and enter the command:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cacls "C:\documents and settings\username\Desktop"</p>
<p>the following command should give you full permission unless there is a "deny" entry (you may need to be an administrator user to make it succeed):</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cacls "C:\documents and settings\username\Desktop" /T&nbsp;/E /G youruser:F</p>
<p>where "youruser" is the username you want to grant full (F) privilege to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more info on the cacls command, type</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; cacls /?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>

<p>Behold! Gears of War: The Board Game </p>
<p>Written Friday, July 29, 2011 By Richard Walker </p>
<p>Apparently inspired by the second Gears of War game, Fantasy Flight Games is releasing Gears of War: The Board Game at the end of next month according to a listing on Amazon, meaning that you can finally gather the family round and play Gears of War with
 your granny. Uniting Marcus Fenix with his stalwart allies, Baird, Cole Train and Dom Santiago, Gears of War: The Board Game tasks players with teaming up and working together to take on the Locust and further the COG war effort by accomplishing various missions.
 In the big box, you'll find a variety of cards, tokens, map tiles, two sets of dice and 30 nicely detailed playing piece figurines that you can set up on the game's massive board. Hopefully, you'll have a big enough playing surface to accommodate it when Gears
 of War: The Board Game launches on August 31st, 2011. Take a look at it in more detail in the video.</p>

<h2>            Internet explorer is missing</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have my console for the 2nd week now but I've just realized that the Internet Explorer app is missing from my console! I used bing to search after it but no results. I can't find it in the app store either. I've just purchased a 1 year gold subscription
 yesterday but it didn't solve my "problem".</p>
<p>Anyone has the same issue? Should I try a factory reset?</p>

<h3> c_d_t  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to have Windows 10 recognize SD card as media device</h2>
                    <p>I have an SD card that I use for music in my car radio's SD slot. &nbsp;I want to add more music from my computer to the card. &nbsp;In Windows 7, I could put the card into my computer's SD reader and it would recognize the card as a media device. &nbsp;That would enable
 me to sync music to the card using Windows Media Player's Sync function (basically it treated the SD card like an MP3 player). &nbsp;However now that I upgraded to Windows 10, when I insert the SD card it recognizes it as a storage device. &nbsp;I can't figure out how
 to get it recognized as a media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anybody know how I can sync music to the card with Windows Media Player? &nbsp;My only alternative is to copy the mp3 files over manually, but that's a pain when selecting individual songs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply but unfortunately this didn't help. &nbsp;And by the way, Bluetooth is not involved since I have an SD card slot in my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit more info that might be helpful to know. &nbsp;In Windows Media Player when I click on the Sync tab (far right side) it has the message "Connect a device". &nbsp;Obviously that's because Windows thinks the SD card is a storage device and WMP is only looking
 for media devices for syncing. &nbsp;I've gone through the Sync settings, but unfortunately none of those help since as far as WMP is concerned there is no device to sync with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when I first insert the SD card and the autoplay window comes up, none of the options are to make it a media device. &nbsp;It has options for Configure this drive for backup, configure storage settings, and open folder to view files. &nbsp;I would think the
 solution to my problem would be to somehow have it add another choice for open as media device, but I have no idea how to get that choice to appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much.</p>

            <p>ALMOST identical problem here. Can happily move media files&nbsp;to the SD card using Explorer and launch Media Player (or Groove Music) to play music files, there seems to be no way for Media Player to recognise the SD Card, either as a library or as a device.
 The options relating to connecting a device are disabled in the menu.</p>
<p>Like the OP, I've tried the remove WMP/reinstall to no effect, rebuild the library to no effect. I suspect what I'm trying to do is very similar to the OP: I have a media library on my LAN (on a Win 7 box) which I'd like to selectively synch to the new Windows
 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems as though the SD drive is completely invisible to WMP in Windows 10. Cynically, I'm starting to think that this is entirely deliberate, but can find no MS page that says "You cannot sync media in WMP in Windows 10 any more".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, following the "Help with synchronising..." menu option takes you to a generic "Windows 10 help and how to" page. Unedifying in the extreme. I almost wouldn't mind if there was a way to achieve this with Groove Music - but if there is I can't
 find it.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am able to update other games&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p>uuuum. What.&nbsp; I've been stuck like this for 2 hours.&nbsp; As im typing this up the download is working now.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I guess this is now a post on if it does this just let it sit there and maybe it will work</p>

            Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; If you're connected via wireless I'd recommend trying an ethernet cable for the update.&nbsp; Other than that I would suggest trying a factory reset on the console.&nbsp; There's an option to keep installed games and apps and your saves are safe
 on the Cloud.

                    <p>Hello there,</p><p>As a customer I'm&nbsp;really wondering why&nbsp;prices have a really big difference&nbsp;in different regions?

    <title>Wireless controller signal strength through thick walls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rusty nerd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless controller signal strength through thick walls</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All</p>
<p>First post but hopefully I could use the experience of the forum to answer my particular question.</p>
<p>I am working on a new building project where all the walls will be reinforced concrete, think prison. In the cells they would like to offer the use of a Xbox to play on but the actuall console will be in a cupboard seperated by the thick wall. In the wall
 will be a hole where a LCD screen will sit behind a very thick pain of glass, think bullet proof thickness.</p>
<p>I think I already know the answer to this but was hoping that someone on here might have had experience with a similar enviornment. I think that even placing the xbox behin the glass for line of sight, i dont think this will achieve a connection to the wireless
 controller.</p>
<p>Your thought and experience is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>I suppose it depends on the thickness of the walls. Usually the signal strength varies depending on how far away from the Xbox the controller is, and sometimes the power left in the batteries. A high powered battery pack and a controller that is no too far
 away from the actual wireless receiver on the Xbox should work fine, but there's always the possibility that the signal won't get through the walls.

<p>I am swaying towards that the walls will be too thick and with reinforcement within will only add to it sapping the signal. I think the only option is to progress with best endevours and hope that the end result will work, maybe if the user is not to far
 away from the Screen itself.</p>

<p>Hey there, the controllers definitely were not designed for that. You may have some luck- and I imagine that glass would prrrrobably be better than concrete. &nbsp;Any material separating the controller from the console definitely can cause interference though.</p>

<p>Maybe hold off your project to use XBOX ONE....... &nbsp;The controller is said to be at least 15% better at Data Transfer but, &nbsp;That remains to be seen. &nbsp;Without running experiments, your question may not have an answer.... &nbsp; An estimated range is the best you
 can do.... &nbsp;GOOD LUCK!!!</p>
