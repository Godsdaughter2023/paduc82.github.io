<h2>            USB drives showing Chinese symbols</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7 32-bit and every USB stick I put into the usb port works fine but when I try to eject it it shows there names with chinese symbols and that they are 4GB, even using my external HDD which is 500GB shows the same thing. It works fine will
 show the files and can access everything with no problems so im thinking it is just a glitch but the same thing happens on my other laptop and that is running the RC where as I have the full edition. I havn't been able to find anything online but it cant just
 be me? Is anyone else having this problem and have a fix for it? Any help is greatly appriciated.

Sounds like the same thing that's mentioned here (also shows a character with a rainbow in devices &amp; printers).&nbsp; I thought it was going to be fixed a few weeks ago.&nbsp; I'll follow up on this.

<h2>            Unable to access Marketplace&#58;  Status Code 80072746</h2>
                    
<p>I've been unable to access anything on the xbox live market place. &nbsp;The error pops up as there is a problem with the xbox live service. &nbsp;Try again later. &nbsp;I did try again later, as this problem started almost 2 months ago. &nbsp;I've tried all the suggestion
 on the error help page, with no luck. &nbsp;Normally I would download stuff from xbox.com to my 360, but I am unable to do so with the Borderlands 2 season pass. &nbsp;It says that I have to go through the game to download the add-ons for free with the pass.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p>My Friend had this problem intermttently, He put his xbox into DMZ on router and it worked. So it may be your router settings. I have a flakey router which gives xbox and ip camera same ip address, Xbox won't connect to live til i restart camera. It only
 happens now and again but took me ages to figure out. . Give me your router make/ model No, and which ISP your with and i'll see if i can help.</p>

<p>my router is a Netgear N600 Wireless Dual Band Gigabit Router. &nbsp;Model number WNDR3800. &nbsp;My ISP is Hughesnet. &nbsp;I'm able to connect to xbox live, and do everything on xbox live except access the market place. &nbsp;I've tried connecting my Xbox directly to my router
 and my modem but the same error popped up. &nbsp;I've tried it on Borderlands 2, Skyrim, and Fallout New Vegas. &nbsp;Borderlands 2 has a seperate in game store that works until I try to download something and it has to access the Marketplace, then the error message
 appears.</p>

<p>Whoah, what the heck! &nbsp;You can't get into the Marketplace at all? &nbsp;OK, I hope you don't mind if I shoot a wall of questions at you:<br />
<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><span>When exactly do you get this error code? &nbsp;As soon as you try to enter?</span>
</li><li><span>Are there any other profiles on your console? &nbsp;Can they get into the marketplace?</span>
</li><li><span>You said you tried connecting directly to router/modem. &nbsp;Did you bypass the router entirely and ONLY connect to modem? &nbsp;If you haven't yet, and you can, that'll be worth trying.</span>
</li><li><span>Have you ever tried accessing the marketplace from another console?</span>
</li></ol>
<p><br />
A couple basic steps to try before we get into anything too exotic will be to just move your profile onto a USB drive and remove it from the system entirely. &nbsp;Then redownload that profile from the sign in screen. &nbsp;Another would be to try and see if you can
 pull up that Season Pass on a Bing search and try to get to it that way.</p>

<p>1. &nbsp;I get the error code right when I try to access the Xbox Live Marketplace, and it is a different error for if I try it game, and when I do it from the Xbox 360 Dashboard.
</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;There are 3 Xbox live profiles on the xbox, and they all have the same problem.</p>
<p>3 and 4. &nbsp;I have not tried to connect it directly to the modem, or on a different xbox, but I will as soon as possible and get back to you.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if it matters or not, but 2 of the Xbox live profiles are on a family pack, with the host account on a seperate xbox. &nbsp;However, the problem presented itself well before we set up the family pack.</p>
<p>I also tried deleting anything downloaded from Xbox Live, including all the game updates thinking it might be a corrupted file, but to no avail. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing connection problems (since you have an 8007* error), and
<em>the order and timing of the steps is important to success:</em></p>
<p>1) turn off the Xbox and unplug the power supply cord from the back of the Xbox then<br />
2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).<br />
3) unplug power from the modem.<br />
4) Wait <strong>at least 5 minutes</strong> then replug the modem/gateway power.<br />
5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that light
 says it's ready, skip to step 7.<br />
6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.
<br />
7) Plug in and turn on the Xbox.&nbsp; For more background on Ports, see <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/port" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>XBOX live &amp; Hughesnet Gen4 Error code 80072746</p>
<p>Some users of the Hughesnet Gen4 service have noticed that they receive the Error code 80072746 when trying to log in to Xbox live, this is thought to be caused by the acceleration feature of the HT1000 modem.</p>
<p>To fix this, go to this page of your modem &nbsp;<a href="http://192.168.0.1/cgi-bin/index.cgi?Command=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">192.168.0.1/.../index.cgi</a> &nbsp;and disable web acceleration and save your settings.</p>
<p>I tried this suggestion after hours of searching and it worked for me. Good luck and hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Windows Update KB3000850</h2>
                    If you notice an optional update in Windows Update on Windows 8.1 KB3000850 is the number beside it. &nbsp;I installed it and worked fine until I wanted to put my laptop to sleep that’s when it did
 something not bad enough to warrant complete wipe and reinstallation of Windows 8. &nbsp;What it did was make my computer never go to sleep and when I noticed this (IE my power light and HDD light were still on after it’s been closed for a while) I opened it back
 up and the screen wouldn't turn on and I could not get it to work with an external monitor either. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The only way to fix it was to force a shut down and restart it then it would work but if you tried to put it to sleep it would do the same thing over. &nbsp;So I had to uninstall KB3000850 update and
 now things are back to normal so I recommend you hide this update and never install it till they make a patch for it. &nbsp;It’s not necessary for Windows to have this update all it has in it is updates from Windows Update dated back to Update 1 back in April to
 November 18th 2014. &nbsp;So it’s not needed and I say don’t install it until patched.<br />

 lower be red ?? or like outlining the letter with a different color ?<br />
and by the way I don't mean anything not like using wordart in MS word ... that uses pictures ... I want like a software to color the fonts we use in messenger/wordpad/any application in windows (customizable color pixel by pixel) ... because the application
 colors the font ... so can anybody help me on this ??? thanks a lot&nbsp;</span>
<div><span><span>and please tell me if there is any software that can do that :)</span></span></div>

            As I said, I very much doubt that there is any "font coloring software" that will do what you want. However, contact one of the font designers and see what they have to say. Most certainly a professional font foundry person will know if it is possible
 to do what you want and if so, how to do it.

                    Hi! I really need some help. My dorm mate just borrowed my laptop and I had to go for some errands. in a hurry, I just set my laptop to a local account from my Microsoft account. Now, I've been trying to change it from the local account to my Microsoft
 account but there's been a&nbsp;problem. I had entered my email and password, then when it had reached the current windows password, it doesn't accept the "blank" or my current password. Help please! Thank you so much in advance!&nbsp;

            Hi Julia -
<br />
<br />You said you changed from a MS Account to a Local Account in Account settings before you loaned the PC, correct?  Did you confirm the sign-in password remained the same, or can you ask your roommate how he signed in exactly?  
<br />
<br />If you're unable to figure out the password or get it to take any that you know you use, then you may need to Reset the PC.  But to do this you need to use the only method to get Advanced Startup Options that doesn't require a password, by booting via the Windows Installation media:
<br />
<br /> Here's how to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />In the Troubleshoot options choose Reset.  This will allow you to save your files, but afterwards you'll need to reinstall your programs which we will help you with as needed.  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />If the Reset fails use the bootable media to Clean Install following <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />In the future make a Password Recovery Disk:  <a href="http://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-and-use-password-reset-disk-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.windowscentral.com/how-create-and-us...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Cortana responds with the wrong time which is 1hr ahead from the actuall time on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Cortana Time and UTC issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simple question: When asked for time Cortana responds that it is a time that is 1 hour ahead of actual and shows my current location and UTC(-5). Now the UTC should be -6.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched for this problem and have found that most responses from community members insult the intelligence of those of us with the problem Having said that, please consider these items before responding:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system time, date, and region ARE CORRECT.</p>
<p>The Location in Maps and Weather ARE CORRECT</p>
<p>My location in Bing IS CORRECT</p>
<p>My location in all Apps is EXACTLY CORRECT, right down to my small town.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that the only problem is the UTC variation that Cortana / Bing use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue? Is there a fix or work around other than changing my location to somewhere I am not?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your responses.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Les,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to some of the corrupted app files &amp; folders or missing app files on your PC. Missing or presence of corrupted system files &amp;
 folders on the PC will lead to changes in system performance where the device will fail to perform simple and normal tasks when commanded.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Run
<strong>SFC scan</strong> and <strong>DISM scan</strong> on your PC by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan
</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. If a
<strong>Windows Resource Protection (WRP)</strong> file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. For example, some Windows functions may not work, or Windows may crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows corruption errors may prevent Windows updates and service packs from installing. For example, an update might not install if a system file is damaged.
 The <strong>DISM</strong> <strong>scan </strong>or System Update Readiness tool may help you to fix some Windows corruption errors.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Open an
<strong>Administrator command prompt </strong>window by</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press<strong> Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select
<strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong> option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click on <strong>Yes</strong> and
<strong>continue</strong>. Provide administrator password if prompted.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Check if it says <strong>
Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> at the top of the command prompt window.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><span>Type the following commands in the
<strong>CMD Prompt</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3:
</span></strong><span>Close the command window and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>
</span><span>If the issue persists,
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/getstarted-set-up-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Set up accounts</span></strong></a>&nbsp;on Windows 10 article and check if similar issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching
<strong>Start menu</strong>, <strong>Cortana, Search bar, Store </strong>and other
<strong>Windows applications</strong>. In such cases creating a new profile and checking for the same will help in identifying if the is specific to corrupted user profile or the OS.</span></p>

<h2>            video connection and sometimes, when I type in the chat bar theletters do not appear,</h2>
                    When I am talking to my friend, sometimes when I type it does not show up, its like my keyboard is disconnected. if we hang up and call again then it will be o.k. for awhile but then it will mess up again. &nbsp; Also when we get connected my video does not
 work sometimes, like the last two days I can see her but my camera does not come on, I click on it but it has a line through the icon but even though I keep clicking on it ,it won't open. very frustrating..&nbsp;

<h2>            PCIE USB ports stop working a few minutes after connecting the headset - Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. &#40;Code 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Good day,</p>
<p>I have a Samsung Odyssey+ that I'm trying to get to work on my desktop. It has an Asus P8H61-M motherboard, i5 2500k sandy bridge processor, 8gb DDR3 RAM, a GTX 1070, Samsung EVO 860 ssd, and a Thermaltake TR2 600W PSU, with a recently installed PCI-E USB
 3.0 card. The BIOS, GPU drivers, and Windows 10 are up to date, and the install is completely fresh, with only Steam installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following problem: I can set up the headset and get into the Cliff House (and even Steam VR) without a problem but, every time, after a few minutes, all the USB ports on the PCI-E card stop working, and under device manager, it shows up with an
 exclamation mark next to it, with the message <em>"Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"</em>. The controller is "VIA USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller (Microsoft)", which was automatically installed by Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If I disconnect the headset, uninstall the drivers and try to scan for devices again, the pc freezes and I have to force shutdown it. After restarting, it works once again for a few minutes and then the same thing happens (meaning I can't really
 use it for anything).</span> Under Event Viewer, nothing relevant shows up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Any ideas about what could be causing this?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note: the headset works on my MacBook, so it isn't the problem.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            In-place upgrade from ISO disk fails in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>To fix a problem with the 1511 upgrade to Windows 10 (which reliably fails at the 25% point of install), I took several people's advice to do an in-place upgrade from an ISO disk. The installation always fails right after "making sure you're ready to install,"
 giving me no error number but only "Modern Setup Host has stopped working." Is there any way to fix this?</p>

<h2>            APC Index mismatch</h2>
                    I am getting an APC index mismatch code on a BSOD (for restart, so not really death). I am almost positive it is related to either the audio or graphics driver as my sound cuts out all the time when watching video, and will even cut out for Windows sounds
 offline. &nbsp;I have tried updating the drivers, but I'm thinking that there possibly isn't a patch yet as I updated to the Windows 10 anniversary Ed. &nbsp;I've even gone to the HP site to get updates directly &nbsp;and that has not solved my issue. &nbsp;I also tried to defrag
 and clean my HD and updated BIOS and nothing. &nbsp;Any advice advice or do I just have to wait it out?

<p>This helps centre old low res game that use a 4:3 aspect ration on the screen. Note that Windows will often force this</p>
<p>setting on games that don't need it, but fails to do so on games that do need it.</p>
<p>- I've also found a couple of games that do need this setting which will fail to launch if it's not set.</p>

            The site isn't illegal... <br />
<br />
All they offer is a tool to automate driver updates. It also looks like you didn't even try their tool, or do you have proof that they plaster older drivers over newer ones? Even if, sometimes it's necessary to revert drivers. Also, Windows does not have updates
 for each and every device or do you actually use the graphics drivers MS supplies? Besides, it's not your job controlling the way people maintain their operating systems.
<br />
<br />
Some people (like you) try to let the OS handle each and every need, some people (like me) want to have total control over what is being installed and do everything manually, others (like those using that tool) want an automation method that suits their needs.<br />
<br />
I hope you hold your breath once you stumble over sites like reboot.pro that offer tools and knowledge how to manipulate and enhance Windows in ways you certainly would qualify as "potentially troublesome"...<br />

            IT IS SPAM!!! Before you start confusing people with your know it all response maybe you should do some research on spam.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>YOU may lead 100s of people into trojan virus h3ll over your calling us lazy for wanting to trust the primary company that made the software.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>IF ANOTHER SOFTWARE GOES WRONG YOU DON'T GO TO ANOTHER COMPANY TO FIX IT! THAT'S WHAT TECH SUPPORT IS FOR. There may be a possibility that the site may not be harmful at all. BUT the fact that it opens your browser almost every hour begging you to install
 the software while pretending to be a part of the Microsoft network = PROBLEM!!!&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The fact that I have never installed the software at all yet still cannot find a fix to prevent the popup = SPAM.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>http://www.driverupdate.net is SPAMMING PEOPLE. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!&nbsp;</div>

            <p>The real answer is... </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Take a look at this.. <a href="https://www.slimwareutilities.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.slimwareutilities.com/</a>&nbsp;the parent company of the driver utility in question..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Full of dubious claims, removal of junk that can all be done for free, but you have to understand that many users shy away from anything technical like using Disk Cleanup or getting a sound driver from the HP laptop support website.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The 'one stop' fix center appeals much more, and the claims made by SlimWare and others pander to the myths and FUD that have been rolling around the Internet for years.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you look at the small print at the base of the link given originally, you will see this..
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><em>"Drivers may also be available for free directly from manufacturers' Websites."</em>
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Clearly, this is admission that one doesn't have to pay for drivers. It is a pity that SlimWare doesn't use the same size print as used for the 'claims'.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>While nothing illegal is happening, I don't believe that the software advertised is in the best interests of the buyer, and I would never personally use it myself or advise anybody to use it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Presently, one can construct a website featuring company logos which may give the impression that 'techies' think that the product is good, and include 'reviews' from people who are impossible to track down. The Microsoft Certified Partner accreditation
 may or may not be applicable, but it is horrifyingly simple to get, something that Microsoft should look into at the earliest convenience.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, websites can be hosted off-shore,, in countries where anything goes and nobody cares. This makes it much harder to get rid of morally reprehensible stuff..

<h2>            Tablet PC Settings is Missing</h2>
                    <p>After updating my Surface Pro to 8.1, I've lost the "Tablet PC Settings" item in the Control Panel and can't access it from the Start menu.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm now unable to reset my pen calibration. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I still have the "Tablet pen settings" panel. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also did some research and found "C:\Windows\System32\TabletPC.cpl" but opening that just sends me to the "Pen and Touch" window.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm looking for the "Tablet PC Settings" window that includes the "Calibrate..." button, but it's completely gone.

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure why that would have been removed from the Control Panel?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a possible workaround until this issue can be resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Desktop</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Right click</strong> on the Desktop and select <strong>New</strong>/<strong>Shortcut</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the <strong>Type the location of the item</strong> window, <strong>Copy/Paste</strong> the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{80F3F1D5-FECA-45F3-BC32-752C152E456E}</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Click the <strong>Next</strong> button and type the name <strong>Tablet PC Settings</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Click the <strong>Finish</strong> button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Double Click the new shortcut and it should open the Table PC Settings window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Let us know if this works for you.</p>

<p>Hi Joowapa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. If the item you are wanting is directly from the Microsoft store than it is possible to use currency. As this one is directing you to Minecraft.net and not the Microsoft store, you will not be able to use
 the currency in this purchase.</p>

</p><p>As the mod said. if the item you are looking for is from Microsoft store then indeed you can use it as long as you are playing the Microsoft version of the game.</p>

<h2>            Intel GMA 3150 Brightness</h2>
                    Is there any chance to adjust the brightness, if you have Intel GMA3150 and windows 8? I wrote an email to the samsung support, they forwarded me to the Intel support, and after that they forwarded me to Microsoft support. But I can't send an email to
 them, so I put my question here.

            That's a shame.
<div><br />
<div>Probably a long shot, but have you tried any 3rd party brightness apps like -&nbsp;<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Video-Tweak/Desktop-Lighter.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Video-Tweak/Desktop-Lighter.shtml</a>&nbsp;(this
 one is intended for up to W7, but I read on a forum that someone claimed they had used it successfully on W8).</div>
<div><br />
<div>It may not help, but if it tries to adjust the brightness using a&nbsp;different&nbsp;method to Samsungs own, it may help? I appreciate it shouldn't be needed on W8, but it may be worth a shot, possibly.</div>

<h2>            when I click once, my mouse acts as though I have clicked twice</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> mouse issues</p>
<p>I have started having an odd problem. I use a single click on my mouse and over the past couple of weeks, often when I click once, it acts as though I have clicked twice. Deleting two emails instead of one or opening an email when I really only clicked into
 it once to view in a reading pain.</p>
<p>I switched the mouse since I assumed it may be the problem but that has not fixed it. I have looked at the mouse settings and there is nothing that appears to affect this. I am kinda stumped. I don't know if i is software or hardware. any ideas?</p>

So, even though my Fable Anniversary games continues to tell me all about SmartGlass and what it can do for me, it is all a big F*CKING LIE.

                    <p>My game progress didn't save and I lost several hours of progress in ReCore. I thought the game was supposed to autosave but I guess it just didn't for whatever reason. I saw that other people have had the same issues in the past but I thought I should ask
 here in case something has changed. Did I do something wrong? Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening again?</p>

<p>Hello Metal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your question. You haven't done anything wrong. Personally had this happen to me also. What I do is save it often. There is an option to save yourself. This will prevent it from auto saving failing. Now if mine fails
 I usually only miss a little running or start a big fight again.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've personally never played the game but I did get with Brad and asked for clarification and he was referring to ways you can force the autosave and not necessarily choose an option to save because unfortunately there isn't one from the research that I
 did. Although, as mentioned there are ways to force an auto save and maybe even do it twice to make sure the auto save feature of the game is working as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/recore/comments/52shbu/how_do_you_save_the_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reddit thread</a> mentions that going in and out of dungeons or doors into other rooms will force the auto save and sitting at your work bench and then&nbsp;getting up should also force a save. Also I found site that explains different ways you can save in the game.

<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>
