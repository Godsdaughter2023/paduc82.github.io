<h2>            How to remove obsolete and unremovable NDIS filter miniport device</h2>
                    Vista Business 32Bits<br />
<br />
Sunbelt Personal Firewall 4.6.18xx was in use for a long time on this pc.<br />
We decided to remove this firewall because it let to intensive BSOD.<br />
Sunbelt Firewall Cleaner had been applied.<br />
<br />
After firewall removal the Vista Device Manager still shows two items of<br />
Sunbelt NDIS Filter IM Miniport device. One called #3, the other one #6.<br />
It is not possible to remove these device, neither by unsinstall, nor by<br />
uninstall along whith driver files removal.&nbsp; These two devices keep to <br />
be listed in Network Adapters group.<br />
<br />
Registry shows several items related to these two devices.<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet002\Control\Class\{4D36E972-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002bE10318}\0015<br />
There are more than two items of #3 and #6 miniport device under ControlSet002.<br />
Also other registry branches still refer to these devices.<br />
<br />
How to remove these two devices ?<br />

            Hi Klaro, 
<br />
<br />You should have an IP on the side of your wireless router. 192.168.x.x - open up a web browser and put that IP into the URL field and hit enter. log in with credentials (also should be on the side of your router) and you should be able to change the password once in there. 
<br />
<br />Are you looking to change the password for your wireless network all together, or are you looking to change it on your computer so you can connect to a wireless network? 
<br />
<br />Let me know and we'll figure this out!

<p>Charlie, Thank you for the response.&nbsp; Please forgive my stupidity in this matter.&nbsp; I am trying to respond to the latest news about hacked routers.&nbsp; I have a dual modem which supports WiFi.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Is that also the router?&nbsp; Info I find on it:&nbsp; **** dual modem, model TG1673G, network name</p>
<p>(ssid), pin #TG02DHQ1672, plus several numbers I do not understand&nbsp; None of the numbers
</p>
<p>are the 192.168.xx you show in your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no understanding at all about your wireless question.&nbsp; For some reason my IP server,TWC, who supplied the modem to connect my TV to wireless,&nbsp;suggested that I leave the PC as LAN connection as it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I should not concern myself at all with change any password?&nbsp; (or perhaps I</p>
<p>should stop watching all the TV news!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I am sorry that I have no better understanding of the new to me electronic language.</p>
<p>I'm 90 years old and trying my best to figure out this new world I'm living in.</p>

<p>DaveM121&nbsp; Thanks, but I find it all so confusing I shall simply ignore advice from TV news to change router password.....I am not computer knowledgeable to even have the foggiest</p>
<p>idea of your helpful instructions.</p>
<p>I'll just let it go and hope for the best.&nbsp; Haven't a thing of interest to Router hackers, anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks, again, for your very nice attempt to assist me.</p>

            No problem at all. Don’t be sorry. <br /><br />If your PC is a desktop, and doesn’t move, then absolutely keep it hard wired. It’s a more stable and faster connection. <br /><br />If we change the password on the wireless router, you’ll have to change any device that’s connected to the wireless router. Your TV, smartphone(if you have one), etc. <br /><br />If it’s 12+ characters, with numbers and letters I feel like it should be suffice. If you want to move forward with changing it I can look up the model information you provided me and we can go from there!<br /><br />I’m here for you either way, so let me know!<br />- C

<p>Thanks Charlie,&nbsp; I think I shall just disregard the change of router password.&nbsp; If I start fiddling with changes I don't understand I'm sure to screw up about a dozen other things.</p>
<p>Best to leave it alone til I find out exactly how important it might be. Thanks again for trying.</p>

    <title>Product Key and MS Customer service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> averageconsumer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Product Key and MS Customer service</h2>
                    <p>I've pretty much had it with MS. I contacted online CS yesterday and they tell me to download and install the Windows 7 Home Edition Premium online and use the product key on the bottom of my computer to activate it. (I had lost my "Pre-Installed" backup
 drive because of a stupid mistake).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried to activate product key and it was coming back saying it was invalid. Called customer service to activate over phone and got an "outsourced" rep on the line. Basically I was told since it was preinstalled, I had to use the program from the PC manufacturer
 and could not use the online version because it was considered a "retail" version. So I am either SOL, or I have to pay either Microsoft or HP for another copy of the same program I already paid for when I purchased the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been with microsoft since it was Windows 3.1. We usually have two or three computers at a time in our house, plus smart phones and tablets. I shouldn't have to purchase another MS operating system. Yes, I know it came preloaded on the laptop, but hard
 drives crash and burn all the time, and most people I know don't actually back up the program to a cd drive, including myself. This is a pet peeve of mine anyhow, an operating system disk should come with any new computer I purchase. It's not like the pc manufacturer
 and MS can't afford to include it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the point of having a valid key if microsoft won't recognize it??? I'm pretty ticked about this whole thing. Not to mention the time it actually took to download the stupid program over a 3g network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it's time to update these computers, we won't be going with another Microsoft product again if I cannot be satisfied with the level of service I receive. Linux Mint&nbsp;is starting to look pretty good right about now. And I've always wanted to try a mac.</p>

<p>You need to change the Key to the one on your COA sticker, using the Change Product Key link on the System properties page, and activate that.</p>

    <title>Login &#47; Lock screen flickering with wait image and black screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raventara  say:</h3>
<h2>            Login &#47; Lock screen flickering with wait image and black screen. Lots of event viewer errors.</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's happened 3 times today and once the other day. I lock my pc, go away and make a cup of tea or whatever, and when I come back and go to unlock my pc the login image swipes up but then I get a flickering screen, from black screen to coloured screen with
 the wait circles circling around.</p>
<p>I checked in the event viewer and it's FILLED up with this happening 2 to 10 times a second, just like the flickering:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Activation of app Microsoft.LockApp_cw5n1h2txyewy!WindowsDefaultLockScreen failed with error: The remote procedure call failed. See the Microsoft-Windows-TWinUI/Operational log for additional information"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the latest updates (windows and video drivers) and it's a Dell Inspiron 17. I have two monitors hooked up to it but the flickering continues on the laptop screen even if I unplug them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried to edit the login screen in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>

 untrue given it's immediately followed by more of the same error...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get a chance I will have to run SFC from the recovery console as although it supposedly found errors they were unable to be accessed or whatever...</p>

            <p>None of the items you list are core components of Windows* - Windows will run fine without them. However these are extremely common 3rd party add-ons/programs to have installed because they add significant functionality.
</p>
<p>Flash Player will allow you to experience a lot of videos/games/multimedia online.
</p>
<p>Adobe Reader will allow you to view PDF files which are widely used for everything from educational documents to instruction manuals for hardware. There are other PDF reader programs beside Adobe Reader - some people recommend FoxIt Reader, but I have't
 got around to trying it myself.</p>
<p>You are correct to configure them to update automatically as security vulnerabilities are often fixed by these updates.</p>

<h2>            When I eject media safe to remove hardware message does not appear</h2>
                    <p>When I have an external hard drive or thumb drive connected to my Windows 7 computer, I click on the safely remove hardware and eject media icon on the task bar. Then I select eject. Then I do not get the safe to remove hardware popup message. I used to
 get it but now I don't. The safely remove hardware and eject media icon remain on the task bar, but when I click on it a second time it goes away.</p>
<p>Can you please tell me how to fix this? Thanks.</p>

            OK, I figured out how to fix it. I found a utility called Ultimate Windows Tweaker. It has a selection called "disable balloon tips." It was selected and when I deselected it the problem was solved.

    <title>Windows 10 freezes and hangs at random, mouse &#38; keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loxxhamanarua  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 freezes and hangs at random, mouse &#38; keyboard completely unresponsive after an update.</h2>
                    <p><em>Not sure where to put this topic, sorry. </em></p>
<p>This started happening with my last update-one I had some issues installing. 'Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709'</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my Windows 10 freezes, it hangs. It doesn't crash, nor does it go back to normal, and both my mouse and keyboard become completely unresponsive. I've tried plugging in my keyboard to the port where my microphone was-oddly, I was able to turn it on and
 off-but still nothing with the keyboard. I also tried changing my wireless mouse batteries, but that did not work either. This always results in me holding down my power button until the PC powers down. I always wait ten seconds before turning it back on.
 The problem randomly persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might have noticed-though I'm not completely sure, I'd need to go through the issue several more times-that when a certain program I use for work is running, the freezing and hanging happens more often, and it's excess windows stay up in the background,
 unresponsive. Once, I tried to close it, and a separate issue arose-a small pop up in the top left hand corner saying Windows had become unresponsive. I tried to click an option, but that froze a grayed out, and the screen went black with my browser and task
 manager open. I was able to navigate my mouse, but not much of anything else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, I've only did it once-but ending the probable problem program with task manager closes it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been looking up different things to do and try when the overall issue happens, but so far nothing works. It doesn't seem to be a compatibility issue, because the program, my mouse and keyboard, and Windows 10 were working perfectly fine before the update?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Other information:</em> </p>
<p>Troubleshooting Hardware and Devices(because of keyboard and mouse) always claims to have fixed the issue and tells me to restart. Of course, I follow the instruction.</p>
<p>Troubleshooting Windows Updates always claims that there are updates pending. I always 'Apply fix' but it does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a couple things I would like to try before I do something as big as a Factory Reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to reinstall an update? Because maybe-I'm not a professional, though-the update did not install correctly. If possible, can you explain step by step easy-to-understand how to do it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it safe to go back to a previous version? Can I keep my files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any idea how to resolve this, and if your sure about it, feel free to throw it my way, please. As long as it's safe to do without wrecking my internals, and is easy to understand, please.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping this doesn't require me to throw my computer back into the shop a second time this year. First time was merely due to dirt inside the tower, and a fan passed it's expiration date around August.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            I'm not surprised you are having trouble with Windows 10 Fall Creators Update. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />If you cannot load the Windows Desktop, you can initiate a Rollback using the following method:
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />After rolling back, Windows 10 1709 will try to upgrade again, block it it.

<p>I want to have set my screensaver to be launch at 9 minutes with photos from a folder let's name it "X", and I want that when I get back to the computer (or someone else tries to use my computer -e.g. mom, sister, cousins.... etc) the lockscreen gets displayed
 with the new slideshow presentation feature of photos from the same folder "X"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I have so far.</strong></p>
<p>I start setting the screensaver from the desktop, right click on the desktop, then click on Personalize, then click on Screen Saver, then from the drop down menu select Photos, then click on Settings... select folder "X", then in Wait set 9 minutes, then
 check the checkbox for On resume, display the logon screen.</p>
<p>Now with the charm bar, select Settings, then Change PC settings<span>, then click on PC and Devices, then pass the switch to On in the Play a slide show on the screen option, then add the folder "X" and remove all others....</span></p>
<p>At this point my logic tells me I'm done!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>but...... after I do the settings for the lockscreen with the charms if I go back to the desktop to check the screen saver settings it is magically set to none...... and if I reverse the procedure described above, set the slide show for the lockscreen first
 and screensaver last, then I go back to the lockscreen slide show settings and it is magically off..... &nbsp;and excuse me for what comes next but....WTF??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really want this to work because it will allow me to know if someone lay a finger on my computer when I was AFK. But....</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I would accept.</strong></p>
<p>I would accept that at least the lockscreen slideshow kicks in at 9 minutes, but since I have set my power settings to never shut down the screen for I have an alzheimer's dad and one autistic cousin, when I'm not there to watch them they really seem to
 &nbsp;hold it quietly watching the screen, that is a 32"HDTV, right now I windows key+L to slideshow in lockscreen and have screensaver disable but if I forgot to do it I might find all my data lost, this has already happened when my sister aggroed my old computer,
 that's why this is not the best solution for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll gladly accept registry tweaks, or whatever you can provide me to solve this.</p>

<h2>            Excel borders not printing after Windows 10 download</h2>
                    After downloading Windows 10, Excel documents will not print borders. They show up in Print Preview, but do not print. I am not talking about gridlines, I am talking about borders and boxes that are surronding cells. My printer is an HP office jet Pro
 8610, 1 year old.

<h2>            Error code&#58; 0x80073d13 &#40;Xbox Game Pass PC Beta&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When installing certain games on the Xbox Game Pass PC Beta app I seem to be getting Error code: 0x80073d13, Games will download to about 4.5%-9% then come up with the error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to install Metro, Wolfenstein, We Happy Few, Imperator: Rome and probably others I have not yet tried will give me this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope this is not similar to the Microsoft Store error that does not allow certain games/programs to be installed on other drives besides C: which I don't think it is cause Halo Wars 1 seems to be giving me a different error code that I think is
 the disk drive error but I am not sure but It would really suck to have a bunch of games you can't install and we can't decide on a game-by-game basis yet so say I had just enough space for Metro on my C: drive but not enough to include another game from my
 other drive I can't specify that (atleast I think) it would all have to be on the same drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Update: That seems to be what the error is, must be installed on your main C: drive, when I disconnect my external drive Xbox app will auto download Metro directly to my C: drive&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the problem seems to be that the default drive for new apps is not the main Windows drive. Changing it to the default drive (i.e. C:\) resolves the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But for larger games this isn't really a solution. Hopefully Microsoft fixes this.</p>

            I am also having this problem. I changed my install location to C: drive, and downloads began as I would expect. This isn't really a good solution because my C: drive is a small SSD, meant to hold the operating system and apps, but not much else. I like
 to store my games on my additional internal hard drives, like anyone else. They need to fix this.

<p>Hello FarhadVatani,</p>
<p>
</p><p>once you have your font downloaded from the web (these are often .ttf files) and available, just right-click it and click Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to check if the font is installed, just press Windows key + Q then type: fonts
</p>
<p>then hit Enter on your keyboard, and now you can see the fonts listed in the font control panel.</p>
<p>

 si son convencionales, los usaría para algo jugable...</p>

<p>A un conocido le paso lo mismo. Aclarando que, primero, ya le había llegado un correo, diciéndole que los puntos ya habían sido abonados a su cuenta, pero no tenia nada. Hablo a soporte y le dijeron que esperara máximo otros 2 meses y le dieron un numero.
 Pero hace dos semanas por fin le llegaron los puntos. Los puntos son Microsoft points normales, que se pueden usar para lo que sea, no solo películas.</p>

<p>Lo primero que deben hacer es dejar de esperar, hablar a soporte y reportar la situacion. Les pediran algunos datos de su cuenta de Xbox Live y tambien datos de la tarjeta de credito o debito con la que hicieron la compra de la suscripcion.
</p>
<p>A mi me paso igual, yo hice la compra el 13 de Marzo y no me dieron los puntos, ya que ellos encontraron la promocion y checaron no tardaron mucho, de hecho hable este martes 2 dos dias despues osea el &nbsp;el jueves ya me habian mandado a mi correo 3 codigos
 de prepago con un valor total de 1,000 MS Points, con los que me compre el Dungeons &amp; Dragons XD.</p>
<p>Espero que les sirva un poco la informacion, aunque ya comentaron la solucion. Bueno saludos a todos y espero que resuelvan pronto lo de sus puntos.</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />Once you are able to boot into safe mode, check the integrity of the system
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Last option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. I would be happy to work with you to take you though this problem.

            Hi Jan, please try this:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

Only if you have purchased a group volume license that is able to be used on multiple devices would you be able to do this. A retail license would be a single use license.

            Hi JannieLouwrence 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />In case of Retail license, it is one license one computer philosophy. The license gets attached to your motherboard. Hence, you can't use an existing license on another computer unless you transfer the license (but it will mean losing license on earlier computer). Hence, you will have to buy another license.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>DISM</strong> comes with the <strong>Windows 10</strong> update, and according to your issue Windows 10 still uses Package Manager. So, I suggest you to follow these methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Perform SFC Scan</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click (or press and hold) the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select<strong> Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</li><li>Enter <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> (note the space between "sfc" and "/").</li></ol>
<p><strong>Method 2: Automatic Repair in Windows Recovery Tool</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Download a&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 ISO file in a DVD or USB</strong>&nbsp;using media creation tool&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here.</a></span></li><li><span>After you boot your PC using&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 ISO</strong>, a black screen will appear with text. Press any key.</span></li><li><span>Select the&nbsp;<strong>correct time and keyboard type.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Repair&nbsp;your computer.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong>Choose an option screen.</strong></span></li><li><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Options</strong>&nbsp;in the Troubleshoot screen.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Automatic repair.</strong></span></li></ol>
<p>Keep us updated on how it works.</p>

<h2>            Time zone keeps resetting to the wrong timezone &#40;windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using windows 10, and whenever i close the settings window after i change the time zone, it resets to Pacific (i live in Eastern). normally i would go into the control panel to change the timezone, but i don't have administrative permissions for the
 time zone (even though my account is the admin)</p>
<p>
</p><p>ive tried setting windows time service to automatic (like similar questions have been answered with), that didnt work. i tried restarting my computer, which didnt help, and i also checked to make sure my account is the system admin, which it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>any help is appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S: whenever i try to change the timezone, im greeted with this message.<br />

<p>One thing: If you've got a Windows system image backup (or even an image made by a 3rd-party app), the image can be mounted (instead of restored). It will have a drive letter of its own, &amp; individual files may be copied off it. This is worth trying, hoping
 the controls that prevent one profile from accessing another's files is bypassed that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds more like you created a new user account than repaired the bad one. The new one will not be able to see the files of the other. You have to repair &amp; log into the old one to see its files. What shows up in this registry key now...?...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your reply, initially there are 2 long pfile IDs.. one with .bak based on this forum (https://www.kapilarya.com/youve-been-signed-in-with-a-temporary-profile-in-windows-10) make the directory changes from c:\users\TEMP to c:\users\&lt;UID&gt;. but still
 the file mapping is having an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>its a mistake of deleting the .bak and changing the new profile. i guess the issue could have been solved by just renaming them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with the .bak been deleted and the active profile not able to show the files? what options to rebuild a new registry file?</p>
<p>
</p><p>can we use the regback option from c"\windows\system32\config\regback, last update is on Jun 27, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after exploring the error situation, the issue might have caused with an improper patch update the mappings were not complete and the user profile tagged to TEMP. instead of making changes to registry...a rename could have solved the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>please suggest options to recover/recreate the new registry file with all mappings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rk.</p>

<p>Well, the one at TheWindowsClub (unlike Kapilarya) did rename the .bak key &amp; delete the temporary user...</p>
<p>"</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the subkey for the created temporary profile</li><li>Correct the ProfileImagePath for the .bak subkey. It will have the same SID as the subkey deleted above</li><li>Rename the .bak key by just removing the .bak extension and keeping the same SID.</li></ol>
<p>"</p>
<p>However, I'm not positive it would have had a better outcome. Sounds like it might have, though. Anyway...</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) What you suggest could get the registry back with a good key in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) <strong>First</strong>, have a look at your restore points. Those bring back the registry plus other system files &amp; settings that existed at the same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) R-Clk START, &amp; select "System".</p>
<p>(b) Click "System Info" at the far right.</p>
<p>(c) Click "System protection" at left.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; System Properties will open at the System Protection tab.</p>
<p>(d) Click the "System Restore" button.</p>

<p>(1) Have you tried searching for the missing files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In that thread I cited above, someone said the registry fix worked to recover his profile -
<strong>but </strong>he had to go search for his files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(a) Search for them in File Explorer. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Check "Hidden items" at the View tab, then type a partial file name into the search box...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86145589-2909-4276-ab62-ba36eee8f404" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/86145589-2909-4276-ab62-ba36eee8f404" /></a></p>
<p>(b) R-Clk OneDrive in the Tray, &amp; select "View online"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ec70b5f-6a86-4da3-86e3-dc65badc6f88" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4ec70b5f-6a86-4da3-86e3-dc65badc6f88" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(2) What is the date on that restore point you've got? What is the date of the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If the restore point matches or precedes the problem - try it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(3) Did you say you have RegBak...?...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/regbak-lets-you-backup-and-restore-the-windows-7-registry-easily" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/regbak-lets-you-backup-and-restore-the-windows-7-registry-easily</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never used it. I'm unsure it's as thorough as a restore point. But - if it offers a viable registry - I guess you may try it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(4) Are you logging in now with the same password as before the problem began?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>luckily i have the Dell backup &amp; recovery media (during the system initial build took a recovery media copy onto a USB drive) which helped to repair the OS related files. the user profile is rebuilt and the issue is resolved now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks to all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>RK.</p>
