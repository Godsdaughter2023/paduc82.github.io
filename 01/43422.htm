<h2>            What the heck happened with today&#39;s Windows 10 update&#63; &#40;12&#47;16&#47;15&#41; Start menu no longer works, can&#39;t access apps or files.</h2>
                    What just happened with the update this morning(12/16/15)? Why did it take so long, and why did it make the start menu, notification bar, and many other things no longer work? What can I do about it? I'm going to restart and hope it brings back the functionality,
 but am somewhat worried it will get worse.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, why in the **** did it ever start with that incredibly stupid and scary statement that "All your files are where you left them?" I would assume that's the case with any windows update, so why the **** would you say something like that? I honestly thought
 my computer had been hijacked by ransomware that was mimicking the windows startup font and it was about to say "but you need to pay us to access them." Still not sure if it isn't irreparably damaged by the update, but WHY IN THE **** would you put a message
 like that on my screen for a good 3 minutes with NO indication that Microsoft Windows updates were going on??? There was no "percentage complete" message like I usually see with updates, and no indication that anything was happening or that it was from Microsoft.
 Crazy!

            <p>I don't know where to find that information. I didn't choose to install anything. It was automatically done overnight and this happened when I started it up this morning (12/16/2015).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting did not help. The start button does nothing either onscreen or on the keyboard. Nearly all my taskbar icons are gone - Microsoft Edge and IE, as well as time/date, network status, battery status, volume, etc. Nothing in the new notification box,
 and only my antivirus in the hidden icon area. My desktop icons still work, so I can get to Chrome which seems to be working OK, but I have no way to get to Edge or IE, office, or any other apps or programs.</p>

            <p>It's a sorry state of affairs here in this Windows 10 forum...<strong>so many</strong> users systems are crashed by stupid updates which are supposed to fix issues not break them...I am almost certain that you will have to re-install Windows 10 again...but
 I'm afraid to offer advice...many Windows 10 upgraders are creating threads next door @ the Insiders forum.

            <p>I had the exact same thing that RollingStoneOK describes happen to me at 6:00 tonight, and I used the exact same words he did, both about the update language (similar to the original Win10 install) and then when everything disappeared. &nbsp;I can't even find
 my Control Panel anymore so have no clue what the update is. &nbsp;Selecting Start&gt;Settings does absolutely nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank God my other 2 (newer) computers are still on Windows 7. &nbsp;This one was Windows 8, so I figured that was so bad how much worse can 10 really be? &nbsp;Windows 10 was actually a little bit better, until now. &nbsp;Never moving the other ones off 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hoping Microsoft comes up with a better solution than spending 4+ hours re-installing everything.</p>

            Sounds totally familiar. Last time I had a problem like this I got through to a Help Desk. The guy was extremely helpful and spent hours fixing things remotely for me. I was totally pleased. I even bought a year's worth of 24/7 assistance as I am in my
 mid-seventies and finding the world a bit speedy for me now. But along came another update - out of the blue - and I didn't even know it was happening. Now Office 365 is even slower than a turtle with glue on its feet. I have no response from any of my TaskBar
 buttons. My Mail is playing up. I have had a problem with my videos through Foxtel Go, and I can't find the email I received to tell me how to access my 24/7 assistance. I am at the end of my patience. I can't even open my calculator to handle my budget. Chrome
 is all good, and my personal files are fine - as long as I don't need Office 365 to access them. I can't understand technical jargon, so is there anyone out there who can help me in SIMPLE NON-GEEK SPEAK, please?

            <p>Well, the problem seems to be fixed as of this afternoon (12/17). I was trying some suggested fixes I found online (system file checker, reinstalling apps, neither of which worked) and restarted the computer,&nbsp;during which it installed another update, and
 the taskbar is now back to the way I had it and the start&nbsp;menu functions again. Anyone having this issue may try restarting or otherwise getting&nbsp;update KB3119147 since that seems to be what fixed it for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the answers to your questions anyway:</p>
<p>1a. Purchased July 2014</p>
<p>1b. Upgraded to Windows 10 64-bit on 08/24/15</p>
<p>2. from Win 8.1</p>
<p>3. Media creation tool to a new thumbdrive</p>
<p>4. McAfee All Access - Total Protection version 14.0, expires Jan 2016</p>
<p>5. None that I know of unless it's included in the McAfee Suite.</p>
<p>6. No, the McAfee All Access is the only one I have installed on this computer</p>
<p>7.&nbsp;Maybe a Norton trial that I never used and deleted before W10 upgrade. I used Windows Defender under 8.1</p>
<p>8. Yes, but there is also a&nbsp;new one from this afternoon: KB3119147</p>
<p>9. Yes: You have version 20,0,0,228 installed</p>
<p>10. Chrome only (plus Edge and IE)</p>
<p>11. No, have never used a registry cleaner on this computer, unless the McAfee Suite does that</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help. I'd appreciate any insight in case this happens again.</p>

    <title>Card reader is shown as Mass Storage device with Yellow triangle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanzoghrob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Card reader is shown as Mass Storage device with Yellow triangle</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 7 Professional. I plugged in my 23 in 1 card reader (generic type, which I have been using&nbsp;for years with my previous Windows Xp Professional woth no problems) &amp; used it as ususal. To my astonishment I found&nbsp; in Devices &amp; Printers a "Mass
 Storage Device" with a yellow tiangle with exclamation mark. checking its properties I found out that it was the card reader, choosing the hardware tab showed that it has the 4 slots assigned as drives with no problems "Generic USB CF Reader USB Device", then
 MS, SD and SM, and&nbsp;another 4 WPD File System Volume Driver as Protable Device with the yellow triangles &nbsp;next to them with a message of "The Device Cannot Start. (Code 10)".</p>
<p>Checking the Device Manager I found the 4 slots of the reader under Disk Drives with the same names &amp; with no problems, but under Portable Devices the 4 WPD file system volumes are there with their yellow triangles.</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling then reisntalling the reader, tried Microsoft FixIt, disconnecting then reconnecting the reader, ... all to no avail. The same problem persists.</p>
<p>I can use my reader normally though, but heving this yelow triangle with code 10 next to it is annoying.</p>
<p>Any help please.</p>

            <p>Thanks Mat for your help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Actually it's a&nbsp;generic one with no brand on it at all (my daughter gave it to me as a gif few years ago, all that's written on it is Card reader 23 in 1, &amp; made in China)&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's really working fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Why Windows 7 is accessing each slot as 2 ? one recognized &amp; the other is not with a yellow triangle?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The troubleshooter &amp; the FixIt utility weren't much of a help. Problem still there..</p>
<p>Are there any new drivers for WPD? or may be work around this issue as Mat suggested.</p>

<p>I will for sure. The maps look pretty sexy. I just think it's stupid that they're releasing them so soon after the second pack.</p>

<p>No chance! yet another 1200 pts, these map packs are getting extremely silly now, especially so close to the last release. Seems to me that they are bleeding this game for all its worth before MW3 is release, kinda smells like they've backed up these map
 pack release purposely! </p>

<p>Heck yeah. For less than $50 I will now have the 3 map pack that end up extending the life of this game until MW3 comes out. The cost per hour is ridiculously small considering the number of hours that many of us spend playing this game.</p>

            Hi EGill5 
<br />
<br />When you enable Remote Assistance, that will allow someone you give permission to to have full control of your PC remotely over the Internet
<br />
<br />This process is fine, if you know who is on the other end, that you are providing that access to, if you are in any way unsure of who is on the other end, never provide access to them
<br />
<br />May I ask, are you being asked to enable Remote Assistance and if so, who is asking you to do that?

<h2>            Graphics Card Permissions.</h2>
                    Hi! Im having problems with the permissions on my computer. In my computer I have a Nvidia GeForce 820M Notebook version graphics card and its great for playing games like Minecraft but when I want to play steam games and stuff I need to activate the Intel
 HD Graphics 5000 and I can, but I constantly need to get my dad to enter his password as he doesn't mind but its obviously irritating. Is there a way to allow my permission to do that so I don't need my dad's password? If so how? If not please tell me something
 along the lines that could help. Thanks!!!

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. Appreciate your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are using a Child Account which has parental control and permissions. I would like to inform that the issue is not with the Graphic Card permission. There are certain limitations which are given to the Child
 account that require permission from the Parent to access and the changes can only be done by the Parent account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to us for any assistance with Windows, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h2>            KB4100347  has left my PC unable to overclock PERMANENTLY</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>as some of you are aware the KB4100347 update released in late September&nbsp; caused many people owning a broadwell-E processor to be unable to overclock their cpus.&nbsp; many people were posting the solution to this as being to just to uninstall the update.&nbsp; However
 I have uninstalled the update myself and STILL can't overclock my cpu.&nbsp; I have a 6950x and it has run at 4.2Ghz for years and now runs at 3.5Ghz MAX even with the update uninstalled!....what a disaster of an update!!! it has left my CPU permanently at stock
 settings.&nbsp;&nbsp; When i go back into the bios to overclock it again it still always reverts to stock clocks once windows loads....</p>
<p>
</p><p>without a counter-patch of some sort I won't ever be able to overclock the thing!&nbsp;&nbsp; extremely angry!!!!&nbsp; how any update can touch the bios settings is beyond me....Does microsoft have a response SOON for this????</p>

<p>- some guys said the files are in the window.old folders</p>
<p>- so i go there , i think i didnt find it there BUT i did think i &nbsp;find them in os(C)-users-myname</p>
<p>- i then begin to cut and paste everything but my pictures to the NEW documents, videos, downloads folders</p>
<p>- so after all of that i begin to use like normal and shut down my laptop</p>
<p>- i then reopen my laptop to find my old wallpaper is back, a message from windows saying my old files are back etc</p>
<p>- i then go to my files and realize EVERYTHING was gone except for the files i DID NOT cut and paste</p>
<p>
</p><p>- so what do i do now? i cant find my files in the windows.old folders anymore or anywhere else</p>

            <p><strong>BEFORE going back!!!</strong></p>
<p>Try to find them all again, like you did in your first post, and then <strong>
save it all on USB-stick and extern harddisk BEFORE shutting down the computer</strong>. That's the way to get the files secured saved!! Don't trust your computer!

<p>
</p><p>A good recovery-program is the free Recuva if you later have to use one - set it as shown in this screenshot</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After ended scanning, you will see a big mess of files and Windows-things, but you can set it to only show pictures, documents, videoes and e-mails. When recovered pictures, you set it to show documents. recover them, and so on... You don't have to run a
 new full scan...</p>

            <p>Is this a Windows 8 or Windows 10 problem?&nbsp; You are in the Windows 10 Forum. This is a new problem that you are throwing at us, not that I mind that, but with a video problem in a post about missing files, the video experts are likely to miss your question
 about videos.&nbsp; You may want to start a new post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Will these video files play on another machine successfully?&nbsp; If not the files may be corrupt and require downloading again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What program do you use to play video files.&nbsp; What is the file extension of the failing videos?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It may be necessary to uncheck "Hide known file types" in Control Panel/ File Explorer Options/ View, to&nbsp;see the&nbsp;file extensions.</p>

<h3> larry 246  say:</h3>
<h2>            is it possible to rip a cd without the track number becoming the beginning of the file name&#63;</h2>
                    Every time I rip a cd the files for each song begin with the track number.&nbsp; This makes it cumbersome when I am looking in the entire library to remove duplicate music.&nbsp; I might have the song in 4 different folders each file not being identified in alphabetical
 order because each one might begin with a different number.&nbsp; To remedy this I remame each file-deleting the number, but this is tedious.&nbsp; I would like the ripped file to exclude the track number or find a way to remove the number in mass.

    <title>Taskbar graphic bug right click menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> martinljunggren  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar graphic bug right click menu</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10, but I could not stand it so I re-installed my Windows 8.1 via the recovery USB I made before upgrading to Windows 10. All the Lenovo apps and bloatware came back, so I know it was correct... But, now I have a very annoying bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right-click a app/program or folder in the taskbar the menu is coloured in a dark color instead of gray, also look at the pin. The Graphics are way out of where they should be. If I right-click the Desktop, Start Screen&nbsp;or Taskbar or any file/folder
 anywhere&nbsp;else&nbsp;the correct menu pops up imidiatly. It is only here occuring only on files pinned to the taskbar. New pinned from Start, re-pinned... Everything pinned. The Menu still works, but it does not look good. Can I re-install just the taskbar, or kill
 it in some way? Reboot does not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo B50-30 AIO with a Intel HD 4400 Graphics card and a Nvidia GeForece 820A (and DX11). Both cards were first on the original Lenovo driver when I saw this bug, so I updated them, but the bug is still there. Except for Win 10 I have no more
 updates in Windows Update. I have never seen this before. The computer is 4 months old.</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindest regards</p>

<h2>            How far is too far&#63; Dealing with gta stalkers</h2>
                    I have had multiple contact from female xbox gamers all complaining about another gamer called
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>, he has basically stalked them for months, hounded them for nude pictures, became aggressive when they rejected his advances, since then he has found&nbsp; them and contacted them on social media becoming aggressive and created other
 gamer tags to follow in mutiplayer games,&nbsp; he has been blocked and reported repeatedly to xbox and rockstar and has gotten to the point where he is being reported daily for griefing, his behaviour and stalking, even contacting xbox and rockstar directly, yet
 nothing seems to happen, some of his "victims" have gotten to the point where they dont feel&nbsp; safe on xbox and have come off it completely others they still play but always looking over their shoulder so to speak, it has affected their confidence and has affected
 them off xbox too, how far is too far? before something is done about gamers who treat fellow gamers in particular female&nbsp; gamers like this, when will something be done? As they feel let down by xbox and rockstar.

<p>Best thing to do is avoid giving them any attention or reaction. &nbsp;Its easier said than done for sure but a reaction is exactly what they’re after. &nbsp;Report and block them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Avoid things like </p>
<p>“I’m reporting this”</p>
<p>”leave me alone”</p>
<p>trying to reason with them</p>
<p>giving them anything to fuel&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just report and block. &nbsp;Eventually theyll get tired of creating account after account for you to not even acknowledge them. &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums. Unfortunately there isn't much that Xbox and Rockstar can do besides banning/suspending the accounts this person is using to harass other's but as you've stated, this person keeps making other accounts continuing
 the harassment. At&nbsp;this point&nbsp;that is criminal harassment that will need to be handled by law enforcement officials and they will need to launch an investigation to put a stop to this person because they will continue to make new accounts unless stopped by
 the law. Clearly there is enough people being harassed where this can be reported to law enforcement and a formal investigation can begin on this person. For this reason we removed the user's gamertag since the forums is not a place to handle these situations.</p>

    <title>Xbox Live message harassment&#47;death threats - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chemicalflower9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Live message harassment&#47;death threats</h2>
                    
<p>On behalf of my husband (gamer tag: <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>) I am filing a complaint related to harassment/death threats via Xbox Live messages. First off, we have both contacted Xbox Live support through the 1-800 number and tried multiple times
 to file this complaint through&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> profile but due to technical difficulties with the webpage, we were not successful to do so. After logging into the website with&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> info, and clicking Xbox Forums tab,
 we repeatedly received a message stating, "Ooops! What happened to this page? We've moved some things around...etc" We tried accessing it through different web browsers and even tried using the consoles internet app but we still received the same message.
 Since the webpage is cooperating with my log-in information, we are filing it through this user profile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The harassment started approximately 1 month ago from different users. Gamer tags:&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> (same user, different accounts),&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> (same user, different accounts),
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. The gamer tags I have listed have repeatedly contacted&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> through Xbox Live messages, social media messages, phone, etc.&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> has taken all routes to block their gamer tags
 on Xbox, blocked communication, filed complaints for harassment, and have replied to some messages stating to 'please stop harassing me or I will file a complaint with the local PD'. Even though they are blocked on Xbox, they are still able to look up his
 gamer tag info through mutual friends, still able to join session in progress, and still able to verbally harass in pre-game lobbies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the multiple harassment/death threat messages he has received via Xbox Live messaging states, "You're better off dead so kill yourself before we have to do it." Due to profanity in the messages, that was the general idea of the message... stating
 he should commit suicide because he is better off. Those gamers have also been making provocative and negative gamer cards about&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> and me (ChemicalFlower9)... as in sexually explicit and sexually harassing. Upon receiving these
 types of messages,&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> has been deleting them and ignoring it but it is a constant, everyday occurrence and me and my husband should not have to log on to our Xbox Live accounts and encounter this type of harassment everyday. It
 has gotten personal and we are fling this complaint so something will be done about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have been in contact with support from Xbox for over an hour and we were informed that we had the option to change our account names but we, as a consumer, should not have to spend more money to change our accounts and lose all achievements for the games
 we play due to these users being able to harass us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for reviewing our complaint and we hope to hear a solution for this problem we are encountering.</p>

<p>Reporting on your console is the only course of action.</p>
<p>No one from microsoft will read your complaint here.</p>

<p>What Owenkiller said, if they made death threats call the police. Otherwise, just keep blocking each GT that does this and reporting them via the console.</p>

<p>[quote user="ChemicalFlower9"] I am filing a complaint related to harassment/death threats via Xbox Live messages.
<span>&nbsp;First off, we have both contacted Xbox Live support through the 1-800 number and tried multiple times to file this complaint through VP Phoenix86's profile but due to technical difficulties with the webpage, we were not successful to do so.</span>[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You can only file a complaint through the console (which you have already done). &nbsp;The website (including these forums) has no option complain about other users. &nbsp;Xbox support does not process complains on other users, so calling
 them isn't going to help at all.</span></p>
<p>[quote]The gamer tags I have listed have repeatedly contacted VP Phoenix86 through Xbox Live messages, social media messages, phone, etc. [/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Your husband should report them and block them to any social media site he is being contacted on. &nbsp;He should also report the offending phone number to the phone company.</span></p>
<p>[quote]VP Phoenix86 has taken all routes to block their gamer tags on Xbox, blocked communication, filed complaints for harassment, and have replied to some messages stating to 'please stop harassing me or I will file a complaint with the local PD'. Even

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">There are a few things I should address here.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">When you file a complaint, that complaint needs to investigated by Xbox staff, so it may take an amount of time for anything to happen to them. &nbsp; There are things your husband can do for a more immediate result, which he has
 (somewhat) done.</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Blocking communications is the correct thing to do here, but your husband made a very wrong move when he messaged them telling them to stop. &nbsp;This is the wrong thing to do for a couple of reasons. &nbsp;Firstly, he is validating their
 harassment by responding to it. &nbsp;The harassers know they are pressing his buttons, and because they know this, they will continue. &nbsp;Second, and much more importantly, when you send any message to a person you have blocked, you will unblock them. &nbsp;You have
 re-opened all lines of communication with the harasser, and you're cancelling the block. &nbsp;Again, NEVER contact these people.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">There are some other things he can do such as mute the person. &nbsp;Avoid them. &nbsp;Setting his friendslist to private. &nbsp;Keeping communication to friends only. &nbsp;Stuff like that.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">If you feel this harassment is serious (which it seems it is), don't threaten to contact local PD. &nbsp;Actually contact them. &nbsp;Making threats on your life or your husband's life is a serious matter, and will be treated as such.</span>
</li></ul>
<p>[quote]We have been in contact with support from Xbox for over an hour and we were informed that we had the option to change our account names but we, as a consumer, should not have to spend more money to change our accounts and lose all achievements for

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Again. &nbsp;Don't bother with Xbox Support. &nbsp;They simply do not have the resources to process complaints. &nbsp;Only the "Enforcement Team" can do that, and they can only be reached through the player feedback (file complaint) system on
 the Xbox console. &nbsp;Also, suggesting that you change the gamertag name is terrible advice. &nbsp;Your husband will still show in the recent player list of anyone he played, but under the new name.</span></p>
<p>[quote]Thank you for reviewing our complaint and we hope to hear a solution for this problem we are encountering.[/quote]</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Unfortunately, no one here can review your complaint. &nbsp;This is a community discussion forum, meaning that everyone here are simply regular users such as yourself. &nbsp;It is extremely unlikely a representative of Xbox will even see
 this thread, let alone act upon it.</span></p>

 and then press ENTER.<br />
<br />
Also I have tried method 2, also remain unchanged;<br />
</span>
<p><span><span>Check permissions within the Installer folder. To do this, follow these steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click on Start and in the Start Search bar &gt; type in &gt; c: /windows/installer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Right click on c: /windows/installer at the top under programs and click properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click on the security tab &gt; Verify if System and Administrator account has Full access permissions.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Everyone account should have read and execute permissions, List Folder Contents, and Read.<br />
<br />

<p>Try these steps, specifically, and please let us know whether the Auto-Hide option remains enabled.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; <strong>Right click</strong> the <strong>Taskbar</strong>, choose <strong>
Properties</strong>, and enable the <strong>Auto-hide the taskbar</strong> option (i.e., put a checkmark in the box).<br />
2.&nbsp; Log off (note, specifically do NOT shut down here, but just log off).<br />
3.&nbsp; Log back on.<br />
4.&nbsp; <strong>Right click</strong> the <strong>Taskbar</strong>, choose <strong>Properties.&nbsp;</strong>Is the
<strong>Auto-hide the taskbar</strong> option still set?</p>
<p>The various applications that show up in the System Tray (and in the hidden portion of same) can cause the Taskbar to unhide, even when the Auto-hide option is enabled.&nbsp; If you are seeing the Taskbar come out and stay out even when the Auto-hide the taskbar
 option is checked, then it is likely one of these tray apps is doing it.&nbsp; Before&nbsp;Windows 7, the way to notify the user of a problem or important message was to unhide the Taskbar and display that message.&nbsp; Now, with&nbsp;the try apps hidden,&nbsp;one of them may be
 trying to do this but you are not seeing it.&nbsp; To overcome this, click each one of them and check their individual settings.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            <p><span>Hi d.w.wilson,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting in the Microsoft Communities. From the problem description I understand that you are not able to open .MPEG
 or .JPG file in Pictureit. Provide the following information for the better understanding of the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Has it ever worked?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This behavior can occur if the JPEG graphics filter is missing or damaged, or if the registry entries for the JPEG graphics
 filter are missing or damaged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To resolve this issue, remove Picture It! Express, rename the JPEG graphics filter, remove the JPEG graphics filter registry
 entries, and then reinstall Picture It! Express. Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span></span></span><span>Rename all of the
<b>Jpegim32.flt</b> files to <b>Jpegim32.old</b>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>g)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Use Registry Editor to remove the JPEG value from the following registry keys:<br />

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> This section, method,
 or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you
 modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following link.

                    <p>In games like Forza Horizon, I get 5.1 audio just fine. But in all other instances of audio output, I only get stereo? BlueRay is only stereo, apps like Grove and Spotify are only stereo. YouTube Dolby 5.1 Test is only stereo. I use an Optical cable to plug the output of the Xbox One to my Samsung Home Cinema 5.1 system.

    <title>Surface Book Headphone jack issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Headphone jack issue</h2>
                    <p><span>Problem: When headphones are connected to the headphone jack, the internal speakers continue to play.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Under the “Playback” tab of the “Sound” control, the headphones or the internal speakers are listed as the default device (with a green check mark) depending on whether the headphones are plugged in or not.&nbsp;
 Plugging and unplugging the headphones switches the default device and the “sound level meter” on the far right indicates sound is playing for the current default device.&nbsp; However, the audio only comes out of the internal speakers, regardless of whether the
 headphones are plugged in or not.&nbsp; Disabling the internal speakers will force audio to play through the headphones.&nbsp; Disabling the internal speakers is not a solution for switching the audio output device.&nbsp; Is there a solution for fixing this so the audio
 plays from the headphones when they are plugged in and out of the internal speakers when the headphones are unplugged?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Greg,
<br />Try going into device manager and uninstalling (but don't delete) the Realtek Audio driver. Then restart. This will reload the driver. See if this makes any difference.

<h2>            Crash while inserting or removing USB Thumb Drive</h2>
                    I have had this problem regularly for months now. I difficulty is that windows does not recognize the crash, so I have little in the way of Problem Reports or information on the Reliabilty Monitor. Here is the run down.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It only seems to happen when the computer has been one for a while and has hibernated. It is a laptop, so it hibernates all the time. &nbsp;I am running Vista 64 bit with 4 GB of Ram. &nbsp;It is a HP tablet PC.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it happens when the USB drive is inserted, the computer thinks for a moment, no windows associate with the drive show up, and then the mouse freezes. If I try Ctrl-Alt-Del a thinking circle shows up on the mouse, and then the keyboard is unresponsive
 too. &nbsp;Ctrl-Alt-Del is the only response I can get out of the keyboard. I then use the power button to restart/shutdown the computer. Windows simply records it as an improper shut down on the Reliability Monitor.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If it happens whe the USB drive is removed, it is after I have excuted "remove drive safely" on the toolbar. Otherwise it is an identical result to the one listed above.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The most recent instance I received an error message right before the interface froze. It said that the Microsoft Sync Center had stopped working. I had not been using the sync center, and did not know it existed. I have tried to search the internet about
 this problem and have had no luck. &nbsp;One of the steps I took was to turn of the automatic check for rediboost. I have tested rediboost in the past with a friend's drive, but I have not used it since. &nbsp;It has happened for three different brands and sizes of
 USB Thumb Drives.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a few regularly occuring errors in the Problem Reports that may or may not be related. There are none listed that consistantly occur on the same date as the improper shut downs listed in the reliability monitor</div>

                </div>
