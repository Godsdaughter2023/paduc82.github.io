<h2>            Do you need to enter the product key again after you reset&#47;refresh your pc&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, I was wondering whether you have to re-enter the windows 8 product key&nbsp;after you reset or refresh the operating system

            <p>For both the refresh and reset scenarios, <strong>if no activation store or activation status information is available, or if the activation store is unreadable, the activation status will not be preserved</strong>. The user will have to activate again once
 the operation completes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I would say it depends on how much Windows 8 has been corrupted which force you to use either Refresh or Reset in the 1st place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I get a chance I'll try Refresh and see what happens as I have an Image Back and even if Refresh does ask me to activate I'll just restore the image.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.

 call the support in my Country (Indonesia), but they say Digital License need to be installed on the same laptop, I cannot use my digital license on my new laptop. I thought I had the "Stand-alone software" but it seems not. I'm confused. Please advice??</p>

            <p>According to the WhatsApp FAQ pages, you can send a video if it is under 16 MB. From Movie Maker, you probably want to pick the "For email" format when saving your movie. That will reduce the resolution and bitrate of your video to hopefully make it smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either of the two supported video formats (.mp4 or .wmv) should work, but for best results, you probably want to stick with the default of .mp4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you CANNOT just send a project file (.wlmp). That's only a text file containing the editing state of your project. It has no photos, videos or music within it and wouldn't be usable by anyone else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, another option is to always upload your video to a video sharing site or a cloud storage account and share the *link* to the video that way. That should get around the issue of small attachments via email or WhatsApp.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior the issue?</p>
<p>Follow the steps provided below and check if that helps.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to unplug or disconnect all the external devices and check if the issue persists.
</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> You can find the ‘<b>explorer.exe’
</b>process in the processes tab and not in the application tab. If you’re unable to find explorer.exe then you may start the process manually by following the steps provided below.</p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press CTRL+ALT+DELETE, and then click Task Manager.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Look for explorer.exe in the "Image Name" column and if you do not find it then start it manually.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click File from the menu.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click New Task (Run...).</p>
<p>
<span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Type explorer in the Open field.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click OK. Windows Explorer shell will restart.</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b><span> Try to boot into safe mode and check if you get the same pop-up message.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in safe mode then restart the computer in clean boot to check if any third party program is causing the issue. To configure your
 computer to clean boot follow the link given below.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow step 7 in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> Restart the computer in low resolution mode, refer the link provided below for more information.</span></p>

    <title>Language Hotkeys removed by itself &#40;Windows 10&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sarmadys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language Hotkeys removed by itself &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>This problem used to happen in previous versions of Windows and users had found workarounds for it (http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-desktop/custom-hotkeys-to-change-input-language-disappear/66d1d89d-e5dc-41e1-a8b3-48d596ab8e11).
 However those soloutions do not work for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 3 keyboards and I have defined Ctrl+1, Ctrl+2 and Ctrl+3 hotkeys for them. The problem is that either all of the hotkeys or the first one is removed regularly (when windows goes to sleep or lock screen all the hot-keys are removed).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This makes me crazy when I am in hurry to get something done (and the problem kicks in).
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please do not suggest blind generic (mostly nonsense) solutions like running sfc etc. I have done most of them without luck.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, I understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue that you are facing can be due to various reasons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To narrow down the issue, I would like to suggest that re assign the hotkeys for the languages and check if the issue re appears. Also I would suggest that you log into the computer from another User Account and check if the same issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Arul, thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried different hotkeys (Ctrl+1 ... Ctrl+3), (Ctrl+Shift+1 ... Ctrl+Shift+3) and (Alt+Shift+1 ... Alt+Shift+3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of them get removed as soon as the windows goes to sleep (automatically or manually) or even locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw. sfc/scannow shows finds no error and my windows is build 10586.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>I finally found the solution and I am posting, in case someone else has the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- Define your hot-keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- Search and find the "region" settings palette and go to administrative tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f5195a9-973a-4928-9c70-fe570c557b01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9f5195a9-973a-4928-9c70-fe570c557b01" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now go to "Copy Settings" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e00afb36-401e-4d29-8717-cc8d81744b4a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e00afb36-401e-4d29-8717-cc8d81744b4a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Select both tick boxes below the window and press ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case this applied the settings in a way that they are no more removed.</p>

<p>Moin,<br />
da ich leider keinen anderen Weg finde einfach mal hier der Post.&nbsp;<br />
Mein Headset der One ist leider seid 2 Tagen kaputt. Kabelbruch im unterem Segment beim Anschluss .<br />
Wo und wie kann ich das nun reklamieren...ich denke ja mal es ist ein Garantiefall da es im Paket ja inbegriffen war.&nbsp;<br />
Ein neues hoffentlich länger funktionierendes wäre ganz schön..immerhin hat das gerät mich 500€ gekostet und ist noch nicht so alt...&nbsp;<br />
LG</p>
<p>[Translation: <br />
Moin,<br />
because unfortunately no other way I find easy to time the post here.<br />
My headset of the one is unfortunately 2 days are broken. Cable break in the lower segment for the connection.<br />
Where and how can I now reklamieren...ich think even it is covered by the warranty because it was so included in the package.<br />
A new hopefully longer working would be very nice...After all, that has me € 500 cost and is Not yet so old...<br />

            <p>I'm having the same problem - upgraded to Windows 10, experienced the same problems mentioned above, then went back to Windows 8.1 - which worked perfectly before - but the problems from Windows 10 are now also in Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I can't save my files, everything
 is 'read-only'' and no matter how many times I do all the changes indicated in various websites, it keeps changing back. How am I going to do my work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will it help if I uninstall Windows 8.1 and reinstall, do you think?</p>

    <title>Bluetooth driver gone from device manager - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jayboxone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth driver gone from device manager</h2>
                    The bluetooth driver on my Acer Aspire VN7-592G suddenly stopped working today. The icon has disappeared from my action center tray, and it only appears on my device manager if I reveal hidden devices. I've updated the driver from the Acer website, and
 I've tried to restart and automate the Bluetooth Support Service without any changes. I have not had any recent updates to Windows 10 nor have I downloaded any new programs recently. Any help would be appreciated!

            I've tried updating the driver multiple times per the recommendation above w/o any luck. After reading a lot of different solutions online, I found someone who had made some adjustments in BIOS so I thought I'd give it a try. I booted into BIOS, and I
 looked around at the settings w/o changing anything. However, when it booted to Windows, the Bluetooth was back. I have no idea why.

</p><p>Thank you for this, the last time I had this on my Acer Predator I never bothered fixing it and eventually after a Windows 10 reinstall it worked again, but this time it was really starting to annoy me. And mysteriously, just going into the bios (I did exit
 with saving changes, although I didn't make any) brought the bluetooth back. Especially funny since there is absolutely nothing in the bios aside from boot order and some security settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway thanks for being the only answer that actually helped!&nbsp;</p>

                    Hello out there!-My netbook computer is a Toshiba NB305-N442BL-The program I want to load and run is: "Instant Immersion, Spanish" By Topics. As stated in the title the&nbsp;computer's max res is 1024X600. Program reqiures 1024x768-Is there no way to work around
 this issue? I right clicked on the program icon (the program sucessfully downloded from the disc&nbsp;at least enough to show up as an openable program) and then clicked "trobleshoot conflicts"-which gave me initial hope but ultimately gave me this forum as an
 option for further info. I have a tower onto which I can load the most demanding software but I then loose the portabiity. Any suggestions????

<h2>            Windows Defender blocks network connectivity&#58; How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 computers (notebook and desktop) both running the most recent versions of W10. My notebook is about 5 years old so perhaps the ethernet card is a bit outdated, but it has the latest drivers: I always used a workgroup exclusively but in trying to
 fix the following problem, I also set up a homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My notebook can always see the desktop anb access the shared files. But my desktop can only "see" the notebook but cannot access the shared files UNTIL I TURN WINDOWS DEFENDER FIREWALL OFF on the notebook. Obviously, the Firewall is blocking access. How
 can I get Defender to allow my desktop access? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Hi Pradhan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows Defender is blocking access to a particular file or folder, it may have detected the file or folder as malicious. You can stop Windows Defender Antivirus from alerting you or blocking the program by adding the file to the exclusions list. To do
 this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Windows Defender Security Center</strong>, and then select <strong>
V</strong><strong>irus &amp; threat protection&gt;Virus &amp; threat protection settings &gt; Add or remove exclusions.&nbsp;
</strong></li><li>Under <strong>Add an exclusion,</strong> select the files, folders, file types, or process. The exclusion will apply to sub-folders within a folder as well.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For any results, let us know. </p>
<p>

<p>Perhaps I was not clear, so please allow me to clarify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Firewall ON on Notebook side:</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the notebook's perspective:</p>
<p>When I select Network, it sees the Desktop and can access its files per sharing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Desktop's perspective:</p>
<p>When I select Network, it sees the Notebook, but when I double-click it, the desktop first gets this popup</p>
<p>Windows cannot access Notebook&gt;&gt; Diagnose</p>
<p>
</p><p>which eventually leads to&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows cannot communicate with the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I then turn Notebook Firewall OFF. With Firewall OFF on Notebook side:</p>
<p>No problem at all. All shared folders are seen both directions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So clearly, the Notebook firewall is blocking the entire network traffic from the Desktop. It is NOT a matter of one particular folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to exclude the entire computer so the notebook does not block it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I am clearer, thanks again...</p>

<p>Update,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been playing with this for hours, trying this and that. It seems obvious that the problem rests with Defender. As a test, I disabled it and downloaded/installed ZoneAlarm Firewall. Problem disappeared instantly. So its all solved.</p>

<h2>            Black Ops III disc installation problem on Xbox 360 S with 4 GB memory</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I know nothing about these game consoles, so patience, please.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My young nephew purchased BO III a few days ago from Game Stop and we also got a 32GB flash drive. He has, as best I can tell from the images, an Xbox 360 S console with 4GB of memory--console is two or three years old this Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; He has been unable to install (complete installation?) of BOIII. He has left it on overnight and it does not complete installation. Any idea why? What determines how fast an installation is?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I stopped by the Game Stop store this morning, but the young guy there knew nothing and opined that some discs will not install on a flash drive. As an example, he mentioned GTA, but my nephew has successfully installed that (GTA 5) on a flash drive,
 so I don't think that is the reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Would it be possible to put the disc in a pc (Dell, Windows 10) and install it on the 32GB flash drive and then once that is done, go back to the console and put the disk in the tray and the flash drive in the USB port and then be able to play?
</p>
<p>&nbsp; His sister purchased Black Ops Ghosts and that too did not install, but Black Ops II did. He also has Black Ops Call of Duty which works fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Thank you for any advice or suggestions you can provide.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sam</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>It is not possible to use a PC, or anything other than an Xbox 360 to read those discs. If you get an error message saying the disc is dirty or unreadable, then make sure that there is no damage to the disc and that it's clean. Also, make sure your storage
 devices have sufficient space on them. I would avoid using USB flash drives, as they perform poorly, and don't last very long. I recommend buying an external USB HDD (Avoid the Seagate or PNY brands, they're trash). If when starting the installation the screen
 just says "Installing" and it sits there, make sure that the center of the disc, with the Xbox Holograms in the middle, is clean.</p>
<p>Wipe your discs with a lint free cloth (If you don't have those, use a coffee filter). Go from the center ring, out, in a straight line. _Never_ use circular motions as this can damage and/or scratch the disc. Do not use any cleaners or alcohol on the discs.</p>
<p>If you could provide some more information as to what exactly the console says or does, that will shed some light. Keep in mind though, that installed games cannot be moved between devices, and once installed, would need to be reinstalled if you use a different
 storage device.</p>

<p>Thank you for the quick response. Will double check his console model and ask him to install it again so I can see what happens (if anything) this afternoon when I go over there after he gets home from school.</p>
<p>As for an external HDD, had thought of that, but wondered if it had to be a special HDD in order to work with a game console. I prefer WD/WesternDigital myself, having had trouble before with Seagate. From what you've written, however, I can just go out
 and buy "any ol' " WD HDD then? One of the slim MyPassport ones should be ok then.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your reply. Will no doubt write again this evening when I get home from my nephew's. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Certain games require an "Official" Xbox hard drive in order to play them. &nbsp;The USB thumb drives wouldn't count for that.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that is the issue you're coming across, but I remember hearing people mention that issue in the past.</p>

<p>I haven't heard of any games that check whether or not your drive is real or not.. The only reason that Original Xbox games don't work is because some of the time the counterfeit manufacturers don't bother putting on the emulation profile partition. There's
 no real way of checking whether or not it's real, or fake, from a console's perspective. Aside from the partition, fake drives are also of very low quality, and fail relatively quickly. Because they're cheap trash.</p>
<p>I doubt you have a fake drive, so what errors/what does the console do when you say it doesn't install? Does it throw an error out at you? Does it lock up?</p>
<p>Western Digital is an excellent choice (WD unite!), but make sure that the size does not exceed 2 TB, because then your Xbox will freak out and not detect the drive. Also, make sure that you format the drive using the Xbox once you do buy it and not a PC.
 (Cluster size is apparently a huge deal for the 360, and Windows has a tendency to use "default", which can cause the Xbox 360 to not even detect the drive after that). If you already have a drive, then just pop it into the 360 and see if it's detected. It'll
 take a while for the 360 to "mount" the drive, about 5-15 seconds depending on your drive size. If your drive has an indicator light on it, those are helpful too in determining whether or not it's just chilling there or if your 360 is actually attempting to
 read the drive.</p>

<p>I know there's games that need an HDD to play--I never said that I didn't know of games that didn't. I was just saying games have no way of checking whether or not your HDD is a genuine drive or not. That being said, BOII is not one of those games.</p>

<p>^^ &nbsp;This is getting off-topic now, but yes, games DO know if you have a legit HDD or not. &nbsp;This is why you read posts on here of people who say they are getting an error when trying to play OG Xbox games in their 360. &nbsp;They say they bought a HDD for cheap
 on eBay, it says it's an Official Xbox HDD, but in all actuality, it isn't. &nbsp;The Official MS HDD's have data preloaded onto them in order to handle certain functions.</p>

<p>This isn't getting off topic. It should make no difference for OP, whether or not his drives are genuine or not.</p>
<p>The Xbox 360 HDD is a regular 2.5 inch HDD. There's nothing special about it--aside from the HDD running custom firmware, and a special proprietary file system that only the Xbox 360 can recognize. It has some security sectors, along with two partitions.
 One is for backward compatibility emulation profiles, its associated information, and the other is for 360 related save files, videos, dashboard data, and so on. If your drive is recognized by the 360, it has the 360 partition on it. Hence, all 360 games will
 recognize it as a 360 drive. The reason that B/C titles don't work is because a lot of these fake drives do not have the first partition on it, which is why when booting up your game, it fails. The other issue with fake drives is their build quality. Drives
 are mechanical. They're going to fail. Fake drives don't pass QA, are cheaply built, and fail within a few months of purchase at best. There is no technical way, at least on an Xbox 360, to check whether or not drives are genuine or not. If that was possible,
 you can rest assured that Microsoft would update the dashboard to reject any fake drives. Unfortunately, this is just not an option.</p>
<p>This game, as far as I can find, doesn't require any HDD to play. However, OP can check this by looking on the back game cover. If it says "Hard Drive Required" near the bottom, on the back, where it tells you how much storage you'll need for a save file,
 how many players the game supports and so on, then you don't need an HDD. Considering he said installation fails, there must be another issue preventing it from completing. Games that require HDDs refuse to accept anything other than an HDD anyway.</p>

<p>Make sure that PC is clean(free from zero access rootkit before trying this fixes)</p>
<p><br />
This firewall issue is commonly found on vista and windows 7 (<strong>64 BIT OS</strong>)</p>
This is symptom for rootkit on 64 bit systems<br />
<br />
<p>if you find a folder called system64</p>
<p>C:/WINDOWS/<strong>SYSTEM64</strong>(not the sysWOW64)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and a file called <strong>consrv.dll</strong></p>
<p>C:/WINDOWS/SYSTEM32/CONSRV.DLL</p>
<p>You're infected by zero access rootkit.It is recommended to contact malware removal forums to remove it first and try the fix</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Download both the registry files<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’ve seen this issue on several different fronts, and the majority of those were virus related. The Key to resolving this is to first run a virus scanner to remove the infection. Some viruses such as rootkit viruses are a little more difficult to remove
 but it can be done. The viruses can leave residuals that can still cause issues, things like the inability to turn on or configure the firewall or other security applications. Once the virus is gone, work to resolve the other issues that they caused.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First thing, Scan for viruses and other malware. If you don’t currently have a virus application, try Microsoft Security Essentials here. There is also a new tool, Windows Defender Offline Beta , you download the tool, burn a CD and then boot from that CD,

<h2>            Wifi not working on holiday</h2>
                    <p>I originally connected to the wifi fine on my first day and yesterday it said the wifi was unable to be connected saying,<br />
"some information changed since the last time you have connected. We need more information."</p>
<p>I have put the security key in again and it didn't work.</p>
<p>I've done a troubleshoot and it says the wireless security types do not match so I've tried to change it but there is nothing to change it too. Im at a loss at what to do, any help would be great,</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Controller Driver for wIndows 7 x64 is corrupt and digital signature expired January 2010, file is corrupted and will not install</h2>
                    
<p><span>I am trying to download the xbox 360 controller driver for windows 7 x64 pc from<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/4/69446ACF-E625-4CCF-8F56-58B589934CD3/Xbox360_64Eng.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/9/4/69446ACF-E625-4CCF-8F56-58B589934CD3/Xbox360_64Eng.exe</a>

<div><span><span>The digital signature on the file expired on january 2010 so that could be part of the problem</span></span></div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver corruptions, overheating, and software conflicts are the possible reasons why your device is freezing. We'd like to know if you've made any changes prior to the issue. For us to isolate your issue, we suggest booting your computer in safe mode. In
 this way, we're able to check if the defaults settings and device drivers are causing the issue. To do so, refer to this article:
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start your PC in safe mode in Windows 10.</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, we also recommend disabling unnecessary startup programs. This will prevent apps from running when you start your device. To do so, refer to these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Ctrl </strong>+ <strong>Shift </strong>+ <strong>Esc </strong>keys&nbsp;keys on your keyboard at the same time to launch
<strong>Task Manager</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>More details</strong>, then go to the <strong>Startup </strong>
tab.</li><li>You can disable the program that you want by right-clicking on it, then select
<strong>Disable</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer to apply the changes.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You can also check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-sg/help/4002019/windows-10-improve-pc-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the steps on how to improve your computer's performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to us with the result.</p>

this is not it. the computer runs fine for everything else including games and other things... but it is just the internet videos. not the music or anything else. all of the codecs and add-ons are up to date, and the videos were working a few weeks ago. i have

<p>==========================================<br />
I think overheating is still a possibility (dust buildup inside the case <br />
can csuse this) but maybe you could check the support site of your <br />
computer's manufacturer and see if there are any diagnostic utilities <br />
you could run.</p>

<p>ok.... im still having the same issue, but let me update on what i have done recently... &nbsp;i have removed the thermal&nbsp;heat sync, and cleaned the old thermal off of it and the processor and replaced it with arctic silver and put the sync back on. the pc has
 been completely blown out of ANY dust that has been in there, and also i have added a few more fans. it has plenty of air flow, as well as it is staying cool. i shut the pc down at night so it cant overheat when i go to use it the next day.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi datasdevil,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>What is the make and model of the card reader?<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Error code 43 denotes that o</span><span>ne of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system
 that the device failed in some manner.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may check if the card reader is getting detected any other computer or USB port.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect the drive. You may disconnect all USB devices and
 then perform the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong>Start</strong>,
 and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click<strong>System
 and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System</strong>, and then click<strong>Device Manager</strong>.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click<strong>System</strong>, and
 then click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong>Allow</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Repeat
 the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers. Refer to the below link for assistance–</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>I would also suggest you to download and install the latest drivers for the USB from the system manufacturer website
 and check if you are able to resolve the issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />
Thanks, <br />
