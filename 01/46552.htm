<h2>            Restrict DOWNLOADING apps from the app store &#40;not USING apps&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I know how to restrict using installed apps through Family Safety.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be a way to Not Allow an app install from the app store without a Parent's approval (email and password).</p>
<p>If the child has a microsoft account, then he can download at will.</p>
<p>My child has a ms account, but I want to approve the apps he installs.</p>
<p>How is this done?</p>

<h2>            Folder images have changed to generic icons</h2>
                    Since downloading win 10 ver. 1709, the mini images on my folders have changed to generic icons. Clicking on properties and using customize Folder Pictures doesn't work and nor does Restore Default. I have rebuilt the icon cache but that didn't help.

<h2>            Message &#34;someone else is still using this PC&#34; when I try and shut down</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently been getting the following message when I try and shut down my Toshiba Laptop:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Someone else is still using this PC. If you shut down now, you could lose unsaved work"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been happening for the past few weeks. As such, I have not shut down my laptop and have just let it sleep. I'm worried about losing files and data (as I'm very amateurish with computers and don't know how to back-up).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that, when I go into task manager, I see a 'defaultuser 1 (11)' profile with the status 'Disconnected'. I have searched for people who have had the same or a similar message and someone mentioned that Avast antivirus could cause this problem - I
 have got Avast installed. The other suggestions for the problem I did not really understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please explain to me - in a step-by-step way - how I can solve the problem which is causing this error message?</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users to see if there are any other Accounts listed, back up any files from them  and delete them there if so.  
<br />
<br />Type netplwiz in Start Search, check also there to see if there are any other accounts to highlight and Remove.  
<br />
<br />No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners. 
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Your files should always be backed up because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.  <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/download/backup-and-sync/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.google.com/intl/en-GB_ALL/drive/dow...</a>
<br />
<br />Or you can manually drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />A better automated file backup to external disk is free Macrium which is the choice of the experts:
<br /><a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            That message means that you apparently have another Windows UserID open on your computer.
<br />
<br />Open the Start menu
<br />Look on the lower left side, at the top of the stack of icons starting from the bottom of the screen. The top icons of for logged in user ids. Hover the mouse over the top icon (your current userID)
<br />In the screen cap you can see that in addition to the current Userid Icon (white circle with red maple leaf) I have 3 more user IDs. And I am currently signed in to the "Admin2" ID.
<br />
<br />Look to see if you are signed in to another ID.
<br />
<br />If you are, click on that icon to switch to that ID.  Sign out of it, saving any open documents you need to.  Then you can sign back in to your main userid and exit without seeing that message.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a2a5fe63-4269-4293-ba4a-d9ebdb938f2b?upload=true" />

</p><p>It appears you have some program running which is causing this. Even an incomplete print job in the queue can cause this too.</p>

            What about in the other place I suggested to look?  I saw where you had checked in Task Manager, which is not where to check.  I gave you two places to check.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Well, that is kind of a trick question. Because you might notice an app running and suspect it is the cause. Or you might not know any of them. I will tell you that if you have other PC's on your network, this could be the problem such as example, someone
 on another PC is watching a shared video or has a shared app open on their PC. You could also have some malware. I do not know if you install free apps with malware or tool bars etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you log off, does it ever also tell you a program is trying to shut down, or just someone else is using the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also have something web related running that could cause this or browser addon. Most likely some form of malware. Also as mentioned, print queue has an unfinished print job. This unfinished print job could also only show on another PC on your Home
 Network, but not on yours. This is why you could be getting this message someone else is using this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use4 Microsoft Account to sign in, this could be a possible reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A connected cell phone to charge or transfer files could give this message. Another device connected to PC might cause this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete all temp internet files on all browsers. remove any toll bars or free software you installed. Look in programs and features installed programs list and look for things installed you did not install or are not aware of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do a complete disk clean up and also reboot your modem. Check all other PC's and devices that are or have been connected to network, such as their print queues to be empty. Run a full defender scan.</p>

            It sounds like you have Vista 64-bit. Go to Control Panel&gt;System and on the General tab you will see whether you are running a 32 or 64-bit operating system. If it says Microsoft Vista Home Premium [some Service Pack level] 64-bit operating system, then
 there's your answer. The program will not run on a 64-bit operating system. Find another program that will. If you

                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trouble with installing .NET Framework 4. I've tried to install it, but somewhere in half of installing it just hang and after approx 1 hour terminated with error. I found error code in installation log:
<span style="font-weight: bold">
0x80070643</span>&nbsp;and on the internet solution to this error, but only for "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">INSTALLMESSAGE_ERROR [The Windows Installer Service could not

            <p>Update: after installing windows updates (and it took approx 3 hours... ) and trying to install .NET Framework 4 it hanged at 0% and then showed up new error code (can't remember number, but i will add it during the day), but solution was to restart windows
 (or stop windows update services), because too many updates was running. After restarting windows I tried to install .NET Framework again, but this time I got almost to half of installation, then it hanged again and i had not so much power to wait next hour
 while it canceled and solve this witchy program/windows/laptop (i don't know, choose one of them...) as well...</p>

            <p>So, after this everything above, I downloaded optional updates (I marked every update, where was written .Net Framework 4.x). Then I had problem with Updates- it searched optional Updates, but when I clicked Install, it hangs at 0%. I downloaded "FixIt"
 (you can find original software at one of Microsoft pages), installed it and ran. Then I tried to install Updates again. It took 20 minutes till it moved from 0%, but then the installation was fast and successful. I restarted Windows and Updates was really
 successfully installed. I tried to install Daemon Tools (DT can be installed only on Windows with installed .net 4) and installation was successful.
</p>
So my solution to error <span style="font-weight: bold">

 take 4 hours.

<h2>            Installed Graphics card &#40;HD 5670&#41; and now comp is freezing.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so i'm in quite the little predicament. I recently tried to upgrade my computer so i could play Star Craft 2, but now it seems that my computer freezes whenever i play it. Maybe you can help.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I currently have an Acer computer that is about 2 and a half years old. I recently (4 days ago) did some upgrades to my computer so that i could play star craft 2 properly. I had an onboard graphics card and two sticks of 1 GB RAM, and upgraded to a Radeon
 HD 5670 graphics card and 2 sticks of 2 GB RAM. I would have put more on there, but i was told that a 32-bit Vista OS can't handle anymore than that. I would have just bought another computer or built a new one, but cash is tight.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to a local computer tech who seemed like a trusty guy and he charged me about 180 for the parts and installation. He installed the driver i needed for the graphics card and sent me on my way. I went to work, and after work excitedly hooked up my computer
 to play some SC2. When i hooked it up it seemed to be running smoothly at first. However, mid-game, about 2 minutes in it temporarily froze on me. Maybe for about 10-15 seconds. I patiently waited, and continued to play but it did it again a few minutes later.
 It was too late to call him so i continued on, and tried to play the game even if i had some minor freezing. However, the next time it froze, it did not unfreeze and stayed at a black screen. I shut off my computer and restarted it. It did it again (same order).
 I repeated this process and tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver. I tried one more time and got the same message.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this point, i was quite frustrated and was assuming that the graphics card he sold me (or the RAM) was insufficient and that i needed to have an aggressive talk with him. To cool off, i tried playing Age of Mythology (a game that worked fine before i
 upgraded). While playing this i started experiencing similar problems but also started going to a black screen and receiving a message that said "Input not Supported". When this would happen, i would try unplugging my monitor and replugging it in, but nothing
 would happen so i would have to restart my system. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Extremely frustrated at this point, i shut down the game, and decided that i would troubleshoot a little bit. It turns out that the HD5670 requires 400-500 W of power to run it properly. I checked my power supply and it only said 250. Knowing that there
 was nothing i could do, i waited till morning so that i could talk to this tech guy. When i called him he said he thought it was a 450 W and that he supposes we'd have to replace that too. So i told him to pick up the parts and i would pay for it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fast forward to earlier today. I go to his place, he installs the power supply, says i should be laughing, and i leave. I go to work, and when i get home i excitedly start up my computer again. Things run smoothly for a good 30 minutes. No problems, graphics
 are looking good, and i'm pleased. Experience the same problem in the same order. Now i'm really ticked off because i just spent another hundred dollars on a "Enermax: Tomohawk - ETK500AWT", or as he put it, "one of the best power cords you can find".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, it's too late to call and i'm **** out of luck. I try troubleshooting again, and discover the problem to the monitor. Apparently the "input not supported" message is called by a certain resolution? Not sure, but so far it's been fixed. However, as
 far as i know, i have a kick-**** video card, a lot of RAM, and a brand new competent power supply but with the same problem. I've tried restarting my computer multiple times, uninstalling the software and reinstalling it, and i've ran MalWareBytes about 4
 times. Nothing seems to be working. I've heard that Vista is a stank OS but i never experienced these problems before i upgraded. Quite frustrated, almost broke, and completely confused. I would greatly appreciate any help that you can give.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks a million, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>James </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, sometimes the freezing will happen outside of my game just on the desktop, and then a little error message will pop up saying "the driver has&nbsp;crashed, but recovered" or something to that extent. Is this possibly a part of the reason?</p>

            <p><span>Hi James,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Since you are experiencing these issues after installing a graphic card, the issue is related to graphic card\drivers and the error message regarding drivers also indicates the same.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>You can uninstall the drivers completely from the system and try reinstalling it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Uninstall drivers from Device manager.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start and type devmgmt.msc, and press Enter. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Expand Display adapters. Right click on the device and select Uninstall.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After uninstalling drivers from device manager you have to also uninstall the device drivers from programs and features so that it uninstalls the software completely from the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Step 2: Uninstall drivers form Programs and features.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click start</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Type appwiz.cpl in Start Search</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Search for the Display driver and uninstall the package.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try downloading the latest version of graphic card drivers from the manufacturer website and check.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.amd.com/us/psearch/Pages/psearch.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=2.4.1.3.43&amp;contentType=GPU+Download+Detail&amp;ostype=Windows+Vista+-+32-Bit+Edition&amp;keywords=&amp;items=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.amd.com/us/psearch/Pages/psearch.aspx?type=2.4.1&amp;product=2.4.1.3.43&amp;contentType=GPU+Download+Detail&amp;ostype=Windows+Vista+-+32-Bit+Edition&amp;keywords=&amp;items=20</span></span></a><span><span>

            <p>Thank you so much for all the help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As it turns out, uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers made no difference. I noticed that it may be an overheating issue so i put a fan facing my computer on high and it still made no difference. I'm guessing it's probably the motherboard, maybe? Not
 sure. I found out that my motherboard is an Aspire M1640. Is there often issues when the motherboards can't handle newer video cards?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regardless, i'm guessing i'm probably going to have to switch it eventually (unless it's some driver i haven't downloaded). I really appreciate the help though! Although it didn't fix the problem, it taught me a lot. So thanks again!</p>

<p>unable to start Windows XP with error screen advice to remove anti-virus, backing and defragmentation utilities.&nbsp; hardware checked 'pass'.&nbsp; don't have disk to boot, and want to save files data.<br />
</p>
<p>my laptop is a COMPAQ Presario V2000 (p/n PV898AV)&nbsp; &nbsp;with WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL product key: &lt;removed&gt;</p>
<p>Recently i used a lot of Yahoo Mmail and did an email with&nbsp;an attachment which carries a local&nbsp;.org&nbsp;Logo and my&nbsp;personal autobiography for a teaching program.&nbsp;&nbsp;WORD files might contain some political campaigns' materials and opinions which are public information
 from news and views.&nbsp; On 20.11.2011 when i turned on the computer, there was an immediate check by NT.F to run through and state&nbsp;about&nbsp;'a problem' with&nbsp;files and folders, and there was not enough&nbsp;'space' to correct the error.&nbsp; Afterwards, an error screen appeared
 alternately with the OS CHECK ORDER SCREEN.&nbsp; I tried&nbsp;F8,&nbsp;F10, F12 keys to do whatever needed. it kept going back to the 0S CHECK ORDER SCREEN.&nbsp; Safe mode...and the whole list&nbsp;was tried.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The error screen about Technical information ***stopped....some nos. i did not record&nbsp; (does it help if i state those numbers?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It said if power failure, restart it.&nbsp; if the screen kept appearing, it said:&nbsp;&nbsp; use CHKDSK /F to remove the anti-virus...backing..and defragmentation utilities.&nbsp; check hard drive configuration etc.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did use F12 setup Tools to do self-Test on Hard Drive,
 it said 'PASS'&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't have the setup floppy disk,&nbsp;or checkdisk with me on this travelling trip, it will be 5 months later to get there.&nbsp;&nbsp; still, i just bought this HP&nbsp;mini notebook and&nbsp;enjoy this great&nbsp;PC.&nbsp; however, i miss the old one and&nbsp;want to save those data.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>can i change the values on the SETUP facility to start the Windows?&nbsp;&nbsp; or, when i used the F10.., it runs the TPIP...open timeout (how do i use this one to help me remove the file/programs); safe mode with command prompt failed also.&nbsp;&nbsp; what command prompt?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please kindly advise how to start the WINDOWS XP again which said to protect my files (i hate the overprotection in this HKSAR area but too much hackers too, peoples are confusing like 'ell)&nbsp; THANK YOU.&nbsp;</p>

            You do not describe symptoms consistent with a need to use KB307545, but you can sure give that a try if you care to.&nbsp; I'd say it is not even a good guess.<br />
<br />
<p>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</p>
<p>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</p>
<p>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come with a store bought system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>When installing ImgBurn, DO NOT install the Ask toolbar.<br />
</p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt or read about the XP Recovery Console here:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/recovery_console_cmds.mspx?mfr=true</a></p>
<p>A good idea before starting things is to first verify the integrity of your file system using the chkdsk command.</p>
<p>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where Windows is installed to try to repair any&nbsp;problems on the afflicted drive.</p>
<p>Running chkdsk is fine even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;It will not hurt anything to run it.</p>
<p>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</p>
<p>chkdsk C: /r</p>
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</p>
<p>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</p>
<p>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will not be present.</p>

            <p>Hi Cann2011,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to arrange for an installation disc. Until and unless the disc not available we cannot go further to troubleshoot the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you arrange for the disc then you may refer the Microsoft Knowledge Base article and check.</p>

            <p>Hello Omkar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have Windows 7 Home Basic installed on all the computers connected to LAN?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, as you rightly mentioned, "Windows 7 Home Basic can join only but cannot create a&nbsp;homegroup". It needs a higher&nbsp;edition of Windows 7 like Home Premium, Ultimate or Professional to create a homegroup, and then Windows 7 Home Basic can join in.
 So, I would suggest you to once try sharing files using <em>Sharing Wizard</em> as detailed below.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open Windows Explorer on your taskbar.</li><li>In the new window, click on <strong>Organize</strong> and then click on <strong>
Folder and search options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>View</strong> tab.</li><li>Check mark the option <strong>Use Sharing Wizard (Recommended)</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ecddd85-1341-494a-8451-d1cc4a735870" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, follow the steps below to open Shared Folder Wizard.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Windows key + <strong>R</strong> to open the <strong>Run</strong> box.</li><li>Type <strong>shrpubw.exe</strong> and hit Enter.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong> on the welcome page.</li><li>You also can name (or rename) your PC. You should probably leave your computer
<br />
name as is, since changing this here could cause conflicts with your computer <br />
name as defined by the system. You will need to set up the folder to be shared <br />
by clicking the <strong>Browse </strong>button.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Name your share and click <strong>Next </strong>(You may also click on <strong>
Change </strong>to modify Offline settings).</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions to set up and customize the permissions and click
<strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Finish </strong>to complete setup.</li></ul>
<p>You should now have a shared folder ready for your other users to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Hope this information is helpful. If the issue still persists, please post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</em></p>

<h2>            Using a stylus on a touchscreen laptop</h2>
                    I bought a stylus (thats for all touchscreens) but it does not seem to work properly for example I can make a line with my finger but with the stylus it comes out like streaks little chunks of lines on my dell inspiron15 laptop. &nbsp;I tried to calibrate the
 pen in (pen and touch settings ) but it does not work.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model number of the Stylus?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you are not facing the issue while using the finger, there are chances that it might have occurred due to hardware. I would suggest you try using a different stylus or try the same stylus on a different computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The stylus is Artist hardware Sensu Capacitive brush and stylus. No I am not facing the issue with my finger. This is the second stylus I have tried. In order to get a straight line it requires a lot of pressure on the stylus and get draw easily and I
 cant calibrate it either.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, please help i have tried recalibrating the screen and updating the drivers but didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a griffin stylus, here is the product link ( http://www.amazon.com/Griffin-GC16040-Stylus-iPhone-Touchscreens/dp/B0041D0K1Q)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The strange thing i find is that if I use my finger the screen detects the touch but if you use a normal capacity stylus or even a metal tip which works on all smart phones, the screen is not detecting the touch, the tablet i am using is Razer Edge pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so i suspect that there is some thing else going on there like the scree is accepting touch only if there is a skin contact and rejects others like a metal tipped pen or a capacitive stylus, can you please let me know if there is any option or a regedit
 setting that can be changed to correct this, thanks</p>

            I also found one more thing, if I use a metal object say a spoon it works if place the curved bottom surface on the touch screen but not if o place the tip(this works on smartphones), so does windows detect touch if it has a bigger touch area, not sure
 if there is any registry setting to tweak that please let&nbsp; me knpw if such a setting is there i am a power user and know about playing with registry<br />

<h3> dgkus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Speech Recognition does not work</h2>
                    It seems that MS Speech Recognition has bugs in Windows 7. At different times, it has different problems like: Unable to configure a mic, unable to activate because "the language configuration is not supported." That seems to be the big problem. I tried
 to fix it with the online instructions, but could not find the fix the instruction said was there.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Scenario 1: Issue with MIC.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Before troubleshooting,</strong><br />
<br />
1. Make sure that the microphone is positioned close enough and that you're speaking directly into it.<br />
2. Make sure the microphone wires are intact and unbroken. Make sure the connections aren't loose and that they fit snugly into the computer.<br />
<br />
If the microphone input level is too low, make sure the microphone input level is set properly.<br />
To adjust the microphone input level<br />
<br />
1. Open Sound by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type sound, and then click Sound.
<br />
2. Click the Recording tab.<br />
3. Double-click the microphone that you use for Speech Recognition.<br />
4. Click the Levels tab, and then use the slider to set the input level for your microphone.<br />
<br />
Please make sure the Microphone properties are set properly and check if that fixes the issue.<br />
<br />
Refer the links below for details: <br />
<br />
<strong><span>Connect a microphone, music player, or other audio device to your computer</span></strong><strong><br />
</strong></span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Connect-a-microphone-music-player-or-other-audio-device-to-your-computer</span></a><strong><span>

<br />
<strong><span>Why doesn't the computer understand my spoken commands?</span></strong><br />

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Scenario 2:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you please answer these below questions?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>This issue can be caused by Speech Recognition settings.</strong>
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest performing the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Go to Control Panel -&gt;Speech Recognition</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Advance Speech options on the left panel.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Change the Language to another option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. Uncheck the "Review documents and mail to improve accuracy.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it does not work, change the Language back.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>If the issue persists, please update the sound card driver and BIOS to latest version.</strong><br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This error could occur due to Network Issues, Machine Configuration Issues or Software Configuration Issues. Below are checkpoints to consider in solving your issue:<br />
<br />
<strong><span>1. The mail server that you are attempting to send or receive data from may not be available.</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
If you have recently been able to send and receive email using Windows Live Mail, it is possible that your mail server is currently un-available.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
To determine whether your mail server is available:<br />
<br />
a. If your email provider provides a web based access to email attempt to login using the web based email.<br />
b. Review your mail provider’s web site for a status of their mail services. <br />
c. If you are unable to access your mail provider’s web based email or find a web site for server status please contact your provider to determine the status of their email servers.
<br />
<br />
<strong><span>2. DNS may have incorrect cached data.</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
It’s possible that an incorrect server address has been cached in DNS preventing access to the email servers. Complete the following steps to clear the DNS cache.<br />
<br />
Windows XP:<br />
<br />
a. Click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, click <strong><span>Run</span></strong>, type
<strong><span>cmd</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>OK.</span></strong>&nbsp;
<br />
b. From the command prompt, type the following and the press <strong><span>Enter</span></strong><b><br />
</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span>ipconfig /flushdns</span></strong><b><br />
</b>c. You will received the following message<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span>Successfully flushed the DNS Resolver Cache</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Have a display language issue.&nbsp; All is OK, all dropdown boxes are in English except the fonts box that shows the names of different fonts and the first few characters - it shows the names in English but the first few characters in Russian cyrillic<br />
<br />
I have Russian as an alternative keyboard language, but fonts display as they should on the two alternative keyboards and my display language is English and all other boxes etc display in English - it is solely the display of characters next to the (English)
 font names in the font drop-down box that display in cyrillic regardless of my keyboard - but I can still type in English with them when the display language is English!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I say "keyboard" I mean my language choice displayed on the language bar</p>

            <p>e.g. [Word – Home – Font – top left is a drop-down box].<span>&nbsp; </span>If I drop it down I get a long column of fonts to choose from, the name in English, the

 I have English selected as the “keyboard language”.</p>

</p><p>Dude, I cannot believe you and I are the only ones that has this problem either!&nbsp; I posted a question about 6 monjths ago and no joy from anyone.&nbsp; I have the exact system and in addition when I open the list of the default windows 7 system fonts there is
 not an English sample in the list.&nbsp; Mine are not Cyrillic, they are some Asian language, perhaps Thailand?&nbsp; Every one from Araial to Zop's all of them.&nbsp; However when I type in office or any app the come out English--I have no way to see what they look like
 in English.&nbsp; I too have set all system defaults to English, still get any preview in Vietnamese.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft store will not open</h2>
                    <p>Hey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been struggling with this annoying problem for a week now.&nbsp; I wanted to install some of the WSL-type packages, so I navigated to the Microsoft Store.&nbsp; When I tried to go to the page for downloading the app, the Store crashed.&nbsp; After updating to the
 latest available Windows 10 package, I could no longer enter the Store in the first place.&nbsp; It would crash on startup.&nbsp; I tried everything.&nbsp; I did "sfc /scannow", and a number of other commands.&nbsp; "wsreset.exe" is entirely broken, it cannot find any of the
 files it needs to reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I tried using the Microsoft Support from this website.&nbsp; I got connected to an agent quickly, and I was passed along to a technician.&nbsp; He tried everything that I had tried, and had no luck.&nbsp; He did an "In-Place" update, which he claimed would remove
 all Microsoft programs and reinstall them.&nbsp; As soon as he started the Media Installation tool or whatever, he ended the chat session.&nbsp; I tried to give him bad feedback, since he left me hanging, but he abused the LogMeIn control power he had, and closed my
 window.&nbsp; This meant that I couldn't give feedback on him!&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I got back with another agent, and reported my experience to her.&nbsp; She said it would be passed along.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the "In Place" thing had fully completed, I restarted a few times, and installed some new updates.&nbsp; I tried opening the Microsoft store, but it still won't open.&nbsp; Furthermore, my Start Menu was completely reset, and everything is slow now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how many times I will have to ask for help, or where I should be looking, but it's clear from other threads on this forum that Microsoft has failed to fix this problem.&nbsp; Please help me!</p>

            Hi Bob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> To repair the store:
<br /> 
<br />See if the fixes here help:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows/3-quick-fixes-for-your-windows-store-problems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3053099/windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Store cache:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-store-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-windows-sto...</a>
<br />
<br />If that fails go to Settings&gt;Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset.  After it resets, restart PC.
<br /> 
<br />If that fails then reinstall Store.  Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:
<br />
<br /><code>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</code>
<br />
<br /> 
<br />If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I went through this with a Level 2 tech.&nbsp; They couldn't powershell the problem, and they say I have to reinstall Windows completely.&nbsp; I am entirely unimpressed - this is not an option for me.&nbsp; I am far too busy, and I cannot afford to format my drive.&nbsp;
 There needs to be a better way!&nbsp; With older versions of windows, many programs could be downloaded online manually, or easily replaced.&nbsp; This new process is convoluted.&nbsp; Apparently, something went wrong with my initial install of Windows 6 months ago!&nbsp; I guess
 it silently failed&nbsp;<strong>(!)</strong>, because I am only discovering this now... I wish it had notified me when I installed Windows that a major part had FAILED to install!

            When you get time I'd invest it in reinstalling Windows so that you have an install that will support Windows 10 heavy updating.  What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br /> There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />Until then you can try all of the store fixes I gave again in the order I gave them, or you can do the Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  This reinstalls WIndows while saving your files and apps in place; takes about an hour, resolves most problems.

            You see, if you read my original post, you'd know that a tech already ran an In Place install...&nbsp; I have no idea what verbal gymnastics you're using in your 2nd paragraph, but it's pretty confusing.&nbsp; I'll probably do nothing, and I doubt I'll get a refund
 on the HVEC decoder I bought from the Microsoft Store webpage, since it's a "consumable".

            Bob -
<br />
<br /> You said Microsoft Support had tried to fix the Store app but only gave powershell commands as the example.  But there are many other steps I gave in my first post that usually work to fix the Store app without needing to Repair Install or Reinstall.  Can you go back through that list to try them?  
<br />
<br />If the Repair Install was run and didn't fix the store then since it reinstalls Windows and you'd have a fresh Store, it points to a program, driver, app or setting that were carried over which are likely causing the problem.  You can remove them all from Starting with Windows which they do not need to do since you only need most of them when you call on them.  Follow Step 4 in this checklist:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.  I will continue to try to help you if you'd like.
