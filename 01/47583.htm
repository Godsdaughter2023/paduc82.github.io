<h2>            Booting from Repair disk Windows 10</h2>
                    When I boot from the "repair disk windows 10" it begins to boot until it reaches the first page which asks which language do you want to use. When the boot begins the red LED&nbsp;in the optical mouse is on but just before the language query page comes up the
 LED goes off and the keyboard also goes dead so I am not able to answer the question.&nbsp; So I am stuck at that point.&nbsp; Is there a bug in the program?&nbsp;My computer is an hp pavilion desktop computer.

            <p>1. Yes the mouse works fine when I do a normal boot from Drive C.</p>
<p>2. When I boot from the DVD (Repair Disk Windows 10, 64 bits) instead of Drive C the LED in the mouse is initially lit but goes off just before the language select page comes up.&nbsp; The Keyboard also responds until this point but after the USB is turned off
 it is dead.&nbsp; I checked this by tapping the 'caps lock' key and the caps LED goes on and off. It appears that during the boot from the DVD that USB is being turned off and that kills everything.</p>
<p>3. I can not get far enough to tell if it works later on when I boot from the DVD.</p>
<p>4. No, there are no error codes.</p>
<p>5. Yes I have tried connecting to different USB ports but there is no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have restarted the computer many times and the result is always the same.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think that the DVD can be booted into safe mode.&nbsp; Do you think it can?</p>

</p><p><span><span>Let's perform a <strong>“Startup Repair”</strong> using Windows 10 bootable DVD or USB drive and check if that helps. Initiating repair from CD/DVD may have different results than earlier since the source of boot is different now. So, I would
 suggest to perform the repair again and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your suggestion but I don't want to loose my apps and drivers.&nbsp; That would be too extreme at this point in the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is apparently some kind of incompatibly between the&nbsp;program on "Windows Repair Disk Windows 10 64 bit" and my computer.&nbsp; A friend of mine has tested it and finds that it works on his computer so I suspect that it works on most computers, just not mine.&nbsp;
 My computer is a quad core&nbsp;HP Pavilion desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have pretty much given up on getting it to work on this computer but have found an alternative way to accomplish the task.&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried&nbsp;Acronis True Image 2016 and found that it works.&nbsp; The way I got connected to Acronis is that a few months ago I bought a
 Solid State Disk Drive by Crucial and it came with&nbsp;a download&nbsp;of Acronis to assist in copying the operating system to the SSDD.&nbsp; I upgraded to the full version even&nbsp;though this might not have been necessary.&nbsp; It did successfully do the job and I now have a
 SSDD drive-C.&nbsp; Acronis has&nbsp;the equivalent of saving the disk image and restoring it.&nbsp; And my computer boots from their boot up disk.&nbsp; So that is what I plan to use from now on.</p>

<p>Does your PC really says you don't have disk drive software or does it say something else and if something else, what does it say?</p>
<p>If your system has a CD burner but just no CD burning software, you can download free CD burning software.</p>
<p>If that is the case, here is a way to create a bootable XP Recovery Console CD. &nbsp;No XP media required and you just need to have a CD drive capable of burning a CD (hardware):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</p>
<p>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</p>
<p>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download the ISO file from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></p>
<p>Use a new CD and this free and easy program to burn your ISO file and create your bootable CD:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></p>
<p>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</p>
<p><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></p>
<p>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</p>
<p>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</p>
<p>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</p>
<p>Press any key to boot from CD...</p>
<p>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</p>
<p>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</p>
<p>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</p>
<p>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</p>
<p>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</p>
<p>The Recovery Console allows basic file commands like: copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</p>
<p>For a list of Recovery Console commands, enter help at the prompt.</p>

    <title>Screen resolution problem, my resolution is no longer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikarijamko  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen resolution problem, my resolution is no longer &#34;supported&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Forgive me as I don't really have enough information on my monitor or graphics/video card.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I know is, I have an Acer LCD monitor, that is between 20-22 inches, yesterday, my screen resolution was 1680 x 1050*, and it was the perfect resolution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This morning, when I turned my computer on, the resolution was knocked down to 960 x 720 for some reason, and it looked terrible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went into the resolution menu, and I couldn't remember my resolution, so I just did 1650 x 1200, and that isn't right, everything is way too small and blurry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked through my screenshots (for dimensions) and it said 1680 x 1050, and that isn't in the menu anymore, the menu changed. It used to be there was a scroller that went from high to low, and you could just kinda pick your own resolution, now, it lists
 the resolutions you can "choose from", and mine isn't in the list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer did updates a few days ago, but I don't think that messed anything up, but this is very frustrating, I can barely see what I'm typing, and if I knock it down even one setting, everything is huge and blurry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I fix this?</p>

            <p>Did you install an optional update for your graphics card? You would have had to do it manually because optional driver updates are not checked by default..
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This being the case, </p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt; Category Large Icons &gt; Device Manager &gt; Dispaly Adapter</p>
<p>Right click on the adapter and select 'Properties'</p>
<p>Click on the&nbsp;'driver' tab and select the 'Rollback' option.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completion you should be able to get your resolution back.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW, NEVER install driver updates for any hardware device from Windows update UNLESS there is absolutely no alternative.. that is to say, that the device manufacturer no longer supplies a full driver package for the device and the OS..&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Store App Not Finding Updates &#38; Can&#39;t Click On Apps</h2>
                    <p>HP Pavilion 20 All-in-One PC</p>
<p>Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Christmas event for Hidden City Mystery of Shadows update has come out but my Windows Store app isn't finding the update (other Windows users in the game have told me they got their update today 12/3/17). I have also noticed that the app is behaving
 weird. I can click on apps on the home screen to see their summary, reviews, and requirements. But when I search an app category for example "hidden object games" and hit enter, I can't click on any of the search results not even&nbsp;Hidden City and I own the
 app. I recently had trouble getting the update for my Magic Jigsaw Puzzle app but one day it automatically updated on it's own which happened on&nbsp;12/1/17 or 11/30/17. So I don't know if something is really wrong with my Windows Store app or not. Especially
 since I have used the apps.diagcab (I don't know what version it is but I downloaded it on 10/23/17), and it found nothing wrong. Now I don't know if it found because nothing is wrong or if it found nothing due to the message&nbsp;at the bottom of the&nbsp;General Properties
 tab "This&nbsp;file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer".&nbsp;Should I remove the block and run the troubleshooter again or&nbsp;is the message meaningless to the tool's performance?&nbsp;&nbsp;I also reset the store app by right clicking&nbsp;the
 windows icon in the bottom left corner of the screen, clicked run and typed in "WSReset.exe", hit enter, a command prompt window opened and then the Windows Store App opened, I saw the Home screen then it went white for a second then the home screen was back
 and it showed loading for about 3 seconds and then it was done. I went to check updates still nothing, then clicked sync licenses then tried check updates again and nothing. I'm not using a proxy but I checked anyway to make sure and there isn't one.&nbsp;I don't
 know if this has anything to do with the Windows Store app misbehaving but I&nbsp;opened the control panel and went to update history to see if there are any updates that have failed and I saw one that I didn't know was failing multiple times for a long time. I
 don't know if my system really needs it and if it does I don't know how to get it because the links attached to it don't have the download available and don't provide and information about it or where to go to get it.&nbsp;Help with finding solutions&nbsp;is greatly
 appreciated, thank&nbsp;you for your time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Question related to profiles and changing gamertag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ll ganon ll  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question related to profiles and changing gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>I recently tried to change my gamertag, to find the new gamertag was already taken (which I had expected). However, when I check the profile of the owner of this gamertag, there was only the default gamerpic, zero gamerscore, no rep at all, no zone and no
 games played. </p>
<p>My question is, is this a glitch? If so, is there anyway for me to have that gamertag?</p>
<p>Thanks. <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /></p>

<p>I cannot open attachments in Windows Mail.&nbsp; My operating system is Windows Vista.&nbsp; Up until about a month ago I was able to open attachments with out a problem.&nbsp; In June I downloaded the PC Cleaners program,&nbsp; this program is no longer on my system and&nbsp;I
 am assuming this program had something to do with not being able to open attachments but after removing the program I am still unable to open attachments.&nbsp; I can open the attachments on the Web Server but not in my Windows Mail.&nbsp; Can someone help?</p>

<p>After running those programs and it will take a while, reboot and test opening an attachment. If you still have issues, post back with the file extension of the attachment, and also see if you can open it if you save it first.</p>

<p>Vista's Windows Mail is <strong><em>not</em></strong> the same program as Windows Live Mail. It's not even close.

<p>If you are not familiar with the programs that predated Windows Live Essentials, please do some homework.</p>

            <p><strong>OT @Neil S: </strong>In what way(s)&nbsp;did you edit Julie's post seven&nbsp;(7) minutes after you posted your original reply [i.e., before you edited it, too, three (3) times in as many minutes),&nbsp;Neil?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since Julie very clearly posted about Windows Mail, not Windows <em>Live</em> Mail, perhaps you can tell us why you didn't move her post to the correct forum (i.e.,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-ecoms">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-ecoms</a>)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Request: Please don't edit <em>anyone's</em> post after someone has replied to it (i.e., Bruce) or a later post in the thread - at least not unless you very&nbsp;clearly mark what you've edited. Please share this with your colleagues &amp; supervisor. Thank you.</p>

            Sorry, I posted this in the wrong location, I had trouble finding the correct location so I picked this one.&nbsp; The program that I down loaded is called PC Cleaner.&nbsp; I have run the suggested programs and I still cannot open attachments in my Windows mail
 or my Webmail server.&nbsp; When I try to open attachments in my Webmail server I get a message that it was infected and deleted.&nbsp; But when I try to open in my Webmail server on&nbsp;my work PC, it opens without a problem.&nbsp; Thanks.

    <title>Tips and Guide for Black Ops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maverick0217-ba7bf97b-976a-4ff0-998f-452e3e1d64b0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Tips and Guide for Black Ops</h2>
                    
<p>Welcome to Sinister Syndicate’s Multiplayer Guide! This four-part guide will tell you everything you want to know from game types, to weapons, to challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops is the most recent entry into the long-running series of war games. While
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Call of Duty</span> started primarily with games centered around World War II, popular opinion has generally shifted away from that war and into more modern conflicts. This isn't a guide for Modern Warfare, though, so
 not that modern. Black Ops as a game is set primarily in the conflicts in Vietnam, and the events surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis. This only matters to us in the Multiplayer guide because it sets the tone of the game; what settings will be included in
 the maps, what outfits will look like, what factions are available for play, and most importantly, what weapons are available. Black Ops is Treyarch's fresh entry to the series, after their success with World At War. It's a departure from the recent and successful
 Modern Warfare games by Infinity Ward, but is also much better supported, especially now that IW barely exists.
</li><li><b>Basics of the Game</b> </li></ul>
<p>It wouldn't be a Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer guide if I didn't talk about the multiplayer though, now would it? So here we go. The basics of the multiplayer game modes are all the same; you're a man fighting other men with guns in various environments.
 There are two main resources to keep yourself aware of in the game. EXP and COD Bucks.</p>
<p><b>EXP </b>is just what it sounds like, to anyone who has ever played a video game. You gain EXP to level up, which grants you access to better guns. Unlike the Modern Warfare games, leveling up does not get you new perks or kill streaks. Levels only unlock
 new weapons, allow you to customize guns and face paints, and unlock certain other features such as layers for your emblem and prestige modes. EXP is earned by killing players, completing challenges, capturing and defending objectives, winning matches, and
 other similar actions in game.</p>
<p><b>COD Bucks</b> are an in-game currency that you earn in much the same way as EXP. The difference is in its use.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">COD Bucks</span> rack up while you play until you spend them or you prestige. What can you buy with COD Bucks? Everything! You have to buy weapons to use them, and buy attachments to equip them. You have to buy the ability
 to paint your gun and put your emblem on it, or to customize your sights. You have to buy perks and their upgrades. You have to buy grenades or equipment to use. You even have to buy each layer of your emblem and each individual symbol you want to use.</p>
<p>Contracts are time-limited challenges that you purchase for COD Bucks if you complete them, you get more money than you put into buying them. If you fail, you lose your investment.</p>
<p>Sound confusing? Read on, it will all be explained.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Kill streaks in Black Ops</b> </li></ul>
<p>Anyone familiar with the more recent Call of Duty games knows about Kill streaks. In Black Ops, unlike Modern Warfare 2, they go up to 11 kills. Kills made by your kill streaks do not count towards your next kill streak. Each kill streak can only be earned
 once per life, so if you earn all three you'll have to die before you start earning any more. The kill streaks are:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Spy Plane: 3 Kills.</p>

<li><b>Black Ops Perks</b> </li></ul>
<p>As always, Perks are a large part of game play. They can protect you from air support, allow you to move and aim faster, hide you from enemies, and let you see equipment. There are three perk slots: Blue, Orange, and Green. You can have one of each type
 of perk, to mix and match. Blue perks choose your player model. Each perk also has a Pro version, unlocked by completing certain challenges for it. More on that later in the guide.</p>

<li><b>Other Aspects</b> </li></ul>
<p>The customizability of your player in the game is nothing to be scoffed at. How can you
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">customize </span>yourself? This Call of Duty Black Ops multiplayer guide will tell you!</p>
<p>Perks are the first method of customization. Your first perk chooses the look of your character. Once you unlock the ability to, you can change the face paint of your character as well. You can choose your clan tag, and you can etch it into your gun. Speaking
 of your guns, you can paint them different cameos, change the color and dot of the sights, and paint your emblem on them.</p>
<p>Your emblem consists of a number of layers, each of which you can add one of a selection of symbols to, in various colors. Use your creativity to make whatever you want! Just don't make it offensive, or Treyarch will remove it.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer Gametypes</b> </li></ul>
<p>The core to multiplayer is the gametypes, and this wouldn't be a good guide if it didn't cover them for you. So here we are, the Call of Duty Black Ops
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">multiplayer </span>gametypes.</p>
<p>Gametypes fall into two categories; <i>Player Match</i> and <i>Wager Match</i>. Player Matches are the standard deathmatch and objective variants, while Wager Matches are a new addition to Black Ops. Wager matches allow you to play one of four specific game
 modes at one of three ante levels, with your COD Bucks on the line. Win and you can take home as much as three times your bid; lose and you can lose it all. There's also the thing type,
<i>Combat Training,</i> which is regular Player Matches using bots.</p>
<p><b>Player Matches </b>divide into four groups. <i>Core, Hardcore, Barebones, </i>
and <i>Prestige.</i> There's also a fifth group for new map packs when they come out, to play just those maps.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/98/0/980b724afb37603833a911bc0480a5e5ea63bc6b_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p><b>Core</b> includes:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Deathmatch: 6v6 kill everyone. Reach a score limit of 7500 with 100 points per kill.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercenary Team Deathmatch: Team Deathmatch that disallows parties of organized players.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Free For All: 8 player battle royale with 5 points per kill and a score limit of 150.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Domination: 6v6 teams capture and defend 3 map points to a score limit of 200.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Ground War: Domination and Team Deathmatch with higher score limits and 9v9 teams.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Demolition: Two bomb sites on a map. Every player has a bomb. 6v6, one team defends.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sabotage: 6v6, each team has a bomb site, with a neutral bomb. Defend your bomb site and destroy the other one!</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Headquarters: A neutral objective appears randomly; 6v6 teams try to capture it and hold it to gain points until it moves.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Capture the Flag: Two flags, 6v6, classic game type.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Search and Destroy: One bomb site, one bomb, 6v6 teams on offense and defense; no respawns.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Tactical: 4v4 teams with Headquarters, Search and Destroy, Sabotage, Domination, and Team Deathmatch</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hardcore, Barebones, and Wager Matches</b> </li></ul>
<p><b>Hardcore</b> mode ups the danger! Players have much lower health, no HUD, no radar unless a Spy Plane is called in, and friendly fire is on. Hardcore gametypes include:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Deathmath</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Search and Destroy</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Free For All</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Headquarters<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/2f/6/2f61958e979e3040b8adb7e18ebd1bc973b161ef_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Capture the Flag</p>
<p><b>Barebones</b> game modes strip the game to it's basics. There are three types.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Pure: No Perks, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Kill streaks</span>, Attachments, Equipment, or Contracts. Team Deathmatch and Free For All</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Classic: No Attachments or Equipment and kill streaks are set to Spy Plane, Napalm Strike, Attack Chopper.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Team Tactical: 4v4 with no Perks, Killstreaks, Attachments, Equipment, or Contracts.</p>
<p><b>Wager Matches </b>have three ante levels: 10, 1,000, or 10,000 buy in with a double-down option. Only the 10-buck level allows parties. They come in four flavors:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; One In The Chamber: Players have 3 lives, a pistol with 1 bullet, and a knife. Bullets kill instantly and when you kill someone, you get another bullet.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sharpshooter: Every player gets an identical weapon, which changes every 45 seconds. Kills net you perks that stick until you die.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sticks and Stones: Players only get the Ballistic Knife, the Crossbow, and the Tomahawk. Kills with the first two net you points, the tomahawk makes the enemy lose all of theirs.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Gun Game: 20 tiers of weapons from a pistol all the way to missile launchers. Players start at tier 1 and each kill bumps them up a tier. Being knifed lowers you a tier. First to kill with the final tier wins.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to the second article in the Call of Duty Black Ops multiplayer guide. This article will cover weapons and equipment in the Black Ops multiplayer mode, from the SMGs and **** Rifles all the way to grenades and the crossbow. Read on to learn all
 there is to learn!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons Guide</b> </li></ul>
<p>In this second part of Sinister Syndicate Black Op<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/07/9/07995d72cb80d4a6f223346e198670d6ab432fac_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>s guide, we cover weapons. Obviously essential to combat, your weapon does a lot to determine your playstyle. Whether you choose the faster-moving faster-firing SMGs, or the slow-moving high-power LMGs, or split the difference with the **** rifles, it
 all makes a difference. Even your secondary matters; do you go in for a launcher to help take out air support, or do you run with the ballistic knife for some in-your-face stabbing action?</p>
<p>Well, before you spend your hard-earned COD Bucks on something you're not even sure you'll like, be sure to research your choices in this
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Call of Duty Black Ops</span> Weapons Guide. Each section over the next few pages will cover the primary weapons, secondary weapons, grenades and equipment. But first, we'll take a look at attachments and customization.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Weapon Attachments and Customization</b> </li></ul>
<p>Almost as important as your choice in gun is the choice of the attachments you put on it. Every attachment costs COD Bucks to buy, for each weapon; you want to buy a silencer for two guns, you have to buy it twice. Thankfully, once you buy it, it's yours
 until you decide to prestige. Never going to prestige? Go hog-wild with your purchases.</p>
<p>Each attachment cost<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/79/0/790b55a8fbcb3354ba62364220f7412e1f011069_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>s a certain amount of COD Bucks, spread into six tiers.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 250: Upgraded Iron Sights</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 500: Snub Nose</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 750: Speed Reloader</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 1,000: Extended Mags, Dual Mags, ACOG Sight, Red Dot Sight, Reflex Sight, Masterkey Shotgun, Flamethrower, Foregrip</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 2,000: Infrared Scope, Suppressor, Variable Zoom</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; 3,000: M203 Grenade Launcher</p>
<p>Some of these attachments are just for secondaries, like the Upgraded Irons and the Snub Nose. The rest are for various primary weapons, with the **** Rifles getting the most variety. For a more detailed look at each gun and attachment, check out
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this guide</span>.</p>
<p><b>Customization</b> is only available for primary weapons. At level 16 you can paint your emblem on your gun, and at level 19 you can etch your clan tag into it as well. At level 22 you unlock gun cameos. At level 25 you can change the color a<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/43/f/43fb3b3c8b35d34bdda242d71515f14364e475ac_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>nd shape of your lense dot. At level 28 you can change the lense color itself. The costs are:</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Gun Camo Colors: 250 each. Gold camo unlocks at Prestige 14.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Dot Sight Shapes: 500 each.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Dot Sight Colors: 250 each.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Sight Lense Colors: 500 each.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Emblem and Clan Tag: 1,000 each.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Weapons List: SMGs</b> </li></ul>
<p>In the first part of the actual Call of Duty Black Ops weapons list, we have the primary weapons the SMGs. SMGs are fast-moving guns that fire quickly and have a limited supply of bullets. They're mostly for players who love to be mobile, who can't stand
 to sit in one place to camp. Every SMG costs 2,000 COD Bucks to purchase except the MP5K which is automatically unlocked. You have to buy all of them to unlock the classified Kiparis.</p>
<p>The <b>MP5K</b> is unlocked at level 1 and is part of the default SMG class. It's effective at close range but has a high damage drop at medium range.</p>
<p>The <b>Skorpion </b>is unlocked at level 7. It has the highest damage of any SMG, but drops off significantly beyond very close range.</p>
<p>The <b>MAC11 </b>is unlocked at level 11. It has a high fire rate, but all around lower damage.</p>
<p>The <b>AK74u </b>comes at level 17. It has a decent damage level, similar to the MP5K, but with a decet clip size and high recoil. It's almost more of an **** rifle.</p>
<p>The <b>Uzi </b>is unlocked at level 23. Like the MAC11, it has high recoil, low damage, and a high rate of fire.</p>
<p>The <b>PM63 </b>unlocks at level 29. It has a high rate of fire, the same standard low damage of SMGs, and a reasonably low recoil.</p>
<p>The <b>MPL </b>comes next at level 35. Low damage, high recoil, high rate of fire, it's standard for SMGs.</p>
<p>The <b>Spectre </b>is the last non-classified SMG, unlocked at level 41. It's almost identical to the MPL only a lower recoil.</p>
<p>The <b>Kiparis </b>is the final SMG in Black Ops, and is Classified until you have purchased all of the others. Only then can you purchase it. It has the lowest recoil of any SMG.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Weapons List: **** Rifles</b> </li></ul>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">**** rifles</span> are the standard gun. Not as mobile as SMGs, not as powerful as LMGs, not as long-ranged as Snipers, they're average in every regard. This does mean that you'll hardly ever go wrong with choosing
 an **** rifle. Obviously though, not all rifles are created equal. Most are automatic, while some are semi-auto or burst fire. Some have higher power or recoil than others. The M16 comes unlocked for you, while you have to buy every other gun to unlock
 the G11.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/ab/4/ab4eaacee1b63f35dac0081188ba4267cf0fec68_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>M16 </b>is the first **** rifle in the game, one you start with. It fires a three-round burst and has a decently high damage rating, which only drops off at long range.</p>
<p>The <b>Enfield </b>is unlocked at level 6. It has lower damage and more recoil than the M16, but is the first full-auto rifle you can buy.</p>
<p>The <b>M14 </b>is unlocked at level 9. It's semi-auto, one shot at a time, but it makes up for that by having easily controllable recoil and high damage, higher than the M16s.</p>
<p>The <b>Famas </b>Is unlocked at level 14. Essentially the Enfield but better, the Famas has lower recoil and about the same damage.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/af/6/af6b48d1f3a02b89bbfb7e3a806cbe52f30d9a5e_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Galil </b>Is unlocked at level 20. It has the same damage as the Famas, but less recoil, and is a solid **** Rifle to use early in your career.</p>
<p>The <b>AUG </b>Is unlocked at level 26. It has less damage than the Galil, but more manageable recoil, as it tends to pull the same direction every shot.</p>
<p>The <b>FN FAL</b> Is unlocked at level 32. The second Semi-Auto gun, you fire one shot at a time. It has the same damage as the M14, but much less recoil, making it more deadly.</p>
<p>The <b>AK47 </b>Is unlocked at level 38. High damage, manageable recoil, the AK-47 is a Call of Duty standard for endgame.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/99/0/99099a0f3766e5646b9fd04fb612c3ea7fa34aa0_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Commando </b>Is unlocked at level 44. The AK-47 is great, but the Commando is identical in every way except a faster reload and weapon swap time.</p>
<p>The <b>G11 </b>is Classified and is unlocked when you buy all the other **** Rifles. Fires in three-round bursts that kill most players, the G11 is an end-game death cannon. To make up for this, it only has two attachments: A Low Power Scope and the Variable
 Zoom scope.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons List: Shotguns</b> </li></ul>
<p>Making their return to Primary status after their stint as Secondaries in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
MW2</span>, Shotguns seem to have gotten a bit of a nerf. There aren't many of them, and while they're powerful, they're quite short-ranged. All shotguns are
<i>more accurate </i>when you aim down the sights; it reduces pellet spread and makes a kill more likely and mid range. The Olympia is unlocked by default and you need to buy the other two to unlock the HS-10.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/fc/3/fc37cd61e005a0b3d5eeb89c6199bef011bedb81_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Olympia</b> is the default shotgun. It has two barrels that can be fired in quick succession before needing to reload.</p>
<p>The <b>Stakeout </b>is unlocked at level 8. It's much like the SPAS-12 from MW2, with four shots, a pump-action between them, and the best range of any shotgun.</p>
<p>The <b>SPAS-12</b> is unlocked at level 24. It has 7 shots and is semi-auto, with no pump between shots. It's purpose is for room-clearing, and spamming shells.</p>
<p>The <b>HS-10</b> is classified, unlocked when you purchase the other shotguns. It has four shots and is semi-auto with no action between them. It's benefit is it's attachment; it's the only shotgun that can be Dual-Wielded.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons List: LMGs</b> </li></ul>
<p>LMGs in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Black Ops</span> are the standard weapon for covering allies and spraying bullets. They tend to have high numbers of bullets, making reloading a thing of the past. They have high power, but the trade off is
 their low mobility. Try playing a SMG class fora while then switch to a LMG; it feels like moving in slow motion. You start with the HK21 unlocked, and must buy the others to unlock the Stoner63.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/78/c/78c9f219527472d099c0af8da1ed6d7f23636d7e_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>HK21 </b>is the first LMG and you start with it. High recoil, but no damage drop off at range, it will kill in the same number of bullets from across the map as it would right next to you.</p>
<p>The <b>RPK </b>is unlocked at level 6. Same damage and lack of drop-off as the HK-21, the RPK has less recoil, making it an upgrade.</p>
<p>The <b>M60 </b>is unlocked at level 21. It's the only real bullet-spam gun, with a huge box of ammo to burn through. It has a slight damage drop off at medium range.</p>
<p>The <b>Stoner63 </b>is the classified gun, unlocked when you buy the other LMGs. It's the same damage and drop off of the HK and the RPK, but has nearly twice the rate of fire.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Weapons List: Sniper Rifles</b> </li></ul>
<p>There's not much to say about sniper rifles in Black Ops. One high-powered bullet to put somewhere really far away, attached to a high power scope. They aren't very good in this game; no rifle will get a one-shot kill anywhere other than a headshot, and
 any gun gets headshot kills easily. There are also only four of them; the Dragunov is unlocked when you start, and you need to buy the other two to unlock the PSG1.</p>
<p>The <b>Dragunov</b> is the starting sniper rifle. It will one-shot a player in the upper-torso or head region, but will always 2-shot with a silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>WA2000</b> is unlocked at level 10. It has a faster fire rate and more manageable recoil than the Dragunov, but has the same kill areas and 1-2 shots.</p>
<p>The <b>L96A1</b> is unlocked at level 27. It's a bolt-action rifle, so one shot at a time. In addition to one-shooting people in the head and upper torso, it will also one-shot a player in the lower torso. All areas are two-shot kills with a silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>PSG1</b> is the Classified sniper rifle. It's Semi-Auto again, and has the same kill areas as the first two guns, but higher recoil, making it less useful overall.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Secondary Weapons in Black Ops: Pistols</b> </li></ul>
<p>First of the array of secondary weapons, and by far the most populated, is the
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Pistols</span> section. The other two, launchers and specials, have fewer between them. Pistols are a varied lot, but for the most part they're close to mid-range weapons with a small clip. Their strength is in the fact
 they shoot bullets; this lets you pull them out in Second Chance, or when you're out of bullets for your main weapon. You must buy all of the pistols to unlock the CZ75. The ASP, M1911, and Makarov are all essentially identical; the only difference is in their
 attachments.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/4e/c/4ec3c3c08180fffd253f352d572861f15ea86567_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>ASP</b> has Dual Wield.</p>
<p>The <b>M1911</b> has Upgraded Iron Sights, Extended Mags, Dual Wield, and a Silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>Makarov</b> has Upgraded Iron Sights, Extended Mags, Dual Wield, and a Silencer.</p>
<p>The <b>Python</b> is unlocked at level 18, and is a six-shot revolver. It has higher damage than the three starting pistols, but obviously less ammo and a higher recoil.</p>
<p>The <b>CZ75</b> is classified, and unlocks when you buy the other pistols. It has the same damage as the starting pistols, but much less recoil.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Secondary Weapons in Black Ops: Launchers</b> </li></ul>
<p>Launchers are simple; they shoot high explosives and target different things. None of them have attachments, none of them are classified, and each serves a different purpose. There aren't many in
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Black Ops</span>, but they serve all their roles.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/66/e/66e284b67b4c869789070fc56bbe2bcffd6f5d4d_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>M72 LAW</b> is the first Launcher in the game, and you start with it unlocked. It's the most versatile as well. You can free-fire it at players or turrets or walls, or you can lock on to aircraft. It has a slight curve, not as pronounced as the RPG,
 but still enough to make precision at long range slightly lacking. It's only down side is you only get one shot, making anything harder than a Spy Plane impossible to shoot down in one life.</p>
<p>The <b>RPG </b>is unlocked at level 12. It's free-fire only, no lock on, and has a more pronounced curve in it's flight; it's not accurate, it's made for clearing areas. On the plus side, you get two shots. This can often mean the difference between success
 or failure in hitting your target.</p>
<p>The <b>Strela-3</b> is unlocked at level 30, and is this game's version of the Stinger. Two shots, aircraft lock-on only, as simple as that.</p>
<p>The <b>China Lake</b> is unlocked at level 48. It's a grenade laucher with two shots, a nifty pump-action reload, and a quick drop time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Secondary Weapons in Black Ops: Specials</b> </li></ul>
<p>There are only two special weapons in Black Ops, both of which have their roles. Both are unique to this Call of Duty game, and are both entertaining to use. One is for close range and the other is for long -- you'll be able to guess which is which just
 by looking at them.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/c2/8/c28c81221ad588b060d5e5f8cf30ebbc107ca13d_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>
<p>The <b>Ballistic Knife</b> - Unlocked at level 15. You get one shot and one reload unless you have Scavenger. The Ballistic knife is a spring-powered throwing knife, essentially, that flies in a straighter arc than the tomahawk does. Using it also increases
 the speed of your melee, almost to tactical knife levels.</p>
<p>The <b>Crossbow </b>- Unlocked at level 33. Much like the Ballistic Knife, you get one shot and one reload before you have to pull out Scavenger. Think of the crossbow as a mix between a grenade launcher and a semtex. The bolt sticks to walls, floors, and
 people, and explodes after a couple of seconds. You can stick a player and they only have seconds to live.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Black Ops Grenades and Equipment</b> </li></ul>
<p>In a departure from MW2, Black Ops gives your character three special slots. One for a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Lethal grenade</span>, one for a Tactical grenade, and one for a piece of Equipment. The former are thrown using the triggers or shoulder buttons, while the equipment is readied and placed using up on the D-pad.</p>
<p><b>Lethal Grenades include:</b><a href="http://img.bhs4.com/18/c/18cb4b72c59341c79c93d91c652f86555003c6ab_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>
</b></a></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Frag Grenades: Explode in a radius, will bounce and roll, and have a set timer. You can cook them in your hands, but watch out; hold it too long and you'll explode.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Semtex: A sticky grenade with a larger blast than the frag, with a distinctive noise and light.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Tomahawk: Thrown in a straight arc, this small axe is a one-hit kill on any part of the body. Known to bounce off surfaces.</p>
<p><b>Tactical Grenades include:</b></p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Willy Pete: White Phosphorus, does a tiny amount of damage locally and fills the area with thick white smoke.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Nova Gas: A yellow cloud of smoke that damages, blurs vision, and slows any enemy or the user who is not wearing Tactical Mask</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Flashbang: A grenade that explodes in a blinding light, turning the screen white and muting sound for many seconds.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Concussion: Similar to the Flashbang, it doesn't blind totally but darkens the screen, dulls sound, and severely restricts movement.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Decoy Grenade: When thrown, for a minute, will rattle off noises that sound like gunfire and appear as enemy dots on enemy maps.</p>

<li><b>Call of Duty Black Ops Maps</b> </li></ul>
<p>There are fourteen basic maps that come with the game when you buy Call of Duty Black Ops. Additionally, Treyarch has recently released the First Strike DLC pack for 1200 Microsoft Points, which gives you four more maps. The maps vary in location from the
 jungle, the arctic, a nuclear test site, and even the Berlin Wall. Each one has it's own unique placement of objective and strategies to learn. The maps are: Array, Cracked, Crisis, Firing Range, Grid, Hanoi, Havana, Jungle, Launch, Nuketown, Radiation, Summit,
 Villa, and WMD. The four First Strike maps are Berlin Wall, Discovery, Kowloon, and Stadium.</p>
<p>Where do objectives spawn? What strategies are most effective? Read on in this third part of the Call of Duty Black Ops
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Multiplayer</span> maps guide to find out!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Array</b> </li></ul>
<p>First up is perhaps the largest map, Array. It's a winter map,<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/50/0/5001df2f9139f67c14a95a99a48a164969b1242e_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a>meaning everything is bright white and movement is easier to spot. Key areas to control include the central circular building and it's surroundings, which many people find is the hub of confrontation. Snipers love climbing the broadcast tower off to the
 wilderness side of the map, so if you hear a sniper go off, check that tower. Often you can out-snipe snipers before they can spot you. As a map with a lot of open area, anti-aircraft weaponry is essential if the enemy goes on a long enough killstreak to call
 in helicopters. Be prepared to move a lot; often you will spawn half a minute of running away from the action, so a LMG would make the slog intolerable.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cracked</b> </li></ul>
<p>Cracked is a broad map with several different levels of height and angles of approach to watch out for. There are few places to snipe from, as most of the area is mid-close range. The center of the map is a strip of raised rubble and buildings which are
 where most of the action takes place. Domination B is squarely on top of that rubble, leaving players attempting to capture it very exposed. On one side is a three-story bombed out building with a commanding view of multiple avenues of approach, making it
 key territory for many campers. There is very little open airspace to drop a care package without being ambushed, so be cautious using such killstreaks. Players with fast reactions and SMGs will make short work of many of the tight corridors.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Crisis</b> </li></ul>
<p>Crisis is a cuban missile base, offering a scenic beachfront, fortified underground bunkers and control rooms, and a pair of buildings. The beach is
 rarely used as more than a spawn point; most of the action takes place either in the tunnels or the cliffs above them, or the two-floor house to one side where many players spawn. Key places include a small tunnel carved out of the rock, which is a good ambush
 spot for players running from the beach to the tunnels. The tunnels themselves have many small corners to hide in, so keep an eye out. The beach is wide open to call in killstreaks, or to use
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">packages</span> as bait. Just watch out for players on the cliffs, who can see most of the beach at any time.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Firing Range</b> </li></ul>
<p>Firing Range is a relatively small map, one of the smaller maps in the game. Nearly every surface is made out of wood or thin metal, making bullet penetration easy and Hardened especially deadly. There is a lowered area as one spawn point, with three pathways
 up to the higher main area. Players love going to the higher tower in the middle of the map, but are vulnerable to a grenade if you throw it into their cubby hole. The two buildings overlooking the central area are also frequent camping spots, where you'll
 often find two or three members of one team watching the same window; these are easy kills. There are very few places to call in care packages without being killed, so use them wisely.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Grid</b> </li></ul>
<p>Grid is another snowy map, this one on the small end of the spectrum. A soviet comm/power station, most of the action takes place in the center of the map, between the two buildings. You can climb onto the truck to kill from an unexpected location, but you're
 quite exposed from both buildings. There is a back corner of the map with some tunnel-like buildings people rarely go to, which you could use to snipe from if you so desired. On the opposite side of the map is a wide wilderness area with enough cover to call
 in killstreaks or place hard-to-reach turrets. Not much fighting takes place back there, so it would be a great location to bait a trap with a care package.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Hanoi</b> </li></ul>
<p>Hanoi is yet another map in the Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer maps roster. It's perpetually night-time in Hanoi, with a roving spotlight in one courtyard, a gallows under which players can hide, and several buildings around the map with multiple access
 points and windows overlooking the courtyards. Always keep an eye out on the second level when you move! Every courtyard and road has a building that can watch it, and more often than not someone will be
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">camping</span> one of those windows. Even the outer edge of the map has a building you can crawl onto the roof of and camp from. While hiding under the gallows is a good place to ambush players, it's also a good place
 to be ambushed.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Havana</b> </li></ul>
<p>Havana is a map with a long road in the middle and clusters of buildings on either side. The majority of the action will take place in these buildings. The long road is almost always covered by some sniper from one of the ends, while the buildings offer
 a lot of cover, snort sight-lines, and perfect ranges for SMGs and **** rifles. Due to how long and narrow the map is, a rolling thunder can cover a majority of it and net you an entire team worth of kills. Be wary when running through the buildings, as
 chances are there are claymores around every corner.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Jungle</b> </li></ul>
<p>Jungle is a dense map full of greenery, twisted pathways, and cliffside huts. It's easy to lose track of the enemy in the foliage and even easier to get sniped before you spot them. There is a high ridge where snipers love to camp, be aware one will be there,
 and probably have a claymore or motion sensor behind them. Be careful approaching them and instead throw a cooked grenade on top of them. The dense tree cover can make it hard to spot air support before it's on top of you, making it hard to shoot down. Also,
 on one side of the map is an open area with no boundaries. You can run outside of the map but after a short time you will explode, unlike the usual Call of Duty radiation death. This makes for an amusing time if you throw a care package slightly out of range,
 as enemies and allies alike try to capture it and die trying.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Launch</b> </li></ul>
<p>Similar to Cracked or Havana, Lanch has two large sprawling sides clustered with small pathways, separated by a long open road with little cover and long sight lines. To one side is a lower area with high catwalks, from which snipers love to kill players
 incoming to the area underneath the rocket. After several mintues of game time, a siren will go off and the rocket will begin to launch, hence the map's name. When the rocket lifts off, it's exhaust will kill anyone nearby; this makes Domination especially
 interesting, as Dom B is directly underneath the rocket.</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Nuketown</b> </li></ul>
<p>Based off a model town for the purpose of testing a nuclear weapon, Nuketown is a tiny map colored in bright primary colors and loaded with mannequins. Combat in the map is fast and frantic, making it hard to do anything more than spawn, run a few feet,
 and kill or be killed. The map features several easter eggs, including out-of-map RC-XD paths, a large double rainbow, and a musical surprise. If an organized team shoots the heads off of every mannequin in and outside of the map, in the first 15 seconds of
 gameplay, the loudspeakers will play Sympathy for the Devil by the Rolling Stones. Many players love the map for it's fast-paced action, but others hate it whenever it comes up, especially on objective-based game modes, where capture points are often constantly
 exploding.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Radiation</b> </li></ul>
<p>Radiation is a map with a factory on one side, catwalks on the other, and a large open area in between them. Both sides have buttons that open and close a set of blast doors in the middle of the map, which lead to a tunnel that runs lengthwise through the
 map. Be aware that the blast doors will crush players caught between them when they close, making it dangerous to try to dive through a closing door. The tunnel is where B is located in Domination, so it's advised to close the doors once your team controls
 it and open them if the enemy does. There are many camping places on the map to watch out for, including the catwalks behind the factory with the conveyor belt, underneath the catwalks on the other side, and behind boxes in the tunnels.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Summit</b> </li></ul>
<p>Summit is another snowy map, placed at the top of a mountain, with a large central building where the majority of the action takes place. Be careful running into this building. From the south side people love camping the stairs to the left and the small
 entry room on the right, making a box of death if you enter without looking. From the north, people love camping on the stairs just inside to the left making them hard to shoot, or prone on the floor to the right to kill you when you expect the other way.
 If you survive all of that, check the control room floor and the catwalk across the way, as players will often hide there to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">ambush</span> unsuspecting people.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Villa</b> </li></ul>
<p>As the name suggests, the map Villa is a rustic mansion and it's grounds. Unfortunately it suffers from two large open areas that players nearly never use, given that they're out of the way and hold no tactical advantage. Instead most combat will take place
 in the main building, near the fountain, or on the narrow road. Be careful and always check second-floor windows, as many players will camp such overlooks. It's possible to flank around the main building from either side, if you're careful, and ambush the
 entire enemy team controlling the area. Just be watchful for claymores, as most entrances may be covered.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>WMD</b> </li></ul>
<p>Last of the standard maps, WMD is a boxy area with a train that runs through the border, making it noisy and hard to hear enemies. In the center is a building with commanding views of much of the rest of the map, making it an ideal place to control. Additionally,
 near the domination C point, a high scaffolding can be climbed up on for sniping, though like all high exposed sniping areas it's easy to be counter-sniped. The Domination B point is in the exposed central area, making it often quite hard to capture without
 large amounts of smoke and cover.</p>
<p>In this fourth article of the Call of Duty Black Ops Multiplayer Guide, we cover the remaining aspects of the game. The effects of leveling up, medals, and challenges for pro perks are all included. We hope this guide has been useful to you, and please let
 us know if anything is incorrect!</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Leveling Up and Unlocking</b> </li></ul>
<p>As you gain EXP you begin to ascend through the levels, and each level comes with a new symbol, a new name, and new weapons. You can gain EXP in any number of ways; kill people, capture points, call in killstreaks, shoot down killstreaks, and more. There
 are 50 levels and when you reach level 50 you can enter <b>Prestige Mode</b>. Prestige Mode resets everything except your emblem and clan tag, resets your level to 1, and lets you go through it all again. Certain prestiges higher up get you colored clan tags,
 special backgrounds, and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">special lobbies</span> and leaderboards. You can prestige a maximum of 15 times.</p>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Level 25: Lieutenant. Unlocks custom sights.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The Rest of the Levels</b> </li></ul>
<p>The first 25 levels are easy peasy. Every level the amount of EXP it takes to increase goes up. The last 25 levels take much longer to gain. If you're finding leveling slow, play an obective game like Headquarters, or Demolition with a dedicated team of
 defenders. More kills = more exp, but capturing objectives and defending them is worth even more.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Basic Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Basic challenges are the easiest challenges in Black Ops multiplayer. Even so, some of them are things you wouldn't think of doing, or would only do occasionally. Here's the list.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Break On Through</b> - Dive-to-prone through windows.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Elite Challenges</b> </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>&nbsp; </li><li><b>Finishing Moves Challenges</b> </li></ul>

<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Final Choke</b> - Get the final kill with Nova Gas.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Killstreaks Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Killstreaks challenges are all quite self-explanitory, but some of them are more than just "get kills with this killstreak." Some of them, in fact, are anti-killstreak challenges. While the numbers vary, they all have three challenges associated with them.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Get X number of kills with the killstreak (or in the case of spy planes and blackbirds, while the killstreak is active.)</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the killstreak X number of times.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; Destroy the killstread X number of times (in the case of turrets, air support and the like. Obviously doesn't apply to the Blackbird or weapon killstreaks.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a "get X kills with the care package" killstreak. Given that it's almost impossible to kill a player by dropping a box on them, the primary way to get this killstreak us to use
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hacker Pro</span> to sabotage an enemy crate. Then when it explodes, those kills count.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Lifetime Challenges</b> </li></ul>
<p>Lifetime challenges are the only challenges that do not reset when you prestige. They keep counting from the moment you begin the game to the final time you die. Many of them are obvious, but the less obvious ones are detailed as well.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Kills</b> - Get kills.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Time Played</b> - Time spent in game. Time spent in lobbies might count, but time at the menus don't.</p>
<p>o&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Career Wins</b> - Win matches.<a href="http://img.bhs4.com/2f/6/2f61958e979e3040b8adb7e18ebd1bc973b161ef_large.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</a></p>

<p>Medals are necessary for <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">challenges</span>, but for the most part they're self-explanitory. You earn medals for things you do in-game. Rescue a teammate in second chance? Medic medal. Avenge a teammate after they've
 been killed? Avenger medal. There are a number of medals that have challenges associated with them, and others that do not. The challenges all have only one level and offer 700 exp as a reward. They all require earning the medal 20 times. The exception is
 the first one, for tomahawks.</p>

<li><b>Pro Perk Challenges - Perk 1</b> </li></ul>

<p>Weapon challenges are all the same and they're all boring. Unlike Modern Warfare 2, where completing the challenges net you special titles and emblems, the only thing you gain from these challenges is EXP. Every weapon has essentially the same challenges.
 Get kills, get headshots. The only difference between tiers is the number you need. As you could guess, with the launchers, the challenges become "kill air support" and occasionally kill players, when the option is available. Don't worry about these challenges;
 just let them happen while you use your weapons of choice.</p>

<p>Stay alive longer and increase your kill/death ratio with these highly-effective tips for Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer. Take your time, know the map, and avoid dangerous areas to increase your multiplayer effectiveness. Read on for more.</p>
<ul>
<li>The multiplayer in <a href="http://call-of-duty.alteredgamer.com/cod-black-ops/91772-perks-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> is perhaps the most addicting the series has ever had to offer. Even after putting in countless hours and achieving multiple levels of prestige, even the best players are constantly looking for an additional edge, a way to increase
 their kill/death ratio and constantly top the in-game leaderboard. After playing for several months now, our experts here at Sinister Syndicate have compiled some of their favorite tips and tricks for gaining that edge over your opponents. Some of these tips
 may seem obvious enough to seasoned players, but there’s bound to be something on the list that can improve your game, regardless of your rank or skill level.
</li><li><b>Use Your Mini Map</b> </li></ul>
<p>This may seem like a pretty obvious thing to say, but I know there are many people out there who don’t take advantage of everything their in-game mini map has to offer. When your team has a spy plane up, you can use the mini map to track the movement of
 any enemy player who isn’t using the Ghost perk. You can also use it to spot enemies who are firing unsuppressed nearby, with or without a spy plane in the air. It’s best to play with one eye on your screen and another on your mini map. Using it correctly
 and effectively means you have advance warning of most enemies as they advance on your position and you can quickly locate enemies that are firing on your teammates (or you) nearby. You can also press the start button while you’re in a match to bring up a
 full map of the battle area. Use this to track enemies that are far away and communicate to your teammates where they’re headed. You can’t fight with the map up, so I recommend hiding first, but with a spy plane in the air this map can be an invaluable source
 of recon.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Use the Edges of the Map</b> </li></ul>
<p>The center of the map, especially in objective-based modes like Domination and Headquarters, is a merciless meat grinder. Those who run through are basically asking to be shot at from all sides and killed before they can accomplish anything positive for
 their team. Covering the middle of the map, as a lot of top players know, is a great way to get a ton of kills, taking out those who fail to heed the advice in the first paragraph of this section. If you need to get from one side of the map to another, and
 you’d like to arrive alive, your best bet is to move around the edges of the map. Out here, chances are there’s only one way for an enemy to come at you, and you can pay attention to that approach as you move. In the center of the map, there are just too many
 potential hiding spots and approaches to cover. Move around the outside, stay alive, and take or defend that position you’re headed for, rather than dying before you’re halfway there.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Avoid Obvious Positions</b> </li></ul>
<p>This tip is mostly for objective-based gametypes. When you’re playing Headquarters or Domination, defending a position by standing on it is simply a bad idea. Most objectives have multiple approaches, and even with a well-placed claymore you’re only going
 to be able to cover two at maximum. Instead, take up a position overlooking the entrance to the building that contains the objective or the objective itself. Position C in the Berlin Wall map is a good example of this. Smart players cover it from the building
 across the street, rather than by standing directly on the objective. This way, even cautious players will conclude the area is clear and rush into the objective, allowing you to pick them off with relative ease. Yes, there are those who will frown on camping
 like this, but in objective-based modes it’s pretty much the name of the game. Find a place where players will run past you to get to the objective and you’ll rack up a massive amount of kills taking out players so focused on the objective that they fail to
 watch their surroundings.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Don’t Rush</b> </li></ul>
<p>Which leads me to tip number four: don’t rush in without looking around first. Players who continually run headlong for objectives or to the place where a teammate has just died typically end up becoming a similar icon themselves. Keep your eyes open, move
 slowly, check out popular hiding spots before moving in to capture an objective. Aim down the sights and cover corners as you move through a building. Yes, it slows you down, but it’s still much faster than dying and having to run all the way back. Don’t forget
 to stop and take a deep breath if you find yourself getting frustrated. Getting angry and rushing back to the spot where you just died almost always ends with you watching a kill cam. Take your time, find a smart way to approach and you’ll end up getting the
 drop on your enemy, rather than ceaselessly rushing to be slaughtered repeatedly.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Know the Map</b> </li></ul>
<p>Again, this seems obvious, but I’m still discovering places where I can jump up and get behind unsuspecting enemies, even in the original maps. No position is unassailable. The upstairs cargo container on Firing Range, for example, has three possible approaches.
 The most obvious, the staircase, is the only one most players bother to cover. It’s incredibly easy to get the drop on someone camping up there by using the stack of tires or the nearby fence outside. Knowing the map allows you to get into oft-overlooked places
 like the tower and catwalk on Summit. People aren’t used to checking these areas as they move around the map, and you can get a lot of kills as they run right past you. Take the time to get to know the maps well. Start a local match and just explore, jumping
 onto anything and everything you see. Getting into an out of the way place can lead to massive amounts of kills, and knowing how to get to people hiding in one can greatly relieve the frustration for you and the rest of your team. Even the best Call of Duty:
 Black Ops multiplayer players know that they can always find a way to improve their game. These tips can help players of any level, from noob to guru, to improve their kill/death ratio and maximize their effectiveness. No matter what gametype you prefer, these
 five tips will keep you alive longer and ensure you’re taking out as many enemies as possible.</p>

<h2>            Regarding Chinese Pinyin IME, how to import a file of user-defined phrases exported from win7 to win10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used Win7 Chinese pinyin IME for many years and used the "User-defined phrase tool" to built up a big library file.&nbsp; When I upgraded one of my PCs to Win10 two years ago, I found that Chinese pinyin IME had serious regressions as mentioned in&nbsp;https://www.pinyinjoe.com/faq/windows-10-missing-broken-chinese-features.htm.&nbsp;
 I have been waiting for the update badly.&nbsp; Its seems that Windows 10 build 15002 makes a big improvement.&nbsp; Now I can see User defined Phrases.&nbsp; Then, my question is how to import the old Win7 library which I have been built for many years.&nbsp; In Win7, I can
 export the library as a txt file.&nbsp; Win10 imports and exports user defined phrases through .dat files.&nbsp; Are they the same?&nbsp; It seems that .dat is a binary file while .txt file is a unicode text file.&nbsp; What happens if I import the win7 .txt file to win10?&nbsp; &nbsp;If
 my win7 library of phrases can be imported to win10, my suffering in the past 2 years can end finally.&nbsp; Please help me out.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi JD, <br />
<br />
Considering you're running Windows 10 1709, you can only import/export .DAT file. Unlike Windows 10 1607, you can import/export the .TXT file extension.&nbsp; To check the build and version of your Windows, press
<strong>Windows key + R</strong> &gt; type <strong>winver </strong>&gt; hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your reply.

            I am running Win 10 version 1703 (OS Build 15063.850).&nbsp; Did you mean that 1607 supported txt but 1709 stopped the supporting?&nbsp; I should have captured that moment to import my txt library to Wiin 10?&nbsp; But, it is not reasonable.&nbsp; I have rejected all the
 opportunities upgrading my other machines to Win10 because of this regression.&nbsp; &nbsp;Does MS have a plan to solve this regression?&nbsp; My library file has more than 1500 phrases.&nbsp; How can I re-import them one by one?&nbsp; Also, even if I do that manually, how do I have
 confidence that MS will not change from .dat to another data format in the future without considering the regression involved?

    <title>Machines do not have security permissions to update DNS records - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Machines do not have security permissions to update DNS records</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are running into an odd issue with machines not updating their own DNS records. Upon further investigation we noticed that a decent amount of machines do not have the security permissions to update their own records. All over different subnets and VLANs.
 Has anyone ever run into this issue or may have an idea of what may be going on? Any help would be appreciated, this is making software deployment a pain.

<h2>            Meu XBOX veio com service date.</h2>
                    
<p>Comprei o XBOX SLIM esse fim de semana 15/09 na minha cidade, hoje quando fui olhar estava o famoso service date, pretendo ir trocar logo amanhã, mas tenho algumas duvidas:</p>

<p>O vendedor não me deu nota fiscal, só tem o selo de garantia no console com a data e tudo certo, se ele não quiser trocar por um novo, eu posso chamar a policia ? trabalhei o mês todo pra ter meu conforto e acontece uma ***/ dessa... ja fiquei irritado de
 ver aquilo no meu brinquedo novo, se ele não quiser trocar eu vou ficar loco...</p>

<p>Obrigado a ajuda =D</p>

                    Okay so I bought my laptop from Future Shop and got an AntiVirus along with a two discs called Recovery Media for Windows Vista. I want to reinstall Vista. When I put in the recovery disc 1 of 2, I go to My Computer and choose the disc drive,&nbsp; it gives
 me a list of files and folders including the following:<br />

ZZImages (folder)<br />
!V5_01_07.VRP (file)<br />
BOOTMGR (file)<br />
DATA (file)<br />
PLANDATA (file)<br />
<br />
There are no installation files except for one I found in the BOOT folder named ETFSBOOT. When I click on this file then I get the following error:<br />

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am a Microsoft Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with possible resolution to the issue you are reporting.
<br />
<br />Open up the Control Panel by pressing the Windows key (or opening the Start menu/screen if you don't have one) and typing “Control Panel”. In the left-side panel, select “Turn Windows features on or off.” Disable features by unchecking them on the left.
<br />
<br />Let me know if this resolved your issue.
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.

<h2>            Time&#39;s up in time limits during an unblocked time</h2>
                    I have the parental control time limit blocked during late night early morning hours when I can't steward my son on the computer. So between 8am and 10 pm, he is allowed on the standard account. Yet various times during the day the pop up warning that
 he has only 15 minutes unless the admin gives him more time. I am assuming the time limits follows the time zone on my computer, or is there a glitch in this program?

                    My Surface Pro 4 is less than six months old.&nbsp; It worked fine yesterday when I put it to sleep normally.&nbsp; When I turned it on this morning, Windows would not boot up and I get an error message that says INACCESABLE_BOOT_DEVICE.&nbsp; I always update when asked
 and the last update was 5 or 6 days ago and it has worked since.&nbsp; Please help.

<h2>            update problems</h2>
                    
<p>Having problems with the override.dspack. Starting to update then it shuts down (in WoT) the connection to the server. So I'm stuck in an endless update procedure. Fix?</p>

<p>Delete all the WoT game content on your xbox. Go to system settings, select storage, select your harddrive; then find the World of Tanks folder in the games and apps main folder. Highlight it and press Y. &nbsp;and then delete. Afterwards download the game from
 marketplace and let it install all the game files fresh.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you cant/dont want to install it all over again; you can try doing a defragmentation. Hold left and right bumper buttons and Y and then press start at the starting screen after you launch the game.
