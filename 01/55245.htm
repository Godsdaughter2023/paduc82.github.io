<h2>            DVD Drive will not read discs &#40;DVD or CD&#41; after Windows 8.1 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded my Lenovo B570 notebook form Windows 7 to Windows 8.1 PRO. Since then the DVD drive will not read any DVD or CD. The device is shown in Device Manager as Optiarc DVD RW AD-7710H. Driver shows as cdrom.sys, version 6.3.9600.16384. When
 the DVD is inserted it whirs for a while but doesn't read the disc. I've tried the FixIT's on the MS website and the recommended Regedit stuff, updated driver, uninstalled and reinstalled, scanned for hardware changes but nothing has worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I then tried an external USB Samsung SE-S084F and exactly the same although when the disc is inserted it whirred briefly and the device kept disappearing and then reappearing in Device Manager. Very odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and suggestions welcome. I'm struggling.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for this. Yes, that's the registry key I cheeked for sure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded &nbsp;the gear drivers and they haven't fixed it. There are now two drivers showing against the device in Device Manager, the original Microsoft one and the Gear one.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried the registry key above, no difference.</p>
<p>Uninstalled, reinstalled devices, no difference</p>

<h2>            Delaying an ethernet connection</h2>
                    <p>Is there a way to delay or change the order of the boot process of an ethernet connection?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every morning when booting up our computers we get a warning message that windows was not able to connect to all network drives and windows displays a red X on our network drives. If you actually click on the drive name it allows you&nbsp;to connect and the red
 X for that drive disappears. The problem is that a couple of the programs we are running does not recognize&nbsp;that you can connect and you have to back out of the program open windows explorer and go into the drives&nbsp;to clear the red X and the open the program
 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the&nbsp;boot process would&nbsp;hold off a few seconds OR if there is a way to automatically clear the error once it realizes that there is actually a connection available please&nbsp;let me know.</p>

            We had this exact situation on our workstations in an office i used to work at and the only solution we could come up with was create a batch file that did the drive mappings.
<br />Then every time i user logged in they would run the batch file or you could add the batch file to their login script.
<br />Because i could not find a way to delay the network connectivity.

            How much delay do you need?
<br />
<br />Extending Sarah's idea, your network software probably has some sort of login script, both at the network and user level.  Maybe you can add a "timer" to delay the login long enough for the connect to work.

<p>Expanding a little on the other contributions, here is what you could to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run these commands just once on each workstation:<br />
net&nbsp; use&nbsp; *&nbsp; /del&nbsp; /yes<br />
net use&nbsp; /persisten:no<br />
They will prevent Windows from remembering shared connections and avoid the error messages.</li><li>Place this batch file into the Startup folder you seel below:<br />
@echo off<br />
timeout&nbsp; 10 &gt; nul<br />
net use&nbsp; S:&nbsp; \\YourServer\Staff<br />
net use&nbsp; H:&nbsp; \\YourServer\HumanResource<br />
The first command will insert a delay of 10 seconds.<br />
Here is the Startup folder:<br />
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup</li></ol>
<p>If the machines are in a domain then you should adjust the domain logon script accordingly.</p>

<h2>            Not so Happy Anymore. I hope no one will have to go through this.</h2>
                    <p>I am pissed. I find this some what my fault but Microsoft has a lot of fault in this problem too (they aren't even taking&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;for it.)</p>
<p>So, long story short, I bought a windows surface RT. As this being my first tablet I was happy and excited to see what a windows tablet can do for me. Also I need one for college since my laptop was too heavy to carry around. I was fairly happy
 with my windows surface RT yet I had problems with it. My kick stand came in the package already in bad condition and my touch screen was not&nbsp;responding half the time even with my cover touch mouse pad. I thought my touch screen troubles were maybe because
 this item was fairly new and there were going to be updates to fix it. I just like any average person out in this world, I am not a&nbsp;mechanic I don't know that touch screen issues has to do with the inside of the tablet?! When my sister's friend had told me
 so that touch screens can be an inside problem, I was planning on shipping it back to&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;as an touch malfunction. On top of this I was planning on buying the extended warranty (reason for it will be later explained). However, just my luck, I dropped
 my tablet faced down. I had gotten three large cracks across the screen and I felt my heart drop. I quickly check to see if my 1 year warranty covered for any cracked damages. It didn't and I was furious! I was told by an sales&nbsp;associate&nbsp;that I was already
 given an 90 day warranty on my tablet so I did not need to buy an extra warranty. I took his word for it and right before the day I had damaged my surface I founded out that the 1 year warranty does not cover for accidental damages. I had talked to about 3
 different people from&nbsp;Microsoft and 2/3 did not do their best to find other ways to work around this problem while 1/3 did. I believe her name was Shawn and I do applaud Shawn for her excellent customer service. She treated me well like as if I were one of
 her friends. However the other handful of representatives did not do so. Not only does it show a lack of service but it shows that they do not care for the customers. When I was talking to the Shawn who was trying her best to work around my problems and find
 loop holes so I do not need to pay an 320$ for this repair, I had told her that I had an a lot of touch malfunctions before my crack had happened. She took note of everything and told me to try to send my tablet as a touch malfunctions. I did and I felt like
 there were some hope. The tablet, on the way to the company, there weren't any problem. After it was received I had gotten an email stating that my tablet was received and the a team was going to look into my damages. A few days later I had received an email
 stating that my tablet was shipped back to me, nothing more. Not even an sorry we could not exchange or repair your item. Nothing was said so I had thought that my tablet was being exchanged/repaired. I was extremely happy!</p>
<p>This is were the problem comes in. I was trying to track my package and guess what, who in the world would make such extreme error as to sending me an incorrect tracking number. I shop mostly on the internet and I have NEVER, EVER had an experience
 like this. I could not track my package! I had contacted Fedex thinking maybe something was wrong. No, nothing was wrong with fedex. I contacted Microsoft in my count at least 4-5 times. Everyone told me different answers but they all said something in&nbsp;common.
 They all said it was strange that I had received an incorrect tracking number. They had also told me that the care team was supposed to contact me within 3-5 days. Guess what? NO ONE CONTACTED ME. I recalled numerously and they all said that the care team
 should be contacting me soon and NO ONE DID and still to this day, NO ONE DID. I had to wait 4-5 extra days for my item to be shipped back to me. The more problematic situation was my tracking information was not available until TWO DAYS before my package
 arrived, now how does that make any sense? I was furious to open my package and find my original tablet placed nice and neatly inside. I had been given a sheet explaining possible reasons as to why my item was unable to be exchanged and yes I do understand
 these reason are no all valid but only 2 of out the 10 listed reasons were valid reasons. I was angry and I had given a call to&nbsp;Microsoft once again to find out that they only way to fix my problem was to pay the 320$. Really? Really, Microsoft? I was even
 more angry to find out that my tablet touch screen came back to me in worsened conditions. I really an not convinced that it takes less than two weeks for the touch on my screen to become worse. HOW, Just how is it that when I shipped my tablet to Microsoft,
 only little areas around the crack did not&nbsp;respond but when I receive my item back in less in two weeks almost 70% of my screen does respond? Just how does that happen? The person whom I was on the phone with told explained to me that the pressure of the crack
 can cause this and its just is similar to if I were to crack the screen on a touch phone. But I am not convinced that it takes less than two weeks for 70% of my screen to become&nbsp;non-respondent. That is just pure bull. Why? I cracked my old phones touch screen
 a few years back and my touch is responding perfectly fine throughout the years.</p>
<p>I am furious now. I had to wait a little close to two weeks knowing that was problem was solved and to find out that I had just receive my, now even more worsened condition, tablet. Why did I just waste two weeks of waiting for something that was
 going to be send back as the same? Oh and now they are telling me to pay 320$ for a repair after two weeks of wasted time. To be honest, even if I lack the knowledge of a mechanic I am well aware that IT IS NOT HARD OR THAT COSTLY TO REPLACE A DAMAGED SCREEN.
 I really do not understand why it takes 320$ to repair a crack screen!!? WHY? I paid close to 700$ for this piece of tablet, why does it cost 320$ to get my screen repaired? I find that just&nbsp;ridiculous&nbsp;in so many ways. I still can not believe the care team
 or whom ever was supposed to contact me, still hasn't, its been close to a week now. I have nothing nice to say about my experience besides that one nice lady, Shawn, who tried her ultimate best to help me in which ever way possible. Sorry to say but, its
 hard to see me buying any windows product for a while. I rather buy from an different company who shows&nbsp;dedication to their customers. Out of about in total 7-8 people who I talked to only one was able to help me in ever way possible. Really? I give a sarcastic
 applaud to customer service that I had experienced. I can not express how utterly&nbsp;shameful it is to send to the customer an incorrect tracking number. I do realize that everyone makes mistakes but within a huge corporation it is just unheard of to send someone
 an incorrect tacking number. It makes me mad because only ONE person apologized for this mistake on the phone and the rest did nothing to take&nbsp;responsibility&nbsp;for some of their mistake. All they did was state how strange it was and blamed it on other groups
 within Microsoft. The person whom I was talking with did not apologized for any of their mistakes not even when I stated that my touch screen was in worsen condition. All they did was point at others and blame blame blame. I had worked as an sales associate
 within huge companies before, such as Macy's. We are put through an intensive training and a huge chunk of it has to do with the way we handle customer service. We are taught that no matter the situation or who's fault it is, it is always the sales associate's
 job to firstly apologize and find every possible way to solve this matter. Again only 1 out of the many I had talked to did so. Thus, I give customer service experience a thumbs down and a F for failure.</p>
<p>I hope many people read and I hope that no one has to go through what I had to.&nbsp;Unfortunately, now I have no choice but to pay 320$. However I refuse to pay this money! Only one out the all the&nbsp;Representative whom I have talked to apologized and
 spoke to me if I was like their friend, trying their ultimate best to help me. I demand someone to take responsibility for all&nbsp;the mistakes Microsoft had done. I refuse to pay 320$ for an exchange or an repair. My experience with Microsoft has just a well
 rounded FAIL.</p>

            Hi, I am not here to pick fights or even start any. Firstly I am a girl. Secondly, I bought my tablet on the February of 14. Thus, I am stating this story due to the fact that I only had about two week to even get to use my tablet. Also while yes I did
 in fact drop it, and yes I do take full&nbsp;responsibility for my surprising clumsiness. However, Microsoft did not. That is why I wrote the run down of what exactly happened in within two or so weeks. Also I was unaware that it was a defected device. I lack the
 knowledge to realize it. Yet, I explained I thought it was due to the fact that the device was a newly developed tablet and just maybe the frequent updates were going to fix it. Also the kickstand did not bother me. It only did when Microsoft blamed that I
 had broken it. Also I am not "kicking a fuss" I am simply, like I said, stating the events that had happened. Also "messed up" is fine. Everyone messes up but it is not fine with they do not apologize neither take responsibility for th

<h2>            Surface Headphones not playing sound while connected</h2>
                    <p>I've had this ongoing issue with my surface headphones through multiple factory-resets on both my iphone&nbsp;6 and surface book.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The song or video will be playing, but no sound will come from the device or the headphones for about 15-30 seconds, or sometimes longer and I am forced to restart the headphones. Sometimes opening the Cortana&nbsp;app causes the sound to start, sometimes it
 doesn't. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens every time I turn on the headphones, and after it says it is connected to said device. I am really frustrated by having to wait so long for my headphones to finally start play, or open my phone again to try to force the headphones to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To answer all the questions:</p>
<p>as I said before it is happening on both devices</p>
<p>It happens with all apps I've tried, including Netflix, Youtube, and Spotify</p>
<p>No changes I know of, it's been happening the whole time I've had them.</p>
<p>It didn't&nbsp;happen with the Bluetooth headphones I had before but I've since given those away so I can't test it now</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done all of those things many times on both devices. I'd like to know if other people with the headphones have had this problem but it almost seems like not enough people have bought them to have a solid test base. If other people have this issue
 a patch update would likely fix it</p>

<p>Hi Equiarius,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the information. In this case, there's something to do with the Surface Headphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you try to unpaired (Bluetooth) all of your devices that is connected to the Surface Headphone then paired one device at a time and make sure that only one devices that is connected to Surface Headphone. Also, can you try to use the wired cable that
 came with the Surface Headphone.&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>Have you updated the firmware on your Surface headphones since you got them ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was surprised to find out just today that there was an update that has fixed alot of issues users were experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The support page is here&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4469758/update-surface-headphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4469758/update-surface-headphones</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works fine, and I have had no issues at all since the upgrade, where-as before I had many syncing issues, spotty connection issues etc. Even the audio and sound cancellation is much much better than before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fingers crossed M$ has finally ironed out all the bugs.</p>

            <p>Hi George, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the post on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the description of the issue, you would like to install Smart Panel for Epson 1240 in Windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Do you get any error when you try to install it?<br />
2) Did you get installation disk?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per now, Microsoft does not&nbsp;have any information on the compatibility of this program in windows 8.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>If you are still not able to install it then please contact the manufacturer supports team.

    <title>Surface Pro 4 won&#39;t boot from downloaded Recovery Image &#40;via - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> logidelic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 won&#39;t boot from downloaded Recovery Image &#40;via USB drive&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to restore my surface to factory default. I have tried all the easy methods from within Windows, but there are still some major issues, so I decided to download a recovery image.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Entered my serial number <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> and downloaded the correct recovery image.<br />
</li><li>Ran the recovery Drive app to create a bootable USB (16GB stick) recovery drive<br />
</li><li>Copied all files from the downloaded image to the USB drive.&nbsp;<em>Overwrote</em> conflicting files,
<em>as per the Microsoft instructions.</em></li></ol>
<p><br />
The USB drive will not boot, even though I have correctly set it as the first drive in the boot order. I have also tried swiping the drive in the UEFI menu and choosing "Boot this drive now." Instead of booting the recovery drive, it just brings me back into
 the UEFI settings after reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: If I stop before #3 and do not copy the downloaded recovery image files, the USB drive can boot! Obviously this is a big clue. Is there something I could be doing wrong when copying the recovery image files to the USB drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I'm a programmer with ~20 years of experience. Not that you should trust me, but I'm not an idiot and I've re-attempted the entire process above 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Try using the Rufus tool <a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.akeo.ie/</a> and format FAT32 (GPT). Use a different 16GB USB stick if you can. 
<br />
<br />To start your Surface from your USB recovery drive:
<br />Step 1:	Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in.
<br />Step 2: 	Insert your USB recovery drive into the USB port on your Surface.
<br />Step 3:	Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power button on your Surface.
<br />Step 4: 	When the Surface logo appears, release the volume button.
<br />Step 5: 	Follow the on-screen instructions, such as selecting the language and keyboard layout, to enter the recovery tools menu, etc.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. If it was of assistance, please DO mark as Answer.

<p>
</p><p>Battlefield 1&nbsp;shows up in the 'Get More With Gold' screen, but when I select it, the screen switches to Overcooked, one of last months free offerings. If I select that, I get the&nbsp;Xbox Stores screen, stating there is a problem with the Xbox service and 'Status

<p>
</p><p>I can't claim my free game on&nbsp;my PC&nbsp;either, I tried...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Xbox Live Gold membership fully paid up&nbsp;until 2020, so that's not the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or advice would be much appreciated, as Battlefield 1 would be nice to own, should I ever get an Xbox One...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any constructive help.</p>

<p>Well one battlefield 1 is NOT an xbox 360 game</p>
<p>Therefore cannot be claimed on the xbox 360&nbsp; or downloaded onto it</p>
<p>You have to download from the websiteas the 360 doesnt have access to the xbox one marketplace</p>

<p>It sounds like your laptop version of Photos hasn't been updated in a long time. &nbsp;In November it became very different. &nbsp;The other explanation is that it has a more advanced version than has been reported here, in which case we'll all soon be happier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can avoid the navigation pane by not moving your mouse and using your keyboard's delete button and arrow keys. &nbsp;But you'll still need the pane to easily add the picture to an album. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xbox One No Signal</h2>
                    
<p>So I've had this issue for a week now, and I've tried the "Do it yourself" power cycles, cache clears and factory reset techniques. Either they don't work or I've done them wrong because still I stare at a blank screen upon turning on my console. As the
 subject implies, no matter which HDMI cable I use or television I plug it into, no signal can be found. I am using the out port. I've not had this console for even six months now and without the warranty I'm not liking the idea of paying to have repairs done
 only to have the same issue another five months down the road. What exactly can be done here, if anything?</p>

<p>Hi pogo! Have you tried booting in low-resolution mode? Hold power for about 8 seconds, then wait for the power brick light to turn steady orange.</p>
<p>Now, to start up, hold the EJECT button and power sensor until you hear a beep to turn on the console. Wait for it to start up, then see if you see a picture. It should be in low-res, 640x480 mode, and should allow you to reset the video to the right settings.</p>
<p>More info can be found here:</p>

<p>Also, this is a "simple" question, but believe me, stranger things have happened - have you cycled through all of your television's inputs? I've had it happen where my TV comes up blank, only to realize the cat stepped on the remote and switched inputs without
 me knowing it!</p>

<p>I had an issue close to that. With mine the only thing that would come on was the light in the power button and the fans. My TV never got a signal from the Xbox. It started when my power went out. I could turn it on turn it off and insert and eject games.
 I had to send mine in for repair. They sent me back a replacement.</p>

<h2>            Windows stays semi-responsive or completely breaks</h2>
                    <p>This has been happening frequently and is getting very annoying. So it happens 100% randomly with no prior warning and when it happens its easy to tell, whatever application is open at the time will still working. So Chrome for example whatever was loaded
 on the page prior to the "crash" will still work the scrolling will work, but whatever wasn't loaded such as images will not load until Windows will start responding again also with pressing links on the page will not work. This is with any application such
 as Spotify whenever the crash happens a clip of the song will play over and over until Windows responds again. The mouse always works even when it turns not responsive and hovering over an item it will respond like the windows button it will turn into the
 accent color but clicking it is useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And sometimes VERY Randomly it breaks and BSOD shows the stop code is like System Stop Exception. I already tried Windows Driver Verifier and after 24 hours nothing has crashed. The BSOD has been showed twice to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already done RAM tests and no problems, My S.M.A.R.T scores for my HDD's (2 1x SSD 1x HDD) are decent. The SSD being in the high 90's and the HDD being in the 80's.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help its really getting annoying it freezing. Its been happening for the past 1 1/2 years and I've already tried refreshing windows which fixes the problem for like 5 months and it returns.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue that you are experiencing regarding the performance of your computer and blue screen error "System Stop Exception" may be caused by a bad sector of your hard drive. As our initial troubleshooting step, we recommend that you open your command prompt
 and type <strong>chkdsk /f /r </strong>to repair bad sectors if there is any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on the result.</p>

<p>Yes I did so and I got this</p>
</p><p><strong>Windows has scanned the file system and found no problems.</strong><br />
<strong>No further action is required.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the /f /r parameters afterwards I did that as well and it says&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another</strong><br />
<strong>process. &nbsp;Would you like to schedule this volume to be</strong><br />
<strong>checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N)</strong><br />
</p>
<p>I press <strong>Y&nbsp;</strong>and I restart right after and in less than 5 seconds I see a message popup on the bottom Scanned and Repaired C: 100%.
</p>
<p>After the 24 hours my system crashed (BSOD) and it said Driver .... and I think it was from that Driver Verifier and got a file in my Minidump should I upload it?</p>

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

    <title>Why does Media Player keep dropping audio stream&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Media Player keep dropping audio stream&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 Media Player will not sustain streaming audio for some reason. I have to keep closing&nbsp;Media Player&nbsp;and then relaunch by reclicking the stream icon on the radio website.&nbsp;As I keep reconnecting to the audio, eventually the&nbsp;internet connection itself
 is also disrupted by relegating my router connection from "connected" to "limited access" status. Also, sometimes in the process of trying to re-establish the stream, a window will appear stating that "Windows has encountered an error". Before my most recent
 upgrade this window used to read "Windows cannot find the file"</p>

            <p>Could be a weak or fluctuating bandwidth from the radio station website. </p>
<p>You should just leave it and see if WMP can buffer the flux.</p>
<p>You can either persist or&nbsp;ask your ISP to upgrade your bandwidth.</p>

<h3> mrpc_jazz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Re-Activation</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently had to replace my motherboard (twice!) and now my Windows 10 system will not re-activate. I just get activation error: 0x803FABBA, for which I cannot find any information for. I've 'told' Windows that the re-activation was due to a hardware change;
 but that doesn't help. I'm not sure if it makes any difference but whilst my machine was being repaired I was using Windows 10 on another machine (Laptop). Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi, I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I posted my as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2&nbsp;identical laptops, Compaq laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded one to windows 10.</p>
<p>I kept windows 7 on 2nd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now&nbsp;1st was having a hardware problem due to its motherboard malfunction.</p>
<p>I pulled HDD from 1st with Windows 10 on it, and replaced into 2nd one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, 2nd laptop boots, but Windows 10 is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned, there is NO listing on LINKED DEVICES, even though you can verify them logging into MSN.COM account, in the reactivation dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though I linked 2 different computers, they will show up in MSN.COM account under Linked DEVICES, but&nbsp;none of them&nbsp;show up in actual reactivation window dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my conclusion is that MS does not want anyone&nbsp;to transfer any license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says RETAIL CHANNEL version of windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The free Windows 10 license is tied to the motherboard in the upgraded machine.</p>
<p>So when you move your hard disk with Windows 10 on it is not activated on the other computer. When you have a retail ver. you may well get it moved, but you need to contact received Microsoft Activation Department :-)</p>

Hello Michael, I have the same problem and my husband called the Microsoft Activation Center for my new PC. Last year I upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 on my old PC but it became much too slow. So we bought a new I7 PC for me. My&nbsp;harddisk was copied to a brandnew
 SSD and all worked fine for almost 6 month. Then my mainboard broke and had to be changed on guarantee.&nbsp;After that&nbsp;my licence was off&nbsp;with a. m. error code. And&nbsp;the Microsoft Activation Center is not willing to reactivate my license because of that fact that
 I have a new PC.&nbsp;Her advice was to&nbsp;buy a new&nbsp;Win 10&nbsp;Home Premium Licence from the own store.&nbsp;So they turn the free Windows 10&nbsp;upgrade from Windows 7 into&nbsp;money 6 month after. From my opinion this is as same not fair and of course not moral&nbsp;correct.&nbsp;I remember
 a time when Microsoft was much different! Too make a long story short: No support from Microsoft for above mentioned error code! Very poor...

            Hi DorotheeS,<br />
<br />
Regarding activation, there is a difference whether it is a retail or an OEM license type, since an OEM is the ones that belongs the computers thats is buyed together. They can not be "moved" to another PC. On the other hand, you can move a retail.<br />
<br />
What type of license is what you have / had?

            Dear Michael, thank you very much for getting back to me. Regarding your question: The woman from Microsoft&nbsp;customers board spoke about the same. Since we know that this should be those a. m. OEM version.&nbsp;I hear&nbsp;what you say but I am a simple customer
 and please understand my position that I'm NOT familiar with those specific details.&nbsp;If I buy a PC&nbsp;it doesn't interest a customer if it is this or this version.&nbsp;Everything - cumulated - coast so much money at the end of the day,&nbsp;almost 700 Euro for a new PC,
 now as&nbsp;I learned&nbsp;135&nbsp;Euro there for a new (XP &gt; Vista &gt; Windows 7 &gt; Windows 8 &lt; Windows 7 &gt; Windows 10)&nbsp;licence (if you have a broken mainboard or PC change), on the other&nbsp;hand suddenly&nbsp;incompatible hardware/software&nbsp;don't work anymore&nbsp;with the new upgrade(s)
 and and and. Michael, we discussed all that with our friends and colleagues&nbsp;and many of us think that&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;since years is on a w

<p>Never! I couldn't leave the good old OXF. Anyway, the more people who leave, the more attractive the case for removing the UK forums and rolling them into the international (i.e American) forums becomes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Imagine that for a moment. Sharing a forum with people who think that some bloke called Steve Carell is a better David Brent than Ricky Gervais.</p>
