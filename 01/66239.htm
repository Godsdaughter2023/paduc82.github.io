            Hi James.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can see if either of these help:
<br /> <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-change-the-default-font-for-composing-emails-in-Windows-10-Mail-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-change-the-defau...</a>

<br />
<br />You can also increase all text and object size to compensate in Settings &gt; System &gt; Display under Scaling.  Start with 125% which may be too large so you can instead set a Custom Scaling around 117% works for me.
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. I will also track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

    <title>Windows XP 32 Bit - Genuine Validation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianrobertsbpr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP 32 Bit - Genuine Validation</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to download Windows Media Player V11. Microsoft's web page directs me to the validation program which I have downloaded and run successfully to get the validation code. Unfortunately when I click "Continue" (after entering the validation code)
 I don't get the download page but some generic screen about microsoft programs. If I go through the options to finally get to Windows Media player V11 (for Windows XP 32 bit) the whole validation process starts again - I have even generated a 2nd validation
 code but I still end up going round in circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anybody help please. Thanks</p>

            <p>Try using Internet Explorer for the whole download cycle - it sounds as if you've been using Firefox.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, reset the Internet Options Security settings to default, and try again.</p>
<p>If it still doesn't work, post an MGADiag report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To properly analyse and solve problems with Activation and Validation, we need to see a full copy of the report produced by the MGADiag tool
<br />
(download and save to desktop - <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=52012</a> )<br />
&nbsp;Once saved, run the tool. <br />
Click on the Continue button, which will produce the report.<br />
&nbsp;To copy the report to your response, click on the Copy button in the tool (ignore any error messages at this point), and then paste (using either r-click/Paste, or Ctrl+V ) into your response.<br />
&nbsp; - **in your own thread**, please<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please also state the Version and Edition of Windows quoted on your COA sticker (if you have one) on the case of your machine (or inside the battery compartment), but do NOT quote the Key on the sticker!<br />

            Thanks Noel - I have Firefox but have used IE(v8) for access to MS site. I have tried again and this time the site does not even ask for the validation code but goes staight to saying "thanks for validating". The "continue" button then takes me to

            <p>If you hover over them and look in the status bar (you *do* have that enabled?) you will see where the link actually goes to. (that's one of the reasons that I prefer to use 'bare' links (Hmm - the smut filter didn't like my original word there!), rather
 than obscure them under text) Since both links are to the Microsoft site, they should be safe :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;It sounds to me as if you have your security settings rather too high - If you go to Internet Options, and reset the Security zone for Internet to Default, that should allow the ActiveX to work as it's supposed to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Having said that.... I *think* this link may work to bypass the validation requirement for download-

http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=8163</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(it will ask for validation at install time anyhow) If you confirm/deny that, I'll delete it to prevent misuse.

    <title>Skype caller ID SMS verification broken&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> altjx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype caller ID SMS verification broken&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So earlier today I was trying to use my Verizon number to call people from Skype. I got the SMS message, accidentally deleted it, and then tried to re-issue it and now it never sends to my phone, even after hitting the "resend" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to use my 1844 number since it is a virtual phone system and enables SMS messages, but it never sent there either. I have no idea what's going on. I can't imagine that it's my phone, or carrier, since I text back and forth all day every day
 and INDEED receive the Skype SMS verification at least one time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be done to help fix this issue?</p>

<p>Looks like the forums are working again. In Skype for Mac, there is no "Verify Your Number" option in the skype client. Take a look at the screenshot I attached at the bottom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I provided the phone number in the same format where the SMS message worked on the first try. There's got to be some bug going on with my account or something.</p>

<h2>            unable to delete mp4 in windows vista even after changing the ownership.</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>i had tried all methods in the solution given in windows vista to delete off the mp4 files in destop. but everytime, it said permission needed.</p>
<p>I had changed the security for ownership for full control rights. but still unable to.</p>
<p>can you please advice me how to do so?</p>

<p><span>Despite whatever you did with permissions, it is probably still a permissions issue.&nbsp; There is changing permissions to get full rights and there is taking ownership
 - two completely different things and you may need to do both.</span></p>
<span>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read
 only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp; You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop
 this except protect the folder with a password using a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></span></a></span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></span></span><span><br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesnt work, try using one of the following free products to delete the file/folder.&nbsp; File Assassin
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 or without Force Delete: </span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></span></a></span><span>)
 or Unlocker at: </span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly (or you can try this first if you want - it might be faster).&nbsp; If it still doesn't work in normal mode, try doing this in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>oscarpooh,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does this happen only with MP4 files?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The following might prevent you from deleting a file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you do not have the proper rights for a file or folder, you cannot delete it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you didn't create the file, you might not be able to delete it, even if it appears in the Public folder. If that's the case, you need to ask the owner of the
 file to delete it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Ø<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Also, you can't delete a file (or the folder that contains it) if the file is currently open in a program. Make sure that the file is not open in any program,
 and then try to delete the file again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Why can't I delete a file or folder?
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Why-cant-I-delete-a-file-or-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Why-cant-I-delete-a-file-or-folder</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ensure that you are not playing the file when trying to delete it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode and then try to delete
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Boot the computer in safe mode, to do this, follow the steps below,</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the
<strong>F8 key</strong> before <span>Windows</span> starts. On the advanced boot options menu select
</span><strong><span>safe mode</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:
</span></strong><strong><span>File system corruption is preventing access to the file</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may not be able to delete the file if the file system is corrupted. To resolve this issue, run the Chkdsk utility on the disk volume to correct any
 errors.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run Check disk to fix any bad sectors on the hard drive.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on start and in the start search bar type cmd, right click on the command prompt icon in the programs area and then click on run as administrator.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>At the command prompt type
<strong>chkdsk /f </strong>and then press enter. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Now, type in <strong>chkdsk /r </strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>CHKDSK would try to recover bad sectors on the hard disk, during this process there are chances of DATA loss from that particular sector.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if this works
</span></p>

<h2>            Favorites - Select All</h2>
                    Today I wanted to tranfer my favorites onto my Skydrive <br />

- Open IE8 favorites &gt; click one favorite (then tried my normal SHIFT + highlight) to 'pick up' a number at once - NOT POSSIBLE<br />
<br />
It would be nice if you could select all or 'pick up' then drag &amp; drop a couple favorites in IE 8's favorites menu

</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> By default, Internet Explorer creates a Bookmark.htm file in your Documents folder. If you want to use a name other than Bookmark.htm, or if you want to store the exported Favorites in a folder other than the Documents folder, specify
 the new file and folder name. </li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>. <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If you already have a file that has the same name, Internet Explorer asks you to replace it. Click
<strong>Yes</strong> to replace the file. Click <strong>

Would it work with Skydrive if you copied your Bookmarks.html file to it?&nbsp; That is how IE 7 and IE 8 save your Favorites.&nbsp; They are all listed in one HTML file that is stored in Documents.<br />

Hope this helps,<br />

            If you don't have a real Vista installation DVD you don't need to buy one. <span>
The computer mftr. may have given you the Vista System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe Mode. Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. You will need to use third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a>
 ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data.</span>

<h2>            How does Surface integrate to W8 on desktop&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a 32gb Surface RT, but I own a W7 dekstop. I was thinking of upgrading because it has a very nice $40 pricepoint, but I would like to know if there are any advantages to having W8 and Surface instead of just W7.

    <title>How to STOP MS Edge 10 from giving your personal email when you only - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronnienwolf  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to STOP MS Edge 10 from giving your personal email when you only VISIT websites&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This problem started to happen about two months ago when I noticed I started getting a HOST of 'subscriber' emails coming from websites where I only VISITED and did in<strong> no way
</strong>communicate with <strong>or give my personal information</strong>, <strong>
or subscribe </strong>to begin getting their daily email ads!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot relate this to any specific MS-10 Edge&nbsp;downloaded updates and I did not tinker with the edge stings that allows your browsing experience to be 'shared' so you get a glut of adds which show up on your browser page. I sort of live with that aspect
 of MS ridiculous sharing aspect, despite not liking it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>But I DO have a huge problem of visiting random websites that can now glean my private email address, then subscribe me to their daily adds, where the only way to get rid of them is having to 'unsubscribe' to that particular website I only visited!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What ELSE are they doing with my email address I wonder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any body have an answer? I contacted MS Tech support chat and they told me to hit the Default setting in Apps to try and help...It did not work and then the last time when I asked them how to stop....I mysteriously got 'disconnected' So, I assume they
 had no answer and don't know and keeping 'mum' as to this serious security breech in their product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answers or suggestions would be most appreciated - Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>

            HI,  
<br />
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />
<br />1, Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>
<br />
<br />2. Clear browsing history.
<br />
<br />3. Run the SFC scan 
<br />Run the Microsoft Windows Resource Checker tool, also know as "System File Checker" or "sfc". This tool scans and verifies the integrity of all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct versions. Here's how: 
<br />1. Press Windows key + X, click Command Prompt (Admin). 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt, type the following command, sfc /scannow and then press Enter.  
<br />3. Wait until the process completes. This usually doesn’t take longer than 20 minutes with a regular hard disk 
<br />    and takes much shorter when you have a fast SSD drive.  
<br />4. Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the system. 
<br />
<br />4. Repair and reset the app: 
<br />Right-click on the Start menu button, and select Settings. 
<br />Select App, click on Microsoft Edge from the list, and select Advanced options. 
<br />Select Repair. 
<br />If the issue persists, repeat the steps and select Reset. 
<br />
<br />If, all the procedures above didn't work, please try to reset  Edge manually:
<br />
<br />Microsoft Edge doesn’t open, try resetting the browser manually.
<br />Press Windows key + R and type: C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Packages.
<br />
<br />Open the folder labeled Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe and delete all of its content.
<br />
<br />Then, 
<br />1. click Start and type: power shell and right-click Power Shell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />2. Run this command will reinstall Microsoft Edge: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />The command result will appear in the PowerShell window. Exit PowerShell, then try launching Edge again.
<br />
<br />I hope it works,
<br />
<br />Regards. 
<br />
<br />Diego R.

<h2>            Windows 10 Local Area Connection</h2>
                    After upgrading to Win 10, my local connection to my router has been disabled, and whenever I go to re enable it in the Network and Sharing Center it tells me that it has enabled but the icon stays disabled along with the actual connection. Occasionally
 it'll jump to life like nothing happened and be completely enabled and working fine, and other times it wont even let me enable it. Right now I'm stuck to using Wi-Fi and the connection isn't nearly as great as I'd like it to be. Help?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As with previous releases, Windows 10 will be available in 32 and 64 bit architectures. Windows 10 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. In fact, Windows 10 64 bit supports up to 512 GBs of RAM, while Windows 10 32
 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like
 run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 10 64 bit is more secure too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows
 10</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to: Switch from 32 bit versions of Windows to Windows 10 64 bit</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-switch-from-32-bit-versions-of-windows-to/40d90c4e-8845-4bcb-bb2f-aeab312caf74">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-switch-from-32-bit-versions-of-windows-to/40d90c4e-8845-4bcb-bb2f-aeab312caf74</a></strong></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t rename files from flash drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffmdon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t rename files from flash drives</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden I cannot rename files on any of my flash drives. The files I'm trying to rename have been around for a long time and I have never had any problem with renaming anything on flash drives before today. Renaming works fine on files from the hard
 drive. It just suddenly seems to be the flash drives this is happening on. Additionally, I tried what I thought was a clever way around it, but it didn't work either. The specific file I was trying to rename was a LibreOffice .doc document file. So I opened
 a brand new unnamed .doc file and copied and pasted the document's contents from the file I was trying to rename into the new document I created. Then I tried to save the new file with the intended filename, which was the same as the original filename except
 I had some capital letters in it now when it used to be only lower-case. But when I saved the new file, it recognized no difference between it and the original filename(which was in all lower-case). When I told it to replace the original file with this new
 one(with both upper and lower-case), it saved it exactly like the one I told it to overwrite - with all lower-case letters. During subsequent investigations, I found out that I have also not been able to rename anything period on any of my flash drives. I
 can, however, save any new documents with any filenames I want to, but again, those can then no longer be changed.</p>

            Hi. I ran a Norton virus scan and it did not resolve it. Then I copied the contents of the drive to another drive intending on doing a re-format of the original drive I was having the problem with. But before I did, I attempted to see if I could rename
 the filenames in the copies I had placed onto the new drive and they would not rename either. So it would logically seem to me that a re-format of the original drive wouldn't do any good, as I'd just be putting un-renamable files right back onto it. Do you
 agree?

Hi Jeff,<br />
<br />
For us to isolate your concern with renaming file, we would like to know if you have tried running the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker (SFC)</a></strong> scan and use the

<br />
SFC utility allows administrators to perform a scan of all protected resources to verify that they are the correct version. If SFC should find any incorrect versions in any of these protected resources, SFC will replace them with the correct versions, while<br />
DISM, it will resolve some damaged or corrupted system files that SFC can't repair.<br />
<br />
We would appreciate it if you could get back to us and provide us your feedback.<br />

            I'm sorry, but that answer was largely over my head. I've never heard of either of those utilities you mentioned. While I certainly appreciate the fact you're trying to help, I kinda require answers to assume I'm a newbie. I'm a loooonnnggg way from really
 knowing anything beyond what I need to just get by, so an embarrassing amount of computerese is a completely foreign language to me. From what I gather of your answer, I am assuming these utilities are built-in resources...? If so, where would I find them
 and use them? And what is an administrator? I know what one is in the real world, but in in the vein of computers.

            <p>Hello Tracey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience. Let me assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed any further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did this scanner worked on your computer previously?<br />
2. What is the make and the model number of this scanner?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation,&nbsp;I suggest you to check if&nbsp;you have the OCR Program installed.</p>
<p>Fax and scan need to use an OCR Program to function. The OCR Program usually comes on the Printer disk.</p>
<p>Also, be sure that you have downloaded and installed the most recent drivers for the device from the&nbsp;manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, see the following threads for the possible solution:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-fax-unable-to-set-up-account/db5153d7-3de7-4e5d-a0ad-167cb267fdf4">Windows Fax Unable to Set up Account

<h2>            browser works for internet, but apps wont</h2>
                    <p>I have been having this problem for months, and still have not found out how to fix it. I have tried everything, but nothing seems to work and no one seems to know how to fix this problem or what the problem is. Everytime I try to browse the internet on
 any application other than firefox, it does'nt work. Chrome and Edge say I have a proxy server error, but I dont even use a proxy server for my internect connection. I cannot load the windows store or the Xbos app. I cannot download games from steam. I cannot
 access internet from any program you name but firefox. I can download from firefox and no other application. Some games can connect, others can't. The problem is not my router because I have tried changing routers. other info:</p>
<p>
</p><p>i use a wireless adapter to connect to the internet, but i do not see why this would be blocking my connections. And no, I do not use any sort of childblock or safety blocker other than the built in router security. Any ideas what the heck is going on?</p>

            <p>Hello, <br />
<br />
For us to better assist you, we need to get more information:<br />
<br />
• Have you tried running the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows app troubleshooter</a>?<br />
• Have you tried disabling your VPN Client? </p>
<p>The first step in resolving the “can’t connect to the proxy server” is disabling the VPN client in your PC. Though, this is only applicable if you have a working VPN client installed. Follow these steps for guidelines:<br />
<br />
1. Open your VPN client if it's running.</p>
<p>2. Disconnect from the internet by clicking on the disconnect link on your VPN client.<br />
3. Once the VPN client has been disconnected, Close and then Exit.<br />
4. Open Edge or Chrome browser and try to open any web page and see if the error has been resolved.<br />
<br />
• What about disabling your Proxy for LAN? Check steps below to learn how: <br />
<br />
1. Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong><br />
2. A pop up box will appear, type <strong><em>inetcpl.cpl</em></strong> <br />
3. Hit <strong>OK</strong>.<br />
4. A pop up box will give you options to configure, go to the <strong>Connections</strong> tab.<br />
5. Click the <strong>LAN settings</strong> button.<br />
6. Tick the box for "<strong>Automatically detect settings</strong>".<br />
7. At the bottom find <strong>Proxy Server section</strong> and uncheck the box for “<strong>Use the proxy server for your LAN (These settings will not apply to Dial-up or VPN connection)</strong>.
<br />
8. Click on <strong>OK </strong>to save the settings. Then click <strong>Apply</strong> and
<strong>OK</strong> to save the <strong>Internet Properties</strong> settings.<br />
<br />
Now open Google Chrome or Edge and try to open any web page. If everything went right, you should not see the “can’t connect to the proxy server” error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<h2>            passwords</h2>
                    recently got a new computer with win8 on it I'm having so much trouble with passwords its not even funny, I bye passed the password screen but one time it had to be restarted and then you have to have the password to get back in that was ok but the password
 would not work on my mail I kept changing and changing the password now Microsoft is reconizing it for the purpose of getting into their sites but still can't use it for the mail. I finally went to my mail online and put it in my my bookmarks now it can open
 with a totally different password. This has been so much frustration.&nbsp;

<p>Hi phyllisstane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few ways that you can manage your Microsoft account password and access like though
<strong><a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://login.live.com</a></strong> or through the computer if you're already logged in on the computer. However, it'll be a different story if what you're trying to manage is your email
 address from a different email provider. Before we perform any troubleshooting, be advised that the current life support of
<strong>Windows 8</strong> has already reached it's <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=Windows%208" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">end of life cycle</a></strong>. For you to get further support, I suggest that you
 have your system upgraded to <strong>Windows 8.1 and above</strong> for <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13853/windows-lifecycle-fact-sheet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">continued support</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your concern, I'd like to clarify a few things to ensure that you'll be provided with the correct steps in addressing your query or refer you to the correct channel:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How to you change your password for your Microsoft account, is it through your
<strong><a href="https://login.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">online account</a></strong> or your
<strong>Microsoft account profile</strong> on your <strong>Windows 8</strong>?</li><li>Can you send us a <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">screenshot</a></strong> with
 the error you're getting?</li><li>Is it the settings upon logging in to your <strong>Windows 8</strong> from being idle that you'd like to modify?</li><li>What user profile are you modifying, is it a <strong>Microsoft account profile</strong> or a
<strong>local account profile</strong>?</li><li>What is email provider that you're using?</li><li>If it's a <strong>Microsoft account email</strong>, is that the one that you're using for your
<strong>Microsoft account user profile</strong>?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can use this article on <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/14064/windows-8-sign-in-to-windows-without-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how can you sign in to Windows without a password</a></strong>. This
 would be providing you not only a guideline on how to sign in with no password but also provide you information on it's conditions for it to be successfully applied.</p>

            Just got this computer and I set up the email account as AOL. Seems as though I di get an error code but I didn't write it down. I did get somewhat of a note at the bottom of my question from microsoft and said this mailbox is unattended and to go change
 my email info so I tried it said I couldnt and besides the email is correct I did find a page that lets the user use the email it was clicked and wouldn't let me unclick to authorize the name address. Could this have anything to do with me bypassing the login
 screen so I don't have to put in a password eveytime the screen saver comes on?

<p>Thank you for keeping us posted. Since you mentioned that what you're getting are blue screen errors, it could be possible that there might be something in the background at work that's causing the issue. To have this isolated, you can run your computer
 on <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2809468/how-to-easily-enter-safe-mode-in-windows-8-one-click-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong>. This way, we'd be able to tell if the basic hardware components are intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to login to safe mode without any issues, we can further look into the background programs and services running on your computer by doing a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>. When performing this step, turn on each services after each restart to see what service triggers
 the blue screen error. Once triggered by one of the services, have it reinstalled to see if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now as to addressing your follow-up questions and also to add further clarity, a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028195/microsoft-account-sign-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft account</a></strong> used on a
<strong>Windows 10</strong> computer would enable the user to save the settings that they saved. This way, the user would be able to apply the settings they have on their computer to other
<strong>Windows 10</strong> computer. As for a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13951/windows-create-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">local account</a></strong>, this is account that you can create on your computer depending
 on what you would like the privileges the user would like to have. At most cases a computer already installed with Windows on it has a
<strong>local administrator user profile</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep us posted with the results.</p>

            I did indeed tried to uninstall and install again. I realize that I am not computer savvy but I cannot for the life of me figure out how to take a screenshot. When logged into Skype there are no toolbars at the top. It is not like a normal website. Sorry!
 Thanks for trying to help but I guess I will settle for Google Duo on the phone.&nbsp;

<p>The message is informing you that you do not have a default email client set up in Windows. This is a Windows/Internet Options setting, not a Skype setting. Once you specify one, it will launch that email program to allow you to send an email invitation.
 If the email account you use is not configured for the client you choose or is incompatible, you will either need to locate a client that is compatible with your email provider or send invitation emails manually.</p>

            I am not sure if it is because I have Windows 7 but it turns out that I had no email client on my laptop at all. One I chose one and downloaded it my problem was solved. Was able to send out the invitation on Skype. Thanks!

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>advpack.dll assists with hardware and software installs by reading and verifying .INF files. Let us try the below listed methods one by one and check if the issue is resolved.</div>
<div><strong>Method 1. SFC SCAN</strong><br />
Let us run the SFC scan and verify it prevents this error to occur.<br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To do this, follow these steps:&nbsp; <br />
1. Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password,
 or click Allow.<br />
2. Type the following command, and then press ENTER: <br />
sfc /scannow<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
More Information about SFC scan can be found in this document:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a><br />
<div><strong>Method 2.</strong></div>
<div>Let us re register the advpack.dll file</div>
<div>1.Log on as an administrator. <br />
2.Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search text box, right-click cmd.exe, click Run as administrator, and then click Continue.
<br />
3.At the command prompt, type regsvr32 advpack.dll, and then click OK.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3.</strong></div>
<div>Also make sure that the .NET Framework is also enabled on the computer as it is required to install this application.</div>
<div>Here is how:</div>
<div>1. Go to Start and in the search type "Turn Windows features On or Off".<br />
2. Click on "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1".<br />
3. Expand "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1" and place a check mark on 2 options listed.<br />
4. Restart the Computer.</div>
<div><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
