<h2>            Windows Live Mail 2011 not displaying emails correctly</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows Live Mail 2011 (Build 15.4.3555.0308) is not displaying some emails correctly. I have 3 computers here all running Windows 7 Professional and the same version of Windows Live Mail, and they all suffer from the exact same problem. I send out eshots using
 MailChimp, and they do not display correctly in Windows Live Mail (missing text or pictures etc) but on another computer I have here with Windows XP and Outlook Express on it, they display perfectly fine. It also happens on some incoming emails - for example
 if someone sends me a file using mailbigfile.com, all I get is a blank email with a pink rectangle in the middle of it?! If I right click on the message and view the message source, you can see all of the text and links etc that are meant to be there. So the
 information is there, just not being displayed correctly. I've been through all of the security settings and I don't think it's any of them. It's becoming a real pain now, and I need to get it sorted asap.<br />
<br />
Any help on this would be hugely appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Simon<br />

            <p>Having examined the source of a message that wouldn't display and established that Simon has at least one Helvetica
<a href="http://www.linotype.com/1755/fonttechnologyfeaturepostscriptandtruetype.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Type 1 font</a> installed,&nbsp;our tests confirmed that this is another case of the Helvetica bug:<br />
<br />
<em>If a mail message contains a call for a Helvetica font, and if the computer being used to read the message has a Helvetica Type 1 font installed, the message body will be blank.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two tests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Remove the reference to Helvetica from the message HTML. The message displayed correctly.</li><li>Uninstall all Helvetica Type 1 fonts from the computer but leave the reference to Helvetica intact. The message displayed correctly.</li></ol>
<p>This bug has been around since the introduction of Internet Explorer 9 in 2010. It was corrected in IE but seems to persist in Windows Live Mail 2011/2012.<br />
<br />
The only solution is to uninstall the Helvetica Type 1 fonts. They can be replaced by their OTF equivalents.<br />

<h2>            Hard drive goes to 100&#37; and anything accessing it will not respond.</h2>
                    Win 10 Pro. I have 2 SSD and one standard hard drive. The standard is a 2 Tbyte and used for storage. It has worked great until the last couple days. S.M.A.R.T. says there are no problems. Reading in large amounts from it is no problem. When I try to write
 to it, especially if it is a large file or even doing a chkdsk, it will write a bit then stop, write a bit then stop. If it doesn't complete the write in about 30 seconds, it goes to 100% usage and is not accessible. Comp will not reboot. Hangs. Have to use
 power button on computer to shutdown/reboot. The drive will run at 100% as long as windows is running. I tried shutting down the notifications as suggested to me. No change. I copied everything from the drive to an external drive with no problem. I tried to
 wipe the drive and it locked up. I tried to reformat and it locked up. I used a Linux disk to format it and set it all back up. I went BACK into windows and formatted it and it worked this time and I ran chkdsk and defrag. Both

            I found the origin of the issue. My motherboard drivers had updated and enforced certain associations that originally were not enforced. I have several SATA connections that are for RAID only. I have several more that are IDE and AHCI only. My original
 driver allowed me to use the SATA connection in any way I wanted (And Linux allows any connections too) but when my motherboard driver was updated it enforced the SATA priorities. After moving all disks to the appropriate SATA connectors my issue was resolved.
 Linux never even noticed I changed SATA connectors and nothing changed with it. Many Win10 performance issues were resolved when I moved them. The original motherboard driver was one from microsoft which I assume was generic and NOT the board manufacturer
 so I guess (like Linux) the ports really didn't matter to it. When the manufacturer drivers were installed it made MUCH difference. That is a good lesson I will remember. Generic drivers are NOT the same as OEM drivers. (By the way, your advice was of no benefit
 at all.)<br />

    <title>Windows Media Player 12 wont play mp4, mp3, wmv files through IIS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelrayman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player 12 wont play mp4, mp3, wmv files through IIS local hosted website when PC is disconnected from the Internet</h2>
                    <p>I have an IIS 6.1 website on a local Windows 7 32-bit machine that serves HTML and MP4 videos through Internet Explorer all on the local machine. &nbsp;An internet connection is not required as this is all local storage and local hosting via IIS. &nbsp;IIS is configured
 to serve the MP4 videos as downloadable files, not streaming in any way. &nbsp;I do have the proper MIME type ".mp4" with "video/mp4" setup in the IIS server, so I do not believe that is the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the machine is connected to the internet, clicking an MP4 video link in any HTML page served by the local IIS server results in Windows Media Player opening up and playing the video in its own window. &nbsp;However, when the Ethernet cable is unplugged,
 clicking the same MP4 video link results in Windows Media Player opening its own window, then displaying this error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Media Player cannot play the file. &nbsp;If the file is located on the Internet, connect to the Internet. &nbsp;If the file is located on a removable storage card, insert the storage card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is almost as if Windows Media Player has a bug and since it is accessing this media file via a URL but the machine is not connected to a network, it thinks this file is unplayable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Ethernet cable is disconnected, the local IIS server still serves all the HTML and ActiveX content except for media files. &nbsp;I also tried to access MP3 and WMV files through the IIS server to see if Windows Media Player would open those when the
 machine is disconnected from the Internet. &nbsp;Those files also caused Windows Media Player to display the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested VLC player (VideoLAN) after changing file extension ownership to VLC from WMP for .mp4 files. &nbsp;With VLC installed and extension ownership changed to VLS, I can download/open the MP4 video using the link in the web page served by IIS all while disconnected
 from the internet. &nbsp;The only thing I cannot do is get VLC player to open up and play the video simply by clicking the link in the Internet explorer web pages served up by the local IIS server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to make use of Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player with this IIS server serving MP4 videos rather than use VLC player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael Rayman</p>

            <p>I finally figured out the answer to my problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>While disconnected from the internet, mysteriously, Windows Media Player 12 requires that you check a checkbox in the Tools &gt; Options... &gt; Player tab settings area called "Connect to the Internet (overrides other commands)". &nbsp;Once this is checked and settings
 saved with APPLY, then Windows Media Player 12 will play videos served through the local IIS webserver on the same machine, while disconnected from the Internet.</p>

<h3> marytopper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows can&#39;t connect after new modem</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Every other device in my household (including two other laptops which have Windows 10) are able to connect to a new Linksys modem that was purchased in my home. Every device except mine.<br />
<br />
I have an HP with Windows 10. I am currently using an Ethernet cable to post to this forum. The modem was activated and connected by our internet provider, and everyone else in the house has been able to connect wirelessly with no problems whatsoever.<br />
<br />
I've run Windows Network Diagnostics many times, and the only message I ever get while not connected via Ethernet cable is that Windows can't identify the problem or can't connect to the network. I ran a Wlan report about a day ago and found 142 instances of
 "<span>Dynamic key exchange did not succeed within configured time".&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">I'm at my wits' end. I even tried to create a new network on my laptop, and got Error 651 (the modem or other connecting device has reported an error). I literally don't know what to do anymore and am so, so frustrated.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance to anyone who can help, but I will also note here that I am not a techie. Overly complicated fixes will go straight over my head.</p>

            <p>You obtain the drivers from Gigabyte site, specific to your model. The raid drivers are part of the chipset drivers. You can also obtain the motherboard manual, which details the setup required.</p>
<p>Doubtless you will be aware Raid 0 has no data redundancy so external backup/Image is imperative.</p>

<p>NBA 19k and Assassins Creed Origin are <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/xbox-one/xbox-one-x-enhanced-list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
listed on this page as being Xbox One X enhanced</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This means, that these enhanced games demand more processing power on the Xbox One X compared to other (older, non Xbox One X enhanced) games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>More processing power creates more heat that has to be cooled by the console's fan. The Xbox One X tries to do that with a fairly "intelligent" fan control, where the console tries to run as silently as possible, but intermittently the console has to turn
 up the fan in short bursts to dissipate the heat caused by the higher processing power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Xbox One X has an improved cooling system thanks to the vapor chamber that makes the console run quieter compared to the "older" Xbox One generation, you need to be aware, that the console can't break the laws of physics, thermodynamics and aerodynamics.
 So you will never have a "silent" console in that form factor. For a completely silent 4K system, you would have to have several passive cooling elements that are as big as the whole console itself. So an active (noise producing) fan is still necessary to
 get a console that still fits into a regular TV shelf.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more processing power a game demands, the more heat the chips produce, and the faster the fan has to spin to generate enough air flow to cool the console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under "normal" gaming conditions, where you have the game sound turned up to regular room volume, you should only hear the console if you specifically listen for the fan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And of course, if you mute the sound completely, you will hear the higher speed fan bursts that happen intermittently when running Xbox One X enhanced games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whenever you run non-enhanced games, you'll hear that the console does not do these faster fan bursts that cause the console to become louder.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a fan sound with the One X, it's completely normal. The only time the machine would be almost silent is playing none enhanced titles. The machine gets warm especially playing enhanced games. A temperature sensor would record 65c at the rear of the
 unit, quite normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, the fan should not be in any way annoying or disruptive to your game experience.&nbsp; If Xbox One X sounds overly loud, like a 'vacuum cleaner' or a 'jet engine' something is wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only the PS4&nbsp; Pro sounds like it's going to 'take off', normal for that machine (I've got one), not the One X.</p>

<h2>            Please Help&#33; Windows 10 Update 1709 keeps failing &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This has been happening to my household for 6 weeks now!!!</p>
<p>I have the Windows 10 Update 1709 problem on all my Lenovo Edge 15 Laptops.&nbsp; <strong>
We have 3 identical Laptops (</strong>Factory Stock) in my house all having the same problem with ONLY this
<strong>Windows 10 1709 update</strong>.&nbsp; I'm on version Windows 10 1703.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically all my laptops download the 1709 update then prompts me to reboot for install, it takes about 1.5 hours but always ends by saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restoring Previous Operating System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Chat Help 4 times and everytime they say this will work 100% yet it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the media creation tool I finally received an error code at the very end of the install:</p>
<p><strong>0xC1900101 - 0x40017</strong><br />
<strong>The installation failed in the SECOND_BOOT Phase with an error during boot operation</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I researched this error and it basically says to use the Troubleshooter (did that)!&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also says to run this from the command prompt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>but that didn't work either!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC was working perfectly and there are no errors I can find anywhere....&nbsp;</p>
<p>But i'm convinced that this Windows 10 Operating system totally sucks!</p>

<p>Thx for the Reply... I'm starting to see all the problems this update is causing for people that successfully installed it... Maybe I should just Block all Windows updates by disabling the service?</p>

<p>Method 1 didn't work at all. It said that there's no problem and nothing corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On method 2, only steps 1 and 4 work. Steps 2 and 3 didn't bring anything up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can get to windows update (which works properly) is to open it on the settings --&gt; update and securty ---&gt; windows update or as described to win+I and then open it manually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't like to relly on my mouse and I'd really like to press "win" key, type "update" and then find "Windows update", but it's not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still can't find windows update on search. It seems that the setting "windows update" is not "indexed" or something.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can find it properly on my other two computers but it doesn't work on this one.

            <p>This is not an isolated issue. I support over 600 computers and 90% of them have this issue. It is like Cornata refuses to search anything windows related if you are not signed into a Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only relation to not finding the windows security/windows updates via a search seems to be related to the login status of Cornota.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to link my Skype account with Microsoft Live</h2>
                    <p>I am using a macbook&nbsp;air 10.13.4 running High Sierra. I need to join a Skype meeting set up with Skype for business. When I download and install&nbsp;LWAPluginInstaller.pkg everything seems to install fine (except that at the end of the install it asks me if
 I want to move the installer to the trash, which I haven't seen before). I've tried both trash and cancel with the same results.&nbsp;</p>

Is there ANY living human being at Microsoft who will actually answer this question?! 



I've been searching for over an hour and everything I find is dated from over a year ago when Cortana was a beta product. 



I see no "Learn my voice" button. 



I turned off the "Hey Cortana" functionality assuming the switch for that would still show up so I could turn it back on and maybe THEN I would see the "Learn my voice" button. Now Cortana doesn't use voice at all, and there is NO OPTION that allows me to turn it back on. 



Cortana has never - NOT ONCE - understood a single damn word I have ever said to it. I did the initial voice testing in my living room, which has crpets and drapes and not much echo of any sort. That didn't work. I tested in two different rooms with the same results. I have even tried testing it in a linen closet where there was zero reverberation at all. Same result. I don't have any kind of accent. 



Now I don't see ANY of the settings that are mentioned ANYWHERE for ho

</p><p>As I was writing that, Windows 10 was doing an update and that update (Aug. 4, 2016) appears to have magically restored this button to Cortana.</p>

There are several<br />approaches to doing this. Which is best for you mostly depends on how<br />much data you have to transfer. Here are some choices:</p><p>1. Transfer them on CDRs.<br />2. E-mail them from the old machine and read the E-mail on the new<br />one.<br />3. Network the two computers, and just copy the files over the<br />network.<br />4. Temporarily (or even permanently) install the old computer's hard<br />drive in the new computer and just copy them over.<br />5. Use a USB thumb drive</p>

<p>
</p><p>We used to be able to use easy transfer&nbsp; to move all settings and files from old computer to new computer.&nbsp; Instead of buying windows 10 and updating my old vista computer - I decided to purchase a new desktop with windows 10 already installed.&nbsp; Only to
 find out later, windows easy transfer no longer works with windows 10.&nbsp; Now I have to copy all my files, reset all my settings, then reload all my programs (yes I realize I would have to do this either way).&nbsp; What happened to easy transfer - no new equivalent?&nbsp;
 I guess I should have bought an old windows 7 system -used easy transfer - then upgraded to windows 10?&nbsp; any other suggestions?</p>

<p>LemP or FileExt.com:</p>
<p>I don't believe I( have any of those programs installed. I've never heard of them and don't see them on my program list. I can't say for sure when these folders and files started appearing or why. I believe I may have installed my Avast security free download
 about that time. Also, I had BestBuy transfer all the data from an old computer onto my current one but that didn't have any programs or problems with files like this going on. I'm not at all a technical person, really just a layman home user. Yesterday, after
 submitting this question and reading some of the other queries re these files aI went ahead and just deleted them. Maybe a dumb thing to do. In any case that's what I'm basically trying to find out: Are these new VDM files necessary to the operation of the
 computer? Should I be concerned about some of the warning messages I get when deleting them about possibly screwing up the operation of the computer?</p>

<p>I suggest that you download the free version of MalwareBytes Antimalware from <a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
malwarebytes.org</a> , update it and then do a scan of your entire system. This will take a while; you don't have to hang around while it's scanning.</p>
<p>As a general principle, if there are files that you think can be deleted -- but are not really sure -- the best thing to do is to rename them (e.g., somefilename.vdm to somefilename.xxx) and/or move them to a new folder.&nbsp; If you don't notice any problem
 after a week or so of your usual operation, you can feel pretty safe in deleting them.</p>

            LemP: In frustration I deleted them, probabloy not smart but so far no apparent impact alothough my computer does run much slower than it should. There is a program I have called Microsoft Forefront Client Security. Also, at a friend's suggestion I have
 Avast! antivirus free download which I added a couple of months ago, possibly (not sure) about the same time as these files appeared. I will follow your suggestion and download malwarebytes and scan the system. What does that do? Scan for viruses? Thanks.

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I usualy take is such issues two steps.</p>
<p>First I change the extentions of such files to something arbitrary&nbsp; like .zzz</p>
<p>Then I wait for a while to see if new .vdm would appear, or if something suddelny would diplay a message looking for this files.</p>
<p>After few weeks if nothing happens I delete it.</p>
<p><strong>In any case, .vdm files are associated with Windows Defender (Windows native Anti-Malware application) Update Files.</strong></p>

<p>I have&nbsp;a mass of unknown extentions, including the .VDM one, and then I read they are</p>

<p>I'm thinking my problem is with all the helpers(not!) I have at home and have access to my</p>

<p>I have tried to block them out but one family member is the resident computer guru and I can Not get rid of him. Hence I've created even more confusing files, trying to fix, and I- by the way I have ADD but I'm smart- and am old enough to be mother to&nbsp;anyone

</p><p>Hi all, This is a bit long, but it kind of sums things up from what I've learned AND I have questions, too. Please read through, even if skimming a few areas for a quicker read. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel like Brenda Barron, and agree with some of the other posts. so many file extensions; how to open, are they safe to open, and most important: WHAT ARE THEY &amp; what do they do or what are they for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think Brenda posted in the wrong place. The posts and replies make sense with my questions, all of which were helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The vdm extensions on my WIN10 laptop pc are windows defender files. The reply from hqgoldswan is a good answer, at least for me, except I don't know what the overture tool is or the Vienna Development Method is so I searched it and skimmed a quick overview.
 And I don't know about other uses as discussed in SteveyV and LemP's posts. Jack MVP's post, although from 6 yrs ago, is the one I realized that I was right about my vdm files being defender files. Although his suggestion sounds like a lot of work, and I'm
 looking for easy to do/use/fix type programs/apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a lot of BIN files popping up, also, among many others.&nbsp;Is there a good tool or app to use to know what to do, ie: keep or toss, safe or malware, how long to keep, any related information to help organize and understand these in a simple, easy to
 use way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I found these files because I have Clean Master Clean Sweep for PC's. They go through scanning files and delete all cache, temp, and junk files. sometimes I think this helps&nbsp;keep my laptop safe, too, a great addition to a security program (CM,
 Cheetah apps - were kb before that - but, they saved my cell phone more than once when other security apps weren't quite keeping up as fast.) So, sometimes I check some of the files before deleting them, out of curiousity, &amp; to make sure I really didn't need
 any of these files. CM is very good at letting you know what should be kept, and what you don't need. The files can be viewed after getting scanned; you have a choice. Anyway, any good cleaner would help and some security programs, even some of the browsers,
 scan and get rid of some of the unnecessary (ie: cache ) files for you. Helps to keep your device running faster &amp; smoother because it's not all filled up with&nbsp;junk. (Not an advertiser for CM, they have worked well for me for quite a few yrs, just personal
 preference)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extensions we are seeing aren't something we directly downloaded or put on our system. They are used by the programs we use. OR they are sneaking in and are viral &amp;/or mal-ware. At least, this seems to be the case - I have been doing MUCH at home research
 since the win10 upgrade (although I like learning how to do this stuff and understand it, it is getting to be way too much!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*So, I hope what bit of information I posted has helped, even if only a little. I also hope someone can guide me to a good app/program (I saw some in windows STORE) to sort out the mess of files on this laptop, something fairly basic, easy to follow and
 use, I am just an at home mom with youngest graduating this year; seems I am doing&nbsp; on my own time what I went to school for after I graduated (long, long, ago - floppy disks &amp; DOS) but was unable to continue. Trying to get our little home wifi network running
 smooth, one step at a time.*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I feel like I may be drifting off the subject; sorry about getting so lengthy, sometimes have a hard time explaining things so want to be very descriptive &amp; have the right info. Thanks for listening!

            <p>You could create two profiles on your computer: one for work and one for personal. Link the personal to your Microsoft Account, and don't link the other one at all, just use it to access O365 and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But yes you can also have two Microsoft Accounts, but it's difficult to use or switch between them because they are meant to be personal. Your backups, sync settings, Xbox, Email, Phone, Accounts, MSN, everything in the "world of Microsoft" will link to
 it.&nbsp; So I don't recommend trying to have two (but two PC profiles is okay).</p>

<h2>            My mouse die after boot.</h2>
                    <p>I was using Logitech G403 Wired version for half year and had no problem with it until now.<br />
<br />
As soon as I see Windows login screen, Mouse's LED is turn off.<br />
If I replugged usb port, mouse works for few second and dies.<br />
<br />
I think all of this caused by bluescreen.<br />
When I changed uTorrent to not started when boot. And then suddenly PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA bluescreen came out.<br />
I have seen many blue screens so I just waited for reboot.<br />
I thought it would be okay, but this happened.</p>
<p><br />
In BIOS(Or UEFI), mouse works perfectly fine. So I think this is problem of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, Looks like this.</p>
<p>Also, My mouse doesn't show up in "Mouse" tab. It showed in "Other devices" tab.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/221fe6fb-973d-4e00-8d0d-a8f8451651a0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/221fe6fb-973d-4e00-8d0d-a8f8451651a0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>And properties of that.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec120707-00b7-4db7-869d-3076fd56a9da?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec120707-00b7-4db7-869d-3076fd56a9da?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click Scan for hardware changes button, LED is showed up like 1 second and off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried:<br />
1. Plugged at other usb port. (Not working)<br />
2. Restore Windows to 3 days before. (Not working)<br />
3. Plug to another computer. (Works)<br />
4. Uninstall device from Device Manager. (Automatically regenerated)<br />
5. Boot to safe mode. (Not working)<br />
<br />
Sorry for bad English.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on the error message that is shown in the message above, there is a need to do an update to the device's driver. May we know if you were able to do that? If not, we suggest doing so. We suggest going to the Logitech website and downloading the updated
 driver for the particular model. If you don't find it, it may best to talk to one of their support representatives and ask for the said driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do get back to us if you have any other concerns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards. </p>

    <title>External hard drive is showing up as local disk drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nakoskotsanis91  say:</h3>
<h2>            External hard drive is showing up as local disk drive</h2>
                    <p>For some reason it changed from USB Drive to Local Disk.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i cant use a Label Name (like MyDrive). <br />
I try to change the drive Letter and still nothing happen. When i plug the USB Driver to an other computer i see it again as a local driver. If i go to Properties -&gt; Label Name and write something nothing happens and the Label Local Driver remains.
<br />
<br />
When I'm saying that it appears as a local driver let me exaplain it better with the example below...<br />
<br />
I have a USB drive that it appeared as "USB Drive" and i can change the Label name, set an icon, etc...<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8afc1f5-7740-4795-8112-ecf8dd2f6402?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d8afc1f5-7740-4795-8112-ecf8dd2f6402?upload=true" /></a><br />
Inside that USB drive i create an Autorun.inf and with this way i can set the name and the icon...<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0938a803-8081-45a2-860a-ad9d1cc644fa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0938a803-8081-45a2-860a-ad9d1cc644fa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now i plug the driver (with the problem) and as you see it appeared as a local disk and not as a USB drive<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13d39eec-42ec-4699-82dc-85be3969fc6f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/13d39eec-42ec-4699-82dc-85be3969fc6f?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
When i open the drive the is no Autorun.inf file and i cant create one (As the Sandisk example above)<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcf1bfec-fb98-4347-b648-9e2a4885f7b4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bcf1bfec-fb98-4347-b648-9e2a4885f7b4?upload=true" /></a><br />
Instead there is a folder called "Z_Drive_manager" [ Local_Disk (Z)/Z_Drive_manager ] that include (by default?) the Autorun.inf<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9938de8-7aed-4c41-9017-0ba301e8ea20?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e9938de8-7aed-4c41-9017-0ba301e8ea20?upload=true" /></a><br />
I try to change the label or the ico from the AutoRun.inf and nothing changed, also i delete the Autorun.inf but still nothing happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What i have done so far and nothing happened</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I try with cmd to fix the disk entering the commant <em>chkdsk</em> Z: /<em>f</em>
</li><li>I have change the Drivel letter</li><li>I took the ownership of the driver </li><li>I plug the driver to an other computer and try all the above</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I cant move my files to an other drive and so the format option don't suit me.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>

<p><span>A<span>pparently your driver has changed ... originally pictures show it as FAT32, which is same as most usb flash drives, &nbsp; then it has changed to NTSB.</span></span></p>
<p>I might look in disk management at its properties and maybe, if the options are there, try setting policy to quick removal and not caching. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps as last result uninstall the drive including its driver from device maanager - then reinstall the Maxtor driver for it. &nbsp; You might want to visit the Maxtor support pages or forum if they have one to resolve the problem as it seems more of a Maxtor
 problem than windows.</p>

                    <p>I imagine this problem occurred with a new update i downloaded recently for microsoft. The download I thought went fine as 3 days have passed, but now this happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On boot up, I am greeted by the all to familiar blue screen with the error code stop : 0x0000074 (or however many 0s there are) with a bunch more in the parenethsis ( like 0x00000002 or xFFFF[other junk im not fast enough to type]). Fine whatever not my
 first time doing this, as this happened 2 weeks ago. Start the repair tool - no avail. "startup repair cannot repair this computer automatically."&nbsp; ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever I'll just run system restore by hand... after initializing it states that it did not complete successfully, and the files were not changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">"system restore failed while mounting the registry from the restore point.</p>

<p>Most of those STOP:&nbsp; 0x00000074 errors report Bad_System_Config_Info like this:</p>

</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e781ff8-821a-4340-8fa2-a108c23abd03" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3e781ff8-821a-4340-8fa2-a108c23abd03" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is probably an afflicted registry but you can check a few other things out first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Windows F8 Advanced Boot options menu choose:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disable automatic restart on system failure</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>That will let you see the BSOD message and confirm it is Bad_System_Config_Info (or something else).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restart again and this time from the F8 Advanced Boot Options menu choose:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Last Known Good Configuration (advanced)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>LKGC will load a copy of the system configuration that was saved the last time Windows booted successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another reason to suspect a registry problem is you report this message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>System restore failed while mounting the registry from the restore point.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>To see about replacing suspicious or corrupted registry files here are some notes about that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>First know that there is a Scheduled Task in Windows 7 that backs up the registry every 10 days:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0255e05-9428-4d29-ab02-1781e101afcb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f0255e05-9428-4d29-ab02-1781e101afcb" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The registry does not get backed up "sometimes", "once is a while", "every so often" or "when certain things happen" - it is every 10 days unless you change the task.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the Windows 7 System Recovery Options screen you can get to a Command Prompt window so you can navigate and replace the suspicious registry files with those from the backed up registry files.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you will backup your current/suspicious registry files (just in case), replace the 5 registry files on your system with the 5 files from the backup and see how things look after that - if that's the only problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a procedure to recover the registry from the backup in the SevenForums community.&nbsp; That way I won't have to compose one myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember that there are only 5 registry files that come into play:</p>
<p>
</p><p>DEFAULT</p>
<p>SAM</p>
<p>SYSTEM</p>
<p>SOFTWARE</p>
<p>SECURITY</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you make a new folder and copy the 5 files you have to the new folder you created (so you can undo things if needed), then replace the 5 suspicious files with the backup copies made by the Windows Scheduled Task.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 &#40;64 bit&#41; Crashes after wake up from sleep - after switching to SSD</h2>
                    Windows 8 no longer wakes up from sleep.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Background:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I purchased an Acer Aspire R7 with Windows 8 x64 on it. It included a standard hard drive (non-SSD). I had a good SSD in my previous machine, so I cloned the drive over to the SSD using EaseUs Todo Backup. I then had the SSD swapped into the machine, and
 WIndows 8 booted fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything works perfectly except for waking up from sleep. The machine boots fast without issues, and works for days as long as I never sleep it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, 9 out of 10 times the machine crashes after waking up from sleep. It crashes like so:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If password on wakeup is enabled:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The locked background appears, but the usual clock on the lower left never renders. The machine doesn't respond to any kind of input. After some time frozen on this screen - maybe 1-2 minutes - it reverts to a BSoD.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If password on wakeup is disabled:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Occasionally things actually work, especially if I leave the system to rest for a couple minutes before touching anything. If I move the mouse right away, the machine crashes 100% of the time. When it crashes, one of 2 things occurs:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A) The cursor is visible. Moving it over things leaves another cursor, stationary where it started when the machine woke up. No windows react to mouseovers or clicks for 1-2 minutes. Then the machine BSoDs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>B) The cursor isn't visible. The screen does respond to touch, but moving the mouse or clicking with it does nothing. Things click in response to touch, but the apps that receive those clicks crash almost immediately after. One by one they crash, including
 the taskbar, then the machine BSoDs.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Generally the message is&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR on the BSoD. The file it complains about varies - sometimes it's something along the lines of dxgkrnl.sys. In one case the message was something along the lines of CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIES.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><br />
</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I've included the 3 .dmp files from C:\Windows\Minidump, and just in case it helps, C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP.</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I've also run Troubleshooter from the Start Screen ("Find and Fix Problems") and asked it to Improve power usage. All it did was enable sleep, which of course makes things much worse not better. To be certain I tried sleeping
 the machine after each of these steps. In both cases the machine crashed on wakeup, and these crashes are included in the above zip file.</span></div>

<div><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">There are other problems like this posted to this discussion forum, but no solution is included in them, and judging by the way the public investigation proceeded, they may be too specific to be related to the issue I'm

            Method 1: Power troubleshooter. Already did this, described in my original post. Made things worse.
<div><br />
<div>Method 2: Took these steps, restarted, put machine to sleep, woke it up, same problem as described.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Method 3: Took these steps, restarted, put machine to sleep, woke it up, same problem as described.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In both cases the machine let the mouse move around but nothing reacted to clicks. It froze in this state for about 1-2 minutes then blue screened.</div>

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to boot the computer into safe mode and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)<br />
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a><br />
<br />
If the issue </span>is fixed in safe mode, then I would suggest you to perform clean boot and remove the program that is causing the issue.<br />

<br />
Note: Follow <b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b> from article KB929135 to reset the computer to normal mode.<br />

Hope this helps!<br />

            Since the issue is with the machine being unable to wake from sleep, that help wasn't relevant to my issue. Sleep is disabled in Safe Mode, so while I was able to boot into Safe Mode fine, there's no way to test Sleep nor wake from Sleep in it.

            <div>I'm signing in with a Microsoft Account.</div>
<div><br />
Method 1: Microsoft Account Troubleshooter changed my personal settings to now sync with Microsoft.
<div><br />
<div>Method 2: Created a Local Account named test.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In both my real user and the test user, the problem still occurs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I do very little with the laptop, like just open the Task Manager, I can sleep it 1-2 times and wake it without issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I do something more aggressive with the laptop, like play a Hulu video and sleep it while the video is playing, it crashes every time on wake up as described above. This seems to be the same as was happening prior to the troubleshooting steps so far.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've noticed a new symptom.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the machine isn't going to crash:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sleep</div>
<div>Power LED stays blue, then shifts to slow blink orange - blinks once per 2 seconds.</div>
<div>Wake, machine works.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When the machine is going to crash:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sleep</div>
<div>Power LED stays blue, but this time shifts to fast blink orange - maybe twice per second. 4-10 blinks like this, then slow blink orange like before.</div>
<div>Wake, machine crashes after a minute of freezing.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Every time I get the fast orange blink, I know I have a dead machine on my hands when it wakes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Even if I do nothing with the laptop, within 3 sleeps I'll get the fast orange blink, and it will crash a minute after waking.</div>

            Hi Chris,<br />
<br />
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform startup repair using Windows 8 DVD.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>a) Boot from the disk, Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “Install now”</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on Repair your computer</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the next page click on Advanced Options</span></p>
<p><span>d) Now click on Troubleshoot</span></p>
<p><span>e) Lastly click on Startup repair and follow the on screen instructions</span></p>
<span>This may take 15 to 20 minutes to repair. Once completed try to login to your desktop<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</span><br />
        </p>

            Not sure how to perform these steps.
<div><br />
<div>My machine didn't come with a Windows 8 install disk; it came with a Recovery Partition, which I've since copied onto a Recovery Disk. If I boot from said disk, I have the following options:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Refresh</div>
<div>Reset</div>
<div>Advanced</div>
<div><br />
<div>Refresh and Reset both make it sound like they're going to wipe out my settings or programs. In Advanced, there are several options, but only one of them sounds like what you're describing:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Automatic Troubleshooter</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running this spends some time Diagnosing, then tells me it was unable to fix the problem.</div>

<p>Your account cannot be hacked. The only way your account can be taken over by somebody else is though phishing scams and social engineering. Read this guide I linked here to keep your account safe
