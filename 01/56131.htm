<h2>            Image issue when playing videos</h2>
                    <p><em>Hello,</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I have been having issues out of nowhere when playing videos on my Laptop, the video image appears to be zoomed in and blurry; the sound is perfectly fine and it doesn't appear to be an issue of zooming in and out within the settings or using the mouse
 control. This issue is occuring on all platforms, youtube, netflix, bbc iplayer ect and there is no obvious cause. Everything is up to date, no viruses have been found and this doesn't seem to be a common issue as I've had next to no luck finding a solution
 online.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>I have screenshotted an example of the issue below&nbsp;and would appreciate any help on solving this.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Thanks in advance</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How can I leave program or app when it is displayed full screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a newly bought ASUS transformer running Windows 10</p>
<p>that can be used with a physical keyboard and in tablet mode.</p>
<p>I opened a pdf file first using the pre-installed Reader and later and</p>
<p>late with Adobe Reader.</p>
<p>When using these programs in full screen mode I have no idea how to either</p>
<p>exit the program or bring up the task bar or bring up a menu so that I can</p>
<p>exit to do something else. This applies in both cases, when using the keyboard</p>
<p>and when using touchscreen.</p>
<p>I presume there is a standard method for doing this in any program or app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what the standard method(s) is/are?</p>
<p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Cmd.exe</span></strong><span> is a command line interface which is useful for interacting with a computer program, where the user issues commands to the program in the
 form of a successive lines of text.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> You may be facing this issue because the program is added in the startup settings. Disable the program under startup settings by following
 the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Right click on empty space on the taskbar and select <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on the <strong>Startup</strong> tab from the window to show the startup program and applications on your PC.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Click on the program or application and click on the <strong>Disable</strong> button located at the bottom of the window.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
Close the window, <strong>restart</strong> the PC and check if the changes are effective.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Safe mode and Clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:
</strong>If the issue persist, boot your PC in <strong>Safe mode</strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if you are facing similar issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Safe mode</strong> is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear at the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Expand the options to boot into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To exit from <strong>
Safe mode</strong> follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open <strong>Run command</strong> by pressing <strong>Windows key + R
</strong>on the keyboard and type <strong>msconfig</strong> in the command box.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Under <strong>Boot </strong>tab uncheck the <strong>Safe boot </strong>option.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Reboot </span></strong><span>the system and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>To know more about
<strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)
</strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:
</strong>If the issue does not persist in <strong>Safe mode</strong>, perform <strong>
Clean boot </strong>by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.

    <title>Windows 8 Store icon is missing from start menu - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> landsharkk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Store icon is missing from start menu</h2>
                    I just noticed that the Windows 8 Store icon is gone from my start menu.  I'm also missing some other apps, like Internet Explorer (metro version), possibly more. 



The spot on my start menu where the icon use to be is literally missing now.  I did not remove it. 



I have tried looking through 'all apps' for 'store' and it does not exist.  I've also used the 'windows key' + Q to search for 'store' and it's still gone. 



How the **** did this get removed?  And don't tell me to 'restore', that is not an acceptable solution to a possible bug.  There MUST be a simpler way to get a store icon back, like re-installing it or something, but so far my searches have turned up nothing. 



I've seen this issue posted elsewhere too, but with no solution.  Is this is common?  I'm use to blatantly obvious bugs in Windows OS, but sometimes this just gets ridiculous.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you go through the following steps in order:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Apps troubleshooter</a></li><li>Clear the Windows Store cache running the <strong>WsReset</strong> command ([Win]+R / WsReset / OK)</li><li>Delete Temporary Internet Files running the <strong>CleanMgr</strong> utility ([Win]+R / CleanMgr / OK /…)
<strong>+ Repeat step 2</strong></li><li>Reset all Internet Explorer settings to their defaults values (Tools / Internet options / Advanced tab / Reset…) – this “change” applies to both version of IE (Windows UI and Desktop)
<strong>+</strong> <strong>Repeat step 2</strong></li></ol>
<p>Hope this helps<br />
Cheers<br />
Lz.</p>

            I had a problem with the Desktop and Store icons not showing on my start screen. The Apps troubleshooter fixed it - I've been trying for a couple of weeks to fix it and that worked.
<div><br />
<div>Note that when running it, the icons will appear at the far right of your start menu rather than the position they were in before, so if you don't think it worked double check there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks so much.</div>

<span>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may arise when there are issues with the Windows update components. Try the following methods to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong><span>
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail, one email account, two computers</h2>
                    Problem:&nbsp; Not recieving all my emails<br />
<br />
Caveat:<br />
<br />
I've been using Windows Live mail on my laptop and recently got a new computer which I set up Windows Live mail on.&nbsp; On my old laptop I get all my emails. On the new desktop I only get a few emails.&nbsp; Is it possible to have Windows Live Mail fully functioning
 on two computers using only one email account? &nbsp;Meaning, getting the exact same amount of emails on one computer.<br />
<br />
I assume my percieved problem is because when my laptop syncs with the comcast account it downloads all the emails and deletes them from the server.&nbsp; There for when my desktop syncs it sees few or no emails.&nbsp; Please confirm?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there an option to overcome this or do I need to just disable the program on one of my computers?<br />
<br />

On EACH computer, do the following ...<br />
Open Windows Live Mail &gt; Tools &gt; Accounts &gt; your acct. &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced &gt; under Delivery heading,&nbsp;&nbsp;put a checkmark on " Leave a copy of messages on server " &gt; OK<br />

                    i have had a few problems since upgrade from Windows 7 to 10 but this is the most frustrating. After losing the edge and store, I added another user and got around that one. Now I have 2 user accounts but can't make changes because EVERYThing is blocked.
 The yes/no option flips back to NO on its own, so all the advise re changing account settings doesn't work, help please !!!!!

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update to build 1709, I cannot connect to a wireless display via Miracast.&nbsp; I have tried it via Microsoft Wireless Display and directing to an LG OLED 65 b7a, which has an inbuilt wireless dispaly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system tries to connect but then it says that something went wrong.&nbsp; Apparently, lots of people are having these issues and I just cannot believe that you did not test for this before releasing the 1709 build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please let me know how to connect?&nbsp; I have tried all of the&nbsp; suggestions that you have under MWDA troubleshooting page and nothing worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update taking over 4 1&#47;2 hours</h2>
                    My laptop has been in Windows 8 Update:&nbsp; Installing update 1 of 2.......for the past 4 1/2 hours!&nbsp; not sure what it is updating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is this normal?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been told never to turn off my computer when Windows is updating- it can cause major problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 Thanks!&nbsp; Christine

            You know, I manage to update all sorts of programs on all types of computers and never has it taken hours.&nbsp; And when we complain, we are offered four different, multi-step methods of resolving the issue when it should be Microsoft who resolves it.&nbsp; My
 computer was working just fine before this update but now I'm in the second DAY of updating and still just 80% done.&nbsp; This is just unacceptable.&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Many people think that it will have 4-player co-op.&nbsp; It will only have 2-player co-op.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will be available November 15th for $40.00.&nbsp; Best Buy has it listed as $60.00 with a release date of December 1st.&nbsp; Eric Eckstein- "I don't have anything against Best Buy, but that's incorrect.&nbsp; You should expect the game at $39.99 on November 15th."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It will have at least seven Reach maps remade from Halo:CE, including one map from Halo 2.&nbsp;

<p>All I know is they better for FREAKING once have the option to join/host random co-op games. &nbsp;I've been wanting this option since Halo 3. &nbsp;I would have replayed those games so many times if they had that option. &nbsp;Every other game seems to realize that's
 an important option. &nbsp;Why have they always thought otherwise? &nbsp;All the people on my friends list play through the campaign once then stay on multiplayer. &nbsp;Some of them don't even play it once lol. &nbsp;Co-op is more fun for me than multiplayer. &nbsp;It would be nice
 to meet some new people while rocking that. &nbsp;It's too hard to get people to play co-op. &nbsp;Just want to play that *** over and over on Legendary. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All I know is they better for FREAKING once have the option to join/host random co-op games. &nbsp;I've been wanting this option since Halo 3. &nbsp;I would have replayed those games so many times if they had that option. &nbsp;Every other game seems to realize that's
 an important option. &nbsp;Why have they always thought otherwise? &nbsp;All the people on my friends list play through the campaign once then stay on multiplayer. &nbsp;Some of them don't even play it once lol. &nbsp;Co-op is more fun for me than multiplayer. &nbsp;It would be nice
 to meet some new people while rocking that. &nbsp;It's too hard to get people to play co-op. &nbsp;Just want to play that *** over and over on Legendary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Head over to TA and set up Co-op sessions for times you want to play. You will probably get other people wanting to play.</p>

</p><p>I transferred your post to the Skype for Windows desktop: Instant messaging board (at least temporarily) so it can fit the description of your concern. Please post back with the
<strong>exact </strong>Skype version you are on so we can arrange to transfer your post to the correct message board.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that deleting an entire conversation will remove all the messages on your history. The history will be deleted from the specific device but will still be visible on other devices unless you delete it from there too. These support links will give you
 the step-by-step guide on how to delete chat conversations on different platforms.

    <title>How Do I Restore System Image &#34;Manually&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rockydean  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Do I Restore System Image &#34;Manually&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have created a Windows 10 system image onto an external hard drive, and also created the repair disk (DVD).&nbsp; I did this using the Windows Control Panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case my system gets corrupted to the point I cannot get to the Windows sign on screen, I want to be able to restore the system image "manually".&nbsp; By that I mean pressing the F8 (or F12 ?) key while the system is powering on, and having the hard drive
 connected and repair DVD</p>
<p>inserted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do this, sometimes I get a primitive looking Dell screen, and other times I get the Windows sign on screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I do get the Dell screen, I am not able to select the right options to allow me to do the restore of the system image, and the system
 continues to the Windows sign on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to do this some time ago, but for some reason I can't get it work any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Dell support and they told me since my system was out of warranty, I would have to pay $250.00 before they would help me.&nbsp; Thanks Dell.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The is a Dell Inspiron desk top computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could someone please tell me the instructions on how to do this (install the system image manually).</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

            Hi Rocky.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I would not use WIndows image or FIle backup as they are dysfunctional and likely being phased out.  Instead I'd use a much better free choice like the choice of all experts Macrium to create a stored image, create the Rescue media it will generate to boot into to apply the image.  This is all described here:  
<br />
<br />If you still want to use Windows Imaging make sure you're accessing the Repair Mode to Recover Using a System Image Backup.   All methods are here to access the Repair Mode:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  If it advances to the WIndows 10 logo then you've missed the chance to trigger the Repair Mode so need to power off and start over.  
<br />
<br />You may need to create bootable media to access Repair Mode.  For this you can create a Recovery Drive containing only the repair tools or including the System Files to reinstall WIndows, or create WIndows 10 Installation media that has both these tools and can reinstall WIndows.
<br />
<br />See here to create the bootable Recovery drive:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/c...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Recover Using a System Image.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />
<br />If you receive a popup asking if this solved your problem please ignore it, as it will remove my ability to help you and others may also not help.  Please wait until after the issue is resolved to answer the popup or mark your question answered to help others.

<p>Windows 10 has not had a supported image backup utility for more than a year. Microsoft recommends that we use third-party backup applications for image backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Macrium Reflect is a popular choice (and what I use) but there are many excellent image backup applications, including Acronis TrueImage and EaseUS ToDo Backup, among others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The procedure for using these applications is similar: Define a backup task, schedule it, create a retention schedule, then sit back and the software makes backups automatically. To restore a backup, boot to the application's recovery environment (on a USB
 flash drive or a DVD,) select the backup you want to restore, then sit back and in a matter of minutes your computer has gone back in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The internet has reviews of image backup software from professionals in the field. Read the reviews, take advantage of the free trials, and pick an application that appeals to you.</p>

            I appreciate your suggestions and I will check them out.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it seems that what I am trying to do is more of a Dell issue than Windows 10, but I am probably wrong.&nbsp; The point is I was able to restore a Windows 10 system image&nbsp;recently using the Dell
 F8/F12 options during power on, but now I cannot figure out how I did it. &nbsp;&nbsp; Unfortunately, I cannot snip the Dell screen and post it here so you can see what it looks like.

<p>After much frustration, it appears I have something that works.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had been using a System Repair DVD that I created as an option on the Control Panel (Backup and Restore Windows 7).&nbsp;&nbsp; I powered on the system, pressing F12 until I got the Dell boot screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 When I selected the DVD to boot from, it was hit and miss (usually miss).&nbsp; The majority of the time the system would continue to the Windows sign on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I purchased a 16GB USB SanDisk, and created it as a System Recovery Disk.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now when I get the Dell boot screen and select the SanDisk to boot from, I consistently get the screens to restore the system&nbsp;image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the System Repair DVD and the System Recovery SanDisk are two different animals.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That can happen with machines using UEFI Bios... A lot of times a DVD is not a "Valid Device" even though there is no message stating this...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Same with a flash drive, except that it can be created specifically for the type of Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some machines have Boot Options for two different types of devices...</p>
<p>"UEFI Optical Drive", and simply "Optical Drive", for instance..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that you might also have a DVD that didn'y burn quite right...</p>

<h2>            Just got Tritton AX Pros.  Questions...</h2>
                    
<p>So I just got them because my TB DX 11's headphones went bad for the third time.&nbsp; After one to two months with my new set, one of the speakers would start to rattle.&nbsp; I never even played them too loud.&nbsp;&nbsp; I really liked the sound of the DX 11's but the quality
 of their speakers is obviously ***.&nbsp;&nbsp; Luckily my warrenty covered all of them and allowed me to upgrade to the Pros for only a little more.&nbsp; My problem is I can't seem to adjust the settings right.&nbsp; One particular aspect in any given game always sounds weird.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are your ideal settings?&nbsp; Settings that seem OK to me: Fronts-high white, Rears-middle white, Centers-low white, Subs-low white (LFD2).&nbsp; Fronts-middle white, Rears-high white, Centers-low white, Subs-low white (Black OPs).&nbsp; I know the inside of the
 case suggests 321?, respectively.&nbsp; I've seen conflicting videos on whether this pertains to colors, or number of toggles apart.&nbsp; Also, do you mess with the time delay settings?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help me!&nbsp; I originally posted this in the A/V forums but I'm posting this here to see if I can get a reply.&nbsp; Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            LaserJet  Pro MFP M125nw not working on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Help!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I posted back in May and which a member of the HP team resolved has now returned.<br />
All was well with printing from my two Windows 7 laptops (one on Pro, the other on Ultimate) but on updating both within the last two days to Windows 10 Pro then wham! The symptoms are exactly as before:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. WordPerfect X7 (the latest version) and QuatroPro X7 will print a document containing a picture (say clipart), but not if it contains any typed text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Excel 2010 similarly, but Word 2010 will not print anything. Neither will WordPad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Notepad prints text!</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Lotus 1-2-3 Release 9 and Lotus WordPro print a picture but not text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Acrobat Reader will print any .pdf document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. The scanner works fine, and so does printing to a Canon InkJet. Both printers are on Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution proposed by HP Support was to set User Account Control to "Never notify" and this worked fine until Windows 10......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any other solution? My guess is that it is embedded somewhere in security tied in with the different transmission methods of the different programs and document types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in anticipation!</p>
<p>

            <p>Update to my original post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the solution for Windows 7 (set User Account Control to "Never notify") seemed to show that security was the blocking factor would there be something in Local Security Policy editor that is causing the problem in Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The settings are numerous and dauntingly confusing to the layman and I have no wish to fiddle around there without guidance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone able to help and advise me?</p>

            <p>Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has been resolved by a suggestion from an HP technician. The solution was to simply set the security on my own account for the temp directory to "Full control".</p>

<h2>            Two 3rds of the month gone and still no sight of an indication when Windows 10 will be available,, poo poo on MS.</h2>
                    <p>Two 3rds of the month gone and still no sight of an indication when Windows 10 will be available (with their app), as it was promised that it would be available after the 29Th of last month, now 20 days later and still waiting !, with no clear indication
 of when, or that if any priority to those who have other versions of windows 8 and earlier windows 7 would be getting the update/upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a witch hunt, it's a question of what the heck is going on with MS KEEPING THEIR WORD and doing the right thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My opinion is ,,it's getting to look like "maybe" only "who and what" people may have gotten it,, the select favoured few ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe their is problems with it that the so called beta testers that got the first grabs that "are now pulling their weight" and finding all the oops's we did it again's,, that are becoming synonymous with the WINDOWS OS and the insistence of metro that
 people just don't like.</p>
<p>Or might be they realise they did it again with how the settings are set to have the OS set to have "everyone opted in" instead of "opted out" that might be looked at AS UNFAVOURABLE internationally by other country's marketing laws.</p>

                    <p>I'm having trouble buying things from the Xbox website or through my Xbox One. I&nbsp;am trying to purchase several backwards compatible games (Such as Knights of the Old Republic 2, Hitman Blood Money, and several others)&nbsp;but&nbsp;all I&nbsp;get is&nbsp;"Sorry your purchase cannot be completed at this time. Please try again." I&nbsp;have never had this issue before, especially with backwards compatible games. Support keeps telling me to purchase them using a 360, which&nbsp;I dont have one and thats just the laziest suggestion I have ever heard. They have offered no other help. So I&nbsp;am hoping that the community can help me out.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Is anyone else having this issue right now? Please help!!!&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>The latest updates installed on my laptop have now made it useless, All my game apps, News, Facebook plus others are hanging or crashing, I've run the trouble shooter and it can't fix it so now what? Basically I may as well go back to a pen and paper. Please
 fix this asap, I don't understand why you don't fix the bugs before you make us install the latest updates. Is their anything I can do to sort this out? PLEASE</p>

            I've tried all this and nothing works, It seems that since the updates were installed on the 6/12/17 all my apps, games, facebook have stopped working, I generated a report but no luck in sorting this out. What makes me really cross is that everything
 was working perfectly before these damn updates. Can anyone from Microsoft help? I haven't got a system restore point on win10 so I can't even go back and it won't let me uninstall the updates. So basically I'm stuck with a useless laptop. My brother has offered
 me an old mac but I'm used to windows and usually like it but this is so frustrating. Can anyone suggest anything else please.

<p>Same here, MicroSoft... Win10 insisted on doing some updates or upgrades last night when I shut down, and again this morning when I started it back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, my office suite (Apache OpenOffice) crashes every time I try to use the "Copy" key combo (CTRL+C); my browser (Chrome)is intolerably slow to load pages, where it used to be the speediest thing out there; clicking on some .exe files (generally
 game install .exe files) takes literally minutes before anything happens, my email app (Thunderbird)crashes... what the hell did you do to my computer?!!&nbsp; And don't give me any garbage using Microsoft equivalents or about clean booting... everything was working
 just fine until those updates went in.&nbsp; I categorically refuse to start Windows up in a crippled mode with a bunch of drivers and such not loaded... what's the point of running Windows at all if I can't have full functionality?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I WAS going to install Linux beside Windows... now I'm thinking I might just blow Windows off altogether and just run Linux.&nbsp; I use Windows mostly just for gaming, but now that I have a PS4, I don't really even need Windows at all anymore.&nbsp; It's just not
 worth the constant hassle, dealing with all the stupid changes introduced with each new iteration of your ludicrous OS....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I un-install these latest "upgrades," and roll back to it's pre-"upgrade" state?</p>

<h2>            &#34;a media driver your computer needs is missing&#34;</h2>
                    I'm trying to install Windows 8 with an official DVD - not the download.<br />
Once I get past the keyboard/language question, i get the following message:<br />
<br />
"A media driver your computer needs is missing.&nbsp; This could be a DVD, USB, or Hard Disk driver. . . ."<br />
<br />
It doesn't tell me which driver it wants. The machine is already running Vista with no hardware issues.<br />
I can't progress.<br />
Any ideas?<br />

            I have a second machine which built with no issues. I tried swapping the DVD drive from that into the problem machine and it worked. Once the OS was built, I returned the original drive to the machine and it found a driver. The problem drive was a Sony
 IDE model, whereas the good drive was a TSST SATA model.<br />

            <p>I was getting this error too.&nbsp; There were two things that may have been the cause&nbsp;for me.&nbsp; I was trying to install Win8 on a new laptop after transferring my SSD from a Win7 laptop.&nbsp; The old laptop used standard old BIOS, the new one is UEFI.</p>
<p>I changed the SATA setting on new laptop from RAID to ACHI.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Also, I removed the partition from the SSD because I was getting an error that it was formatted as MBR and UEFI needs GPT.&nbsp; Win8 install was then able to format properly.</p>

<h2>            PLEASE TELL ME THE ACTIVATION KEY OF WINDOW8 SINGLE LANGUAGE</h2>
                    I bought a SAMSUNG NP355V5C-S06IN laptop with Windows 8 Single Language pre installed. There is no product key sticker on the laptop, therefore I have no access to the product key. Does anyone know where to look for the product key, as I would like to
 do a clean install and get rid of all the crapware?&nbsp;

<p>With Windows 8, Microsoft has changed from stickers that have the product key that the user has to type in when installing the operating system to new BIOS embedded product keys. The idea is that by eliminating the sticker, you eliminate one of the easier
 ways for nefarious users to get a legitimate product key. Eliminating the product key sticker also removes any worry that the sticker might get damaged while at the same time eliminating the long and irritating process of typing in various letters and numbers
 when installing the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the user has to reinstall the operating system on a machine that came with Windows 8, the installation process automatically grabs the software product key from the motherboard BIOS with no input from the user. This means that those familiar Windows product
 key stickers will no longer appear on the Windows 8 computers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you can do is uninstall any of the bundled programs you don't need, then create a recovery image point, which will allow you to reinstall Windows at anytime without the bundled programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Programs and Features</p>
<p>Scroll through the list and uninstall any of the programs you don't want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have Windows 8 setup the way you like, do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Create a recovery image point:</p>
</span>
<p><font>From the Start screen, type </font><font><font>cmd</font></font><font>, and then right-click the Command Prompt app and click "Run as administrator."
 Click through the UAC prompt. and at the command prompt type </font><font><font>recimg /createimage C:\Recovery</font></font><font>. The computer will churn for awhile as it writes
 the image to disk—it's not unusual for this process to take several hours, so give it time.</font></p>
<font>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>moving the restore image:</p>
</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</font>
<p><font>If in the future you'd like to move the </font><font><font>C:\Recovery</font></font><font> directory elsewhere to save space on your main drive, you
 can; all you have to do after you move it is fire up another administrative command prompt window and type recimg /setcurrent [New directory name] to set a new path for the recovery image.</font></p>
<p><font>Also, note that while a refreshed PC will include all desktop applications you had installed at the time you made the image with
</font><font><font>recimg</font></font><font>, it will uninstall all desktop applications you've put on there since. If you'd like to update the image with new drivers or applications,
 just run recimg with the /createimage switch again.</font></p>

<p><br />
So just uninstall via Control Panel-Uninstall a Program.</p>
<p>Unless you have a proper Windows 8 disk, you can't do a clean install using the manufacturer's method - that will just put all the "crapware" back again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Pre-installed Windows 8 machines the Product Key is held in the BIOS.</p>
