            Hello with this error<br />
On the update page says recent update check says NEVER<br />
There is hope<br />
I will paste<br />
If the error is 8024402f<br />
And on your update page says<br />
Recent check for update says NEVER<br />
There is hope<br />
You can try this .This is now the about 48hrs since I found a possible solution so far 5 out of 5 computers using Windows 7 64bit and 3out of 4 using Vista were corrected.<br />
I will paste most of the information given abit of a story.note should have on your update page under Most recent check for update says NEVER if so maybe hope.<br />
<br />
I have had this problem as well and tried alot of recommendations but none apparently worked.On the update box on my computer has&nbsp; recent time update tried had NEVER.<br />
So if you have this maybe this will work for you I tried quite a path with all having the same apparent result with the error 8024402F Coming up.<br />
This is such a mad mad world we live in (murphies law seems to be in control.)<br />
Do exactly the opposite what is logical<br />
First set your update setting to NEVER RECEIVE UPDATES, then UNTICK the two boxes below if they are ticked (one about any one can update,) and the other about being informed about available updates.(That one a box comes up are you shore you want not to be notified
 etc.)<br />
NOW USING MURPHIES LAW&nbsp; Leave all settings as is eg NOTHING SHOULD WORK<br />
NOW CLICK THE UPDATE BUTTON SURPRISE SURPRISE YOU NOW CAN UPDATE.!!!!!<br />
After updating ,check for further updates after the first batch.<br />
Then the settings can be put back to normal eg Receive updates Automatically, the tick the other two boxes.<br />
As you I have Windows 7 64bit.<br />
I had extra information if not successful ,but appears this first part works well<br />

    <title>Window Z-order Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tankaviator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window Z-order Problem</h2>
                    <p>I'm having a problem with the order of my windows. Every once in a while alt-tabbing leaves the current window on top and in focus, with the alt-tab selected app is one level below it. I've also had an app that displays a modal dialog box, but it occasionally
 is displayed behind the main window but retains focus and there is no way to get it to the front without using "close window". Oddly enough closing the window brings the modal dialog to the front instead of actually closing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that once the machine gets into this state the only way to fix it is to log out and back in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix for this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
To better assist you, may we know what changes have you done prior to getting this issue? Is it only happening to a specific app?<br />
<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.

<p>It seems to be fairly complex and intermittent, so getting data on the behavior is a pain. However here are the symptoms I am seeing:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) It seems that when my pc gets into this state whatever window is the highest on the stack gets stuck there. If I alt-tab the windows will reorder but the stuck window doesn't respond to alt-tab.</p>
<p>2) When a window gets stuck I am able to minimize it to remove it from the alt-tab stack. Restoring the window unfortunately puts the window back on top and stuck.</p>
<p>3) When the app is stuck and not in full screen I can interact with the exposed parts of lower windows. Even though they have focus at this point they remain one level lower in the z order and the stuck window stays on top.</p>
<p>4) Oddly enough, when Chrome is running but the 3rd window or lower, alt-tabbing to Chrome leaves Chrome at its current z order. Clicking is the only way to focus it. If the 2nd window is maximized there is no way to interact with Chrome without minimizing
 the windows above it.</p>
<p>5) I have seen this behavior with different windows, so it's not specific to any particular app.</p>
<p>6) Clicking on task bar icons does not bring that app to the foreground.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as what has changed... nothing that should have caused this. I have a 2017 Razer Blade, and aside from getting the Oculus rift and installing some games and typical apps (Eclipse, Visual Studio, Google Drive, things like that), nothing of importance
 has changed. I am a software engineer, so feel free to ask technical questions. And no, I have not used my powers for evil on my laptop :).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one odd data point I noticed last night that may be interesting. I just downloaded a trial of Army Builder from Lone Wolf Development (this problem started long before then). This app also got stuck, but is setup in such a way that I could see some
 additional odd behavior. Here are the interesting bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) The app starts and immediately shows a modal dialog box. The actual window is locked, and the dialog box appears below it, inaccessible.</p>
<p>2) Left clicking on the task bar icon and choosing close windows brings the dialog box to the foreground, which I can then dismiss and interact with the app. However it throws up multiple dialog boxes, and each needs a close window issued to get it back
 to the main window.</p>
<p>3) When I closed the app (or killed it in task manager) and reopened it it was in the same stuck state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been noticing z ordering problems using alt-tab and task bar icon clicks. The only way I can fix it seems to be logging out and back in. Also, as I mentioned, this is an intermittent problem and doesn't occur at login. It starts some time later (sometimes
 not at all) and persists until a logout/in or reboot.</p>

            I'm having the same problem with the z-order of windows during development of some simple MFC applications. Starting with Windows 10, opening applications does not bring the window to the top of the z-order. Opening a modal dialog in this application has
 the same behavior. If I alt-tab I can see that the application or dialog I was trying to open is the very last in the list. I've tried changing the window position on initialization and specifying top most window. I've also tried setting the focus to the window
 in question. Nothing has worked so far. I'm wondering if this is an understood change in behavior or a known bug.&nbsp;

<p>I've been living with this problem for a long time on Windows 7 - I only see it when I've got my laptop connected to two external displays, not when the just using the laptop screen on it's own.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I originally thought that it was a z order problem, but it's actually an "always on top" setting that is wrong, this thread seems to describe the problem perfectly, although I avoid using win+d, so there's another problem with the same symthoms:
</p>
<p>https://superuser.com/questions/269415/show-desktop-sometimes-sets-a-window-to-always-on-top</p>
<p>
</p><p>so&nbsp; I've been using both of the workarounds in that thread to avoid having to continuously restart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same few applications running all the time - IE, Chrome, and Remote Desktop Connection manager (+ others, but the problem will appear with just those 3 running) . I suspect that it's some action in Chrome, IE or RDCMan that is messing up the windows.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround 1:&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the window that is shown in the foreground selected, press CTRL + ALT + ESC. This should remove the window's always on top setting and stop it from misbehaving.</p>
<p>this doesn't seem to work with the Skype for desktop window though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Workaround 2:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes a modal child dialog box gets hidden behind the main application window, typical example is a printer dialogue box. The main application can't be moved &amp; doesn't respond, and the modal child window can't be seen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you know where the child window is, then you can ALT+SPACE, then M followed by arrow keys to move the child window from behind the parent window... but this doesn't work if the main window is using the full desktop. For this,&nbsp; using the UltraMon utility,
 I've assigned a hot key to run the following vbs from that thread:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set wnd = CreateObject("UltraMon.Window")<br />
</p>
<p>If wnd.GetForegroundWindow() = True Then<br />
If wnd.AlwaysOnTop = True Then<br />
wnd.AlwaysOnTop = False<br />
Else<br />
wnd.AlwaysOnTop = True<br />
End If<br />
wnd.ApplyChanges 0<br />
End If</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will display whatever window should be in the foreground. It's far from a fix, but it's a usable workaround.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 folders containing icons to applications shortcuts - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wob  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 folders containing icons to applications shortcuts frequently change the &#34;icons&#34; to &#34;details&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I've got many folders on my desktop containing groupings of shortcuts to applications. For some unknown reason, fairly frequently the view of one or more of the folders changes from "icons" (which I prefer) to the "details" view giving a listing showing</p>
<p><em>name, date modified, type, size ...</em></p>
<p>I then have to select the <em><strong>view</strong></em> menu to change the look back to icons which are much more user friendly. While in principle no damage seems to have occurred to my system and it's easy to turn the view back to "icons"it's just a nuisance.
 It never used to happen until fairly recently and I wonder why it happens sporadically to one or more such folders with no apparent pattern or frequency of it happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else encountered this problem and can suggest a solution?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem with folder file view automatically changing could be due to <strong>
automatic folder type discovery</strong> feature on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest that you try the registry-script steps provided below, it will reset the view settings of all folders and then it'll completely disable the automatic folder type discovery feature:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Type<strong> regedit</strong> in <strong>RUN</strong> or <strong>Start</strong> search box and press
<strong>Enter</strong>. It'll open <strong>Registry Editor</strong>.<br />
2. Now navigate to following key:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell</strong></p>
<p><br />
3. Under "<strong>Shell</strong>" key, select "<strong>Bags</strong>" key and press "<strong>Delete</strong>" key. It'll ask for confirmation, click on
<strong>Yes</strong> button.<br />
4. Now right-click on "Shell" key and select "<strong>New</strong> -&gt; <strong>Key</strong>" option. Set the name of new key as Bags<br />
5. Now right-click on "Bags" key and select "New -&gt; Key" option. Set the name of new key as AllFolders<br />
6. Again right-click on "AllFolders" key and select "New -&gt; Key" option. Now set the name of new key as
<strong>Shell</strong><br />
<br />
So the final key path will be:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\Bags\AllFolders\Shell</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Now click on this new "Shell" key and in right-side pane, create a new String value and give it name as
<strong>FolderType </strong>and set its value to <strong>NotSpecified</strong></p>
<p>Fixing_Folder_View_Type_Problem.jpg</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Either restart your system or log off and now Windows will no longer forget or automatically change your customized folder view type settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Many thanks for your reply. After going through the routine you suggested I rebooted and reset all the folders I wanted from
<strong>details</strong> to <strong>icons</strong>. The good news is that, after I rebooted again, all the relevant folder stayed as
<strong>icons</strong>. Further reboots over the next day or two suggested the problem was solved totally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This afternoon the bad news is that, after a fresh boot, all my folders were once again displayed as
<strong>details</strong> and not a single one was <strong>icons</strong> so it looks like whatever in my system was changing all to
<strong>details</strong> is back again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestion as to what might be causing my system to revert to the all folders displaying all
<strong>details</strong>?</p>

<p>I've tried using Feedback Hub but unfortunately not having any success. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After logging in it gives me the the Home Screen headed by the word <strong>Welcome.</strong> Underneath that&nbsp; appears to be a search box saying<em> Give us your feedback to make Windows better</em>. There's no clue given as to what it wants me to type in
 that box, so I tried a few random words and then pressed what I presume is a <em>
search</em> icon. Then Feedback Hub just hangs for ages with a dotted circle going around and never finishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to the Microsoft instructions page I should reach a page headed <strong>
Add new feedback</strong> but it never appears. How do I get from the <strong>Welcome</strong> page to the
<strong>Add new feedback</strong> page?</p>

<p>Regrettably my Feedback hub simply doesn't work. After opening there are 3 icons on the top left of the application:</p>
<p>1 three horizontal bars</p>
<p>2 a building (presumably home)</p>
<p>3 The same as the application icon on the desktop (an outline of the top of a person with a rectangular shape behind).</p>
<p>There are no words alongside any of these icons unless I press 1 (three horizontal bars) when it displays
<strong>Home</strong> and <strong>Feedback </strong>alongside the other two icons. In particular the words
<strong>Add new feedback </strong>do not appear anywhere on the screen. If I click the third of the icons (<strong>Feedback</strong>) it goes into showing dots circling and nothing else. I've left it up to 20 minutes and nothing else happens. All I can do is
 to either press one of the top 2 icons and either repeat the circling dots or exit the application. I've logged out, rebooted and all the usual workarounds but Feedback hub still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case the problem is related to my operating system, the following is my Windows specification:</p>
<p>Edition: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Version: 1709</p>
<p>OS Build: 16299.125</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I heed to do to get Feedback hub working?</p>

    <title>Will windows 10 fit on my tablet&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cameron_pjc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will windows 10 fit on my tablet&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got a nextbook with a 10.7gb total disk drive space. Of that, I can only free up a maximum of 600mb (that includes uninstalling all the applications that came with the tablet for windows 8.1). I have no videos or movies, no music, no pictures, and a
 total of 8mb of documents. That's all. Most of the space is filled up with the current windows folder in the program files. According to the system requirements of windows 10, it needs 16gb hard disk space. So I thought it wouldn't work. But lo behold, the
 windows 10 update app has appeared. And it is telling me that my tablet is compatible. So I thought alright, let's give this a bash (I'd installed windows 10 onto my proper laptop a few days before). Before the upgrade commenced it told me I needed to clear
 5gbs of disk space for the download (which I can't do) or to plug in a 13gb external hard drive. Not having a usb this big on me right now, I haven't done anything further than that.</p>
<p>My question is this: Will windows 10 fit onto my tablet completely if I did download it using the flash?</p>
<p>I've spoken to a few of my friends about it, and one of them said if I did this, I'd need to use the flash every time I use my tablet. Another said that it should work, the flash just acts to create extra space during the upgrade, and once it's done it unpacks
 and replaces everything. So I could use my tablet without the flash.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that's what the windows installation wizard will attempt to do, but I've also noticed on my laptop that the old windows is kept under the folder old.windows. Apparently this folder is redundant and is only used as a rollback to windows 8.1 if
 there's a error in the download. But it still takes up a rather large disk space.</p>
<p>So will the old windows folder and windows 10 all fit into 10.7 gigs, and still leave me some space? Or will windows 10 completely replace the old windows folder and I won't be able to go back to 8.1?</p>
<p>To me it seems like this all shouldn't work, the windows update app shouldn't have appeared and it should not be compatible for the download. Yet it still wants to go ahead.</p>
<p>Any advice other than trust the Wonderful Windows Wizard?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just to be 100% certain, when you say "<span>USB drive should be plugged-in&nbsp; to use Windows 10" does that mean that the USB drive will always be needed and will always have to be plugged in to use Windows
 10 on my tablet?</span></p>

                    <p>Every time I start Microsoft News now, it immediately collapses, and exits. I even completely deinstalled/reinstalled it, but that makes no difference. I did the usual lame DISM repair stuff, which found nothing (of course); nor did sfc /scannow, for that

            Hello, 
<br />
<br />Try re-registering News app. Perform these steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Search for Windows PowerShell using Cortana or Windows Search. 
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />
<br />3. Then type following command and press Enter key: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.BingNews | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Let the command complete. 
<br />
<br />4. Close Windows PowerShell and check News app, it should work fine now. 
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

<h2>            external microphone use with windows 10</h2>
                    I have a blue yeti microphone and when plugged in to my PC it cuts the sound i.e. my skype audio doesn't work either way also there is no sound when I play a youtube video. I have been into the control panel and the yeti is set up correctly as far as I
 can see. I also have a webcam/mic which works perfectly both image and sound. The Yeti is for improved audio.

            Hi Eugene,
<br />
<br />Sorry to say, from your screenshot, you are not running genuine Windows 10, that is a cracked volume licence you are running . . .
<br />
<br />Do you know the history of your PC or version of Windows? 
<br />
<br />If your PC is second hand or Windows was reinstalled by a PC Repair Shop?

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Hello everyone. Firstly I would like to recommend everyone who bought Fortress Craft to go back on and there's an update that makes it really unique and let's you be very creative!</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Right! My problem. I reset my world and start to play the game. I play for an hour and build a small house. Then my brother comes on to play the Xbox and he loads up FortressCraft. He goes play world and
 then he is now playing in my world? Quite annoying when originally when the game came out he and I could have separate worlds but now we can't.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><strong>Does anyone know how to solve this problem? Thanks</strong></span></p>

            My computer is doing the same. It was pre-loaded with windows 8 so there are no disks I can use. The computer loads straight to the message saying boot manager is blocked. It then asks me to choose what I want to boot. And I click the only option and the
 loop continues. <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/52f78916-aa9c-406a-83b4-5560e3c77462">
EnigmaR</a> asked a week ago and I have been checking every day for a reply to his second post. Is there any advice that can be given on what to do? Otherwise I am going to have it looked at (for free) at Office Depot.

Thanks in advance,<br />

    <title>System Thread Exception Not Handled - RealTek Driver Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nkx196  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Thread Exception Not Handled - RealTek Driver Issue &#40;RTKVHD64.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I updated my laptop yesterday and there was an issue with the sound driver. There were no input and output sound detected. So I watched a video, downloaded the Realtek driver and ran it. It fixed the issue and the sound is working again after I restarted.
 However, the installer ran again and I cancelled it while it was running halfway. My laptop crashed and the first BSOD appeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"For more info about this issue and possible fixed, visit http://www.windows.com/stopcode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The stop code is: THREAD EXCEPTION NOT HANDLED&nbsp;</p>
<p>What failed: RTKVHD64.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure the issue has got to do with the Realtek driver and I have no idea if I can uninstall the driver through command prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, I could still log in to my laptop and it will crash after about 10 seconds or so. I did a system restore and it identified the drivers (Realtek). I thought it would work but this time round I can't even get to the sign in screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restart my laptop, it will always show me 'Prepare Automatic Repair'. This was what I tried to do using:</p>
<p>1) Go into safe mode (Advanced options) It will bring up the list of options for safe mode but it will still go back to the screen that shows 'prepare automatic repair'</p>
<p>2) Something got to do with registries using command prompt. Did not work. Files still in tact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other way for me to fix this? It's urgent and I am scared if I will lose any of my files. Please help. Thanks!</p>
<p />

<p>I experienced the EXACT same problem, in the manner described above, on Friday. October 11. Now I am stuck in an endless loop of BSOD and hp startup window displaying Preparing Automatic Repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many fixes from many many websites, all to no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was there an update to Windows 10 and/or to HP and/or to Realtek Audio Drivers last week?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial symptom that I experienced was having no audio on my HP laptop on Thursday. On Friday, I attempted to fix the problem with the driver as described above. Fix seemed to work, and I had audio.&nbsp; However, after rebooting the computer the following
 day, again no audio device was detected, and back to installing the driver again.&nbsp; When I rebooted, that's when the BSOD loop began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any solutions.&nbsp; My computer is only 4 months old and is completely unusable.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 is automatically deleting system restore points - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budguinn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 is automatically deleting system restore points</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 10 is deleting the system restore points.</p>
<p>I have checked the services.msc and the volume shadow is running and starts automatically.</p>
<p>I have increased the storage for the shadow to 20gb using the Vssadmin command....I found this in a previous question/answer.</p>
<p>It seems that most of Win 10 recovery stuff is based on the restore points....yet the machine keeps deleting them.&nbsp; I've used system restore for years on my XP and Win7 machines and no problems.&nbsp; This one is new to me.</p>
<p>The rest of the Win 10 seems to be working well.</p>
<p>This was an update from Win7.&nbsp; This update didn't work, so I installed a new 2gb drive and did a clean install.&nbsp; The clean install seems to be working well except for this restore point deletion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went and changed the storage to 20%, which is close to 400mb.</p>
<p>
</p><p>best regards,</p>

            <p>Retandeep...thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I ran the 'sfc/scannow' from the command prompt and it returned no problems.</p>
<p>Since I have increased the shadow storage to 20% I have had no problems.&nbsp; I have restarted and shutdown the machine multiple times and the restore points have remained.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if this is totally fixed but will continue to start and stop the machine to make sure.&nbsp; I really don't feel comfortable if the system restore isn't working.&nbsp; Right now it appears to be fixed.</p>
<p>thanks for the help, and I'll report back if this has totally cured the problem.</p>
<p>

            <p>Retandeep.....well, no joy.&nbsp; I did a few more restarts and then turned it off while I took a shower.&nbsp; Came back and fired the machine up....and it has deleted the restore points.&nbsp; I had three at the time of turning off the machine.&nbsp; The took up 1.2gb....the
 configuration slider is set to 20% which reads as 373gb devoted to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read the replies on the pagefile problems.&nbsp; I do not see a pagefile on my root.&nbsp; I have allowed hidden files to be seen and I do see some others, but not the pagefile.&nbsp; So, I can't really do the recommended 'stuff' for this fix......ie turning things
 off...deleting the pagefile...defraging the drive...then turning 'stuff' back on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching the internet this seems to be a fairly common problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; And, it was apparently a problem with some win 8 and win 7 systems.&nbsp; I have never had the problem on my Win 7 or XP machines...or my newer Laptop with win 8.1.&nbsp; I should point out that
 this machine was previously a Win 7 machine and never had a problem with the restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, any more ideas that I might try?&nbsp; Is there a location of the files that you can give?&nbsp; If nothing else I could make a habit of saving a copy of the system restore point to another drive, or even a usb incase something goes amiss I would at least have
 a known previous good restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>again, where is the restore point filed?</p>
<p>

            <p>Here too, Windows 10 is wiping my manually created system restore points!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With every blasted Windows 10 update, it creates restore points related to the updates, but what good does that do, when my own restore points, to RESTORE to a point BEFORE the update are wiped? Kind of defeats the purpose, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My HATE AND LOATHING of Microsoft are by now limitless. The ruthless way MS descends upon the people to force them to use a totally dysfunctional crappy &nbsp;load of software, which messes up so many functions is near criminal. My ethernet connection does not
 work, some programs I cannot install, my Movie Maker keeps crashing, there are other oddities which should not happen and now for pete's sake, something so crucial as a system restore point is REMOVED by this horrid horrid horrid thing called Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already stated elsewhere on here, that had I the financial resources I would consider suing Microsoft for the despair, the stress, the worry it has caused me, not to mention the effing loss of valuable time. Or does my time not count in Microsoft's grand
 scheme of mess-ups?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case some or other Microsoft support person pops in to advise me: that will NOT be necessary! I have lost every faith in these dodgy instructions which I noticed in 99% percent of all the cases I ran through do NOT work, apart from saddling me with yet
 more stressful labour to figure out a load of obscure instructions (and no, I am not computer illiterate) to "fix" which in the end do NOT fix anything, and possibly create an even bigger mess.&nbsp;<br />
You know dear Microsoft why people use computers? To FACILITATE their lives! Not to reduce their days to a pile of digital agony, scouting through forums in quest of a cure for the ills which Microsoft planted on their costly machines. I remember the days of
 XP, when Microsoft still evidently had the basic decency to TEST their software before release. And also during Vista (ED. though it was far less flexible and fast as XP, I will say that, like 8.1) I have no memory of such godawful snafus as I am experiencing
 these days, me and my laptop a victim of this trillion dollar syndicate with as much trustworthiness as the Titanic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck to you Microsoft, I will be seriously considering to change to Linux.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mabel Amber</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS &nbsp;Forgot to mention the fee to pay a helper and yes, let me emphasize the patience and understanding and helpfulness of a friend and neighbours who were there to catch me and my soggy Windows 10, because believe me, computer problems DO seriously affect
 one's life, never think lightly of it.</p>

</p><p>It's not much help, but I feel your pain.&nbsp; You can see all of the 'help' I'd gotten from Microsoft.&nbsp; They really didn't even read my questions or responses.&nbsp; I tried this on a few different threads with them...asking the same thing in a different manner.&nbsp;
 I never did get a resolution.</p>
<p>My 'fix' was as I mentioned to order a new install set of HP and reinstall Windows 7.&nbsp; I disabled the automatic update functions and now only updates after I have examined them and checked on line.&nbsp; I will never install windows 10 on this machine....it is
 a very fast three year old machine and works with Win7 quite well.</p>
<p>I will say that my lap-top is running Win 10 and no seeming problems with it.&nbsp; It doesn't lose the restore points....my main machine, with Win 7 doesn't erase restore points either.</p>
<p>I wish you luck, but it appears that Win 10 will not work with some machines.</p>
<p>Have you considered reinstalling your old operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>good luck and best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>bud guinn</p>

            <p>Hi Bud,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response and commiseration :)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I did consider reinstalling Windows 8.1 - However, I cannot 'revert' as it has been much longer than one month since I opted in to the free upgrade to Wind. 10. Then too I would be faced with the additional hassle of removing 10 and getting back to
 8.1. Although I am not computer illiterate, I still do need some assistance with major operations and.... the assistance wants to get paid. I also realize that switching to Linux would be sort of a major change as well. And my purse is not very computer literate,
 lol.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I shall simply struggle on, hoping and praying that the visible and invisible forces hovering over and in my cherished MSI laptop (3 years old) will be as kind as possible to this victim of a system which has gone way way way over the top, since its inception.</p>
<p>I think I shall wait till this MSI has had it, and get a new one, to then dip it in Linux straight away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mabel Amber</p>

    <title>ELAN Driver Update Disables Touchpad Buttons on Asus Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darth mac  say:</h3>
<h2>            ELAN Driver Update Disables Touchpad Buttons on Asus Laptop</h2>
                    I have an ASUS PU401L and have recently upgraded to the new Windows 10 operating system. Part the way through the upgrading process it pointed out to continue with updating on the touch pad to which was agreed upon. Now when I first went on Windows 10
 all seemed okay accept that the gestures were gone from the touch pad. I could no longer use two fingers to scroll up or down. Then an update to the driver of ELAN now disables the left and right button of the touch pad. I can only get rid of it by reverting
 the driver to the previous installation. But Windows is still trying to install. I do not even remember when I first got the laptop if the ELAN was part of the software. Can I get some help please on what the ELAN driver is doing and should I just remove,
 although Windows is installing each time for the updates. Confused. Has anyone else had a problem with their ASUS laptop regarding the touch pad?

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Actually it does sound like you have disk corruption issues, malware is at least possible as the<br />
cause though it is not very likely.<br />
<br />
<strong>This is not a Registry issue</strong>, do not buy one of those Registry Cleaners that promise to fix<br />
all sorts of issues. They are ALL snake-oil and will take your money and make things even worse.<br />
<br />
Run the manufacturer's diagnostic for your drive. Redundant backups are a very good idea.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Disk issues can get serious very quickly so I would thoroughly check the drive now and be sure to keep<br />
redundant backups of your important data (use several methods).<br />
<br />
Inside Windows - Regular or Safe Mode (repeatedly tap F8 as you boot).<br />
<br />
Run checkdisk - schedule it to run at next start and then Apply OK your way out then restart.<br />

<br />
These are much more efficient methods to check the disk.<br />
<br />
From the Command Prompt of the Recovery Console (if you have one) or from a Vista disk - if you do not<br />
have a Vista disk you can borrow a friend's (it needs to be same 32 or 64 bit and they are not copy protected)<br />
or make one. Also your System maker will sell the physical disks cheap since you already own Windows.<br />
<br />
chkdsk /f /r<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
Space after k and before /&nbsp; and after f and before /<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />

This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />

Ever since I have been running Windows Media Center some 2 years now, I have the following problem:
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If both programs are up and I play and pause a song in Windows Media Player 12 and then watch anything in Windows Media Center, pause it, go back to Windows Media Player 12, I get the following message: “An audio device was disconnected or reconfigured.
 Verify that the audio device is connected, and then try to play the item again.”<span>&nbsp;
</span>If I click “OK” I can then resume playing that song.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have read that many people get this error but I haven’t found anyone who gets it when combined with Windows Media Center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any ideas??</p>

    <title>Where can I see my digital license key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Where can I see my digital license key&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have multiple Windows 10 product keys that I've bought but I have no way of knowing which ones I've used previously on different computers. If possible, I'd like to be able to see the original retail product key that I used to activate my copy of Windows
 so I don't accidentally try activating Windows 10 twice with the same key. I could have sworn I used to be able to check this via my account but things have obviously changed. I'd rather not have to resort to sketchy third party software just to find something
 this basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hi Bob.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please clarify.  In your title you say you need a Digital License key.  But Digital Licenses are keyless and trying to insert any key other than the generic version key installed by WIndows when you skip the Product Key will fail to activate until it is changed back to the generic.  
<br />
<br />Then in your post you refer to managing physical keys.  Are these retail Product Keys that you used to activate and then had the activation convert to a Digital LIcense in Activation Settings, perhaps linked to your MS Account for convenience and easier use of the troubleshooter if there are activation problems or you want to change hardware?  Same thing.  Use only the Digital License's generic key to reactivate or change hardware.  The retail key is only a back up at that point.  
<br />
<br />If these are retail keys that never converted then you can read the Product Key by running ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> and figure out the retail key by process of elimination - is is not the Generic version key, and it is not the OEM BIOS key that comes embedded in UEFI chip from the factory.  Generic keys here to compare:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />Unless another odd key has been inserted (like shops sometimes use Volume License key illegally) the key that's not OEM-BIOS or Generic is likely your retail key.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
