<p>Não.</p>
<p>Como você mesmo disse, o computador possui uma "saída" HDMI.</p>
<p>Para você conectar o xbox no computador, precisará de uma placa com "entrada" HDMI, ou então conectar direto o xbox na entrada HDMI do monitor, mas aí vai depender do que você está querendo fazer, se é só usar o monitor mesmo ou fazer captura do gameplay.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Photo gallery editing stops working</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have windows 7 professional and I use the Windows photo gallery a lot but every time I go to editing the program says,&nbsp;</p>
<p>' A problem has caused photo gallery to stop working' and the program closes, it then continues to crash until I use the Microsoft fix and then it allows me to do &nbsp;5 or 6 photos before the same thing happens again. &nbsp;This is a brand new PC only 3 weeks old
 and it has done it right from the start. Windows Gallery has been uninstalled and re installed , I have also followed all previous instructions posted like run sfc scan and there is nothing wrong within the PC, please HELP!!!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Anne,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It can be annoying&nbsp;when you get the message 'Windows photo gallery has stopped working' when you click to view a picture or edit it.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This can occur due an incorrect setting on the computer. I understand that you have already tried&nbsp;troubleshooting the issue by running the fixit. I suggest</span><span>&nbsp;you to run the fixit from the link&nbsp;again and perform further troubleshooting steps.</span></p>

            <p>Hi all steps in Shane's solution have now been completed and to no avail. I have also changed over to fiber optic BB out of hope this would help but no the editing galley problem still persists. Any other ideas as I (try) to use this program a lot and it
 is very frustrating to have to keep repairing it ever 4 or 5 photos. Also a pop up box appears with JXR file extension in it and no matter whether you click yes or no it still keeps appearing.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Start Menu Works Erratically</h2>
                    About a week ago, when I click on the Start menu icon, it gave me a Critical Error message and instructed me to sign out and sign in. Never worked. Mysteriously, the Start menu came back a few time without me doing anything. But as soon as I reboot the
 computer for any reason, the Start menu went away again and the same error message will appear again. Apparently, this is a software design flaw. Has Microsoft &nbsp;published a fix for that yet? Does anyone know? If Microsoft did, how can I get the the fix?

<p>Hi - Regarding that - Appcompat.txt - I had that showing up too and investigated - My best answer came from -<a href="http://ask-leo.com/appcompatexe.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ask-leo.com/appcompatexe.html</a>&nbsp;- What is Appcompat.exe? If you go there you'll read some
 of what I'll type in here but there is about 3 pages of others asking the same question. Its worth looking into.</p>
<p><a href="http://ask-leo.com/how_do_i_resolve_my_problem_with_appcompattxt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ask-leo.com/how_do_i_resolve_my_problem_with_appcompattxt.html</a></p>
<p>Summary: Here's what to do when you see appcompat.txt.</p>
<p>This is another case of Windows being particularly obscure. You see (and I'll say this several times), appcompat.txt is not the problem.</p>
<p>I can hear a crowd of people saying "Yes it is! It's right there in this error message!". That's what I mean by Windows being obscure. Read the error message carefully and you'll see what I mean. Appcompat.txt is not the problem, it's not the error, and
 it's not the cause of the error ... it's information about the error.</p>
<p>Appcompat.txt is simply a reporting file used when uploading error reports to Microsoft. You've seen the message asking you if you would like to "report this error to Microsoft"? Appcompat.txt is a file that is uploaded if you say yes.</p>
<p>Appcompat.txt is not the problem. It contains information about the problem. Open it up in Notepad, and you'll see what I mean. When you get an error message that references appcompat.txt, it'll usually give you the full path to the file. So click on Start,
 Run and enter:</p>
<p>Notepad C:\DOCUME~1\username\LOCALS~1\Temp\WER7b4e.dir00\appcompat.txt<br />
Where "C:\DOCUME~1\username\LOCALS~1\Temp\WER7b4e.dir00\appcompat.txt" is replaced with the actual information that was presented in the error message. You'll see a lot of technical information that begins with this:</p>
<p>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-16"?&gt;<br />
&lt;DATABASE&gt;<br />
"Appcompat.txt is not the problem."Followed by information about the program that was running at the time an error occurred. Note: it's not meant that you understand this. It's meant for the engineers back at Microsoft to use to analyze failures and hopefully
 provide fixes over time. I point it out here, simply to drive home the point:</p>
<p>Appcompat.txt is not the problem. It contains information about the problem.</p>
<p>So what do you do when you get an error message that references appcompat.txt? In my opinion, a) allow Windows to report the error to Microsoft, if it asks you to, and b) forget about appcompat.txt. Unless you're technical enough to understand what's inside
 of it, it will not help you. Focus instead on what you were doing when the problem happened. We all know that programs can crash for many, many different reasons. The problem could be due to a bug in an application, a problem with your machine, a bug in Windows,
 a security issue, or any number of other things. Just saying "it's appcompat.txt" tells you exactly nothing about the problem.</p>
<p>The steps to take then will depend on what you were doing and what applications were involved. A fix could be as simple as a configuration change, a virus scan, a system file check, or as complex as a complete rebuild and reinstall of Windows. But without
 more information, there's simply no way to know.</p>
<p>As a final note I want to be clear that appcompat.txt and appcompat.exe are two completely different things. Appcompat.exe is discussed in this other article: Appcompat.exe - What is Appcompat.exe?.</p>

    <title>DISM error 193 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cybot  say:</h3>
<h2>            DISM error 193</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro 10586.17</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been asked by my mom to update and prepare her laptop for her to do the taxes. Unfortunately for me her PC was a bit of a mess operationally wise. after fixing some account group errors, and running sfc and chkdsk (they both found and successfully
 fixed some things). 'SFC now reports no integrity violations were found' and likewise chkdsk is not finding any errors. however, I have run into some strange issues all of which are most likely related to each other. I have done as much as I can. I got the
 start menu and Cortana back up and working and I have put windows into a clean boot state. the problems I am having aside, windows is running relatively well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>first on the list is the task scheduler service. it will not stay running. the start type is set to auto, but it is not starting when windows does. I can tell the service to start, but it seems to stop after a while. when I try and bring up the task scheduler
 program, I get a 'remote computer was not found' error. if I try and tell task scheduler to connect to the local system, it fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>next issue is windows update, when I try and access the updates section in settings, settings freezes up. accessing the other options in settings still works however. when I try and start the windows update service, I get an error 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the next issue I believe is directly tied to the task scheduler not being able to stay running, is when I go to open a windows utility like computer management, or an elevated command prompt. on the first attempt on opening the needed function, I get either
 a 'no program is associated with this action message' or a stub data not found error. the second attempt always succeeds however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>right before I hit&nbsp;a&nbsp;brick wall, I tried do to a 'DISM /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth' operation, but encountered a 'error 193: an initialization error has occurred' message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried preparing a install.WIM to try repairing windows using that method, but the same error occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss on what my next steps should be. and any help would be much appreciated.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for update and reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check the Task Scheduler Dependencies tab, and checked that RPC, DCOM Service Process Launcher, RPC Endpoint Mapper, and Windows Event Log were started and set to Automatic.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Try signing in using a new user account and check if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to create a new user account and check the issue status in the new user account. This would help us to analyze the issue to find the cause and resolution. If the new account works fine for you, add your Microsoft credentials to it and
 use it as your Microsoft account.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I checked on the services you listed&nbsp; and they are all running normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried creating a new local account, and the same issues are still occurring in the new account</p>
<p>
</p><p>my mom is still using a local account on windows 10, as she "does not trust the cloud's security". So, she does not have Microsoft account or use the windows features that require the use of a Microsoft account. I also clamped down on the privacy settings
 in windows at her request. I did not use any tweak to do so, I only used the options provided by windows 10, so at the very least telemetry data is still going out to M$. I keep telling here how awesome Cortana is, but she doesn't care. Anyway, this is going
 waaay off track.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>the issues still persist in a new user account, both sfc and chkdsk still say nothing is wrong. one thing of note on the new account, edge opens then closes when I go to use it. windows store and settings still works (except the windows update portion of
 settings )though. I am still unable to use dism</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>after seeing another post elsewhere on Microsoft answers (I don't remember which one, sorry) that suggested using Tweaking.com's windows AIO repair software to fix windows update. I already had this installed on my moms laptop so I gave it a chance. I don't
 know what all It did during the repair, but it was apparently more&nbsp;through than any of the M$ windows update fix-it's or troubleshooters. when the program was finished running the fix, it asked me to restart. After the restart, not only was the Windows update
 service running but the task scheduler service was now starting with windows, and staying started. so two problems with one stone, not bad.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM however is still throwing error 193 when I try to use it for an online service store repair.&nbsp; a look inside the DISM.log file reference in the error message there are is an error message and two warning messages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>2016-02-17 13:22:25, Warning&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DISM&nbsp;&nbsp; DISM OS Provider: PID=8656 TID=6116 Failed to bind the online servicing stack - CDISMOSServiceManager::get_ServicingStackDirectory(hr:0x800700c1)<br />

C:\Windows may not point to a valid Windows folder. - CDISMOSServiceManager::Final_OnConnect</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure as to what these errors mean, but it sounds like there is a setting that needs fixing. I just don't know where to go to find this setting. the last warning message is a little confusing as 'C:\Windows'
<em>is </em>a valid folder, and since windows 10 is running from 'C:\Windows', I don't know why it is having trouble finding the servicing stack folder. is there a registry key or a config file that I can check to make sure the settings are still what they
 should be, and change them if they are not?</p>

            is there a command I can try that will have the same end results as the dism command I have been trying but instead of doing while windows is running, doing it at the repair screen command prompt? I have prepared a install.wim to use for a repair, but
 dism does not appear to be working atm.

            <p>after painstakingly going entry by entry in the registry and directory by directory and comparing entries and comparing directories to what was on my pc (which was made really easy thanks to remote desktop), I finally arrived at the system32\downlevel directory.
 I noticed there were a few of the lengthy named .dlls present on my PC that were not on hers. whats more, the .dll's had the word service in them so I copied took ownership of the downlevel directory and files on her PC and made made some adjustments to the
 permissions of the files there. while there is a shared clipboard in remote desktop, for some reason, perhaps a security countermeasure, I could not copy directly from my system32 directory to hers using remote desktop. but, what I could do, is copy the the
 directory onto her desktop, and then move the copied directory to her c:\windows\system32 directory. I then ran dism /online /? at the elevated command prompt I had open already. and lo and behold instead of the error 193 I had been getting, I got what you
 would expect to see from the command the dism help option plus the option to use with /online. currently I am running the dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth command. afterwords I will run a repair install just to fix up all the permissions and stuff
 I tampered with. </p>
<p>
</p><p>so... it looks like the culprit was one or more .dll's in the c:\windows\system32\downlevel directory<br />
</p>

            I too had this issue and found it to be with the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c:\windows\system32\downlevel directory but my resolution was different. &nbsp;I have a custom logo that is located in the Control Panel -&gt; System screen
 and somehow the logo file found its way into downlevel directory. &nbsp;Once I removed the file the dism /online commands worked. &nbsp;The underlying dism issue prevented me from upgrading from Windows 10 1507 to Windows 10 1607. &nbsp;Once the file was removed dism worked
 and so did the upgrade.</span>

2.&nbsp;Did you make any changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3.&nbsp;When exactly do you get this error message?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the steps under ‘Missing or Damaged User32.dll File’ from the below article. Make sure you replace User32.dll with ntvdm.exe for the steps provided under ‘Missing or Damaged User32.dll File’. Also for step 7 replace ‘user32.dl_’
 with ‘ntvdm.ex_’.</p>

<h2>            Upgrading to 10 from 7 and getting 0xC180013-0x90002</h2>
                    I'm attempting to upgrade to windows 10 from windows 7 and I cannot. I keep getting the error code 0xC180013-0x90002 when I attempt to upgrade. So I thought that I needed to fully update Win7.... which I hadn't been able to for a while because of an 8007370A
 error. So I ran Windows Update Diagnostic several times and got a few things fixed. Tried to update again... same error code. Went under Control Panel &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; System &amp; Security and ran an Update Fixer and Performance. Nada... Ran AVG, found "EID_pe_iscorrupted"
 in the files I downloaded from the Microsoft Site. AVG cleaned and secured it and then I ran the Quick Tune Tool (which I always do after I do a virus scan) and then ran an Anti-Malware Cleaner and than came up clean *happy dance short lived* Had the Hubby
 help me out and download another Upgrade .exe from the site and ran it... *bang head on desk* Same&nbsp;0xC180013-0x90002 error code. HELP!!!

<p>
</p><p>I would not run AVG which bloated up about 7 years ago and started causing problems, and hasn't been recommended by anyone in Forums since then.&nbsp; Stick with built-in MS Defender once you get to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So let's get you Upgraded now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Download and install <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Media Creation Tool</a> and choose Upgrade Now.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This should do it but if not refer to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">

            Hi Shailesh, 
<br />
<br />It’s funny, HP has Win 10 Drivers for that model, but no audio drivers. 
<br />
<br />Try this one:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/soar-attachment/362/col51350-ob-124404-1-ob-124404-1_sp63916.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/soar-attachment/362/col5...</a>

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />It’s for Windows 8, but it may work. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C
<br />
<br />PS - reboot if you haven’t already, sometimes the Audio drivers will reinstall themselves upon reboot after uninstalling them.

            Hi shailesh_kadam1474
<br />
<br />Have you Restarted (not shut down) your laptop since you uninstalled those drivers - Windows should automatically reload those drivers . .. 
<br />
<br />HP does not seem to provide Audio drivers for that model, therefore they would be just the default HD Audio drivers supplied by Windows

    <title>No Sound from Internal Speakers or Headphones - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phyoke  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Sound from Internal Speakers or Headphones</h2>
                    <p>My Dell Inspiron 5720 has periodically been affected by the sound randomly not working for extended periods. I'm going to try to be as clear as possible, so sorry if I sound pretentious or whatever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked at countless forum topics, help articles, and even YouTube videos trying to fix this problem, but nothing has worked so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sound does not play through my internal speakers or through my headphones. When I look at my Volume Mixer, it doesn't even register that there's sound being played (the green bar doesn't show up or move in response to sound). I have opened my Playback Devices
 menu and checked on things, and found that the green bars don't move there either. HOWEVER, when I right-click Speakers / Headphonesand select Test, my speakers play the test sound and the green bars show up (as long as I'm not playing any other sound in the
 background. If I am, it gives me an error message saying that the device is being used by another process).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's like my speakers and headphones aren't communicating with the programs that produce sound. The programs (Chrome, media players, etc.) all show that they are outputting, but my system doesn't seem to recognize it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, my F11 and F12 keys that increase and decrease the volume aren't working. When my computer starts up and (after it's done with its booting process) I try to change the volume via those keys, I'm supposed to have a transparent gray box appear showing
 my volume level that changes the more I press the buttons. But instead I have the box show up once, not let my volume change, then never show up again in response to button presses. HOWEVER, when I open my Playback Devices menu, that starts working again (without
 any actual sound output). I can make the gray box appear and the displayed volume level change, but after a while that just stops working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the Speakers / Headphones' mute button in my Volume Mixer, nothing happens. It doesn't change the Unmuted icon to a Muted icon. I can still mute and unmute things like System Sounds and Chrome, but not Speakers / Headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following sound drivers installed:</p>
<p>- Bluetooth Hands-free Audio</p>
<p>- High Definition Audio Device</p>
<p>- IDT High Definition Audio CODEC</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what causes or what (sometimes) fixes these problems, but this is a list of solutions I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Generic fixes, like I made sure the sound wasn't muted</p>
<p>- Made sure I wasn't trying to listen to the internal speakers when I had headphones plugged in, and vice versa</p>
<p>- Tested my headphones on another device, they work</p>
<p>- Made sure Speakers / Headphones in the Playback Devices is enabled</p>
<p>- Uninstalled the IDT High Definition Audio CODEC, removing the driver software, then rebooted</p>
<p>- Manually installed Dell's recommended IDT High Definition Audio Driver (Audio_Driver_PMYYG_WN_6.10.0.6426_A03.EXE) from their Product Support website</p>
<p>- Going into Recording Playback Devices and checking the box "Listen to this device" in my internal microphone's Properties</p>
<p>- Going into the Speakers / Headphones Properties and selecting/deselecting "Allow applications to take exclusive control over this device"</p>
<p>- Ran the audio troubleshooter, it told me everything was fine and dandy</p>
<p>- Gone into the BIOS and made sure my sound problem wasn't hardware-related (the testing tones played loud and clear)</p>
<p>- I've even gone as far as running thorough adware/malware scans to make sure there wasn't a process disabling my sound</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a really annoying problem that just randomly happens sometimes. This time I was watching a YouTube video with my headphones (everything worked), then paused the video, closed my laptop, and went to class. After class I opened my laptop, tried to
 watch the video again, and my headphones (only my headphones) didn't work. I tried reinstalling my audio drivers, then nothing worked. Then I deleted my IDT CODEC and rebooted, and it was back to headphones not working. This process continued until I got frustrated
 enough to come here and write this essay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help or advice!</p>

            <p>That's a thorough job of trouble shooting and a puzzling problem.&nbsp; It might be worth reinstalling the chip set driver, particularly since that affects the F11 / F12 functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your last paragraph re. the problem after closing the laptop implies a driver problem resuming from standby.&nbsp; It would be useful to know if rebooting alone (with having deleted the IDT CODEC) would have made a difference.&nbsp; If you can test that, it might
 be helpful.</p>

            <p>Hi Ashish,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, thanks for responding!</p>
<p>
</p><p>In response to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; 1. I haven't made any recent changes prior to this issue. This isn't the first time it's happened, but this is the first time that my troubleshooting steps have failed to solve the problem. There doesn't seem to be anything that I can recognize that triggers
 the problem; it just happens sometimes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; 2. The issue is universal to every sound-producing application I try to run. It's not specific to any one application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the fixit program and it told me "We did not detect any problems and therefore no fixes were applied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked and the Audio Service was already running. I restarted it, but nothing changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both updating and rolling back my existing drivers, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There is absolutely nothing wrong with my laptop's sound when I'm in my Linux partition, so I'm&nbsp;<em>pretty</em> sure this is a driver issue...even though none of the driver solutions have worked.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had forgotten to put it on the list, but one of the first things I did was to reinstall my chipset drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both restarting my computer without applying any changes and restarting my computer after deleting the IDT CODEC. Nothing changed either time.</p>
<p>

            You're welcome. The intermittent nature of the problem makes it hard to diagnose.&nbsp; I would suspect a possible hardware issue if it weren't for the proper functionality in Linux.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would consider testing in&nbsp; selective startup and a maybe a clean boot
 to look for a software or service conflict, but if it's highly intermittent that may not be practical.<br />

            <p>I am having persistent intermittent sound problems on my HP 1240T running 64 bit Win 7. I think the problem my be related to IE 11. Sounds are normal with testing under configuration, but the sounds episodically (and frequently) go very soft with AOL and
 other web sites. I tried all the usual fixes, drivers were reinstalled and updated. I ran MS audio fixit, and even some third party repair tools. Sometimes if I view a certain page with sound, it will go loud again, and stay that way for a while, but then
 it goes soft again. I also episodically hear the chime when a USB device is installed or removed, although there have not been any physical changes.</p>

    <title>Cannot upgrade from Win 7 Pro on MBR to Win 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivar wold  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot upgrade from Win 7 Pro  on MBR to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>My computer is an ASUS Ultrabook (UX31A)&nbsp;with 512 GB SSD disk and 4GB Memory. This was originally delivered with Windows 7 Home and since upgraded to Windows 7 Pro. For historical reasons (disk management tools), I installed&nbsp;this upgrade&nbsp;using MBR without&nbsp;the
 100MB&nbsp;System partition. This setup has been supremely stable and reliable. Before trying to upgrade, &nbsp;I&nbsp;ran disk-check with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many, many&nbsp;times without success to upgrade from Windows 7 Pro to Windows 10. The compatibility check does not show any problems with my computer or its apps.&nbsp;Trying the automatically downloaded upgrade, it starts a re-boot and then simply returns
 to Windows 7 without any error messages.&nbsp;When using Media Creator to force an upgrade, the upgrade starts, runs for a while and then&nbsp;terminates with a cryptic "<em>Something happened</em>"&nbsp; error message. Not really informative.&nbsp; I am now suspicious that Windows
 10 cannot be upgraded from, or on, an MBR disk. If that is so, shouldn't the compatibility check simply&nbsp;have warned me? I would actually&nbsp;be quite happy to have Windows 10 continue to run&nbsp;using MBR, not GPT, but I have no idea how to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to do a fresh install of Windows 10 and then laboriously re-installing all of my apps, it appears that I need a new&nbsp;Windows 10 key. The only way to get this, as far as I understand is to
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">first</span> do a successful&nbsp;upgrade from which such a key can be obtained. I am sure that many others must have run into this problem. Has anyone encountered this problem? Did anyone resolve this issue?

            <p>Thank you. I have resolved the problem myself and I have migrated my legacy Window 7 legacy MBR/BIOS setup to GPT/UEFI. Here's what I did:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Backed up my entire MBR/BIOS disk to an external USB drive using <em><strong>True Image</strong></em> 2014. This had an OS partition (C:) of 100GB with the remainder of the disk used for DATA (D:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Used <em><strong>Parted Magic</strong></em> to remove all MBR partitions and create a single unformatted GPT/UEFI partition on my SSD disk in a single step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Used Rufus 2.2 with my Windows 7 Pro ISO file install medium to create a GPD/UEFI bootable thumb drive.
<p>
</p><p>4. Installed Windows 7 PRO. Did not enter the Windows license code (not necessary). At this point Windows 7 PRO was installed on a single
<strong>GPT/UEFI</strong> partition containing all of the disk space. You may want to check this with a disk manager like Ease US or Acronis Disk Director.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Used Windows 7's Disk Manager to shrink the large
<strong>C:</strong> partition to 100GB. Rebooted and used Windows 7's Disk Manager to create a new primary partition on the rest of the disk. Made sure that the new partition had drive letter
<strong>D</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Installed <em><strong>True Image 2014</strong></em> on the new Windows 7 Pro. Does not need activation. Used it to restore the D: and C: partitions from the backup made in Step 1 above. I did D: first, then C:. Restoring the C: partition over-writes the
 temporary Windows install in step 4 and restores the OS, its apps and licenses to the same state as my MBR/BIOS &nbsp;setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's it. My Windows 7 Pro is now migrated to GDP/UEFI and should now be ready for the Windows 10 Upgrade (I hope).</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Both of the attached DMP files are of the <u><b>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</b></u> bug check.<br />
<br />
<i>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</i><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.<br />
<br />
By default, the fault is NETIO.sys which is the Network I/O Subsystem (not the true cause). I've seen tons and tons of these *D1 network related crashes lately, and almost all of them are after upgrades to Windows 8 and or 8.1. We generally have two main causes:<br />
<br />
1. Network drivers themselves need to be updated.<br />
<br />
2. 3rd party antivirus or firewall software that carried over from the upgrade and or install is no longer compatible and is in general causing NETBIOS conflicts and corruption.<br />
<br />
I see McAfee after taking a look at your loaded modules list, so let's go ahead and remove and replace McAfee with Windows 8's built-in Windows Defender for temporary troubleshooting purposes:<br />
<br />

<h3> michaelstapleton1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 isn&#39;t detecting my headset microphone</h2>
                    <p>Just the other day I bought a brand new headset with a microphone so I can have a better mic than the one that is built into my laptop. I've searched several forums and even the company's website to figure out the problem but I can't seem to fix it. My laptop
 doesn't detect the mic on the headset. All my drivers are up to date, the troubleshooter can't find the issue and I have my system notify me when an audio device is plugged in so I can choose headset. When I go to recording devices, the only mic settings there
 are the one for my laptop that's built in, even tho I have display disabled devices enabled. I can't figure out the problem.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af686d69-f34c-4860-83d5-36d37b98b032" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/af686d69-f34c-4860-83d5-36d37b98b032" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/088803df-5e3e-4069-b6be-32db44d0ed40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/088803df-5e3e-4069-b6be-32db44d0ed40" /></a></p>

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Sound Recording and Devices troubleshooters at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />In Device Manager after confirming you have the latest Sound drivers, uninstall them all and restart PC to reinstall them. 
<br />
<br />Also in Device Manager locate the device to see if it is installed and running.  
<br />
<br />When it generates the question of what you plugged in, try Microphone to try to get it to show up so you can set it as Default which is also required.  
<br />
<br />I would also go to another WIndows 10 PC to plug it in and observe if and how it loads correctly. 
<br />
<br />With any hardware you have a one year Support warranty so I'd try to chat with them to see if it's a known issue and get their tips.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Nana.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It sounds like it's displaying Unicode which is the page code and not text.  
<br />
<br />On the Notepad Format tab, choose Font, then Consolas, Size 11, Regular type to return it to default.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

                    <p>I recently changed internet providers and now have a new e-mail address.&nbsp; I have tried everything that is accessible on this website but nothing let's me change my e-mail address.&nbsp; I can change my name, payment information, etc., but not my e-mail address.&nbsp;
 I now get an error message that tells me that I have to wait a month before I can get a code that presumably will let me change my e-mail address.&nbsp; Nothing should be this complicated!&nbsp; I have synched to my office computer and can't get into my account because
 I can't change the e-mail address that gives me access to my programs on that computer.&nbsp;
