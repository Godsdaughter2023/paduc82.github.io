<p>Hi LuffyMok,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being unable to connect to any network could mean that your wireless connection or wireless switch could be disabled, the airplane mode could be enabled that's why the network connections are disabled, or could be that the network adapters is no longer detected.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To determine what could be causing this problem, please allow me to ask the following information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What changes were performed on your computer prior to the issue?</li><li>Have you installed any updates recently?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, please check if your wireless switch is turned on. Make sure also that the airplane mode is turned off. If it is on, turn it off. Kindly navigate to<strong> Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings</strong>
 and check if you have either or both <em>Ethernet and wireless connections</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also run the <strong>Network Adapter Troubleshooter</strong>. Just go to<strong> Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Network Adapter</strong>, then click
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Tip&#58; Playing Original Xbox Games on Modern 360</h2>
                    
<p>So I recently purchased a new Xbox 360 HDD for my old Premium since my 20GB was getting WAY too full. I swapped everything out and so far everything worked great. That is, until I tried to play an Original Xbox title from disc. I tried Halo 2, Mechassault
 2, DOA, and I kept getting the same error every time: "The game couldn't start. Try downloading the game again." I contacted an Xbox Ambassador and the dude was awesome, but totally stumped. We then got a logic chain going and I theorized that if I swapped
 drives again and hooked up my old 20GB to it. It INSTANTLY allowed me to play old-school games and I was able to re-play EVERY Original Xbox game that I had. I would recommend passing this around to every gamer you can think of that still plays the old games
 and has this issue.</p>

<p>Where did you buy your hard drive from?&nbsp; If it was from the likes of eBay and was nice and cheap, it's a fake drive.&nbsp; Yes it will probably work fine with 360 games, but you won't be able to play original Xbox software.&nbsp; Fake drives are missing the emulator
 software that allows the 360 to run original games, it's also probably missing vital 2GB reserved for backwards compatibility too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically, you've been had.&nbsp; The only way to play original Xbox games on a 360 is with an official Microsoft hard drive.</p>

                    <p>I have lost several bingo coins etc., because the game either freezes up or the "watch ads" feature to get more tickets/coins does not work.&nbsp; Also I had two cards completely filled and the game froze and I never got the prizes for that.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Explorer.exe Constantly crashing after Fresh install - Only on certain - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danhumm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe Constantly crashing after Fresh install - Only on certain apps &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue after a fresh install came home from work, opened the Microsoft store with it then beginning to crash constantly until i closed the Microsoft store. From further investigation it seems any Apps that come with Windows or come pre installed
 seems to trigger it crashing also. (CMD doesnt seem to trigger it, seems only apps)&nbsp; It also happens randomly with chrome sometimes when playing videos. I've looked in the event viewer to discover this in regards of explorer.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>Faulting application name: explorer.exe, version: 10.0.18362.1, time stamp: 0x634b66a3</p>
<p>Faulting module name: npsm.dll, version: 10.0.18362.1, time stamp: 0xcb342b40</p>
<p>Exception code: 0xc0000005</p>
<p>Fault offset: 0x0000000000005474</p>
<p>Faulting process ID: 0x1d90</p>
<p>Faulting application start time: 0x01d51eb4ffff0c64</p>
<p>Faulting application path: C:\Windows\explorer.exe</p>
<p>Faulting module path: C:\Windows\System32\npsm.dll</p>
<p>Report ID: a5ea017b-9e91-4ea3-8ca9-1f3cc7a054b4</p>
<p>Faulting package full name:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Faulting package-relative application ID:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all seems to be consistent with 883 errors of the exact same issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched through my minidump folder and have discovered a dump file from yesterday this was towards the end of the installation when it was setting everything up. I was not here for it however as i had went off to work so im not sure the details of
 it but the dump file has been uploaded to my onedrive:&nbsp; https://1drv.ms/u/s!AqyVjJFzsqdkhFiSsUO-9MKoWbN7</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the record, it is a legitimate version of windows with the installation media being a USB that was set up using Microsofts Windows 10 Installation Media tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is able to help or shed some light on this i would be insanely grateful! I would like to preferably avoid reinstalling windows if i can but if it needs to happen more than happy to.</p>

            <p>Try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click start menu and enter admin command prompt<br />
</p>
<p>Run the command 'powercfg /energy' without the quotes</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will take 60 seconds and generate a report for you, likely under c:\Windows\system32</p>
<p>
</p><p>Navigate to that directory and drag the HTML file to your desktop. Open the file there and take notice of the errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any error you see referencing a specific device, i.e NIC, sound card, etc likely needs their drivers updated. Right click the start menu and enter device manager. Search automatically for updated drivers of the devices listed in your energy report.
 You may also need to head to the device manufacturers website for drivers if Windows can't automatically find them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue seemed to be my sound card as once I updated that I was able to enter sleep mode and shutdown without issue. Please let me know if this works for you guys.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Dacuda PocketScan - trying to get it to work on a Windows 7</h2>
                    Having problems getting this to work, should be simple.&nbsp; No software came with the device, bought a Bluetooth 4.0 dongle, installed okay.&nbsp; The window showing connecting computer to pocketscan came up once and I started to scan, but nothing came up on the
 screen and the window just showed a squiggle on a page&nbsp; within that small window.&nbsp; Since then just shows connecting, but never does.&nbsp; Yes I am a bit of a techie veg but figured this would simple.&nbsp; Any ideas? Anyone got one up and running on Windows 7? Have
 been dealling with a help desk for Dacuda but not getting far.&nbsp; Also, when I use the usb cable, Windows says no driver. Thanks!

            Will reply as best I can.&nbsp; No, I did not make any changes to the computer apart from buy the bluetooth dongle and installed the software for same.&nbsp; I checked and I do have the Service Pack 1 update.&nbsp; The issue is specific to the Dacuda PocketScan, the
 first bluetooth device I have used.&nbsp; I have sent messages to Dacuda Help Desk and have re-downloaded their software at least three times, rebooted my desktop and finally it did seem that the two devices were communicating, but when I try to scan anything,
 I do not get the scanned page on my desktop, just a blank page with scan typed top left but it doesn't advance any further.&nbsp; Otherwise, it just says connecting the bluetooth with the device, but no connection takes place.&nbsp; It looks very easy when you look
 at the youtube and vimeo clips.&nbsp; Thanks<br />

            No, I've had to go further with this problem and called in my computer expert, he also tried, to no avail.&nbsp; He then took it home and found that it did work on his Mac but not on Windows, apparently it's a driver problem.&nbsp; No driver is supplied with the
 scanner and this is a big issue when using Windows 7.&nbsp; He has taken it away again and so far, no news.&nbsp;

            This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.

<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.

<h3> alumpyone  say:</h3>
<h2>            RPC and other services disabled, unable to restart</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using XP Pro, with service pack 3. I believe I recently was infected with a trojan, and my antivirus (was using Avast) and the malware program I was using (Malwarebytes) were both disable. I couldn't run either.</p>
<p>I uninstalled both, installed another spyware program recommended by a friend and it found an quanentined the trojan. I have sense run antivirus and rootkit scanners and have have found nothing new.</p>
<p>However, I don't have any printers and am unable to install a new one as the Print Spooler service is not running. I'm unable to start the service, as when I select it in services and right click to start, all options are greyed out. I have no Taskbar and
 have been unable to get that to start. I have to get into explorer by crtl+alt+del, open Task manager and run from there. IE is not working either, the only access to the web on that computer is via Firefox.</p>
<p>The following services are also disabled and when right-clicked, all options are greyed out: RPC, RPC Locater, Clipbook, Alerter, HID Access, Network DDE, Network DDE DSDM, Routing and Remote Access, and Telnet.</p>
<p>I'm also unable to copy and paste, which has hindered my attempts to run scans and post log information. I've read that the RPC service controls a lot of windows, so is there any way I can fix and get this service to start again without having to reinstall
 the OS?</p>

<p>I have almost exactly the same problem, but with XP Home SP2.</p>
<p>My McAfee products were always active and did not watch anything.</p>
<p>RPC service is no longer activated, and I tried without any success a lot of attempts to reactivate it.</p>
<p>In such a situation, the taskbar has vanished. No more access to printer. No way to copy files. No access to a previous correct state of the OS. And more...</p>
<p>It seems that some file(s) should be missing or corrupted ? the error message being:</p>
<p>" Error 2: the specified file cannot be found".</p>
<p>When looking at c:\windows\system32, 3 files are there:</p>
<p>rpcns4.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22 K</p>
<p>rpct4.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 572 K</p>
<p>rpcss.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 392 K</p>
<p>But I can't know whether or not thy are OK or whether some others are missing ?</p>
<p>Should I be obliged to reinstall XP ? And to loose a number of great softwares already installed ?</p>

<h2>            Win7 D3D11.1 and Hybrid Graphics Issue</h2>
                    <p>I'm on a windows 7 OS, 64bit, 3.0ghz quadcore, 8gb ram.&nbsp; The desktop is from HP, the chipset is AMD&nbsp;and the graphics card is Nvidia.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible for me to install the win7 platform update and get a functional D3D11.1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't afford to get the "blue screen of death", which is why I'm asking this question here.&nbsp; I was reading from the Microsoft website and saw that some hybrid systems will get the blue screen of death with the win7 platform update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not totally for sure on the meaning of this "hybrid system" thing, but when I read hybrid, I think AMD and Intel Motherboard in one...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have programs on win7 that can't run because they're asking for D3D11.1.</p>

            backup your files before installing SP1, you definitely need it to run Direct X 11.1.

<h3> gregogane  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 install on DELL Inspiron 530 boot issue</h2>
                    <p>I have 4 drives on my computer</p>
<p>D: Native drive with VISTA Backup - I use it for storage, I only left the recovery partition in case I will ever use it.</p>
<p>C: OCZ SSD Drive - A drive with VISTA SP2 installed it was my main boot HDD</p>
<p>F: SAMSUNG EVO 850 - THIS IS THE DRIVE ONTO WHICH I INSTALLED WIN10 The program files folder and windows and all the rest of the win10 files ARE THERE!</p>
<p>E: 2Gb Storage drive - I extracted the win10&nbsp;ISO&nbsp;onto it because I could not&nbsp;get the system to boot and install win10 from a usb drive but was successful booting the setup from this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK lets push D and C out of the way. Here's the situation</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to boot from the F: I constantly get the error no boot drive found and with an enumeration of SATA1: installed, SATA2: installed, Etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However if I boot from&nbsp;E:, where I extracted the ISO, It boots and displays a WIN10 Option to RUN WIN10 or to GO TO SETUP. IF I select setup then it restarts pc, I choose the E: to boot from and I go to WIN10 setup, IF I choose WIN 10, it boots win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me why is it that I cannot boot from F:? This is the drive where I pointed win 10 to be installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My boot sequence is correct, and I know for sure that I cannot run win 10 from F: because If I disconnect everything else, but F: I still get that error no boot drive found and with an enumeration of SATA1: installed, SATA2: not installed,&nbsp;Etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel that F: is lacking a Boot sector or something along those lines. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what I also did is I extracted the WIN 10 ISO ONTO F: like I did on E: and I still cant boot from it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>F: is a Samsung SSD 850 EVO 250GB ATA Drive</p>
<p>Device Type: Disk Drives</p>
<p>Manufacturer: (standard Disk Drives)</p>
<p>Location: Location 0 (Channel 1, Target 0, Lun 0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In disk Management:</p>
<p>232.88GB NTFS</p>
<p>Healthy (Boot, Page File, Active, Crash Dump, Primary Partition)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I'm missing System in there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways I think I exhausted all my possibilities on google searches, please see if you can find what's going on with my system.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue further regarding with boot concern, we suggest that you create a
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">media creation tool</a></strong>.
</p>
<p>You'll need to use a fresh or blank USB to install the ISO file and observe if.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the result.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you would like to change your IP address.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may try the steps given below and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. Find out your IP address from ISP.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">2. Copy It.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">3. Open Network &amp; Sharing Center</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">4. Open the Properties of the network you what your IP to change. In my case it is an EVDO modem.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">5. On the Networking tab double-click TCP/IPv4 which will open a window to edit IP and DNS IP address.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">6. On this window Click on "Use the following IP address" and paste that IP you copied at Step 2.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">7. Change the last digit of the IP to any value above it e.g. if its 192.168.23.123 edit the last digit to something like 122 so
 that the IP becomes 192.168.23.122.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">8. Click OK until all the windows close.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">9. Disconnect from that network.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">10. Reconnect to that network and if it goes as planned the ISP should force a Dynamic IP.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now check if you have changed the IP.

<p>Pictures Library.&nbsp; I do not have any feeds to this that I know of, but do occasionally save a newspaper article.&nbsp; Although the (link to the?) web&nbsp;page is saved to documents, today I recognised one photo, but the rest are unwanted.&nbsp; is the Media Player corrupted?&nbsp;

</p><p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Pictures Library that you see in Media Player is&nbsp;displaying the contents of the default
<strong>Pictures Library</strong> in <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can manage the Pictures Library from within Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>. <strong>Right Click</strong> the <strong>
Pictures Library</strong> and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will show a list of all the&nbsp;Locations that the Pictures Library is configured to monitor for pictures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The default locations are your <strong>My Pictures</strong> folder and the <strong>
Public Pictures</strong> folder. You can select to <strong>Add or Remove</strong> any of those locations.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>hi.&nbsp; thank u very much for trying to help.&nbsp; I did check the properties as suggested and the only images in it are the 7 colour photos Koala etc. which came with it when new.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a feed or a setting which allows unwanted images to be saved and interfere with my own stored photos when using Windows Media Player, then I have not yet been able to identify it or change that.&nbsp; (I have also found something odd with Windows
 Live Mail viewed offline... thousands of pdf files in amongst my own emails.&nbsp; when I go online and log in, it seems ok there.&nbsp; not expecting u to help with that, unless anything springs to mind.&nbsp; will maybe post new thread after a search etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already spent 4+ hours deleting the photos manually.&nbsp; not easily done as the unwanted images interacted in some way with my own photos, even covering them up.&nbsp; I then had to go to the bin, check them all again and restore my own images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did save 1 more press article and a flood of c1740 images came in again.&nbsp; and removed them manually again.&nbsp; so will have to find a means of saving only the article, without the rest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>for info.&nbsp; I have all Windows updates and anti viral and other checks show no problems that way.&nbsp; I use mobile broadband (dongle).&nbsp; 5Gb per month.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank u again.&nbsp; have given kudos for helpful reply.&nbsp; but still looking for answer as to how I can</p>
<p>stop the images going to (and interfering with my own photos) in WMP.&nbsp; Also appreciate if anyone can help me get rid of the the unwanted pdf (and others)&nbsp;files&nbsp;in Windows Live Mail list as&nbsp;they will not delete individually,&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I select all and delete offline.... will that mean the files are permanently lost when I log in to outlook?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;I've had the same problem, and after finding one slightly complex solution, I came across the simpler version of checking what your
 and deleting the files --- ONLY from the&nbsp; media player library, not the computer as well, I was able to get my holiday snaps back as my only slideshow. Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 deleted Administrator Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelcifizzariyx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 deleted Administrator Account</h2>
                    <p>I do not know the built in Admin. Account password. I've tried a number of options only to get a window requiring a pass word. I've done the command prompt "/active:yes" does not work. Cannot restore. Essentially locked out of my computer admin. ability.
 Only have a Guest Account to work from. &nbsp;Will a Windows 7 recovery work? My CD/DVD is inactive. Will not let me operate a disc. Is there a way to force it to function? Cannot download anything without getting the Window requiring a PW. Is there a way to find
 the built in Admin. PW? Any suggestions would be much appreciated?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>If you were using your own administrator account (as you are supposed to), then the built-in one should still be available for you to use.&nbsp; Just boot into safe mode by rebooting while pressing F8.&nbsp; Once inside Safe Mode, the built-in administrator account
 should automatically become available for use (it has no password by default).&nbsp; Use it to reset the password of your own account, then reboot again to resume normal operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you were already using the built-in administrator account, and you have no other accounts (bad idea!), then you have to erase the computer and re-install Windows.&nbsp; In that case:</p>

</p><p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">If your computer came with Windows 7, then your computer manufacturer may have shipped it with a built-in recovery mode.&nbsp; How you access this varies from maker to maker, but usually involves rebooting while pressing a special key
 like Delete or Escape.</p>

 crashed, I reinstalled with their install disk and then the cd protion stopped working. Mr. Fix it detected filter problems but could not repair. Can someone please help?

<strong>Start at top here and please do ALL even though you might have done some before as it is
<br />
often the total process which solves the issue.<br />
</strong><br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab - click<br />
Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT
<br />
this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose cable or<br />
slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
Hope these help.<br />
