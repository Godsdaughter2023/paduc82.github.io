    <title>Xbox 360 Slim red dot on power button. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim red dot on power button. </h2>
                    
<p>My xbox 360 slim 250GB has a red dot on the power button. The console isn't displaying any video, since the button turns red the moment the machine turns on. There is not error code. I tried removing the hard drive and unplugging the power supply, but nothing
 changes. My PSU is fine, since my friend's brick doesn't change anything.</p>

<p>Hey there, have you tried;</p>
<p>Solid red light (Xbox 360 S or Xbox 360 E console) </p>
<p>There is a solid red light on my console and the screen is blank. </p>
<p>Try the following steps: </p>
<p>1.Let the power supply cool for about 30 minutes. </p>
<p>2.Plug the power supply into a different wall outlet. </p>
<p>3.Disconnect and reconnect all accessories. </p>
<p>4.Check the power supply. </p>
<p>5.Remove the hard drive. </p>
<p>6.If the above steps don’t solve the issue, order a replacement power supply from the Xbox Online Service Center.
</p>
<p>There is a flashing red light on my console and I get the error: The Xbox 360 is shutting down to protect the console from insufficient ventilation.

<h2>            Battery not detected Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>This just happened to me right now on a Surface Pro 3.&nbsp; I had used the machine yesterday no problem, put it to sleep, then this morning it would not power up.&nbsp; I plugged it into AC and it came on fine - and told me no battery was detected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shutdown and restarted several times, didn't make a difference.&nbsp; I then tried shutting down, and powering up using the power button + volume up button.&nbsp; This forces it to the BIOS/UEFI screen.&nbsp; I then exited BIOS without saving any changes, and let it
 restart.&nbsp; The battery is detected again and seems to be charging......</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it happens again I'll be asking for a replacement.<br />

            <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was experiencing the same issue as reported here.&nbsp;&nbsp; My issue was fixed with the help of a chat technician.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just received my unit and powered it up, all was well for 2 days then I encountered this issue.&nbsp; After&nbsp;plugging in my unit for 24 hours with
 no luck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;unplugged the power adapter and&nbsp;could not power&nbsp;the unit up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps to correct my issue:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1) After booting the system with the power adapter connected, Hold Down the power button until the unit powers itself off.&nbsp;&nbsp; (Do not swipe down.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Disconnect the power adapter from the unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3)&nbsp;Press and hold the Power Button (wait for a depleted system battery icon full screen)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4) re-connect the power adapter to the unit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Press and hold the volume up and Power button for 15 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; (the unit keyboard will light up then power down if you hold it the full 15 seconds.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>6) Press and hold the volume up and power button until the keyboard lights up (about 5 seconds)</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) If the system/bios menu appears, select exit and restart</p>
<p>
</p><p>8) Battery is present and charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp; This should be a one time fix, I suspect that it never charged until I went through the steps listed above.&nbsp;&nbsp; I hopes this helps others with the same issue.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Thanks Bennett</p>
<p>thats a good start, but I am looking for a bit more about advanced settings, such as:</p>
<p>a) the task bar colour is such that I can't readily see the icons for some apps that I have pinned. I have tried all colours to no avail</p>
<p>b) in setting up email I get messages that require me to enter info and then okay ( or some such). However the button is hidden by the task bar and I can't select it or move or resize the message box. My screen resolution is set to the recommended.&nbsp;</p>

            I find it odd that the link to the getting started article is intended for Great Britain. Is there a similar article for the English-US? I have a number of people who look to me for expertise and advice on using computers, and I've been telling them that
 Microsoft has surely done a good job in tutorials, or getting started, or user guide, or some such online documentation, but then I'm amazed that I cannot find anything. If I search Microsoft for user guide for Windows&nbsp; 10, I'm directed to the Microsoft store
 where they are pushing apps and games. Where is the support documentation?<br />

<p>E.g. Settings -&gt; Windows Update -&gt; Restart options -&gt; Get Help</p>
<p>Will only go to the virtual agent answers regarding Windows 10 settings in general.</p>
<p>Asking about Restart options does not help very much.</p>

<p><span>Hi Saleh2506,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try and remove the disk, remove the write protection (by flipping a tab on the disk), then try again.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have the flip on the USB drive, try the following steps to resolve the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>Start, </strong>type <strong>regedit.exe </strong>and hit ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to the following location:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrrentControlSet\Control</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>3. Right-click
<strong>Control </strong>and select <strong>New</strong> and<strong> Key.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>4. Name it as StorageDevicePolicies.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Click StorageDevicePolicies and on the right pan right-click and select
<strong>New</strong> &gt; <strong>DWORD</strong> and name it as WriteProtect.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Double click on it and set its value to 0.</span></p>

    <title>Last Backup&#58; Displays &#39;Never&#39; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chemist patrick  say:</h3>
<h2>            Last Backup&#58; Displays &#39;Never&#39;</h2>
                    
<p>I recently upgraded from XP to Windows 7.&nbsp; I backed up to an external drive.&nbsp; After backup is 'complete', it displays "Check you backup results.&nbsp; The backup completed but some files were skipped".&nbsp; I checked the file list and it list 3 files that could not
 be found.&nbsp; I've repeated the backup several times and it always errors on&nbsp;the same files.&nbsp; I've navigated to the folders and they don't exisit.&nbsp; Why ie it trying to backup files that don't exist?</p>
<p>Also, the Backup and Restore windows shows "Last Backup:&nbsp; Never".&nbsp; Shouldn't this show the date of the last backup even if it returned a few errors?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Patrick</p>

<h3> polski777  say:</h3>
<h2>             I&#39;m not able to burn video files to DVD-R disk using Windows, or Windows Media Player. </h2>
                    I'm not able to burn video files to DVD-R disk using Windows, or Windows Media Player. At the end of burning it stops and says that there was a problem with burning, or it finishes burning but when I try to play the disk on computer the disk is not playable.
 It just turns in disk drive and nothing happens. Also, I'm not able to backup video files to video disk. The formating starts and then I get a message that formating was not successful. I tried Microsoft Automated Troubleshooting Services "Fix It" and I got
 a message, "DVD disk in drive D is not writable disk", however I use new blank DVD-R disks so we can be 100% sure that they are writable. What is wrong here?

<p>Hi Polski777,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;Was it working before?<br />
•&nbsp;Does this happen only with video files?<br />
•&nbsp;Do you use any 3rd party burning software? If yes, try disabling it and then check if you are able to burn the DVD.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Make sure that the CD-R or CD-RW drive is recognized as a recordable device<br />
</strong>To make sure that the CD-R drive or the CD-RW drive is recognized as a recordable drive, make sure that the Recording tab appears in the CD drive properties:
<br />
i.&nbsp;Click Start, and then click My Computer.<br />
ii.&nbsp;Right-click the CD-R drive or the CD-RW drive, click Properties, and then look for the Recording tab. Make sure that DVD drive is a selected as the recording device.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2: Choose a slower burning speed for your DVD burner by doing the following:<br />
</strong>i.&nbsp;Return to the Add pictures and video to the DVD page, and then click Options.<br />
ii.&nbsp;In the DVD burner speed box, select Medium or Slow.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
If you are still having problems, you might consider checking the manufacturer of your DVD burner's Web site to update the drive with the latest firmware.</p>

<h2>            Locked out of Windows 10</h2>
                    My Microsoft account alias has changed and I'm now locked out of my laptop. The sign in screen still shows my old email that no longer exists and is no longer my account alias. I have no way to sign in under the email that is now my account alias. From
 talking to Microsoft we established that my password is good since I can sign into all the sites. Please help me finally get this resolved.&nbsp;

<h3> blockcabin  say:</h3>
<h2>            FileTypesMan messed up .exe icons</h2>
                    So I used FileTypesMan to change the icon of .exe files. Turns out, this changes all programs to have that icon, they don't use what they were given. For example, google chrome has the default .exe icon instead of the google chrome icon. What would really
 help me is if I knew how to undo the changes that FileTypesMan did or fix it at all. I am on Windows 10, so please tell me what to do knowing that. Thanks, I really hope I get help.

            <p>Cannot make another account for the same reason, I cannot impute anything from the keyboard. I can open my Microsoft works word processor type what I need to impute then copy and then paste in any of the new apps in windows10. The programs that were part
 of my windows7 seem to operate find but the new windows10 apps seem to lockup when I try to impute directly from the keyboard. I tried uninstalling the keyboard driver and restarting but that didn't work! Cannot figure out how the keyboard drivers are find
 for my programs I had from windows7 but the windows10 upgrade apps there not. Seems to me there is no problem with the keyboard but something in Windows10 software! I Am a novice at this. I have an MSI A5000 laptop!</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that whenever you try to play game it crashes with an error code.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the Methods.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you mentioned, when you open chrome it crashes, I would suggest you to get in touch with chrome support and further proceed with your issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span><span>&nbsp;

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.

    <title>Windows 10 lost partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeymowbray  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 lost partition</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 &amp; in doing so the partitioning on my disk was altered, such that my D Drive has completely disappeared &amp; been replaced by a second recovery partition of approximately the same size (50% of the computer's memory). &nbsp;I can't access
 anything in that partition - there's clearly some content there - much of the space is in use, but I can't see whether any of my old files remain. &nbsp;My D Drive has my family photos on it &amp; hadn't been backed up for quite a while. &nbsp;I fear that I may have lost
 them.</p>
<p>Then this morning Microsoft took over my computer &amp; when I switched on, sinister messages appeared: &nbsp;"We have updated your computer" then "All your files are right where you left them". &nbsp;They are not - Microsoft's upgrade has done damage &amp; I can't see how
 to reverse their actions.</p>
<p>I'm no computer expert &amp; don't know what to do now. &nbsp;Does anyone know how I can get back my D drive?</p>

            <p>Hi Joey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Share this information to assist you better.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>How did you upgrade to Windows 10? Was it clean installation or Upgrade?</li><li>Totally how many drives was present?</li><li>Have you checked the status of the drive in Disk Manager?</li></ol>
<p>Microsoft did not take over the computer, may be the windows update has been installed if you have turned on the&nbsp;Automatic Windows update option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you send the screenshot of the issue, so we can understand the issue and assist you accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually, but not always, after installing Windows&nbsp;10 you will have a Windows.old folder on your C: drive &nbsp;contains all the important files (user data, Program Files, Windows files, etc.) from the older version of Windows that was installed on your computer,
 and can be used to revert back to a previous version of Windows. Open Windows Explorer click on the C: drive - if the Windows.old folder is on your hard drive it will contain all your files from the previous Windows system, and it can be deleted if you don't
 need it to free up space on your hard drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful, let us know the status of the issue. We will assist you better.</p>

            <p>It's a Samsung laptop. Model NP300E5A.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to have Windows 7 - the computer has been prompting me to upgrade to Windows 10 for a few weeks - I had been ignoring the update prompts for a while &amp; eventually decided to let the update go ahead over the holiday period.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer has only one hard drive, but this was partitioned into a C drive &amp; a D drive. &nbsp;In addition, there was a recovery partition, which appears to still be there. &nbsp;But the D drive appears to have switched itself into another recovery partition &amp; it's
 now far smaller than before. &nbsp;It was about half the total computer's memory. &nbsp;There is no longer a D drive &amp; all the files (mostly family photos) are no longer accessible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been able to change the second recovery partition into a primary partition, to hopefully stop the computer from overwriting what's in there, but I still can't access my old files, or anything else in there.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I realise that I should have backed the computer up before allowing the upgrade to take place, but now that I find myself in this mess, I really just want to be able to get those pictures back.</p>

Be sure to check if your billing information is correct at <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> and also check <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/services</a> for any outstanding amount issues, these need to be sorted prior to being able to redeem codes. <br />After that try redeeming the code on both xbox console and via xbox.com/redeemcode</p><p><br />Also check that the Xbox Live account , the console and code all match region wise, using different regions for any of them cause issues too.<br /><br />If you can't find anything wrong and it is still not working, best thing to do is to contact official Xbox Support via Phone or Microsoft Support Chat at <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://suppor

            Check first to see if you can get your email in the browser and make sure your account is ok.
<br />So open a browser and go to live.com if you microsoft outlook or hotmail email.
<br />Go to gmail.com if gmail email etc.
<br />if you can do that then the first step is to remove the account from windows mail and re add it.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the best karaoke style game to get..? I'm looking for one that has the biggest song library availabe and that will actually rate you on your singing ability?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also what kind of microphone should I get? I want one that will work with both the&nbsp; xbox360 and playstation3 and even better it will work with my PC too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there any kind of adapter I could get&nbsp; that will allow&nbsp; me to use my shure mics with the game consoles?</p>

            <p>I would recommend the new Karaoke app that is out in the app marketplace. &nbsp;It has over 8000 songs available on the list with a leaderboard.</p>
<p>You can use any combination of wired/wireless mics or your xbox headset.</p>
<p>It has achievements if you like earning them.</p>
<p>You would have to purchase time in 2, 6 or 24 hour blocks but be aware that the time counts down even if you aren't using the app so I only purchase in 2 hour blocks.</p>

<p>The karaoke app is cool, but I also highly recommend the Karaoke Revolution series, which consists of 4 games, and most of the time you can find them with a microphone for only $20 to $30.</p>
<p>The first 2 are the Karaoke Revolution: American Idol Encore series, the third is just called Karaoke Revolution, and currently available at many retailers is Karaoke Revolution: Glee.</p>
<p>This series also has extra songs you can download from the marketplace, and some of the songs seem to carry over between the games.</p>

<p>I am going to recommend the Lips games. They can still be found on eBay, with wireless microphones, for a reasonable price. The Lips mics also work with the free Karaoke app that is also by the same company iNiS. My biggest complaint about the free Karaoke
 app is that there is no way to gauge your singing, just words that light up on screen. The Lips games make it easy to adjust your pitch based on the on-screen bars and whether or not they fill up.</p>

    <title>Media feature pack - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djordjenikolic2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media feature pack</h2>
                    Hello, I have a problem with the media feature pack. In fact, my camera wasnt working and it said that I need to download the media feature pack for windows 10 pro n and kn. So I did that. Now, if I try to install it again it says that it is already installed,
 but when I try to start the camera or some video on my pc, it does not work. I tried in app settings, windows features, I tried everything I found online that I should do to fix this problem and nothing. The main problem is, that media feature pack is not
 shown anywhere. Like there isnt one in the pc. If anyone had the similar problem, I hope to give me the solution. I can easily install windows 10 with licence again, but I wanted to try to fix this one because this is a pro version and I have original education
 version of windows 10. Thanks for your time everyone, and I hope we will find the solution together. Cheers. Djordje

            Hi Djordje.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible fixes that are working for webcam problems.  If you need help performing any steps I am standing by to help.
<br />
<br />Try resetting the Camera app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Camera &gt; Advanced Options.  
<br />
<br />Did you enable the Privacy setting to allow apps to use your webcam?  
<br /><a href="https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disable-camera-or-webcam-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.top-password.com/blog/enable-disabl...</a>
<br /><a href="https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-camera-and-privacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10-...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also these steps from Microsoft for when webcam isn't working:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/windows-10-camera-does-not-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13753/...</a>
<br />
<br />Try the Hardware &amp; Devices troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the webcam driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  
<br />
<br />To locate the driver in Device Manager (accessed by right clicking the Start Button) choose the View tab &gt; Show Hidden Devices.
<br />
<br />Also compare all other drivers including Chipset, display, sound, etc to make sure you have the latest on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Webcam device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br /> 
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br /> 
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

    <title>Reach FPS drops and screen lag - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reach FPS drops and screen lag</h2>
                    
<p>So a general question , I know this issue was presented a while ago when the emulation was published , I just bought an xbox one , updated everything solely for Halo , other than that I use my PS4 , so I get the master chief collection &nbsp;, looks great , and
 I decide I want reach again , by far the best Halo ever made.</p>

<p>Now on my buddys box one it had this issue , but I figured it was just his copy or the xbox itself.</p>

<p>Come to find out , its the emulator , and I know MC responded to this issue a while ago and I believe the emulator was supposed to have been fixed. So is the game still just broken , and I say broken because lets be honest , the FPS drop is so bad &nbsp;, the
 only person who could enjoy it is someone who likes low end quality , or is there some special setting or update I need to be getting to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any responses.</p>

<p>Hi I played reach last week on my xbox one and it seems OK and runs definitely playable now. There was a massive update for a 360 game recently and this has helped most issues. &nbsp;Hope that helps!</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Wade,
<div><br />
Is this issue occurs only when you play songs through ITunes or any other apps?</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the iTunes and see if it helps resolving the issue.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue is only through ITunes, you may need to change the settings. I suggest you to Contact Apple support to know how to change the settings, they will be more equipped to assist you.</div>
<div><a href="https://www.apple.com/in/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.apple.com/in/support/</span></a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the information helps. Keep us posted if you need any assistance on Windows. We are glad to assist you.</div>
<div><br />
Thank you.</div>

    <title>Investigating wrong WLID&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> queblin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Investigating wrong WLID&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have been working with phone support for the issues with my account for the last 52 days, and have still not had resolution. I was hoping to possibly get some help in the forums.</p>
<p>Here is what has happened:<br />
On May 8th, I found I was unable to sign in to Xbox LIVE, I received an error message that my credentials were invalid. I was unsuccessful in trying to recover my account. I made a few calls to support thinking I had simply forgotten my password. The WLID associated
 with my gamertag at that time was a hotmail account that I had not used in quite some time, so this didn't seem too out of the ordinary. I ended up having to fill out a form and post in a private forum about details of the hotmail account so that I could be
 verified as the owner.<br />
This same night, when my wife logged in to her gamertag, I noticed that my avatar appeared to be online, and playing a game that I did not own. I immediately called phone support back to report the unauthorized access, while I was on the line, my wife discovered
 that there had been two fairly large charges made to my debit card from the xbox. I reported this as well and cancelled the cards that were saved to the account. I also found out that the offender had migrated my gamertag to Brazil.<br />
The next day, I got a response to the forum I had filled out regarding my hotmail account. I was verified as the owner, and was sent a link to reset my password. I did reset my password, changed my secret question, and removed an alternate email address that
 had been added. Using the new password, I recovered the gamertag to my console, and then moved it to a new WLID that I had made that day.<br />
I now have control of the account, but am no longer receiving content for the USA - I have no Netflix, no Inside Xbox, no Video or Music Marketplaces. The channels I do have are presented in Portugese, which I cannot read.<br />
I reported this to phone support, the issue was escalated, and have been in contact with several people who were/are trying to remedy the situation. On June 10th I made a call where I was told that my gamertag was corrupt, and I would just have to make a new
 one. I had a hard time believing this, and also expressed concern regarding DLC I had accumulated on that gamertag. I was transferred to another representative, who re-escalated my issue. I have been told that since then, my account has been locked and is
 being investigated. However, the WLID that is locked is the old hotmail account that is no longer associated with the gamertag. I am still able to log in using the new WLID, and was actually able to sign in to Xbox LIVE on my console this morning, as well
 as post this here now.</p>
<p>My concerns at the moment are:<br />
Is the wrong WLID being investigated? Is this why I'm being told it is corrupt?<br />
My bank has yet to be reimbursed for the disputed charges. Is this being worked on?</p>
<p>I have had a hard time trying to use phone support to get updates. It seems that most times I call, I have to recount the entire situation and it sounds like a new SR is being created. Ideally, I would like to start some correspondence, phone, email, or
 otherwise with someone that I can explain the details to, or get an update on what is being done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where did you have to post in a forum about your WLID? I've never heard of anyone having to do this with a compromised account or missing credentials before. My fear is that this was as phishing tactic to get you to reveal your information to the person(s)
 who compromised your account.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately we aren't set up to handle issue relating to account safety and security here on the forums. I'd advise you to keep in contact with phone support, checking in as often as you need to. I hope they are able to help you sort out your issue.</p>

<p>The second call I made on May 8th to 1-800-4MYXBOX was an attempt to reset my hotmail account password. I was unable to do this online, because I was getting my secret question answer wrong (I believe it was changed by the person that got control of the
 account). The rep on the phone, who I believe was named Maria, said she was opening a forum for me to fill out details on my hotmail account, I was given a PIN number over the phone that would allow me to access it. I then received an email from the address
 "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", that contained a link to that forum. I filled out what was asked of me, and the next day I was sent an email from that same address telling me that they were able to validate my account information and that I would be receiving
 a password reset link in a separate email. That email did arrive, addressed from "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***", and did contain a password reset link - which did reset my hotmail password.</p>
<p>I don't believe this was a phishing attempt - if it was, it was perpetrated by an Xbox LIVE support employee. It also happened after I had already lost control of the account.</p>

<p>That is pretty unsettling. This whole mess has been my first experience with Xbox LIVE support, so I didn't know if that was out of the ordinary or not. If you have the ability to look it up, that interaction did have an SR number associated with it, and
 phone reps I have spoken to since have confirmed that notes were made for that call.</p>

<p>did you fill out the windows live id validation form?</p>
<p>&nbsp;that would be the password reset proccess connected to the windows live help forums</p>
<p>as long as it is a private forum at the windowslivehelp.com which is the windows live team which deals with forgoten passwords and invalid email cases in the worst case
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>incase you cannot reset via an outdated or expired email or the no secret question secret answer</p>
<p>that forums is set up so you can provide further info on incase you do not meet the first requires of validation</p>

<p>Yes, it was a forum at windowslivehelp.com. Glad to know that was legitimate.</p>
<p>I am curious: having just read through the forums last night and today, it seems like unauthorized access followed by MS point purchases followed by region migration is something that is happening to people with some frequency, but I have not once heard
 of a fraudulent migration being successfully reversed. Has anyone had this issue resolved?

<p>There's a few of those "oh my account was stolen/hacked" stories you have to take with a pinch of salt. A lot of them fell for the ol' "I can get you 10th prestige, I just need your log in details" trick and just don't want to admit it.

<p>Yes, I realize that not everyone is very forthcoming in the "I got hacked" type posts.</p>
<p>I know you don't have any reason to believe me, but that is not the case in my situation. My suspicion is that this was the result of having a "weak" password that I didn't bother to change frequently, but I'm not sure.</p>
<p>In any event, it would be a relief to see a post where this had happened to someone, and they actually got their account back to normal. I would also be curious how long that process takes, because it has been quite a while for me.</p>
<p>Anyway, to get back on track to my original question-</p>
<p>Supposedly there is an investigation team looking into my account right now, and have been since at least June 10th. My hotmail account is currently locked as a result of this. Shouldn't the WLID that is associated with my gamertag be the one that gets locked
 and investigated?.</p>

<p>No if the windows live I'd was changed then your gamertag is no longer associated with the gamertag . Only the windows live associated with the gamertag would be locked . Your password would be still changed . Usually when a account is compromised they change
 the windows live ID to make it harder for you to recover</p>

<p>That is what is odd then. This gamertag that I am posting with is the gamertag in question.
</p>
<p>After I successfully used the forum tool I mentioned earlier, I recovered the gamertag to my console myself and then associated it with a new LIVE ID that I had just made that day. Now that the investigation is happening, the LIVE ID that is locked is the
 old hotmail one. Would this explain why I got told my account appears to be corrupt?

    <title>Games disappearing from external hard drives. Happens on three - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Games disappearing from external hard drives.  Happens on three different systems with five different hard drives even when online.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have had a problem with games copied to external hard drives not showing up.&nbsp; The space is taken up on the drive, but the games do not show up when selecting that drive in the selection box.&nbsp; In my household we have three Xbox One consoles.&nbsp; We have a
 VERY slow Internet connection (we live in the country and are extremely fortunate to have a 2.8 mbps DSL connection) so I will often install and update or download a game on one console and then copy it to an external hard drive and then copy it to the other
 consoles.&nbsp; All the hard drives I am using are known good USB 3.0 drives over 300 gigabytes in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The problem is that even when I am logged into my Xbox live account quite often the games do not show up when selecting the hard drive in the list.&nbsp; The space the games take up is shown (for instance, if I have 100 gigs taken up on a 300 gig drive, it shows
 200 gigs free) but the games are not listed.&nbsp; If I can go to my recently played games list and hit menu and Manage Game it will show up as being on the drive sometimes so I can copy it to the console but there is no thumbnail icon showing.&nbsp; I have copied half
 a dozen games to a hard drive and had only one or two show up.&nbsp; It doesn't seem to matter if it is a disc based game or downloaded.&nbsp; Also like I said I am always signed into Xbox Live, so I don't think being offline is a problem.</p>
<p>I'll give an example.&nbsp; I just finished updating a disc based installation of Black Ops III (which took four hours) and copied it to an external hard drive.&nbsp; It says the copy completed and the free space of the drive reduced accordingly, but the game does
 not show up on the drive.&nbsp; I can power the Xbox One down and even unplug the power cord from the console and power it back up again and it still will not show up in the list.</p>
<p>There seems to be no rhyme or reason for this behavior.&nbsp; Like I said I have seen it with three different Xbox One consoles and almost half a dozen external hard drives (I work in IT so I have tons of USB 3.0 drives laying around), so this does not seem to
 be an isolated issue.</p>
<p>Has anyone experienced this and found a workaround for it yet?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm running into the exact same problem tonight. &nbsp;I've had 2 WD Passports connected for ages now, with no issue, but I just bought a 4tb My Book to consolidate them, and a good chunk of my games have now disappeared. &nbsp; It says that the space is full, but
 no games. &nbsp;The Ready to Install list shows titles that I had installed are now apparently uninstalled, and my on disc games are nowhere to be seen. &nbsp;Also, games that I just finished moving are populating that list now.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, &nbsp;no work around, despite having done a hard reboot one I noticed it. &nbsp;At this point, looks like it's a license related issue, as opposed to a hardware related one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that I noticed is that the problem seems to get worse when you go to move the drive to another console. &nbsp;I will say though I have copied games to a drive and seen it disappear from the list right after I have copied it.</p>
<p>The space is taken up on the drive, but the game does not show up on the list.</p>

<p>Man, this is hilarious. &nbsp;I'd like to describe something that just happened regarding this problem.</p>
<p>I copied a game to an external hard drive from the console I downloaded it on to copy it to the other one. &nbsp;Miraculously it was visible when I plugged the drive up to the second console. &nbsp;I highlighted the game, selected Manage Game, then COPY, not move
 to the drive on that Xbox One. &nbsp;After the copy was finished, the game no longer showed up in the browse list of the drive I just copied it from. &nbsp;The free space on that drive stayed the same, but the game was no longer listed.</p>
<p>I then changed the storage device from the external drive to show all of them and the game was in the list. &nbsp;When I highlighted the game and selected Manage game it shows up as being on both hard drives.</p>
<p>Man, I can't believe something this goofy has gone on for so long. &nbsp;Licensing shouldn't have anything to do with it. &nbsp;If you do not have a license for a game, it just shouldn't play. &nbsp;I see that all the time if I forget to put a disc in.
</p>
<p>For example, my son's console has a copy of a game on it that I downloaded from the disc and let update on my console. &nbsp;I copied the completed download to his console and keyed in a download code for the game that mated it to his account. &nbsp;Both games on
 our consoles came from the same installation, but he doesn't have to put the disc in to play it, but I do. &nbsp;If I try to launch it without the disc it just asks me if I own it. &nbsp;I then put the disc in and it plays.</p>
<p>I wonder if anyone at Microsoft is aware of the extent of this problem. &nbsp;If they are I wonder if they are taking it seriously.</p>

            I know this post is old, and I don't know if you ever figured out this issue, but I came across this post because I was having the same problem with my games not showing up when I looked at "contents" of the external hard drive that I had copied all my
 games to.&nbsp; I couldn't see them, and if I tried to copy a game again, i would get a message saying it was already on the drive. I ended up doing a complete shutdown of my xbox, not just a restart, and then booting it back up and then I could see the games.
 I don't know if this will solve the problem for everyone, but it seemed to do the trick for me.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b><span> Unplug the Printer from the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> Uninstall all the Lexmark software/drivers from the computer.</span></p>
<strong><span>Uninstall or change a program</span> </strong>

</span></p>
<p><span>Once all the Lexmark products are uninstalled, restart the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3:</span></b><span><span>&nbsp; </span>Download the latest drivers for the printer from the Lexmark website and install the same.</span></p>
