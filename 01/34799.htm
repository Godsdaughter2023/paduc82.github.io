<h2>            When will the camera work correctly in the Bush A1 Tablet with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>We&nbsp;have&nbsp;an just been given as a present an (Argos) Bush A1 10inch Windows Tablet*.&nbsp; It come with Windows 8 installed and a note in its instruction booklet that it can be upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Win 8 the camera worked OK, but after doing the upgrade to &nbsp;Win 10 is does not.&nbsp; After experimenting I find the following&nbsp;fix.&nbsp; Manually upgrade the drivers from the Computer Management\Imaging\Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400 Properties\Update Driver
 Software\...browse my computer\Let me pick from a list.... panel.&nbsp; (Sorry this 'path' is long but it
<strong>does</strong> get there.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the fix the imaging device is shown as 'Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400'. Click Next and the drivers are installed with an instruction to restart.&nbsp; After this the camera
<strong>works fine</strong> and&nbsp;continues to work OK until the tablet is powered down.&nbsp; On powering up again the 'installed' drivers appear to be inactive as the camera does&nbsp;not work anymore.&nbsp; (It works again OK after applying the above.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the names of the drivers in both the Windows and Window.Old folders (in ..\Drivers\ ).&nbsp; The 6 named drivers appear in both folders.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Help Desk at Bush simply say there are no drivers for the camera in Windows 10 for their A1 Windows Tablet, so 'hard luck', and 'if you want a camera, then revert to Windows 8 before it's too late'!&nbsp; (Not much 'Help' that, and doesn't seem to square
 with finding the quoted drivers in both the&nbsp;Win &amp; Win.Old folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So can anybody help with:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Getting the apparently available drivers 'seen' immediately after a power up without having to do the 're-install and re-start' fix?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Telling me if I can revert to Win 8 and then come back to WIn 10 if I finally decide to live with the above fix?&nbsp; (Does anyone know how many times one can swap between Win 8 and Win 10 like this?&nbsp; I didn't see an option for a dual boot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>BIG thanks in advance for a resolution to&nbsp;this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* The Tablet looks identical to the photographic image on the Argos site of the 'Bush Elma B1 10inch Windows Tablet'.&nbsp; Are these one and the same product?

            <p>Hi Pelcaro,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of your tablet?</p>
<p>2. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to download the drivers from manufacturers website and install in compatibility mode.</p>

            <p>Thanks Ruth for your reply.&nbsp; The make and model are in the posting title: 'Bush'&nbsp; &amp;&nbsp; 'A1 Tablet'&nbsp; (aka 'Bush Elma B1 10inch Windows Tablet' ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been to the Intel site for drivers, but none appear to be listed for the imaging device.&nbsp; They do exist, of course, as the camera worked in Win 8, and can be forced to work in Win 10.&nbsp; I have also tried to convert the drivers in the Win&nbsp;10 drivers
 file using the 'compatibility' tool of MS, but it's difficult to get permission to change these.&nbsp; But I suspect this approach is not that useful since they do work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I have had the same problem with the 8 inch version of the Bush Eluma B1 Tablet. After upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I tried updating the driver for the Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400, and it found an update, AV driver, which I installed. Still no joy. So having used Iolo System mechanic, on my main PC, and it now carries Window 10, I downloaded the free trial, and
 activation key, for the Bush. </p>
<p>Once running, System Mechanic found 10 driver upgrades, when I used the single tools, driver update. Still no camera, but restart, and still no camera, only a message, "Ooups something went wrong". But went back to the Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400,
 roll back driver, and yay, the camera works. restart, and yes still works. System Mechanic runs free for 30 days, then asks for a Licence key to continue.
</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p />

            <p>Thanks Graham for your contribution to this discussion, and sorry to see someone else with the same problem.&nbsp; There have to be others.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was interested in your use of a package to&nbsp;look for a driver.&nbsp; I did not do that but instead searched the Intel site, only to find nothing.&nbsp; I sent a question to Intel about it but silence was the stern reply, and it will most likely stay that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fix using the roll-back drivers as detailed in my first post is OK until there's a power down and power up.&nbsp; Following that there's no camera until the fix is re-applied.&nbsp; Does your fix with System Mechanic work through a power down and power up?&nbsp; If
 so any idea what the driver changes are, if any, and the links to them inside the OS.&nbsp; There has to be something different before and after the fix is applied, and I am almost certain is NOT the drivers themselves.&nbsp; It is maybe&nbsp;a Registry entry change.&nbsp; (
 I haven't done a search for this yet, but probably will at some point. )&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am living with my fix by putting the tablet to sleep instead of turning it off when it's not being used.&nbsp; On waking, the camera is there every time.&nbsp; (BTW, I run a few other PCs permanently and I find using sleep mode and leaving powered up seems never
 to have a deleterious on them.&nbsp; It uses power of course, but not a lot.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the post.&nbsp; Best regards, Pelcaro.</p>

            <p>Sorry to read that RAMASAMYKAMATCHI.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know the 'Next Book' product, but IF the camera did work&nbsp;with Win 8 on the same platform try, on your computer, what I found to work.&nbsp; See my first post, second paragraph:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Manually upgrade the drivers from the Computer Management\Imaging\Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400 Properties\Update Driver Software\...browse my computer\Let me pick from a list.... panel.&nbsp; (Sorry this 'path' is long but it
<strong>does</strong> get there.)&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You will probably have a different camera from mine (&nbsp;Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400 ) and the names of the drivers will also be different, but these names will be evident to you.&nbsp; The&nbsp;method should not change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me this got my camera back OK with Win 10, but it was lost with a power down and power up.&nbsp; So now I get the camera back with the above and only put the computer to sleep, which keeps the camera working.&nbsp; I never power down unless I have to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck - we're on our own with this one I think.&nbsp; Please let the forum know if it does, or not, work for you.&nbsp; Hope that helps.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 is a disaster, security is no good either, revert back to windows 8 and stay there, def more work needed by microsoft, windows 10 works better on pc or laptoo, no good for tablet.</p>

</p><p>Why, ask Microsoft, launched before it was ready in my opinion.</p>

- go to lenovo support site, search drivers for "OV2680" and "GC310" devices, install them on bush tablet - that should fix yor issue. I did that and it's OK now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>I would be very grateful if someone posts content of C:\Windows\inf\TouchSetting.gt (or C:\Windows.old\WINDOWS\inf\TouchSetting.gt) file - I lost it during cleanup and now my touchscreen doesn't work properly.</strong><br />

            <p>Hi Artur,&nbsp; Thx for your post.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I found I had the two drivers you mention, OV... &amp; GC..., in my drivers folder.&nbsp; I was unable to get them known to the camera, which in my case is a 'Intel Imaging Signal Processor 2400'.&nbsp; In fact, worse, in trying various things I managed to crash my Win10
 to the extent it wouldn't run anymore.&nbsp; :-((&nbsp; (&nbsp;It would cycle around a loop saying it had found errors and had to restart, which when doing so, just repeated itself. )&nbsp; I had to re-install Win10, after which I'd lost all my apps,&nbsp;not data,&nbsp;but still had a
 camera problem.&nbsp; As before this is still only partly solved as described one of my earlier posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re TouchSetting.gt,&nbsp; I searched two of my touch screen computers for this, but it was not found in either.&nbsp; Sorry.&nbsp; Maybe your pb is due to something else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pelcaro.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I just returned 8" version to the store and replaced with 10" one - with detachable keyboard. :)</p>
<p>I'm not going to update it to Windows 10 before making copy of hidden restore partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re OV &amp; GC - after update to windows 10, which is quite unusual - they were not as imaging devices- I found them in system devices group instead. After I installed lenovo drivers both cameras came back to life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used that ones:</p>

            <p>Mann,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did get error codes 80246007 and 80073aa2 at different times</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the other updates released in October did install correctly</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try updating manually and got the same results and error codes</p>
<p>
</p><p>All 11 PCs are in a work group</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did run the System Update Readiness tool - it ended with error code 80070005</p>

            <p>PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I will not be on site for some time since my ankle is currently in a large cast so I will try to answer the questions as best I can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. All 11 Dell OptiPlex 330 PCs were purchased in early January 2014 from a refurbisher. They came naked, no software installed on the hard drive. I formatted each hard drive, ran a number of diagnostic tests including the Dell H/W diagnostic and then installed
 MS Windows 7 64 bit and MSO 2010 64 Bit individually on each PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I installed MSE on each PC, there were no prior antivirus/malware software packages installed. I also installed Malwarebytes free edition on each PC. I update MSE and MWB every week with the current signatures and run a full scan. The PCs all run the
 MSE short scan every evening. I also make sure that all installed software is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. No version of Norton has ever been installed on any of these PCs. The users do not have Admin access to the PCs and the Admin account is limited to 4 people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Not sure</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I do not believe Java is installed on this PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Adobe Flash Player is installed, version is current as of a week ago</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. IE 11, 64 bit, current, Firefox is installed, current version</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Users do not run any "system software" basically just Access and IE 11. I run Glary Utilities every week. I also ran the CCleaner Registry cleaner on this PC when the install problems started.</p>
<p>I also use Glary to identify software that needs to be updated, not perfect but it catches most of the updates including Firefox and Flash Player.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear about your ankle but we'll need to know about those updates in #5, the info requested in #8b plus...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. Is <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/33.1.1/releasenotes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Firefox v33.1.1</a> (14 Nov-14) or higher installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Is Firefox or Internet Explorer the system's default Browser?</p>
<ul>
<li>If all browser windows are closed &amp; you click on a link on the desktop, the link will open in the system's default Browser.</li></ul>
<p>2. Do you have backups of ALL the changes Glary Utilities and CCleaner's Registry Cleaner have EVER made to the computer? [1]</p>
<p>

    <title>The boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikethefox  say:</h3>
<h2>            The boot configuration data for your PC is missing or contains errors&#34; File&#58; &#92;EFI&#92;Microsoft&#92;Boot&#92;BCD Error code&#58; 0xc000000f&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I dual booted my windows 10 on an Asus n550jx laptop with ubuntu 16.04 LTS and everything worked fine until I decided to remove my ubuntu. I created a usb recovery drive in windows which eventually got 8 Gbytes of space in my usb. I booted from it and it
 was working. Then I deleted ubuntu related partitions using disk manager in windows and extended one of windows partitions with the left free space. Then I restarted and the grub rescue page showed up. Trying to fix my windows boot, I booted from usb and went
 to command prompt and tryed /fixmbr, /fixboot and /rebuildbcd, which only the first one was done successfully. The second one got me an "Access was denied" and the third one told me that there wasn't any disks. And of course I was still stuck in grub rescue.
 I then followed an instruction and did all below in cmd:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>list disk</strong>: all hard drives in your computer will be displayed.</li><li><strong>select disk n</strong>: n means the disk where Windows 10 is installed. Here I choose disk 0.</li><li><strong>list volume</strong>: all volumes on disk 0 is listed.</li><li><strong>select volume n</strong>: n refers to the number of system partition.</li><li><strong>active</strong>: it can mark the correct system partition active.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>And they were all successful. But when I exited and restarted, I was still in grub rescue, BUT I was no longer able to boot from usb. It was still there but when I booted it I got this blue RECOVERY page telling that&nbsp;&nbsp;The boot configuration data for your
 PC is missing or contains errors" File: \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD Error code: 0xc000000f". So I guess my recovery drive is crashed now, too! I can't see any BCD files in my usb. I tryed to boot from it in another computer and it showed the same message. What
 should I do now? I have super important stuff on my windows and don't want to reinstall it. Is there any way I can make another recovery drive while I can't access my windows?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for this very long question. I wanted to let you know all the things I did for you to better understand my issue.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance.</p>

                    I have&nbsp;two different&nbsp;programs giving me the same error message. Strange thing is, they were all working fine a week ago. I tried re-installing the programs, but that didn't fix it.&nbsp;I ran a search on my hard drive for the file, and came up with 4 results,
 all in different folders, and two of the files were in all uppercase letters. The specific programs this is happening to (that I know of) are : StarForge (a custom map editor for the popular game StarCraft similar to the stock StarEdit program)&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp; Yugioh

            <p>I have had the same message when trying to use the Gutwrench Suite from Sourceforge. I have tried all the suggested solutions but none worked. Today I solved the problem. I had upgraded my computer to Windows 7. All I had to do was right click on the exe
 file, click on compatability and change it to windows 7. Now the suite of programs work.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>Hi Jess,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for being so long coming back to you.</p>
<p>Did a stop and start under services same problem</p>
<p>Tried rolling back to a previous driver but the option was greyed out.&nbsp; Maybe I needed to have run the task as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have also been onto Lenovo and tried their suggestions their suggestions which included.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Update the BIOS driver</p>
<p>2) Update the Chipset driver</p>
<p>3) Update the mouse, pen and keyboard driver</p>
<p>4) Then reboot and load and save the BIOS default settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>last being to sign up to the Insider program and bring down the latest Win 10 version.&nbsp; Not something Iam going to do for a 10 year olds school laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disappointing as this worked fine from new, unless there is a "hardware issue" the only thing I can think of is to do a restore to factory default and save the current personal data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other thoughts</p>
<p>

    <title>Unable to right-click on start menu items in Windows 10 after April - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> belliotti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to right-click on start menu items in Windows 10 after April update.</h2>
                    <p>Hello! </p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that after downloading the April 2018 update, I am now unable to right click items in the Windows start menu. For example, if I search any application in the start menu search box and try to right-click on it, the right-click menu appears for
 a split second and then instantly disappears. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I might also add that in the task manager there is a green leaf next to the Windows Shell Experience Host process, indicating that the process is suspended. I don't know why this is. It may have something to do with my problem, but I'm not exactly sure.
 If someone could tell me how to enable it that would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that I have disabled Cortana in the registry, as I have never needed it, but that has never caused any issues in the past. If that is the culprit, I'll try enabling it to see if it fixes things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the System File Checker, but it did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any advice, solutions, help, etc., I'd be glad to hear it. It could just be a simple bug that'll be fixed in an update, but I'd like to try and fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Another issue I've noticed since updating is that when I'm in the settings interface, the scroll bar will move rapidly, repeatedly-shifting the page up and down. I don't know why this is happening, but I suspect it's a bug from the update, as I did
 a full reset on my PC and this issue, as well as the start menu issue, still persist. Both issues were not present before updating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Both problems were fixed when I woke up this morning and went to my desktop from sleep mode!</p>

            Hi Bellotti,
<br />
<br />I'm here to help, a lot of people are starting to have this issue this update. Have you tried this solution here?: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3f2ren/cant_use_start_menu_or_right_click_taskbar_icons/ctkwo5x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/3f2...</a>
<br />
<br />To save a click, here's the solution (copied here):
<br />
<br />Launch the Registry Editor (hit the Windows key and R, type regedit, and then press Enter) and then navigate to the following key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ ImmersiveShell\Launcher
<br />
<br />Click Edit &gt; New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value, and name it UseExperience. Double-click the newly created item and set the value to 0. Click OK, close the Registry Editor and then restart your computer -- or just restart Explorer. (If you can still right-click on your start button, you can use Task Manager to restart Explorer.)
<br />
<br />Redditors also recommend you refer to this solution here: <a href="https://www.techmesto.com/fix-start-menu-broken-windows-10-technical-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techmesto.com/fix-start-menu-broken...</a>
<br />
<br />Right-click the Start button, click on Windows PowerShell (Admin), and copy and paste the following into the console: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />After all is said and done, just reboot it, and see if it would make a difference.
<br />
<br />I realize this is a lot to follow, but hopefully one of these solutions could help you here. Do let me know if this solves it or if you need further assistance. Good luck.

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There are ALWAYS unintended consequences with disabling or removing any feature or component that doesn't have an Uninstall button in Apps &amp; Features.  Example:  Search comes with Cortana, and goes with Cortana.  
<br />
<br />You can run the Start Menu troubleshooter:  <a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-fix-the-windows-10-start-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cnet.com/how-to/how-to-fix-the-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If these fail I'd try a System Restore point back to before you edited the registry and see if that's sufficient.  If not run Verison 1803 from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates as a Repair install and try it without  the killer mods.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Alright I tried doing everything you guys listed but none of it seemed to work, so I just decided to do a full system reset to be safe. I backed up my important files on a USB and did a complete reset, removing everything. However, after resetting my PC
 and going to the desktop, the issue still persists. I have downloaded all available updates. Surely this has to be a small bug with the update? I feel like a full system reset would've fixed it otherwise. Thanks for the help though!

            You might want to go back to the old version if it works better.  After a Reset though I doubt if the Go Back will still be there, so you'd need to Clean Install using the old media available here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>.  Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>
<br />
<br />But if you're going to CLean Install I'd try the new version first because what we find is that wiping the drive to Clean install will often overcome most problems.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />or
<br />
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows

    <title>Converting Windows 10 Pro KMS to retail version - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pvsdnettech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Converting Windows 10 Pro KMS to retail version</h2>
                    <p>I recently had to to a clean install on a Windows 10 PC that got hosed during an automatic update. Apparently I grabbed one of my KMS install discs from work and proceeded to set the whole system up. I have a retail activation key for the Windows 10 Pro
 but when I try to activate I am getting the error that the KMS server cannot be reached. So now I am stuck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to convert the KMS install to retail so I can enter the correct activation key? Can I run an upgrade of the correct Windows install disc over it? I'm at a loss and I really don't want to do this whole thing all over again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Is the ata/atapi bridge compatible with Windows 7?</p>
<p><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Does your externally connected USB hard disk show up under Disk management?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow few troubleshooting steps to fix the issue on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Try plugging in the USB hard drive on to any other USB ports on your computer and check if that fixes the issue on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>When you plug-in your USB hard drive it all appears to be working ok, but you can’t find it, this is a common issue with computers that have many drive letters in use, and the USB drive tries
 to use the same drive letter which is already assigned to another device and it can be seen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To fix this, right click on Computer select Manage, choose Disk Management, now you can see your USB hard drive, right click and select, Change Drive Letter and Paths, now change the drive letter
 for one that’s not in use, Z is usually a safe choice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter</a></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>You can also try to connect the external hard drive on some other computer running Windows 7 and check if the same issue persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide us with additional information. So that we can help you fix the problem on your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps you.</p>

<h2>            Surface Laptop touch screen - dead area</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought the Surface Laptop (i5, 8gb, 256gb) and have noticed the touch screen does not work in the periphery of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Touches are registering near the centre but for e.g. I cannot touch the Start icon or Action Centre icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this may be a calibration issue but it is not letting me calibrate the periphery of the screen or reset the calibration (it is factory default).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In "About my PC" section of Settings, it says "Pen and Touch support for 10 points". Does that have something to do with it? I assume the whole screen should be touchable...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any help?!</p>

<p>
</p><p>But no:&nbsp; if the screen isn't detecting in some areas, it's likely a broken or defective unit from the factory and needs services.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with Windows Search. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if there is existence of software conflicts on Windows 10. Try the following troubleshooting procedures and check if it resolves the issue.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Run the Search and Indexing troubleshooter</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter to check and fix issues with Windows Search how:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Open <strong>Control Panel </strong>by right click on <strong>
Start</strong> Button.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> In the search box, type <strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click
<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Click on the <strong>view all </strong>option on the left panel.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Run the <strong>Search and Indexing </strong>troubleshooter.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: Enable Safe Mode with Networking </p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Safe Mode with Networking</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>. Safe mode with Networking starts Windows in safe mode and includes the network drivers, services needed to access the Internet or other computers on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer below link to Enable Safe Mode with Networking.</p>
</span>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Start
 your PC in safe mode in Windows 10 </span></span></span></strong></a></p>
<span>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Please restart the computer to start in normal mode.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Perform Clean Boot</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a <strong>Clean Boot
</strong>to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.
</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><span>To do this, refer below article on how to perform a Clean Boot in Windows.<br />
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></strong></a></span></p>
<span>
<p>

            Don't use the Gallery. Open File Explorer, Pictures Library and find the photos you want and drag them to the flash drive. It will copy to the drive. If you want to move files to the drive, right click and drag and a menu will pop up to select Copy or
 Move.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Earl,<br />
<br />
That sounds interesting. There could be a few possible reasons why you are encountering this problem. The issues you presented have something in common, the need to connect to the internet. These may be corrected by diagnosing the internet connectivity.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to better understand the causes, we would like to know:<br />
<br />
1. Are you getting error messages when you try to download updates or activate Windows?<br />
2. Are you able to connect to the internet; go to websites using a browser?<br />
<br />
Do get back to us with your thoughts on this matter. </p>

            Hi Owolabi. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br /> 
<br />
<br /> First try the methods here to Manage Updates after Version 1803:  
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-update-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/manage-windows-up...</a>
<br />
<br /> You can block Windows Updates by setting a Metered Connection, see here:  
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-...</a>
<br />
<br />More prominent tech columnists and experts are recommending to do this:
<br /><a href="https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/microsoft-windows/its-time-make-sure-windows-auto-update-is-turned-off.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerworld.com/article/3241241/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then you can install them when you want.  There are even good reports from users now who've had them shut off for awhile and only install the Version Upgrades twice a year from the Media Creation Tool which is the most stable method anyway, and includes all previous Updates rolled in. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to express your opinion on this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it.  I will vote up the feedback with my MVP badge and also monitor and track the issue for you.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hello Owolabi,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />The pause updates feature is currently available on Insider Preview builds only. You can get the option in Windows 10 Insider Preview build 18282 or later. For stable versions, it may be available on Windows 10 V1903 or later. 
<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Windows not Genuine" pop-up occurred after I received notification to upgrade to Windows 10. It reported my Windows 7 (Home Premium) was not activated and would not perform the upgrade. The reason for my original question was that one of the Microsoft
 support sites where I was routed after this error message stated one recovery method was to "uninstall then reinstall" update KB971033.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After several retries and a couple of reboots, the Windows 10 upgrade finally downloaded and installed last night. The new Windows 10 OS still was not activated, but at least it gave me the opportunity to manually activate it by entering the Product Key
 from my original Windows 7 installation DVD. Within one minute, it activated on-line and now everything seems to be happy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. Have you ever run the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?</p>
<p>

<li>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling (or upgrading) cleanly. The "leftovers" may be a continuing source of trouble for you (e.g., when the next cumulative update for Win10 is released).</li></ul>

<li>Injudicious use of registry cleaners may be playing a role here, too. TIP: If you ever again think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, maximized, "swept" or optimised (it doesn't),

            <p>1) Yes - I ran the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool years ago (when I uninstalled McAfee after the trial period).</p>
<p>2) I intentionally installed Microsoft Security Essentials as my anti-virus utility.</p>
<p>3) That is correct - MSE was still installed when the upgrade to Win10 was started.</p>
<p>4) Both Google Chrome and Firefox are upgraded to the latest versions.</p>
<p>5) Yes - the Registry was backed up each time before it was edited.</p>

<p>The title of &amp; first&nbsp;few posts in&nbsp;this thread is somewhat misleading since you've somehow managed to get "Win10 1511" &amp; KB3120677 installed. That being said...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you encounter any further problems (e.g., updates failing to install; "Windows is not Genuine" prompts), see if restoring ALL System Mechanic backups, followed by a reboot, resolves the problem.</p>

</p><p>As I understand Webcam on the computer is not working properly. It works sometimes and othertimes it gives a black screen. I appreciate your efforts in trying to fix the issue. The issue could occur due to missing updates or software issues or corrupted

<p>
</p><p>The model of my computer is <strong>Samsung 350V5C-S0G</strong>. As far as the changes on this computer is concerned, I think that
<strong>sometimes</strong> there's some configuration that is happening whenever I shut down my computer as this computer insists so. I am using the camera app in windows 8.</p>

            <p><span>Hi <b>Arpan</b>,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on what you have mentioned, it appears that you are unable to access certain apps on Windows 8 computer and you receive an error message saying you are not connected to network.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand it must be frustrating, but rest assured, we are here to help you and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Try these methods.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Modern App troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to download and run the Modern app troubleshooter to check if the issue is caused due to some incorrect app settings. Here is the link to download the Modern app troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above step didn’t help, then I would suggest you to try the troubleshooting steps mentioned in this link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Do not use Proxy or HTTPS-Proxy. They're not supported for windows 8 metro apps, and sometimes can make them unable to use it until you refresh your windows.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3</span></b></p>
<p><span>Disable Proxy Settings</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using any Proxy connection, then try disabling the proxy connection and check.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Disable proxy server on Internet Explorer (IE)</span></p>
<p><span>b) Press the ‘<b>Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>c) In the ‘<b>Run’</b> type <b>inetcpl.cpl</b> and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click Connections tab, click <b>LAN settings</b> button.</span></p>
<p><span>e) Uncheck "<b>Use a proxy server for your LAN</b>" under proxy server.</span></p>
<p><span>f) Click ok to apply the changes</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Disable Antivirus</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If you have installed any third party security software like antivirus or firewall, I would suggest you disable them temporarily and check if the apps work.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues on Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

<h2>            Devices and Printers won&#39;t work. Can&#39;t print from any program.</h2>
                    Devices and Printers have stopped working. I can't print to any device or pdf printer from any program. I can't update any printers. The printer troubleshooter looks like it's doing something, but nothing happens and when you check the task manager it
 is not responding.&nbsp; It worked fine after the Windows 10 upgrade, but then stopped.&nbsp; I'm not sure if an update ran in the interim. I'd love some help.&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>Hi Samantha,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. How are you trying to update the printer; from device manager or from manufacturer site?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you uninstall the drivers from <strong>Device Manager.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows Key + X</li><li>Select Device Manager</li><li>Right&nbsp;click on&nbsp;Printer and Scanners and follow the on screen instruction.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Install latest available printer driver from manufacturer's website and install. If no Windows 10 drivers available suggest him to install in
<strong>compatibility mode. </strong></p>
<p>Follow the steps below on how to install driver in compatibility mode:<br />
1. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
2. Right click on the setup file of the driver and select “Properties”.<br />
3. Select “Compatibility” Tab. <br />
4. Place a check mark next to “Run this program in Compatibility mode” and select operating system from the drop down list.<br />
5. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.<br />
</p>

    <title>Yellow discoloration of my Surface Book screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wolefajemisin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Yellow discoloration of my Surface Book screen</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This is quite upsetting. My surface book is hardly 5 months old. My surface book froze towards the end of work and I had hoped that it would, given time, sort itself out. I put the laptop in my bag and home. On getting home I found that my laptop was over
 heating and yellow discolorations had appeared around the edges of the screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot understand why the screen will suddenly get this yellow but it seems as if the screen burnt out due to the heat. The discoloration improved with time but worse points persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am in Nigeria. What should&nbsp;I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is most disheartening. I thought this was the same quality as a MacBook that I had been using for years</p>
