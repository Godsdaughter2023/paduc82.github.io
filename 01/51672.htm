<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Lock Screen doesn&#39;t show app status</h2>
                    <p>I would like for things like the weather and Xbox Apps to appear on my lock screen, however they fail to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background is OK, it shows the time, and it shows Windows Spotlight elements (like the "Like What You See?"), but it doesn't show elements about the Weather or other apps I'd like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro, updated to the anniversary update on 8/5. &nbsp; I've Google'd a lot of suggestions, but I"m not sure how to overcome it. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp; That's plenty to support a good swap file. I suggest you set that to let Windows manage the size, particular if you're not sure how to otherwise best adjust it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; With an adequate swap file that error is uncommon. It may indicate a problem program eating up excessive RAM or a malware issue.&nbsp; I suggest you first look at the processes Tab in Task Manager. Sort on the memory column.&nbsp; What are the top few items?</p>
<p>&nbsp; Also, check your computer for malware.&nbsp; In addition to your antivirus program I suggest you run these good free programs.</p>

<h2>            password not accepted on 2nd device</h2>
                    I use skype on my Samsung tablet. I wanted to try using it on my laptop but after loading/accessing it a couple different ways [it isnt clear what is the difference between all the different versions] it wouldnt accept my password. So, I went through the
 painful process of changing pw. Now my tablet skype wont accept the new password. I was able to access skype in the past on my Samsung phone [s7], but it screwed my phone up something awful and crashed it multiple times, so I removed it. Pls advise what mountain
 I have to climb or ocean swim to get this working

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi Mitul,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community and we are glad to assist you on this issue.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As per the query description, it looks like you get a blue screen error message prompting “unexpected kernel mode error” when you browse on Internet Explorer.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to gather few information on this query to help you better:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is the Make and Model of the computer?<br />
2) Is the computer connected to a domain?<br />
3) Is this issue specific while using Internet Explorer?<br />
4) Do you receive any error code along with the error message?<br />
5) Are you using any third party software on the computer?</p>
<p>6)&nbsp;Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you get this blue screen error message and the computer restarts automatically, a hardware device, its driver, or related software could have caused this error. You may also get this error due to
</p>
<p>some other application on the computer or due to any issues with memory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to check the details:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/windows/hardware/ff559244(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-in/library/windows/hardware/ff559244(v=vs.85).aspx</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, let's check if any other application is leading to this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the methods:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s check if you get the same issue when you boot the computer into safe mode with networking.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link to do so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode</strong>)”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Check if you get the same issue when you browse on Internet Explorer. If it does not, then move to step 2.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue does not occur in safe mode with networking, it could be some other application causing this issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would suggest you to boot the computer into clean boot state and check for the application or program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can refer to the link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong>”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</strong> of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to install the drivers using Windows update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can follow the steps: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Type Windows update and click on Settings from the charms bar.</p>
<p><span>b) Click on Install Optional updates.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click on Check for updates.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click the link that tells you optional updates are available.</span></p>
<p><span>e)&nbsp;Select the driver that you require to install and then click <span>OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f)&nbsp;Click <span>Install updates.</span></span></span></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to run safety scanner and check if there are infected files leading to this issue. You can use Microsoft Safety scanner to do so.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.<br />

    <title>Unable to erase or format disk - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to erase or format disk</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have had problems with this PC ever since I built it months ago. It is my first Windows PC so I'm still new to Windows and find it difficult to do the simplest things. One of the problems I have is with erasing and formatting a disk. I at first tried
 right clicking and hitting format or quick format but have run into many problems this way so have started going into the disk manager and trying to do things there.</p>
<p>&nbsp; At the moment I have just run Memtest86 trying to find out why my PC wont work with my memory and I ran it off a 8GB USB stick. I now need to use the memory stick for something else so I tried formatting and got it back empty/formatted and 48MB in size.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I look in disk management and there is one partition blue that says NEW VOLUME (D) 49MB healthy (Primary Partition). The second is blue and says 99MB Healthy (EFI System Partition). the last one is black and says 7.07GB Unallocated. The last I have tried
 right clicking but all options are greyed out. I have tried highlighting in the list above but I can do no more from there.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Please help me get my disk back and if anyone knows why it disappeared so I can avoid it next time you would save me a great deal of time and anxiety.</p>

            <p>Kingstone, there's nothing wrong with the stick I don't think. I took the Memory stick in the end and put it in a Mac and it worked fine so I erased it and formatted it for Windows and now I can use it again on this Windows PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp; No one has any idea why the Windows PC cant format it's own drive? Why the Unallocated space in black in Disk Management? It's not the Memory stick that bothers me I can through that away and buy another if it could not be fixed it's not having a clue
 what is going on with the PC. </p>
<p>&nbsp; Next time I'll be in the same situation and if it's a drive I wont be able to plug it into my Mac to fix the situation.</p>

<h2>            all exe&#39;s run the same application -- all desktop short cuts look the same</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I developed and app ss.exe and used NSIS installer which I have for many years. I also tried the&nbsp;</p>
<p>C# VS2015 Publish wizard somewhere after those two. I noticed my desktop app had the same</p>
<p>ss.exe icon. If i run cmd.exe i get ss.exe if i run regedit i get ss.exe no matter what exe i try to run</p>
<p>almost all are my app!!! File Explorer runs OK MS Edge browser runs OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This only happens in one account the admin account, where I run the above two installers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is on a windows 10 64 bit machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to remove all the ss.exe file and yet their is one left I guess that keep running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no ide what wrong!! If I had two admin account I'd delete the broken one, since the&nbsp;</p>
<p>other user (non admin) works OK.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have determined it was VS2015 &nbsp;the CLickOnce app that screwed things up&nbsp;</p>
<p>and I have deleted the &nbsp;/users/myname/AppData/Local/Apps/2.0/wxyz/jiggerish/manifest</p>
<p>
</p><p>All apps I try to start including task manager say&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can Not Start Application</p>
<p>Can not download application. the application is missing required files. </p>

<p>Hello Ed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you may have mistakenly associated that app to open .exe and/or shortcuts (.lnk) files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you like, you might see if downloading and merging the .reg files for <strong>
exe</strong> and <strong>lnk</strong> in the table of Option Two in the tutorial below may help. It will restore their default associations.</p>

            Hi Edmarch, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />It sounds like something's gone wrong in your Windows installation folder. You can try fixing this by running the System File Checker:
<br />
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work, you might want to restore to a system restore point before the issue occurred. Here are instructions:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise, resetting your PC might be the only other option. You can do this by typing "Reset" into Start and clicking Reset This PC. You can choose to keep your files or remove your files. It'll reinstall Windows and all your apps will need to be reinstalled by you.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!       
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>To add to Debleena's fine advice :<br />
<br />
Be sure to check with the game maker's support and their forums for possible solutions.<br />
<br />
Check with your system maker's support and their forums (if any) as there may be BIOS or low level<br />
chipset driver updates and/or known issues with resolutions.<br />
<br />
Also check with Nvidia Support and their forums for known issues and watch closely for driver updates.<br />
<br />
Nvidia - Drivers - Use OPTION 1&nbsp;to manually enter your driver info to&nbsp;get most current drivers.&nbsp;<br />

<h2>            To whomever at MS decided to kill the Briefcase .... well ... has anybody anywhere</h2>
                    <p>been smart enough to come up with an exact replica of the Briefcase? Am very angry right now at having lost some content tonight that I wouldn't have lost had not smug designers/programmers not killed the Briefcase. Somebody somewhere has to be able to replicate
 it. To be honest, I'd pay for it. It was perfect, except it wasn't complex enough apparently for people in charge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I use FreeFileSync, which isn't the same as not needing a connection. And there was a hiccup with the laptop, flash drive, and a file that didn't take and I've lost and can't find, and am really mad. Windows 10 in general - it flat killed one computer of
 mine - has not been a positive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have been extremely frustrated for a few years now about the Briefcase, and if I had the skills, I'd build a Briefcase for free and give it a certain name that, well, never mind. MS would be stunned at how many people used it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'd be happy with a Briefcase that had ads or something, anything. Allegedly smart people don't get why the Briefcase was efficient. Noooo, the Cloud, etc. isn't the same thing.</p>

<h2>            Child account</h2>
                    Hi, hoping you can help me with an issue I’m having. When I set up my Xbox One, I set my son as the main account holder. Now I want to add parental controls but to do so, I seem to need to add my son as a family member. Since he’s the main account holder,
 I don’t know how to do that without him losing all his achievements/data. Can anyone help? Many thanks.&nbsp;

<p>I'm assuming the account is an adult account so you will need to log into his account on xbox.com to change the settings there. Some will not be available since it's an adult account (like screen time limits) but you can restrict the account from communicating
 with others that aren't friends in the Privacy settings part of the website here:
<a href="https://account.xbox.com/Settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.xbox.com/Settings</a> But your son can change these settings back if he knows how to do it, since he knows the password to the account, unless you change that and keep
 it to yourself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no way to move content and progress to a new account that you can have total control over. Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can add a passkey on the console to block certain things as well, but this can be removed by entering the password for the account after you enter the same wrong combination 3 times:
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/create-xbox-one-passkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/create-xbox-one-passkey</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the account is a child account you can remove it from the family its in as seen here:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027707/microsoft-account-remove-members-from-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027707/microsoft-account-remove-members-from-family</a> (If it's not in a family group you don't need to do this step)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then add it to another family, as your account as the main account, here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12417/microsoft-account-add-members-to-family" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12417/microsoft-account-add-members-to-family</a> And after you add your son's account to your family you can set every kind of parental control if the account is a child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>----------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need help doing this you can contact xbox support in a live chat here: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            mircosoft legal agreement stuck on my screen</h2>
                    <p>Last night my computer says running microsoft update; I have my computer setup to run updates at night while I'm sleeping. I get up and on my screen is "Microsoft Legal Agreement" with a bunch of legal information and way at the bottom "accept your new windows
 10" or Decline. I hit decline and the screen goes right back to "microsoft legal agreement" accept new windows 10 or delince. I've hit decline 15 times and the screen goes right back to "microsoft legal agreement" I reset my computer twice it reboots fine
 and right after starting up it goes right to "MICROSOFT LEGAL AGREEMENT" I can not use my computer. I call microsoft help desk and was told for a one time fee of $99 they can fix my computer.&nbsp; FIRST OFF MY COMPUTER IS NOT BROKEN, it was working fine last night.
 Micro soft ran an update loading windows 10 onto my computer and now I can't use the computer unless I accept windows 10. It not broken mcirosoft legal agreement in the way. Still I was told the only way to get rid of the Microsoft legal aggreement is to pay
 $99 to micrsoft help desk. That is a SCAM, microsoft puts something on my computer where I can't use it and I have to pay $99 to remove the microsoft leagl agreement" I always defend window operating system to friend not anymore rather then give them $99 I'll
 go buy me a new APPLE COMPUTER!!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand that you would want to stop getting notification about Windows 10 and I appreciate the effort made towards the fixes you have tried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I do understand that you being a novice, following steps may seems difficult. However, following so, will help you not getting the notification. Let's start from beginning if the update (KB) still shows in updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><strong>Uninstall the Windows </strong>
<strong><span>Update as follow</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/remove-update#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Remove the Windows update</span></a>
</span><span><span>KB 3035583</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: R</strong><span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><span><strong>ename the GWXUXWorker.exe</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Terminate the <strong><span>GWX.exe</span></strong> process using Task Manager. Moreover rename the
<strong>GWXUXWorker.exe</strong> and <strong>GWX.exe</strong> to .old as suffix from directory location:-
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Windows\System32\GWX<span>, if getting any issues while renaming then give the system permission's to respective files and then try to rename it again. OR you can delete the entire directory folder.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persists, follow method 3.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:&nbsp;</strong><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Registry key to stop the notification
</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> on your keyboard to open the run dialog box.</p>
</li><li>

dword:00000001.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click <strong>OK.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Exit <strong>Registry Editor.</strong></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> <em>This method contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft

<p>any news on when this can be fixed? I for one, believe Halo 4 is DOA. &nbsp;Perhaps set up a sticky for all buyers so they don't need to waste hours and hours on useless fixes, reinstatements, usb, clearing caches and rewatching the intro again and again, till
 your head hurts. Will save a lot of frustration. Perhaps set up a sticker on the game in the stores as well. Warning - this game does not work on many consoles as it was not beta tested. Multiplayer is a mess.</p>

<p>yeah sorry guys but Hassassinade is rite. what your experiencing is a bug/glitch in the Halo 4 game and can only be fixed with a tiitle update. 343i is aware of these issues and is working on a fix.

<p>Unless, of course, the disk itself just got scratched since the last time you played that level. If the disk got scratched right where the data for that map is, you will fail to load content.
</p>
<p>Yes, there are numerous known glitches with Halo 4. They were nuts for not having a fully open public beta.
</p>
<p>But any time you are loading from an optical media disk and it says you are failing to load content you need to check to see if the disk is scratched or dirty.
</p>
<p>Of ten times if you switch disks while eating a snack you'll get a smudge on the data area of the disk that will cause this issue and it can be remedied by cleaning the disk surface.

<p>I don't know if the "missing content" glitch is because of a scratch or it is just 343i's fault. Many people, including a forum on 343's website said there was an ongoing issue of loading because of a title update as of late, yet there seems to be a tiny
 scratch on the surface, and it appears to have been caused by my Xbox 360 (the curve of the scratch follows the curve of the disk perfectly), if so, I think this is ridiculous, as the amount of games I have that all have tiny scratchs is enormous. Could someone
 please get back to me about this - although it is only one mission, I fell that the disk not fully operating just after a month and a half of purchasing is ridiculous.</p>

If not, please do give that a try. That way they have more information to investigate the issue with. Thanks for your patience! &nbsp;</p>

Is there anything I'm doing wrong? Please help.<br />

            There are a few things to try as you seem to be having system errors. <br />
<br />
First, I would see if any system files are corrupt. <br />
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: <strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system.<br />
<br />
If you have questions about SFC, review the KB article below.</span></p>

            I ran the scan, and it seemed to have closed when it was complete, so I assume it had no issues. I then proceeded to restart the system. Help and Support still seems to not exist.

    <title>2m boot lag after &#34;Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bc.crandall  say:</h3>
<h2>            2m boot lag after &#34;Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller is disconnected from network.&#34;</h2>
                    <br />
Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm a happy user of Windows 7 Enterprise 64 bit, running on <br />
an AMD Phenom II X4 965 3.4 GHz, with 8 GB ram,on a <br />
Gigabyte GA-790FXTA-UD5 motherboard. <br />
<br />
Happy that is until this last week, when boot time, which<br />
had been quite snappy, started to take an extra two minutes<br />
--exactly.<br />
<br />
System log from recent boot, all events before and after<br />
RTL8167 Warning, are normal:<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />

[system start]<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------<br />
<br />
The warning message (source: RTL8167):<br />
"Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller is disconnected from network."<br />
<br />
Before the 2m lag, the familiar swirling MS logo presents itself,<br />
then a black screen for the two minutes, then the log-in prompt.<br />
<br />
Device Manager:<br />
Once up and running, Device Manager reports "Device status" for<br />
both network adapters, "Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller", as:<br />
"This device is working properly." (PCI bus 4 and 5 respectively).<br />
<br />
Device Manager also reports "Driver software is up to date."<br />
<br />
And, once up and running, the network is fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Examining the system log, it seems the warning occurred on most<br />
and perhaps every boot cycle. But the 2m lag is new, this week. <br />
<br />
Any ideas? <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

                    <p>Hi All</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had my Xbox One X repaired last September 2018, Project Scorpio, and the passed few months again it is sounding like a Jet Engine taxi to the runway.</p>
<p>Has anyone had this issues after it has already been repaired for the same fault?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am worried as this is now out of Warranty but has been sent off to Xbox for repair once...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>

<p>Are you currently using a external hard drive on your Xbox one X?</p>
<p>If so try running your console with out it plugged in.</p>
<p>Again, make sure you have adequate ventilation around your console, it sounds like its overheating, hence fan kicking into overtime</p>

            Are you talking about when the Xbox console is idle or when playing a game? I believe the fan noise is normal compared to some heavy games like RDR2.

            <p>I suggest you get away from the Windows backup program and get yourself a good commercial backup program. This forum is frought with problem reports for the Windows one. I know I was very unimpressed when I tried it. Two I'm familiar with and like are Norton
 Ghost (which I've been using for 7 years without the 1st problem), and Memeo which has a 30 day free trial and you can buy it for $29.99 - you can download it from http://memeo.com . You can get Ghost for next to nothing (like I did) if you watch the sales.
</p>
<p>CNET has a lot of backup program reviews at </p>
<p>http://download.cnet.com/windows/backup-software/?tag=contentBody;sideBar</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Some of these are free (last time I checked there were over 300), some have free trials (over 1000), and some are purchase only (over 200).</p>
<p>Good luck</p>

            <p>The D drive should have nothing added. It is sized to hold the recovery data and have enough free space such that Windows dowsn't flash up low deive space warnings.&nbsp; Remove anything that you may have added to D.</p>
<p>The 500GB&nbsp;external drive is best to use. Format and partiton before use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what do you want to back up? The entire system or just data like documents, photos, music and email? Whichever route, you don't want to use Windows Backup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are only going to back up data, the free version of Genie Timeline works extremely well and is easy to set up..
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.genie9.com/free_products/free_timeline.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.genie9.com/free_products/free_timeline.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to do full system backups, use this or something like it..</p>
<p><a href="http://www.todo-backup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.todo-backup.com/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which route? That depends upon how you use your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use Windows 7 as is, don't really add much software or customize settings, go with Genie Timeline. The Windows recovery partition will get you up and running after a bad crash, and GT will fill in all of the important bits for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you add a lot of stuff and you are into customizing everything, you will want to do completre system backups, in which case you should take the Easeus Todo route..</p>

            <p>Hi Mike Hall</p>
<p>Have not put anything into Drive D that I know of</p>
<p>But I do not recall seeing the level used being so high</p>
<p>I do not really know what I need to back up</p>
<p>Do have photo's , pictures, worksheets and documents on the PC but they are all backed up on external hard drive</p>
<p>Only have games that were on the PC originally but have deleted the 2 I&nbsp; had installed as the PC did not appear to like them</p>
<p>They were deleted using the control panel</p>
<p>What does not appear to be backed up is System repair disk and system image and this concerns me if I have to restore to factory image</p>
<p>I do not seem able to keep more than about 3 restore points and they are generally for the month we are in only</p>
<p>I suppose this is the main problem and it would be great if someone can help me on this</p>
<p>I have read loads of info on the subject but still am not sure</p>
<p>Thanks for help already given</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>You did not mention the model of the LG monitor?</p>
<p>Most monitors will include the OSD Lock (On-Screen Dispaly Lock) feature that allows to to lock/unlock the monitor. This is usually controlled&nbsp;with the monitor control buttons on the front or side of the monitor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recommend that you consult the documentation that came with the monitor.</p>
