            <p>Hi Zohaib,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can certainly check if it is an activated version of Windows 10 or not by following these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Win key + r </strong>on the keyboard and in the run Window, type
<strong>Winver </strong>and hit <strong>Enter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also press the <strong>Win key + Pause Break</strong> and check under Windows Activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It depends if the computer is upgraded from an activated version of Windows 10 or not, If Windows 10 is bought you may check the product key by calling this number or visit this webpage and click.</p>

    <title>SLUI 4 not able to run - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> camronmccormack  say:</h3>
<h2>            SLUI 4 not able to run</h2>
                    <p>So I'm currently trying to activate my copy of windows after a hardware update (including motherboard). When I use the activation troubleshooter then select changed hardware it lets me correctly select this computer, but then says "unable to activate windows.
 We can’t reactivate Windows on this device. Try again later.&nbsp;" I have tried this at a few different times over the past few days in case the "try again later" was actually accurate, but always got the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried calling support and they told me to run "SLUI 4", however that doesn't run anything. No new process starts. They said to try SLUI 3, which just opens the activation settings page. Since SLUI 4 wouldn't work, support said there was nothing I can do
 to activate windows... Hopefully someone here can help?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: After it fails to activate, the error code 0x803F7001 is displayed in the activation settings window.</p>

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Depending on the type of Windows 10 license you have installed, you might be able to transfer it to a new computer if needed. Over the years, Microsoft has distributed its desktop operating system through different market channels. New computers will often come preinstalled with an OEM license. There are many other channels Microsoft distributes Windows in, these include Retail, Volume License, Academic, and subgroups such as Upgrade licenses. Check these links, I hope it helps.

<h2>            YouTube app does not load</h2>
                    
<p>So far there have been no problems with the Xbox One YouTube app, but today I wanted to launch it and it just doesn't start. After the YouTube logo appears, the screen goes to black and I get back to the Dashboard. I tried to launch it several times. Also,
 I restarted the console and reinstalled the app but it didn't help. Any ideas?</p>

<p>Hi again dreampage,</p>
<p>Thanks for posting back and letting us know your progress. I'm sorry to hear things still aren’t playing nice. I would suggest hitting up
<a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/?hl=en#topic=4489102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
YouTube help</a>&nbsp;and posting to them about what you're experiencing with the app.</p>
<p>Also, since you've expressed that you've tried all the steps I've posted above and a few other troubleshooting steps from chat support, another step would be to reset your
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One console to factory defaults</a>. If you would like to go this route, please read all of the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support article</a>&nbsp;in full prior to performing any steps to understand how to do it and what happens after you perform the factory reset.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope this helps, and as always, let us know how it goes!</p>

<p>This link sheds some light on your problem:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-vista/windows-update-error-800f0826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-vista/windows-update-error-800f0826</a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A number of your failed updates show this error. When you look at the list to see which do not have this error code you should put all errors relating to Microsoft Office to one side as they are not dependent on Windows Update for failure or success.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A simple&nbsp;way to resolving a Windows Update problem can be to manually install one update at a time. This way you can identify the problematic update. As the article above suggests it will be an update with a different error code.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)">A lot of problems arise from setting Windows Update to automatically update. You may prefer to change this setting. Select Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the
 current setting. Click on the Arrow down to the right and change the selection to “Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download and install them” and click on OK.</span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)">If you encounter problems updating or you are not using the Automatic Update you should manually update by selecting Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the boxes before the updates you want to
 install, click on Install and click again on Install in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will tell
 you what is going on. You need to be patient. </span></p>
<p><font color="#000000"><br />
</font></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)">You may have a single update that causes all in the batch to fail to install. If this occurs you should install one at a time so that you can find out which update is causing the problem. Manually installing and restarting
 your computer also allows you find out more quickly whether the problem is resolved. Automatic updating is a scheduled operation, which may execute up to 24 hours later.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(23, 54, 93, 1)">With the problematic Microsoft Office updates I would try repairing Microsoft Office. Select Start, Control Panel, Programs and Features. Locate and place the cursor on Microsoft Office, right click and select Change. Set
 up opens and you then check the box before Repair and click the Continue button.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi Vinnu_007,<br />
<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Which update have you installed prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
In order to diagnose the issue, let’s check for the installed updates in the update history.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, refer to this link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/See-which-Windows-updates-are-installed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
See which Windows updates are installed</a></span></p>
<p><span><br />
Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>I would suggest you to perform system restore which will restore back the computer to the point when it was working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.
</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click Finish.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span></b><span>When you perform System Restore to restore the computer to previous state, programs and updates you installed are removed.</span></p>

<p>

<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + X </strong>keys&nbsp;and select the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>User Accounts</strong> and click on the <strong>Manage another account</strong> link.</li><li>If prompted by <strong>UAC</strong>, click on <strong>Yes</strong>.</li><li>Click on a user account which you want to delete.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Delete the account</strong> link.</li><li>Click on <strong>Delete Files</strong> or <strong>Keep Files</strong> for what you want to do with the user account's personal files.</li><li>Click on <strong>Delete Account</strong> to confirm.</li><li>When finished, you can close the Control Panel if you like.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: You must be signed in as an administrator to be able to delete a user account. You will not be able to delete a user account that is currently signed in. You will need to sign out the user first. Be sure to always have at least one

<p>You first have to add another user (administrator), I created one and just called it "New Owner" and used the password 12345. Once you do that you can follow the steps to delete your account from that PC.&nbsp; You are not deleting your Microsoft account just
 the user information and files from that particular PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOTE THESE IMPORTANT STEPS LEFT OUT:</p>
<p>After you click "add someone else to this computer"&nbsp; you get a window asking for e-mail - you have to go to the bottom and click "I don't have this information"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you get "Let's create an account"&nbsp; SKIP THIS and go to the bottom and choose "Add a user without a Microsoft Account"</p>

<h2>            Controller triggers not working</h2>
                    
<p>My controllers left and right triggers arent responsive and it acts like im holding both triggers down, my second controller works fine so its not the console. I also shut the xbox down by holding down the power button. I checked out the warranty and my
 console is covered but my controller isnt. There was no constant or excessive force so&nbsp;I&nbsp;know its&nbsp;&nbsp;a faulty controller and my xbox 360 controllers work fine after&nbsp;5 or 6 years of usage.</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;BlubberMetal!<br /><br />Sorry to hear about the controller issues. I can definitely understand how frustrating that could be. &nbsp;I recommend trying a few steps to see if we can get this issues sorted.<br /><br /><strong>Please give the following steps a try:<br /></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Press and hold the power button on your Xbox One console for 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Once your console powers off, unplug the power cord.</li>
<li>Remove the batteries from your wireless controller.</li>
<li>Wait 5 minutes and then plug in your console and reinsert the batteries into your controller.</li>
<li>Power on your console and check to see if the trigger issue continues.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />Give the suggested steps a try and if you continue to experience issues, try replacing the current batteries in the controller with a fresh set. If after trying all the steps the triggers are still not functioning correctly, you may want to look into replacing your controller. &nbsp;You can reach out to our Phone Support from our&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a>&nbsp;<span>page to verify the warranty status on your controller.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 problem after update to version1607 kepps printing an error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sadnewbie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 problem after update to version1607 kepps printing an error page.</h2>
                    <p>After my computer was updated to Windows 10 version 1607 last night,&nbsp;it requested a needed restart. So I did go to Start-&gt; Power-&gt; Update and Restart.</p>
<p>The desktop Pc restarted but after a little while it started printing page after page with:</p>
<p>"GET /DevMgmt/ProductConfigCap.xml HTTP/1.1</p>
<p>Host: "</p>
<p>about 20 times per page, generating 10 sheets with the same printing.</p>
<p>Meantime the screen remained black although the mouse icon was visible and active. After about half an hour without any other action I did a hard restart on the computer it got me to the Welcome screen asking for my pin. I entered the pin and it seemed to
 work however it just started to print the same page as described above and the PC remained static on a black screen again for over half an hour.
</p>
<p>Tried three more times, kept printing the same type of pages.</p>
<p>Finally after the fifth restart and entering my pin it brought up my desktop screen, but still prints several pages with the same message.
</p>
<p>If I turn off the computer it will go through the same steps printing and black screen. So once I got my desktop screen decided to keep the computer on permanently.</p>
<p>How can I solve this problem? Any help and suggestions will be greatly appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Well, following your suggestion I did run Defender which found no threats or other infection. Ran the disk cleaner too. Then to make sure I ran CCleaner and it got all the junk out about 1.5GB. then ran the Wise Registry Cleaner (Free)&nbsp;most recent version.
 Once I did all that restarted the PC. Voila! no more automatic printing of pages!!!</p>
<p>All is clear and working well. Problem solved.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and assistance.</p>

    <title>Kinect gestures are finally awesome&#33;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Kinect gestures are finally awesome&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So, I received an interesting message from a friend of mine, who apparently got the next update as part of the 1405 preview update roll-out. After the update, he said that the Kinect sensor gesture controls were insanely faster, perfectly precise, and actually
 fun &amp; easier to use. Granted this is 2nd hand information, but it makes me kind of excited, if true, and so I wanted to share this possible up-coming improvement with you guys. I'm in the preview update too so again, if it's true, I should get this update
 soon as well. When I do, I'll let you guys know more. In the meantime, do you guys think this is true? Are any of you guys in the preview update and are experiencing anything remotely similar to what my friend has mentioned? Give it a try and let us know,
 if you get it before me! For you naysayers who don't believe in the Kinect sensor, I simply want to know from you guys whether you think my friend was pulling my leg or not.</p>
<p>Discuss. ;)</p>

<p>24, I did try it for myself and as far as I can tell, it appears to be the same, but then again, I haven't received an update for about a week or 2 now. My guess is that as part of the roll-out I haven't yet received the most recent update, or my friend
 is in fact, pulling my leg - which is why I was asking around. ;)</p>

<p>It's unbelievable how fast and accurate they are now. I have my X1 set to energy saver, so I check for updates. I've updated 3 times since the beginning of the 1405. After playing Titanfall last night I checked for updates; got one for roughly 256Mbs. First
 thing I noticed is the camera "recognized" me, so I went to the Kinect setup where usually that sees me as "guest". After that I raised my hand...it immediately showed up on the T.V. (Usually takes a couple times for this to happen.), so I played around some
 more.</p>
<p>In the ten minutes of playing around the Kinect NEVER failed to register a gesture, was blistering fast on movement, and NOT ONCE lost my hand/hands.</p>
<p>I was very impressed. If it stays this way...I'll be using gestures more.</p>
<p>Peace, J.R. &nbsp; </p>

            Hi Lois.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you Clean Installed Windows then there would be no User files until you reimport them from the backup.  If there are then it wasn't a Clean install which should delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space so that nothing is left during the install.  Did you do something else?  A Reset, Factory Recovery or Fresh Start?  
<br />
<br />See the steps for that in this gold standard tutorial for Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>Sorry I don't remember what Windows called my reinstallation. It offered me the option of keeping my files, and I took that. Does that help you know what I did?</p>

            Hi Lois.  
<br />
<br />Probably a Reset:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />Your files should be in their User folders.  If not it may mean the account was unable to start so it created a temp account.  Do you see your old Accounts at C:\Users to copy out your files now to properly back them up?   Then try to start it again a few times, and if it won't   create a new Admin Local User Account to replace it, move your files into it from backup, test all programs work from it, then when ready delete the old account, if necessary changing it from a Microsoft to a Local Account first so it will delete.  
<br />
<br />If the files aren't there then they may be in C:\windows.old which is where they are archived when not replaced in their User folders or no temp account is created for some reason.
<br />
<br />FYI:  Your  files should always be backed up if you value them at all because the hard drive can die at any time.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud.  
<br />
<br />Or you can drag or copy them to a USB external or flash drive.  
<br />Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn on File History to keep your files backed up incrementally to external hard drive.  However I would also use one of the other methods above to be safest:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-windows-10-file-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/configure-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes:  <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/how-to-create-an-image-backup-in-windows-10-and-restore-it-if-need-be.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/3011736/windows/...</a>
<br />The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>

<p>Thanks. I guess it was a "reset."</p>
<p>As I said originally, my files are in their "user" folder.</p>
<p>But I'd like them to show in File Explorer, which is empty. That's my question: how do I repopulate File Explorer?</p>

            I guess what confuses me Lois, is that your User folder IS File Explorer, if you're reaching it via C:\Users\Your User Account Name.  Once they are there then they should show up the shortcuts in the Explorer bar on left hand side of File Explorer.  
<br />
<br />So where are they missing exactly?  Can we see a screenshot?  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/open-snipping-tool-and-take-a-screenshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/o...</a>
<br />
<br />You can reset File Explorer:  Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.

<p>How are you installing Microsoft Office, from a network location, (Click to Run) or DVD/CD? You could try copying the contents of the disk to a folder on your desktop and start the setup there.</p>
<p>If Windows Installer logging is enabled, the following line should be noted as a symptom:<br />
“Error 1606. Could not access network location %APPDATA%”<br />
<br />
The problem is potentially a result of an inconsistent/incorrect environmental variable (%AppData%).<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
1. Open the Registry editor<br />
2. Navigate to the following registry keys HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders<br />
3. The correct and default value for AppData should be:&nbsp; %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming<br />
4. Close the Registry editor, and try again Windows Update again. (A reboot should not be required.)<br />
5. If the problem persists, repeat the steps 2 through 4 with the following registry keys:<br />
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\<br />
<br />
Or, run http://support.microsoft.com/kb/886549 in place of Step # 5.<br />

    <title>Account migration issues - Account region and dashboard not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ru feelin lucky  say:</h3>
<h2>            Account migration issues - Account region and dashboard not updating&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I have posted a few comments on other posts from other users and I have been told that I should start a new thread as they were old threads!</p>
<p>So here is what happened; I waited years for Xbox to allow account migration and I was so excited when I first tried to change regions! However I have come across lots of issues and will list to the best of my ability what, so far I have done to try get
 my account migrated to a new region:</p>
<p>I moved from the UK to Australia! I followed the instructions to migrate my account and got the SUCCESSFUL ACCOUNT MIGRATION email
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BUT</span> the dashboard and market place were for the wrong region (wrong region apps and currency). I have been in touch with Xbox support online three separate times and wasted probably 2 hours of both their time and
 mine!</p>
<p>I'm going to try a few more things later and I have been escalated in the Xbox support tier system they have. I know that all my games are cross region ok and most of them I purchased here in Australia (and played on a UK account).</p>
<p>The account migration feature is excellent (I have waited almost 4 years for it) but I wish Xbox could work out a solution.</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>System cache&gt;delete</p>
<p>Profile&gt;Delete</p>
<p>Profile&gt;Download&gt;console</p>
<p>Profile&gt;download&gt;USB</p>
<p>Cache&gt;clean again x 5</p>
<p>Power off&gt; wait 30 minutes &gt;power on</p>
<p>In all combinations shapes and ways!</p>
<p>I know that another account I have (free one) with Australian created account works first time!</p>
<p>Now I have just gone in and deleted my old credit card details from the UK bank, as I want to use an Australian bank card! As I live in Australia.</p>
<p>I have now found out that my billing address and contact details have reverted back to a place a used to live years ago in the UK, not even the correct details for the credit use to purchase the latest UK subscription to Xbox live (well dodgy!). This means
 that they have kept my payment details on record and somehow reverted back to them! Not sure I like this! I also cannot no change the local region on the website! I could do this a few days ago and now it's stuck on the UK as the website region! If I try to
 add a new credit card it comes up with the UK by default and it can't be changed. So I am now in the situation of not been able to change anything or access the Australian download content. Looked at trying re-migrate the account and no surprise I can't because
 it worked last week and you can only migrate once every three months (maybe they should allow it more than once in a 48 hour period, to try fix these issues).</p>
<p>After reading the other posts I hope to get a speedy fix, but I know some guys have waited months and got nothing sorted. It's only been 3 or 4 days but I'm not going to hold my breath!</p>

<p>I'll have to type this in again as Xbox signed me out....</p>
<p>I have just confirmed that I can log into the Australian Xbox website and the region states Australia, but as soon as I try to add a payment method it changes the region to the UK again. There is nothing I can do to change that, I have deleted all other
 payments so that not the issue, and I cannot therefore enter an Australian payment details! So I need a member of Microsoft/Xbox to log in and change the database (deleting my old details would be nice too). How hard could it be? delete&gt;clear cache&gt; enter
 new!</p>

<p>I have just checked in the Microsoft account details (<a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://commerce.microsoft.com</a>) under "subscriptions" and it now states that the "Switch Region Offer" is cancelled! Maybe Xbox

<p>But that is not the answer to the original question &gt;Account migration! I should be able to setup a new payment if my region was correct! And I don't want to use a different region credit card and still have to buy from the UK market. I would rather buy
 nothing and save my money and buy something else. Thanks for the help but it not the answer to my problem with my account!</p>

<p>Hey Lucky. The reason I suggested phone support was because you said that you have gone through the proper region migration steps, and when you checked out commerce.microsoft.com, it told you the "Switch Region Offer" was cancelled. You also asked for us
 to make the change for you, which is not possible unless you contact phone support. &nbsp;Are you sure you changed your region both on your console, as well as on your Microsoft Account?</p>

<p>I have received a SECOND email from MSFT Microsoft to confirm that my account switch transfer has worked. And YES it has worked. Please note in the time between the issues as per:</p>
<p>forums.xbox.com/.../438878.aspx</p>
<p>and the fix I did the following......Confirmed it was at the Microsoft end and connected them again via the online support chat function via contact us link. I had also set up new forum post as requested by Microsoft:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/12/p/519043/2431541.aspx#2431541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../2431541.aspx</a></p>
<p>(This post)</p>
<p>I noted that the switch region offer within the account settings had been cancelled, the Microsoft support guy was really good and he also added my very detailed description within my forum post to my case notes.</p>
<p>End result I still have 2 region tabs under my commerce account (just checked for you) but now my current Xbox region is the correct one, dashboard is now correct and currency is also correct. Microsoft also supplied codes for me to put back on my remaining
 Xbox Live subscription time.</p>
<p>BTW - I can confirm the issue was not at my end! But at the Microsoft end! They fixed it after I contacted them using the online chat support and I am very happy. Thank you Xbox support team :D The online support guy "Keith" gave me excellent service and
 the problem was resolved from their end within a few hours.</p>

<h2>            MP4 videos not playing in media player</h2>
                    <p>A simple question begging a simple answer please...</p>
<p>Why do my MP4 video files no longer play in media player after upgrading to 10?..</p>
<p>I quote from Microsoft's site:</p>
<p>"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/316992"</p>
<p>I've read various moderator solutions by resetting media player would fix the problem but as many and myself have realized that this is not the case.Nor is a solution to use another third party player..I'd like a simple answer please as to why these files
 will no longer play in the player that played them fine before the upgrade.Even by Microsoft these files are natively playable in media player.If Microsoft is working on a fix,TELL us please...if Microsoft has NO idea why and has NO plan to repair this issue
 please tell us as well.</p>
<p>This time kindly answer the question instead of moving this post to the community forum.

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for being part of Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for trying some steps in order to get the issue resolved. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>It would be grateful if you can reply to this question in order to assist you further:</span></span></p>
<p>1. Do you get any error message when there is no video in Windows Media Player?</p>
<p>2. Are you able to play the files using a different player?</p>
<p>3. Did you try using DVD app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is having problems playing video or audio files in Windows Media Player, try using the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter to fix the problem. The troubleshooter checks the configuration and network settings for Windows Media Player
 to make sure that you can play content you've downloaded and saved to your computer, or content streaming over a network or the Internet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try the below suggestions and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Run&nbsp;the <strong>Windows Media Player settings troubleshooter</strong> and see if it helps.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">: Press
<strong><span>Windows logo </span></strong>open the search box.<br />

<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>Media</strong> <strong>Settings. </strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Suggestions:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>1.a) Try playing the file on a different computer and check if the file is not corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Try copying the file to the computer and check if you are able to play the file.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. In some cases people have run into this error when the wrong audio device is selected in WMP.&nbsp; Tools | Options | Devices | Speakers | Properties will allow you to change it.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. It’s a good idea to update and/or reinstall your Sound Card and Video Card drivers.&nbsp;Along with DirectX when you are getting this error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. To determine what codec was used with a specific file, play the file in the Player, if possible. While the file is playing, right-click the file in the library, and then click Properties. On the File tab, look at the Audio codec and Video codec
 sections.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. Download and install Codecs by go to the PLAYER tab and check. Connect to the Internet and Download Codecs Automatically from the player.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Configure protocol settings.</span></p>
<p><span>On the <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>Options</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Network tab</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>In the <strong>Streaming protocols</strong> area, select all the protocol check boxes.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When connecting to a server running Windows Media Services, Windows Media Player attempts to use all the selected protocols.</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply..Ill address your answers in order posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get no error message # it simply says the file type is not supported.</p>
<p>yes it (the files) will play on other players like VLC and PotPlayer without issue.</p>
<p>All of these settings you speak of being in "PLAYER" and tools option..are we talking about the same player? as I can't find these in WMP 12.</p>
<p>Where is Protocol Settings located?</p>
<p>How can I right click the file in the player when I told you the file won't play??</p>
<p>the files played fine prior to upgrading and I never had any issues with WMP...the files are not corrupt as the play fine in all other players and judging by the countless post's on this forum and many others this is a PROBLEM with Microsoft and WMP..</p>
<p>if you'd care to send much more detailed instructions that show me where these settings are I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>***UPDATE*** some WMV files will also NOT play in WMP?? come on now!...I created it in Windows Movie Maker and it played fine also prior to the upgrade.</p>
<p>I and ALL the other's out there would really appreciate a fix to this!..again NOTHING is "corrupted" as they play fine in ALL OTHER PLAYERS..</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get the "this file is not supported" message and I click on web help,MS tells me to try this that and the other thing which all I've tried already and gives me this error code number
</p>
Windows Media Player C00D1199
<p>This is a MAJOR problem that I hope is addressed sooner rather than later!</p>

<br />5. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

<p><span><span>Hi Jacky1234107,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. When did the issue start?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Do you rememeber making any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Did you try to boot in safe mode?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try to boot in safe mode and check if the issues occurs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start your computer in safe mode</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are unable to boot in safe mode, then perform a startup repair</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have Startup repair is a preinstalled recovery option on your computer, then you can try that. Otherwise you need a
 Windows Vista fullversion disc to perform Startup repair.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Startup Repair is designed to detect operating system startup problems and troubleshoot any found and corrects them with little
 user interaction.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How do I use startup repair?</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Startup-Repair-frequently-asked-questions</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 3:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If startup repair doesn’t help, then you may also try a System Restore booting from a Windows Vista disc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Use the Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE) to run System Restore</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert the Windows Vista installation disc into the disc drive, and then start the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …” appears.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Select a language, a time and currency, and a keyboard or input method, and then click Next.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Click Repair your computer.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, choose the drive of your Windows installation and click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. At the System Recovery Options Dialog Box, click on System Restore.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>g. Follow the System Restore Wizard instruction as usual and choose the restore point prior to this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
