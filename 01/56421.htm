<h2>            Party chat audio</h2>
                    <p>To get into this everytime I start a party, using the Xbox&nbsp;app my mic is constantly making an extremely loud static-like noise. The main problem is my Mic doesn't even need to be plugged in. Its as soon as I start/join a party. I've tried messing around with audio setting making sure that all audio is coming through my headset but the problem still persists and I now have no idea what to do.</p>

            That message usually means that XP just can't find the file due to some corruption in the NT File System (NTFS) or XP is being told to look for the file in the wrong place.<br />
<br />
You should first tell us more about your system and how you think it got this way, then you can see about fixing it:<br />
<br />
It is too bad the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please answer the following questions as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials sMSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; avast!. Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />

            Like I've said before regarding this problem:<br />
<br />
You can replace the file with the one from the installation CD if you have a working CD/DVD drive and it you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (most people don't) and if you know enough about
 your hardware to select which of the 7 possible hal.dll files on the CD is the one you need (or you could try them all).<br />
<br />
Too many ifs and that is probably not the problem anyway.<br />
<br />
Amongst other bad ideas, the http://pcsupport.about.com WWW site suggests:<br />
<br />
<pre><b>expand <i>d</i>:\i386\hal.dl_ <i> c:\windows</i>\system32<br /></b><br />I wouldn't advise these articles ever and here's why:<br /></pre>
<br />
I have never replaced a hal.dll file in my life for this problem, but since it seems so many people are intent of following those kinds of instructions to replace the hal.dll, I will try to explain why it is a bad idea.<br />
<br />
First take a look at the Properties of the hal.dll on your non virtual machine working system and look at the "Internal Name" on the Version tab and see what it says.&nbsp; That will tell you the name of the hal.dll file that XP chose for your system when it was
 installed (I doubt it is hal.dll).<br />
<br />
Does it say hal.dll?&nbsp; It probably says something else, so if you took the hal.dl_ from an XP installation disk and expanded it onto your system, you would then have a file called hal.dll, but it would be the wrong hal.dll.<br />
<br />
When you check the Properties/Internal Name of the hal.dll on your XP system, tell us what is says:<br />
<br />
<i>Put your answer here</i><br />
<br />
Does it say hal.dll?&nbsp; Of course not.&nbsp; That is why you don't want that file.<br />
<br />
When XP gets installed, it selects and expands the proper hal.dll to match your hardware from seven possibilities of compressed hal.dll files on the installation CD:<br />
<br />
Size On XP Disk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanded<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;53,248 HAL.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 105,344&nbsp; (generic for VMWare)&nbsp; 5.1.2600.5512 (xpsp.080413-2111)<br />
&nbsp;47,091 HALAACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 131,840&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (likely for some systems and laptops)<br />
&nbsp;40,194 HALACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 81,152<br />
&nbsp;51,368 HALAPIC.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150,528<br />
&nbsp;48,531 HALMACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 134,400&nbsp;&nbsp; (Likely for more robust systems)<br />
&nbsp;52,563 HALMPS.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 152.576&nbsp; (multiprocessor)<br />
&nbsp;37,780 HALSP.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77,696<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Each one of those can be expanded into a file called hal.dll file, so if it is your intent to replace your hal.dll, you would have to either figure out or know in advance which one is the right one for your hardware, motherboard and CPU.&nbsp; If you just picked
 one at random, you would have a one in seven chance (14%) of getting the correct one.&nbsp; Maybe you will get lucky.<br />
<br />
If you just expand the hal.dl_ from the XP installation CD, that is the simplest, most generic of all the choices (probably not the right one).<br />
<br />
The hal.dl_ file on the CD is the most boring of them all:<br />
<br />
HAL.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
<br />
<br />
That is a good choice for some virtual machines where there is no real "hardware" (like VMWare), but if you are not running XP in a virtual machine it is the absolute worst choice (sorry Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts").<br />
<br />
You system may in fact boot with it (mine wont), but you will be missing a lot of functionality that is built in to the other hal.dll files.<br />
<br />
For example, if I wanted to replace the hal.dll file on one system here, I would need to expand this file:<br />
<br />
HALMACPI.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Multiprocessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * MPS Multiprocessor<br />
<br />
<br />
If I wanted to replace the hal.dll file on another system here, I would need to expand this file:<br />
<br />
HALAACPI.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Uniprocessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Multiprocessor<br />
<br />
<br />
One of those two are what you will probably find on most modern systems desktops/laptops.<br />
<br />
The error message usually just means that XP can't find the file because the file system is corrupted and you just need to run chkdsk&nbsp; with error correction (chkdsk&nbsp; /r) from the XP Recovery Console so XP can find the file again.<br />
<br />
I would always start with a chkdsk /r first (it will not hurt to run chkdsk /r even if it finds nothing to do), then take a look at the boot.ini file.<br />
<br />
This is also why when folks trying to help give you instructions to put in your XP CD and expand the hal.dl_ file to replace yours, it is generally weak advice from a well meaning novice.&nbsp; The hal.dl_ file on the XP installation CD is the least likely to be
 the right choice of the possible hal.dll files on the CD.<br />
<br />
The second problem with that advice is most people do not have an XP installation CD to begin with.<br />
<br />
That kind of help is usually going to be very wrong - although it sort of makes sense at first and is "logical", but it will never work out favorably and that is generally not the problem anyway.&nbsp; You can learn about all the different hal.dll files on the XP
 installation CD and then figure out which one is the right one for your system, but that file is probably not really missing or corrupt.<br />

            What is the make and model of your computer? 
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network 
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

            I am seeing a lot of questions on similar issues and this looks like some newer Intel driver is causing that.

            Hello Kayless,
<br />
<br />The game is very old. Unfortunately old games usually are not working on Windows 10, if they were not adapted for it.
<br />
<br />Look here for some stepss:

<p><em>"I have followed all the fixes listed in this thread"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>And which thread is that ? </p>
<p>- If the game has installed and does not launch it is because the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disc based version</span> of this game uses <em>SafeDisk</em> copy protection,</p>
<p>and the driver used by SafeDisk - <em>secdrv.sys</em> - is being blocked by MS because they say it is a security risk, event though secdrv.sys</p>
<p>has never been compromised by a malware to date. I have more details on DRM Blocking in my post at&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-gaming/login-as-administrator-warning/56cf28ad-c7e5-432f-89ab-d22e08a06544">
---this thread---</a></p>
<p>- B<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">asically, all disc based games that use SafeDisk DRM require a noCD fix/hack to run the game on Win10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you are having problems installing the game this same issue would apply, but due to the games age it is likely to also have</p>
<p>other issues that would need some other fixes.</p>
<p>There is a small chance game may use a 16bit installer, in which case there is no hope, unless someone on a DK2 a fan site has</p>
<p>created a 32bit installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try copying all of the files from the CD to a folder you create on your Desktop (or location you prefer) and then run the games</p>
<p>Setup from that folder. This can help with some games that don't install from the disc.
</p>
<p>You can delete this folder once the game is installed (or fails to install).- You will still need to use a noCD fix/hack to run the game after installing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Easy way out....</span> Buy the game from Good Old Games. It will have had any issues fixed, and the DRM has been removed so</p>
<p>there is no problem with DRM Blocking.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Wait for one of their regular sales and get is for up to 75% off the full price.</p>

            Hello A V,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick response.<br />
<br />
I connected the printer directly and it does not print !!<br />
<br />
I updated the drivers on the laptop and it still doesnt work.&nbsp; I'm able to print a test page when connected directly but not able to get anything when printing from notepad or Word.<br />
<br />
The printer used to be connected to a XP workstation; I was able to print from the Windows 7 laptop but only after I configured the printer on the laptop as an IP adress (rather than by telling it to go through the XP printer server).&nbsp; I thought everything
 would be easier when I had 2 Windows 7 machines via the Homegroup !! By the way, I also tried the IP adress here and it doesnt work.<br />
<br />
Finally, I also remembered that the laptop used to have Vista.&nbsp; So, I downloaded a patch from HP specifically for computers that were upgraded from Vista to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Any other ideas ??<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />
<br />
Charles<br />

            <p><span>Charles</span></p>
<p><span>I would check the status of the Print Spooler Service.</span></p>
<p><span>Click on the Start button and select Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services. Locate Print Spooler in the list. Check that it has started and that the StartUp type is Automatic.</span></p>
<p><span>I suspect that it has stopped and that just starting it will not solve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>You may need to show hidden files. Type Folder Options in the search box above the Start button and select View, Advanced Settings and verify that the box before "Show hidden files and folders" is checked and "Hide protected operating system files"
 is unchecked. You need to scroll down to see the second item. You should also make certain that the box before "Hide extensions for known file types" is not checked.</span></p>
<p><span>Now access Windows Explorer and select c:\windows\system32\spool\printers. Normally this folder should be empty but there is a problem when files with “spl” and “shd” extensions stick there. Delete the files and restart your computer. This may resolve
 your immediate problem.</span></p>

            Hi Gerry,<br />
<br />
The Spooler was started.&nbsp; I Stopped it and restarted it.<br />
<br />
I checked the ... spools\printers folder and it was empty ...<br />
<br />
So, unfortunately there is no change<br />

            Another info..<br />
<br />
Laptop is running Bit Defender .. The desktop runs Avast ... It looks like that might be my problem .. I saw on other sites that bit defender firewall needs to be turned off for homegroup to work properly ..
<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on that angle ^<br />

<p>Make a restore point before trying this just in case. This method helped another user.</p>
<p>I have read other posts with this problem and I believe that the solution was to go to settings &gt; update and security&gt; windows update&gt;Advanced options&gt; configure automatic device setup after an update under the privacy section in sign in options&gt;Privacy<br />
section&gt; turn off "use my sign in info to automatically finish setting up my device after an update or restart. This&nbsp; setting allows Microsoft to sign in to your device and for some reason makes you need to sign in twice. Reboot&nbsp; to see if problem is solved..Hope
 this solves the problem you are having. Sorry if this was of no help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit the short way is settings &gt; accounts&gt; sign in options &gt; scroll down to the setting I indicated &nbsp; earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also found this in case the first one is not your particular problem. It should either be the first solution or this one.</p>

    <title>Losing wireless connection while playing Destiny and One will not - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Losing wireless connection while playing Destiny and One will not reconnect until I pull the power plug.</h2>
                    
<p>Thought I would start here. For the last month it seems my Xbox One will lose connection to&nbsp;my Wireless while playing Destiny. This has occurred 5 minutes into the game or 2 hours later. When this happens the Xbox One will not reconnect to the wireless no
 matter what I try. I have done all the normal resetting of the wireless router and my cable modem I have even got to the point where&nbsp;I setup a manual IP for the Xbox but the only thing that works is&nbsp;unplugging the power from the back of the Xbox.</p>
<p>The router is a Netgear Genie WNDR3400v2 none of the other devices in the house have this issue. Has anyone else run into a similar issue where no matter what you try your Xbox will not reconnect to the wireless after loosing connection while playing an
 Xbox Live game like Destiny?</p>

<p>Having the same problem here. Don't know if this was because of the Xbox One update 3 days ago but I've only been having problems since then.</p>
<p>Edit: it's also worth noting that I am using Virgin Media as my ISP, SuperHub 2</p>

<p>I started experiencing the same issue yesterday. I called into Xbox support and they had me change the DMZ setting on my router. Then unplug my xbox and it appeared to work, 2 games into the crucible however I was booted again and now even pulling the power
 plug isn't fixing the issue. Hopefully somebody can figure out a fix quickly.</p>

<p>Same thing, this needs to be acknowledged. Started happening (seemingly) with the latest system update. I don't know if it is Destiny related but it's happened to me 3 times in the last 2 days while playing Destiny.</p>
<p>The internet/network connection is terminated, and when I go back to the dashboard, all I can see is the "Home" tab, and can see never-ending spinning circles to the sides where Friends and Pins would be. The only way to fix is to hard reset, because my
 Xbox won't turn off either. I'll shut it down, and the front power button will endlessly pulse, never fully turning off.</p>
<p>I tried testing the network connection twice, and while they both took 5+ minutes sitting there "checking" ... I got 2 different results. One was "can't find an IP address" and the other was "can't find a network." It's like everything network/internet related
 completely shuts off.</p>
<p>Also, this is 100% certainly only on the Xbox One, because when this happens, all other devices on the network remain connected.</p>

<p>Been having the same issue for the past week. &nbsp;Had 4 calls now to Xbox support and they go through all the trouble shooting each time - always fixing the issue by disconnecting from power source for 5 mins then turning back on. &nbsp;Only seems to be happening
 when playing destiny. &nbsp;Support did get me to make sure all Xbox live ports were open as well but this hasn't changed anything, its happened again today and always around the same time of day.</p>

<p>Still having the same issue but only seems with Destiny. No idea how destiny is adversely causing my Xbox one to fail to reconnect to my wireless or what caused it to happen at all but it must be something on their end. Hope they get it fixed soon. It's
 very annoying. Someone gave me a tip to hold power button for 10 seconds instead of unplugging Xbox. That works also and seems less intrusive</p>

<h3> slammin tea  say:</h3>
<h2>            reputation to low to play</h2>
                    
<p>my sons account has been suspended for about 6&nbsp; months, when he tries to play it tells him his account has low reputation and that it's hindering him from finding any matches online.&nbsp; i understand that to get your rep up you have to&nbsp; play online, but everytime
 he tries to play online it tells him his rep is too low to find any matches or to play online in general.&nbsp; with almost every game.</p>
<p>im not happy here because every yr i buy a yr subscription for 59.99 and now its been wasted for the last 6 months!!!!&nbsp; does not make me a happy camper lol</p>
<p>what can be done to resolve this please.</p>
<p>thanks debbie</p>

<p>Reputation is given from the people playing, and enough people have to send you bad/poor feedback for it to drop. Options to report are mainly voice communication, unsporting behavior and quitting early. Honestly I feel like 6 months is a long time for a
 first time offense and there should be a warning with a response on what people reported about you. Then you can speak to your son and try to adjust.</p>
<p>Not to be rude, but for someone to go and submit feedback you must be really offended. I typically report rude children who talk a lot of trash they would never say in front of their parents, repeated team killers if the game allows it and people that quit
 early in games that don't replenish players, but mainly if I'm really feed up. You should mention these to your son.</p>

<p>Hey there SLAMMIN :)</p>
<p>The new reputation system is designed in a way that prevents other players from abusing it. In a simple explanation, players who have been rep-ranked low will most likely be pit against other low scoring gamers. You can find all the information you need
 regards the reputation system on the below link. </p>

            PROBLEM SOLVED (for me)! &nbsp;I had this problem for the last week on my new computer. &nbsp;Seemed like the 'start' button was continually being pressed. &nbsp;Did you happen to have a wireless keyboard that you switched out for another that is still nearby your computer....like
 I did. &nbsp;Turns out I forgot to pull the battery from my wireless keyboard and also didn't pull the usb for the remote communicator. &nbsp;I tucked the keyboard on a shelf above the computer. &nbsp;The 'Start' button got pressed against a book so it was always "pressed"
 and always communicating with the computer. &nbsp;Just happened to realize this when I thought about trouble shooting with my original keyboard. &nbsp;When I pulled it from the shelf, the problem stopped. &nbsp;Hope this helps!

            Hello,&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The DVD comes with either Windows Vista or Windows XP. The best thing to do here is to contact DELL TECH SUPPORT and ask them directly if they have drivers for windows 7.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The drivers that you can find in their website for Dimension 5150 which uou can access here http://www.dell.com/support/drivers/us/en/19/Product/dimension-5150x are for Windows XP and Windows Vista only. Sometimes, Windows Vista drivers work with Windows
 7. But since you have tried everything, try contacting DELL tech support.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Windows 7 product key for 32 Bit Vs 64 bit</h2>
                    I have a retail version of Windows 7 that I bought from a shop, It came with windows 7 32Bit and 64bit versions but only 1 product key, so I installed the 32Bit version, but now I want to use the 64 bit version on this computer instead of the 32 bit version,
 can I still use the product key that I used to install the 32 bit version?

<p>Yes you can use the same product key, you might have to reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p><br />
Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>
<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.<br />
<br />
Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.<br />
<br />
Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>
<p>32 vs 64 bit<br />
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/32-bit-and-64-bit-Windows-frequently-asked-questions<br />
<br />
Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit<br />
<br />
Windows 7 64 bit comes in handy when you need to address at least 4 GBs or more of RAM. Windows 7 32 bit can utilize up to 3.2 GBs of RAM. Because the memory address space is much larger for 64 bit Windows, that means, you need twice as much memory than 32
 bit Windows to accomplish some of the same task, but you are able to do so much more, you can have more applications open, do things like run an Antivirus scan in the background without it affecting your system performance. Windows 7 64 bit is more secure
 too, malicious code cannot easily infiltrate it, drivers are more reliable since they must be signed before they can work with 64 bit Windows 7.<br />
<br />
As for compatibility, you will need 64 bit device drivers for any hardware devices you might have. Also, there is no 16 bit subsystem in Windows 7 64 bit, which means, your applications must be 32 bit only, not 16 bit installer or uninstallers.</p>

<h2>            Patch KB4074594 is causing issues with Windows 2012 R2 RDS sessions</h2>
                    <p>Found this on multiple Windows 2012 R2 Remote Desktop servers. Patch <span>KB4074594</span>is installed and causing some RDS sessions to not allow clicking on the start menu. Uninstalled the patch, rebooted and the servers are now functioning normally.&nbsp;There
 is little mentioned anywhere. I'm hesitant to install this patch any other RDS servers. This patch requires a reg key be added for Antivirus compatibility. This regkey is added. Any update to the status of this patch?</p>

<h2>            Computer slowed down after Windows Update.</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 home 64 bit version... I have had my computer for 3 years now without a problem until windows 8 came out and a huge update was advailible for my laptop. because it was a security update I downloaded it and all of a sudden my computer slowed
 down so much that I am starting to hate windows. I reinstalled windows and updated and the same thing happened, I have tried doing regristry clean and I checked memory and ram. Everything is fine but windows. When I hibernated my laptop today it when black
 and the computer keep running for 20 minutes. And also shutdown is slower than it is supposed to be as well as boot-up.

            I hope this is the correct place to post this as I also ran into this problem with my laptop win 7 64 bit proffesionel elitebook 8560w. I also had a black screen for too long during setting to standby, I had to turn off my laptop hard by holding the button
 as I needed to be somewhere else.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I think it started after the same update.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Furthermore, my dockingstation and usb seem to have issues after standby.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Situation description:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Laptop in standby, put into the dockingstation. Started by power on.</div>
<div>The usb mouse and keyboard connected to the docking station is powered, however they dont work. If I unplug them and replug them they dont get powered not even when plugged directly into the laptop. I have to restart the laptop (which really took more
 than 10 minutes) and then they do work after reboot, they are kept plugged into the docking station. &nbsp;I had this today and yesterday already, exactly the same as described here.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope you have more suggestions than it is a virus, your pc is full etc. &nbsp;and will notify us with a proper fix/update for laptops asap.&nbsp;</div>

<p>I have windows 7 home 64 bit version... I have had my computer for 3 years now without a problem until windows 8 came out and a huge update was advailible for my laptop. because it was a security update I downloaded it and all of a sudden my computer slowed
 down so much that I am starting to hate windows. I reinstalled windows and updated and the same thing happened, I have tried doing regristry clean and I checked memory and ram. Everything is fine but windows. When I hibernated my laptop today it when black
 and the computer keep running for 20 minutes. And also shutdown is slower than it is supposed to be as well as boot-up.

I had the exact same problem.&nbsp; It's my guess that it has nothing to do with your computer, it's with one of the updates.<br />
<br />
I have documented my troubles in another thread which unfortunately never received a satisfactory answer.&nbsp; I tried everything mentioned above and more, and nothing worked.&nbsp; Your best shot, unfortunately, is to refresh everything (assuming your computer can...my
 computer wasn't always able to do so.&nbsp; My computer has crashed about 5 times in a month because of Windows update).&nbsp; Then turn off updates and don't download ANY updates.<br />
<br />
Not all the updates are bad, but one or more of them are.&nbsp; If you're really wanting to do an update, I suppose you can experiment installing them one at a time and seeing which is causing the problem , but with 81 updates on my computer waiting to be installed,
 I don't have the time or inclination to do so.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
On another thread I posted today, I asked a question on which KB updates have been known to cause problems to users.&nbsp; It's my guess (again) that they doesn't cause problems for everyone, but they do cause problems for some, and I want to know which ones they
 are.&nbsp; With any luck, someone will actually respond and give an answer to the thread.&nbsp;

                    Since the end of February, my laptop has been doing this. And it had got to the point where I wouldn't shut down or restart it, because I was terrified of what it would do- but it's just done it again! How the **** do I stop this from happening?

            Hi, JoeBooth2
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor. I hope it helps. 
<br />
<br />The following command will do a full scan of the protected system files on your computer and fix any file that are causing issues while Windows 10 is up and running. 
<br />1. Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Command Prompt (Admin), as you will need administrator permissions to run SFC. 
<br />2. In the Command Prompt type the following command and press Enter: 
<br />sfc /scannow 
<br />1. Once the scan completes, you will see one of the following messages: 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations:This indicates that your system doesn't have any missing or corrupted files. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation: This message means that there was a problem during the scan and an offline scan is required. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: You will get this message when SFC was able to fix the problem. Now, you can move on or you can view the logs to get more details. 
<br />o Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log: In this case, you'll need to repair the corrupted files manually. 
<br />Quick Tip: You may want to run the command around three times to fix all the problems. 
<br />
<br />Please see this great 3rd party link for a complete step-by-step guide

<p>ok your problem is your computer or xbox is giving a bogus IP address: 192.168.0.110 when this happens try this:</p>
<p>try clearing your system cash &nbsp;if that dont work do this:</p>
<p>ok can any of your devices connect to the internet? if not do this: un plug your router and re plug your router to see if it gets a valid IP address you can check on your computer to see if it is doing the: 192.168.0.110 address if it is still giving you
 a192.168.0.110 IP address on your xbox and computers you may need to contact your ISP (AT&amp;T, comcast, ect) because there is something wrong with you router.&nbsp; if your other devices can connect then try connecting your xbox directly using cord
</p>
<p>hope this helps:)</p>

<p><br />
This issue may be better supported by Apple since the issue is happening on the Mac. I’ve listed a link below to a similar issue listed in their forums, however it is opposite of your situation via can’t open on Windows Vista from MAC, however I think it still
 may offer some assistance:</p>

    <title>Wrong language in backwards compatibility titles. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blackviolator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong language in backwards compatibility titles.</h2>
                    
<p>First posted the following at&nbsp;<a href="https://xbox.uservoice.com/," target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://xbox.uservoice.com/,</a>&nbsp;but was told to go here. &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>All the backwards compatibility titles I have testet have been running in the wrong language.</p>
<p>My Xbox One regional settings are set to Danish.</p>
<p>The titles I have testet are playing in german:&nbsp;<br />
(Denmark is NOT Germany! :))</p>
<p>Hexic&nbsp;<br />
Toy Soldiers&nbsp;<br />
Shadow Complex&nbsp;<br />
N+&nbsp;<br />
Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved&nbsp;<br />
Battleblock Theater&nbsp;<br />
A World of Keflings</p>
<p>It's not only only the game that's running in german language, it's the entire virtual Xbox 360 machine.</p>
<p>Titles like Banjo Kazooie and Banjo Tooie was also running in german language. This was fixed in Rare Replay, so the titles are now running in English language.</p>
<p>Also: The recent released backwards version of Gears of War are running in correct language. (Also the virtual machine part of the game)</p>
<p>Suggestion: Fix all current and future backwards compatibility titles, to run in the correct language. Like they do on a real Xbox 360!</p>

</p><p>I suppose this is supposed to be a surround-sound speaker setup.</p>

</p>
<p>There are quick setup guides and a support page for your model, so I'd look here first:

<p>As far as connecting it to the Xbox, this is how it usually goes:</p>
<p>- <em><strong>If you have an optical cable</strong></em>, you can use that as a direct audio connection between the Xbox One and the Sony DAV receiver. Your Xbox One has an optical port for audio. You will need to set the output to "Optical" on your Sony receiver whenever you want to output audio from your Xbox.</p>
<p>- <em><strong>If you are just getting the sound from HDMI</strong></em>, you will need to plug the Sony DAV receiver to your TV (via RCA or other supported methods), adjust your TV's options so it's not using its built-in speakers anymore, and finally your audio should pass through the Xbox, then the TV, then your Sony speakers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is an Xbox support article detailing about setting up your console with a home theater system:
