<h2>            Task Manager&#58; External USB SATA Disk - 100&#37; Active Time, Suddenly No Disk Transfer, Disconnects&#47;Reconnects Self</h2>
                    <p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/84be589f-b7df-4cce-8c9d-60f60dd1a027" /><br />
As you can see from the Task Manager depiction of the situation above and as the subject the Task Manager shows the status of the SATA disk in a USB Enclosure having problems. Typically when space is running low (and let's all be honest, a good number of us
 go through that,) this will happen. It really doesn't matter what sort of filesystem transaction it is performing, but this can happen and, for my case, it&nbsp;<em>is</em> happening and it is becoming problematic because that hinders me from being able to complete
 my work (and, in this particular case, my fun during downtime.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>In full detail, this situation involves quite a large pre-allocated update performed by the
<a href="http://www.SteamPowered.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Steam">Steam Client</a>. The update is approximately 538MB in size and it is not atypical for the client to perform a pre-allocation prior to its actual download of the update. Within the first second of the updating,
 you can see that the disk is beginning its writing transactions. However, the disk, shortly afterwards, ends any reading and writing transactions. Task Manager reports that the disk is still acting 100% and the Steam Client will stop responding because it
 couldn't get its action done.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After a few moments, the device disconnect and device reconnect system sounds play, indicating that the disk has been unmounted and mounted yet again. This is often followed by messages of suggested disk checkups (and doing so would be a quick, canned answer
 of "it fixed your filesystem, no files were damaged" and, after investigation, indeed no files were damaged.) Re-attempt of the previously noted transactions will inevitably produce the same results.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It has been observed for the past&nbsp;¾ year that these instances occur mostly during write operations and very rarely (if even at all) occur to read operations. The following workarounds have been attempted with no avail at completely eliminating the issue:</p>
<ul>
<li>Formatting Disk from NTFS to FAT32; then</li><li>Formatting Disk from FAT32 to ExFAT</li><li>Performing large single-file transaction write and delete (Also known as "Secure Erasure")</li></ul>
<p>Even with routine maintenance (including keeping the system up-to-date and clean of malware and other malicious software/elements) to the host system, this issue still persists. Different devices, including various other desktops, laptops, servers and those
 of different Operating Systems have experienced such issues.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My hands are completely tied. The only other aspects of the entire situation that I could assess is the Hard Disk Enclosure itself for any damages, its intermediates (USB connection), my USB 3.0 Port (very highly unlikely) or the other hardware within the USB
 Hard Disk enclosure. However, before I jump to conclusions and make a rash decision when I can make many different decisions with a "semi-healthy" hard disk now, I would like to receive the assistance from this message board.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What could be the problem and what could I do to get this issue mitigated so that I don't have to move everything to another disk and further increase my downtime (from productivity, that is.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, in advance, to the community for the assistance to possibly be provided.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>As you have already tried format but still the issue persists, it seems to be a hard disk issue. I would suggest you to check the issue with another hard disk.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists you may also try to contact the manufacturer.</span></p>

<h2>            Programs are unable to connect to the internet, yet Internet Explorer is connected and working fine</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently unable to connect certain programs to the internet. I can't register my product code for Microsoft Office, I am unable to connect to the online portions of ANY game I have on my PC, Steam was working fine, but is now completely unable to connect
 to the internet. Usually, I receive an error code for these along the lines of: "Program was unable to connect to the internet. Please connect/check your network settings."<br />
<br />
This is extremely aggravating, as I know I'm connected to the internet. Otherwise I would not have been able to post this complaint.</p>

            Same issue here. The workaround was to uninstall Skype and switch to "Skype Lite". The unreleased version that's in the Play Store? It states that it may be unstable as it's in development. Messaging works, but I've yet to try calls.&nbsp;

            Hi Andy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you all possible fixes for Sleep, based on ten years troubleshooting it almost daily.  If you need help performing any step just ask back:
<br />
<br />First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>.  
<br />
<br />You might want to try Hibernate to succeed Sleep, or use Hibernate in place of Sleep - it's just a deeper sleep that actually powers off because desktop stored in RAM during sleep is written to hard drive hiberfile then powered off.  
<br />
<br />Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag.  While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager&gt;Display adapter&gt;Driver&gt;Update Driver&gt;Browse&gt;Let me pick.  
<br />
<br />In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:  <a href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sleep-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/fix-windows-10-sle...</a>
<br />
<br />What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.  
<br /> 
<br />Also did it previously work?  Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>I have tried everything short of a reset. I do not want to reset because I have music software that requires deauthorizing and reauthorizing in order to not lose my expensive right to a copy of it and I have tons of games and gaming mouse software with tons
 of tedious tuning settings. I am also skeptical that all my user created files will be spared, some of which exist in the apps folders themselves, which I think will be deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I must reset, I see I cannot copy and paste my list of apps, to email to myself. How can I get this list onto another device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a chance Microsoft will fix this from their end like Apple would? I have been told no.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Joel</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delayed response but Joel's response reminded me about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I'll say I'm not new to Windows (10 definitely not my first) - since then, display drivers have never been the issue. That's not to say it can't be but I also update those drivers regularly enough using OEM drivers that it's highly unlikely it would
 be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also not the first time I had this problem - previously I had an issue where my PC would crash going to sleep...this happened for several months and the only thing that changed in those months that addressed the issue were Windows updates. No idea
 what was the actual update but nonetheless it was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then comes along 1903 and now sleep is not working again. Could be either Windows or the drivers that it's installing I don't know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I do know is that I would at the very least get information form powercfg to let me know what is preventing my PC from going to sleep. Typically this has always been the sound card for me. If you search online, checking powercfg and disabling Realtek
 audio drivers using powercfg is always paired together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Sleep set to occur after 45 mins.&nbsp; I also can sleep my PC and it will not wake unless there is some task that wakes my PC (like some backing up that I do automatically over night) which at that point it won't go back to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all I want to know is why powercfg would show no helpful information...<br />

    <title>Can&#39;t get USB - IEEE1284 &#40;LPT&#41; Adapter&#47;Printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david smith 155  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t get USB - IEEE1284 &#40;LPT&#41; Adapter&#47;Printer installed in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>I have recently&nbsp;purchased a Windows 8 PC.&nbsp; I have a printer&nbsp;(HP DesignJet 220)&nbsp;with LPT only port.&nbsp; I have located and installed the 64 bit printer driver for this printer&nbsp;successfully and&nbsp;the printer device (DesignJet 220)&nbsp;shows up in my printer list.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 (Note that I have an HP 1055 All-In-One connected by USB to this computer and it is working fine.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have purchased and installed a USB to IEEE 1284 adapter cable and Windows 8&nbsp;recognizes the adapter (automatically, without having to load any driver).&nbsp; Problem - When I set the printer port in the printer device window&nbsp;to USB003 virtual printing port,
 per all&nbsp;the instructions I have read&nbsp;- nothing happens.&nbsp; I have tried every USB port and every&nbsp;LPT port shown in the list.&nbsp; Sometimes I print a test page and get an error that&nbsp;the printer is out of paper (it&nbsp;isn't), and sometimes&nbsp;the printer test page goes
 nowhere - just stays in the print queue.&nbsp;&nbsp; The 'Enable Bidirectional Support' feature is greyed out, so I can't activate it (it is shown as unchecked).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IEEE-1284 device says no printer is attached.&nbsp; When I try to change the printer driver in the IEEE-1284 device window, it simply tells me that the driver is up-to-date for the device attached (which it thinks is 'none').&nbsp; The printer is turned on and
 ready to print.&nbsp;&nbsp; At no time has the printer indicated that it has recieved any data (on this model there is a flashing indicator on the control panel when data is being transmitted).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I unplug the USB plug (on the&nbsp;Adapter Cable)&nbsp;from the computer, it is immediately recognized in the Device Window and the IEEE-1284 device is removed in the Devices window.&nbsp; If I leave the USB plug in, and unplug the Centronics connector at the printer,
 nothing happens.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do get the Printer device to connect to the USB virtual printer port?&nbsp; Alternatively, is the problem in the IEEE-1284 device and how do I get it to recognize the printer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            The problem isn't the driver. &nbsp;The problem is the interface. &nbsp;Eight doesn't seem to work with most LPT drivers. &nbsp;I've tried two so far. &nbsp;What's more these interfaces are so old that most manufacturers stopped providing drivers after Vista. &nbsp;I've tried
 an interface card (no luck) then a USB to LPT converter. &nbsp;Eight failed to recognize either one. &nbsp;I think the more accurate question is if windows 8 supports parallel interfaces.

<h2>            Unable to install a working IEEE1394 host control driver in Windows 10 version 1803</h2>
                    <p><span>The latest "upgrade" of Windows 10 to version 1803 forced an update of our FireWire driver to a version incompatible with our sound mixer board.&nbsp;</span><span>The KB2970191 patch no longer
 works to replace the "updated" 1394 driver installed during the&nbsp; upgrade with the Legacy driver required by our mixer board.&nbsp;</span><span>The "updated" driver yields a BSOD state as soon as the FireWire card connects to the
 mixer. Successful re-boots after disconnecting the mixer board.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When attempting to manually install a working legacy driver using Device Manager, the installer tells me that "the best driver is already installed." When I click "uninstall device," it does not give me the option to
 delete the drivers so I can force installation of the legacy driver. The "Roll back driver" option is unavailable. The only solution so far is to fall back to version 1709, which I have done 3 times, now.</span></p>
<p><span>When can we expect a fix to this problem?</span></p>

            We are volunteers willing to help you try to resolve this issue. I am Rob, a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting.
<br />
<br />Ensuring you have the latest BIOS, chipset drivers, and Bluetooth drivers from the System/Motherboard Maker is usually the key. 
<br />
<br />Check these :
<br />
<br />Start - Settings - Update &amp; Security - Troubleshoot - "Bluetooth" and "Hardware and Devices" troubleshooters. 
<br />
<br />Check with your System/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.
<br />
<br />Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect the Bluetooth operation.
<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Good idea to update all the major drivers : 
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name. 
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more. 
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a> 
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack. 
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have. 
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.) 
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation. 
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed. 
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model. 
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Was it working fine before? If so, do you remember making any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p>Disable all sound enhancements and then check if the issue persist. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Sound by clicking the <b>
Start </b>button , and then clicking <b>Control Panel</b>. In the search box, type<b> sound</b>, and then click
<b>Sound</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the <b>Playback</b> tab, click
<b>Speakers</b>, and then click <b>Properties</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the <b>Enhancements</b> tab, and then select the
<b>Disable all enhancements</b> check box.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>If you don't see an <b>
Enhancements</b> tab in the <b>Speakers Properties</b> dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>Check to see if your headphones are set to be used as the default *Communication* device instead of the default device, or if both devices are set to default.
 If so, make the headphones default, so that Windows will use them only when they are plugged in follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on the speaker icon in taskbar and select volume control options.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Put a check mark on "All devices currently playing sound".</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Make sure you have "The default communication device unchecked".</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Place a check mark on both speakers and headphones.</p>
<p>Also follow the steps in the following link:</p>

<p>It does not matter which partition you install Windows 7 on. Example: Windows 7 could be installed on the 5th and last partition on your hard drive and when viewed from another operating system such as Windows XP that partition could be G:, however when
 you boot to Windows 7 the partition letter will always be C:</p>

<div>Hi, Glenn.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When we boot from the DVD to install Windows 7 (or Vista), Setup has no idea what drive letters are already assigned, so it starts from scratch and assigns the letter C: to whichever volume (either a primary partition or a logical drive in an extended
 partition) you choose for the installation.&nbsp; As J. W. said, this can be any volume on any HDD in your computer at the time.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If we already have a version of Windows, such as Windows XP, installed on the computer, we can boot into that OS and assign the drive letters that we want to each existing volume.&nbsp; For example, we can assign the letter D: to the third volume on the second
 HDD.&nbsp; Then we insert the DVD into the drive and run Win7�??s Setup.exe from the WinXP desktop.&nbsp; In this way, Setup can see the letters that WinXP has already assigned and respect those.&nbsp; When it asks where you want to install Win7, point it to Drive D:.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Note that, no matter which volume we choose to install Windows, the few startup files (bootmgr and the \Boot folder) will always go into the System Partition on whichever HDD is designated in the BIOS as the boot device at the time we run Setup.&nbsp; For information
 on which volume is which, run Disk Management (diskmgmt.msc).&nbsp; Expand the Status column and pay particular attention to which volumes have the System and Boot designations.&nbsp; It helps to give each volume a name (a �??label�?�), which will be written to the
 disk and will not change when we boot into a different OS.&nbsp; Using Disk Management, we can change any drive letters that we want EXCEPT for the System and Boot volumes.&nbsp; The only way we can change those is to run Setup again �?? in other words, to re-install
 Windows.</div>

            Hi MoellDa,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope you are doing well.<br />
<br />
Windows Parental Controls allows a parent to configure, on a per user basis, various restrictions on what that user can do on the computer. These settings range from blocking websites to controlling what games they can play. Having access to these types of
 controls allows a parent to feel comfortable with their children using a computer and at the same time gives them the flexibility to customize these settings to their specific needs.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence https websites will be blocked or disabled if the Parental Controls is turned on.<br />
<br />
In order to customize Vista Parental Controls you need to log onto to your computer using an account that is an administrator. Once you logged in, please refer the below links for the steps and more information:<br />

<p>Just looked at the log for the recent Malicious Software Removal Tool and see a lot of 'exceptions' which scares us a lot. We have an XP computer and believe the D drive is a "Recovery Partition" and cannot be infected.</p>
<p>But the 11 exceptions show //D:\autorun.inf</p>
<p>which some postings on the Internet say refer to an virus/infection, etc.</p>
<p>Is my computer infected? Can someone please let us know because, as I said, we are really worried.</p>
<p>Please advise and thank you.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The log says that the scan could not run due to some security policy.</span><span>Probably
 there is no permission to access the D drive; hence it’s giving this error.</span></p>
<p><span>You can ignore the error message as it says no infection found.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are still worried, you may try running a virus scan using a different software.</span></p>
<p><span>You can use Microsoft security essentials. It can be downloaded from&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/</a></span></p>

<p><span>Has anyone ran into issues where the adapter is set up fine but will never find a network? I can boot to XP and
 connect to a network no problems. However, when I boot to Win 7 it never finds a network in range. I've even gone in to the same room as the wireless router and still no luck. I reinstalled the wireless drivers and that did not help either. Any suggestions?<br />

<p>If in CCC you go to Desktop &amp; Displays and then clcik on Detect Displays, what happens?</p>
<p>If that doesn't work I would download latest CCC, uninstall old CCC then install new CCC.</p>
<p>Does your undetected monitor need a specific rather than PnP generic driver? If so, download and install that too.</p>

<h3> mevl  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History won&#39;t run</h2>
                    <p>I don't really get an error message. &nbsp;It just tells me it is saving files for the first time. &nbsp;After a minute that message disappears and it says Run now. &nbsp;If I click on Run Now this cycle repeats. &nbsp;If I try things under Advanced like Clean Up versions I
 get this error: You have apps open that are using File History. &nbsp;Close the File History and Disk Cleanup apps, and then try again. &nbsp;I've looked at Task Manager and nothing is open.</p>
<p>If I open File History Event logs I see an error list going back to Dec 2015 with hundreds of errors that say File History-Core and Event ID 200. &nbsp;The Log says:&nbsp;Unable to start a backup cycle for configuration C:\Users\test\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory\Configuration\Config</p>
<p>
</p><p>6 Months ago when I had a problem a Microsoft tech (over the phone) made me move all my files into a new folder called test. &nbsp;I'm wondering if that's when this problem started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been able to run the Windows 7 Backup and System Image - I think, but even it gives errors and seems to always start a new backup instead of incremental, so I unplugged that External HD and bought another one that I want to use for File History. &nbsp;There's
 no trouble finding or choosing this HD.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before proceeding any further, let us know a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue? Is it an abrupt issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<p>Follow the below methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Now, <strong>Volume Shadow Copy service </strong>and <strong>Windows backup service
</strong>are the two essential services required to perform Windows backup. Apart from these essential services, there are dependency services such as
<strong>Remote Procedure Call</strong> which are required to run Windows backup utility. To do so, follow the below steps.</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp;Go to start and type <em>services.msc</em> in the search field and select the first search result.<br />
2.&nbsp;Locate the two services.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right-Click on the service one at a time.<br />
4.&nbsp;Select properties.<br />
5.&nbsp;Go to Dependencies Tab.<br />
6.&nbsp;Note the dependency services.<br />
7.&nbsp;Make sure they’re also running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it still does not help please follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to turn off the System Protection and then turn it back on and then check if the backup is successful this time.. Follow the below steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Right-click the&nbsp;Start Menu&nbsp;and open <strong>System</strong> in the Quick Access Menu and select
<strong>System protection</strong> on the left.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Choose&nbsp;the location or the drive&nbsp;and click <strong>Configure</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Select <strong>Disable system protection</strong> and hit
<strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Choose <strong>Yes</strong> to have system protection disabled.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Re-boot, and go through the process to turn the system protection back on. After you've selected OK, try your back up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>Try to place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party application/software to be causing the issue.
</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help and sorry for the delay. &nbsp;I have followed all the above instructions twice but I still have this problem. &nbsp;I also notice that I cannot access File History Options. &nbsp;It looks like it is running with small dots flying across the
 top of the window, but then it abruptly closes and I am not even in File History anymore. &nbsp;The only way to access the File History is going through the Windows 7 Back up option and clicking on File History at the bottom left. &nbsp;But it still tries to run for
 the first time and then goes back to run and when clicked tries to run for the first time in a never ending cycle. &nbsp;To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue? Is it an abrupt issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>This issue has been going on for more than six months. &nbsp;I can't tell if it was an abrupt issue since I thought File History was nicely working when in fact it was not.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
</p></li><li>
<p><span>Do have any System Restore point set in Windows prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>No. &nbsp;I'd have to go back a very long way and I don't know when the issue really started.</span><br />

            <p>I read about the sfc /scannow while I was trying to solve this and ran it a few times but it never found any errors. &nbsp;I found some helpful advice on another thread that involved stopping File History, &nbsp;renaming the \FileHistory\Configuration folder and starting
 fhsvc again. &nbsp;It didn't work exactly as followed, but did start working when I allowed it to make a new Configuration folder, so I left it at that. &nbsp;Now I have to figure out how to reverse the Clean boot because I think everything is still stopped. &nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s not recommended to change the settings for such kind of issue. This is designed in such a way to keep the display property as per the end users.</p>

<h2>            Here&#38;&#35;39&#59;s how Microsoft and Sony could monetise from having mod tools for games on consoles</h2>
                    
<p>By making it a premium feature, so for Xbox, only Xbox LIVE Gold members would have access and for PlayStation thus far PlayStation Plus members.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">-</span></p>
<p>On PC it's free to mod games, but on consoles you can't instead you have map packs, but at least if they thought about it this way we'd have mod tools for console games.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">-</span></p>
<p>Of course neither of them can continue to ignore mods they're what make PC games have infinite replay value.</p>

Modding ruins so many good games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p><br />
modding in the PC world is different than console world. mods are one of the only real perks of gaming on pc. you are probably thinking of console mods, which are basically cheats to get unfair advantages.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>on PC, mods are user made maps, game modes, total conversion mods... basically, expansion packs made by people in the community in put out to the public for free. GTA 4 for example has mods that make the game look much better than the standard game. there
 are mods for skyrim that allow nudity, better graphics, and add quests, heck there was a mod that turned dragons into my little pony's</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Modding could come to console, it is possible, but it probably would never happen because DLC would be almost useless.</p>

    <title>Finding location of Desktop Background Slideshow Folder - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Finding location of Desktop Background Slideshow Folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I can't find the folder that I've selected to be used as the source for the Desktop Background slideshow. I know it still exists because the pictures continue to cycle through. I can't find it either by looking in my Pictures file or by browsing when
 I browse for an album in the select Desktop Background page. However, it clearly shows that as of right now I have the folder selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find this folder? Even by searching in the search bar nothing appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moved from: Windows / Windows 10 / Desktop, Start, &amp; personalization / Desktop</p>

<p>Hi Tristan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the possible reason why you're unable to locate the folder set for your desktop background is due to the folder being hidden. We recommend that you check the folder options if it's configure correctly. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>File Explorer</strong> &gt; Click the <strong>View</strong> tab.</li><li>Select <strong>Options</strong> &gt; Choose <strong>Change folder and search options</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>View</strong> tab &gt; Under <strong>Hidden files and folders</strong> select
<strong>Show hidden files, folders, and drives</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> then <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may also go to <strong>C:\Windows\Web</strong> and check if the folder you're looking for is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated about the status of the issue.</p>

<p>I went to the Hidden files and folders as you said but it was already showing the hidden things. I then went to the Web folder, but it was only the files that came with the computer and not the new ones.</p>

            I can't say I've made any changes, but considering I created and set the folder in mid-August and have only just realized the issue in late-October I can't say absolutely no changes have been made. What kind of changes would cause this issue? I don't believe
 I've installed any major updates to my computer in the time I've had it.

<p>There's a possibility that the folder that you're trying to access has already been moved or deleted. Windows has the capability to retain certain settings configured ever after modifying their source files/folders.</p>

            Try removing the account from the console, doing a hard restart, hold the power button for 10 seconds while the system is on, and then re-adding the account
