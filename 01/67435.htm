<h2>            Computer doesn&#39;t sleep but wakes up from sleep immediately or when using mouse or keyboard, computer goes to sleep and wakes immediately</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
There are actually two sleep issues, or so it seems.<br />
<br />
Often, when making the computer sleep or when the programmed time to sleep comes up, the computer prepares itself to sleep, starts sleeping (the light flickers once) and awakes back immediately. This is very often,happening about half of the times, either when
 I press the sleep button or when the inactive time comes up to sleep.<br />
<br />
The other issue is very strange. When I am using it with either the mouse or the keyboard or just looking at the screen, it goes into sleep by itself, and just as in the case above it can stay asleep or awake right back.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have not changed any power settings for months, but the second issue started a little over one week ago and has become every day more frequent. It can be normal for hours, or repeat the cycle every few minutes or seconds. When this happens it is impossible
 to do anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
I searched on Event Viewer and found three events that are always the same making it awake:<br />
Power Button<br />
USB Root Hub<br />
USB Composite Device<br />
<br />
No need to look for the first event, because it is when I wake it up myself. However I can't know what originates the other two, which must be the real issue origin. There are many, many, so I can see sometimes one is more frequent, some other times is the
 other one. There is only one "Unknown" result among lots and lots of the two last ones, so maybe we can skip it.<br />
The problem to be sure about the source is that my computer has two USB Composite Devices and seven USB Root Hubs. That is probably why there are many more issues from second.<br />
<br />
With the Lastwake Command In the command prompt I found the Instance Path for one of the USB Composite Devices. From there I found which one, but that is all, and I can't go any further. USB Root Hubs do not have an Instance Path.<br />
<br />
Then, I changed power settings from my long time working Custom to Power saver, living the original settings untouched. I rebooted and the same story again (no changes, no need to repeat). Then, I changed back to my Custom plan, which is based on Power saver,
 only with shorter times, respecting the necessary delays between each and rebooted again. Nothing changed.<br />
<br />
On USB I have a Bluetooth receiver for phone synchronization (model Trust 15542-02) plus the Logitech v550 Nano mouse receiver, that's all. I unplugged the Bluetooth receiver, but nothing changed. In Device Manager, the USB Root Hubs are not allowed to wake
 up the computer in their Power Management tabs.<br />
<br />
What can I do to correct these two issues, please?<br />

            Wireless mice are infamous for waking up computers. Other than that, you can play with the wake settings in Device Manager.

            Hi MakerDusk, thanks for writing something, but you are not giving me anything concrete or usefu helpl as I usually receive here. I have this mouse for 2 1/2 years and it is not a MS one. The mouse is not set to wake up the computer and NEVER does it.
 Just to try it out and make sure I replaced the mouse with a cable model and nothing changed. If you tell me to
<i>play with the wake settings</i> can only be because you didn't even read what I wrote.<br />
<br />
Any <b>helpful </b>answer, please?<br />

            <p>My apologies, I got tossed on the phones for a bit here at microsoft, as such I only had enough time to get a couple of sentences out, so yes, I know my advice only gave the most generic of starting points, I had hoped to be back within the hour&nbsp;&gt;_&lt;</p>
<p>Have you tried unplugging everything except the mouse and keyboard to see if it still doesn't sleep? Yes, I know it says it's with the USB Root Hub and Composite Device, but lets do this anyways, since it could be a problem with a USB port that burned out.
</p>
<p>It slept? Start adding things in one by one untill you find the device that is keeping the computer awake. It could have been a driver updated, or lack thereof for that device that is causing the issue. If not, it gives us something to change a setting on
 in the device manager.</p>
<p>For the unknown device in there, toss it's hardware ID into <a href="http://www.pcidatabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.pcidatabase.com/</a>&nbsp;find out what it is, get driver.</p>
<p>All this made no difference? Have you tried a clean boot? (going into MS config and disabling everthing but the microsoft services? Does the issue still occur?</p>

            Thank you for coming back. I understand something hold you from really answering.<br />
<br />
For a couple of days now, all I have connected to the computer are the peripherals you say only, but nothing ever changes. From the Event logs I am sure it will be something to do with USB, but I have no idea what, which one or where, and here I do need help.
 Nothing can be done before finding the culprit.<br />
<br />
I can use System Configuration, as you suggest, but didn’t do it yet for a good reason. It can take nearly the whole day without going to sleep by itself or it can go into sleep, awake and back to sleep again just in a minute or a few seconds and repeat this
 cycle for some time, then back to normal. Who knows when this happens? That is what is happening right now and will make me take half an hour or more to finish writing this post. So that, this is a double issue, and this auto sleep-awake-sleep cycle is much
 worse than the other simple issue of just awaking immediately after entering in sleep mode. Here, as I said, it can either stay asleep or awake back immediately, we never know.<br />
<br />
The big problem with the Event logs is that they mention three causes for “The system has resumed from sleep”, but never what sends the computer into sleep. When I disconnect the wireless mouse, only USB Root Hub appears on the events.<br />
<br />
Sorry to be so long, but I believe the better people understand these issues, the easier for anyone to help on solving. For the clean boot, it may take me quite some time to come up to any conclusion, maybe a few days, because of what I described, so please
 keep an eye on this thread because I will be back for sure.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>I shall keep an eye out, and no, there is no quick solution when dealing with such things. You basically have to find what's waking the computer up, and as you've noticed, it can be on the hardware; peripheral; or software end.</p>
<p>Have you tried running command prompt as an admin and running a "sfc /scannow"? If not, that will check your system files for corruption and repair it if it can.
</p>
<p>If it is related to an update or&nbsp;a virus, a system restore from a working date would help.
</p>
<p>Also, there is no such thing as too much information. </p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that windows 7 does come with a 90 day warrentee after activation for support, otherwise it is $99 for us to remote in and fix any problems. If you find yourself at a point where you're getting overly frustrated, keep that
 in mind 1-877-568-2495. If you do go that route, the issue will be fixed with a 30 guarrentee, or we fix it again, or we refund you.&nbsp;(Also, we can escallate as needed with no limits, which can come in handy)</p>
<p>That being said, I will most definately keep on checking in and helping with what I can.</p>

            You are quite right, I have to find what is waking the computer up. I have searched on a way, but all I found was a post on a forum with this<br />
&nbsp;"I can also see a windows event log saying:<br />
The system is entering sleep.<br />
Sleep Reason: Application API"<br />
<br />
I find this very strange because it is exactly what I have been looking for on my Event Viewer logs, but couldn't find even a single one. How can I get this crucial information? This is very important. I am sure it not coming from my old Logitech wireless mouse
 (after 2 1/2 year of use), but it is possible to be from a new one that I recently bought, connected to try, but disconnected and am not using. It could have left some track, but again, I need to read somewhere, something like what I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
The sfc scan with the result: "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."<br />
<br />
It don't think to be a virus because I am well protected and also made a scan after this started about a week ago. I receive lots of malicious e-mails, but I can recognise the tricks, false links, links to infected sites, screen and zipped files, whatever,
 the whole lot. I don't use System Restore because it changes file names, uses a lot of disk space and is very annoying. I use the Windows disk image, not the best but simple and can be used without third party programs. However, I have made a lot of changes
 just before this issue came up, just before making a new image, and am trying no repair it before.<br />
<br />
I started using Win7 just a few months after it was distributed, so the 90 days are long gone. It is not perfect and has some very silly wanted or planned issues,
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/windows-explorer-tree-view-expands-at-the-bottom/fb07b088-bc03-42dc-a8d6-79b360154d7c">
like this one</a>, but I never had big problems and I can handle most of them myself.<br />
<br />
The self sleep issue is absent at the moment, but it can stay like that for many hours or come back at any moment and cycle every few seconds for a long while, and then stop again, or do it just a few times and disappear for a while or hours. Crazy. That how
 it has been. This is what makes System Configuration testing almost impossible. The tests are not possible for this issue. I checked again and have no hardware allowed to wake the computer. I had the keyboard, but set it not to. However it is still self sleeping,
 but it seems not awaking alone.<br />
<br />
Thank you for following up.<br />

            <p>Hello Straydog, <br />
<br />
There is a command line command that will give information about the Power Plans that are enabled on your system.
<br />
<br />
Go to a Command Prompt. Select "Run as Administrator". <br />
Then type, powercfg - devicequery wake_from_any</p>
<p>This command will return all devices that support waking the system from any sleep state.
<br />
<br />
if you type, powercfg /devicequery wake_armed</p>
<p>This will list devices that are currently configured to wake the system from any sleep state.
<br />
<br />
Type powercfg /devicequery all_devices </p>
<p>This command will return all devices present in the system. <br />
<br />
You can also list the command that are available for powercfg<br />
type Powercfg /?<br />
For command specific help, type powercfg /? &lt;command&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps with see what could be waking your system. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sincerely, <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn <br />

            Thank you for your tips, Marilyn. I answered yesterday, but my post disappeared, don't know how or why. I am sorry. I will try to repeat what I wrote.<br />
<br />
I have not answered before because the self sleep cycle had not come back, but it is back again. I never know when it will be back, only that it can be many hours or a day or much less, and when it happens it is as described: sets of self sleeping repeating
 within a few minutes or just a few seconds after awaking.<br />
<br />
Regarding the issue of waking up by itself, please read the three ending sentences on my last post. Using the
<i>powercfg -devicequery wake_armed</i> command it returns this:<br />
<i>Standard PS/2 Keyboard<br />
Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller</i><br />
<br />
The <i>powercfg</i> command has lots of switches, but I couldn't find one to answer my question.<br />
<br />
I believe I can correct the issue if I know where to find the cause. <b>I am convinced that it will be easy to repair
<u>if I know what makes it</u>.</b> Why is it not listed in the Event logs just like the wake? I ignore it, of course, but there must be a way to find that out. What about what I read on a forum and I mentioned above (I searched so many that I can't recall
 where), proving that it must be recorded somewhere. But <b>where</b>? It seems this is all I'll have to know to start trying to solve the self sleeping issue, but without that I am blocked.<br />
<br />
<i>I can also see a windows event log saying:<br />
The system is entering sleep.<br />
Sleep Reason: Application API</i><br />
<br />
Please, help finding what makes the computer go into sleep by itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Edit:</b> I noticed that when it is in a self sleep cycle it goes into sleep faster when I type on the keyboard.<br />

            <p>Hmm, have you ever installed a 3rd party power management tool? A search might be best in case it snuck in. Other than that, have you tried a repair install? Such would leave you files intact, and is pretty much the last thing I can think of here.</p>
<p>For the waking, I'm thinking more and more that it's the hardware to blame. If it was me, I'd break out the probe and start testing. It could be a cap or a solder joint&nbsp;that's going. Check to the connections to the mobo, maybe use some fine steel wool to
 rule out corroded connections.</p>

            <p>(updated 12/14/12)</p>
<p>We have identified a problem where some users can’t sign into Windows 8 with a Microsoft account.</p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b>Symptoms:</b></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>You get an error that your password is incorrect when signing in on a PC running Windows 8.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>On a different PC, you can successfully sign in to sites such as account.live.com using the same email address and password.</p>
<p>There are two possible causes for this issue.</p>
<p><b><br />
Keyboard Language Layout changed</b></p>
<p>PCs configured to support more than one language will display the current keyboard language layout in the lower-right portion of the sign-in screen, directly to the left of the power icon.<span>&nbsp;
</span>For example, EN is displayed for English.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If you see a language option, make sure you’re entering your password with the correct language characters.</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>If this doesn’t fix the problem or you don’t see a language indicator, continue reading.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Webroot Software</b></p>
<p>Webroot antivirus software prior to version <b>8.0.2.79</b> mistakenly removes core Windows 8 operating system registry entries required for Microsoft account sign in.<span>&nbsp; If you are running&nbsp;a version of
</span>Webroot prior to 8.0.2.79, you should update immediately.</p>
<p><br />
For updated information from Webroot, please visit <a href="http://www5.nohold.net/Webroot/Loginr.aspx?login=1&amp;app=vw&amp;solutionid=1397" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www5.nohold.net/Webroot/Loginr.aspx?login=1&amp;app=vw&amp;solutionid=1397</a> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here are&nbsp;several options to get back into Windows 8.<span>&nbsp; </span>We recommend you try these in the order presented.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Options</b></p>
<p>If you are able to sign into your computer using a local account, do so and update your Webroot software to the latest version.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>After rebooting, you should be able to sign in with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you only sign into your computer with Microsoft accounts, and they all return the ‘password is incorrect’ error, you will need to reset or restore your computer to a point prior to Webroot being installed in order to sign in to update Webroot.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>To Restore or Refresh your Computer</b></p>
<p>Locate the power menu on the Windows 8 sign-in screen.<span>&nbsp; </span>While holding down the “Shift” key, select “Restart”.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will put your PC into System Recovery.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b><span>&nbsp; </span>If you’re prompted for a password, enter the password that you used the last time you successfully signed in to your PC.</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Option 1: System Restore.<span>&nbsp; </span></b><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This option will allow you to roll your PC back to a working restore point.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any system changes made since that restore point will be lost.</p>
<ol>
<li>From the System Recovery screen, select <b>Advanced Options</b>.</li><li>Select <b>System Restore</b>. Your PC will restart and prepare the System Restore experience.</li><li>Choose an account name to continue and enter the last good password used on the PC.</li><li>In the System Restore window, click <b>Next</b> and select the <b>Show more restore points</b> check box.</li><li>If one is shown, select a restore point at or before the Webroot installation and follow the prompts to complete the system restore.</li><li>When returned to the sign-in screen, if you still can’t sign in, perform the same steps and select an earlier restore point until you are able to sign in.</li><li>Once signed in, we recommend you uninstall Webroot until Webroot has shipped an update to address this problem.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do not have any system restore points, you will need to do a system Refresh.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This will restore all Windows 8 operating system files, and also backup your files and folders.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Any programs installed will need to be reinstalled.<span>&nbsp; </span>This process requires you provide the original Windows 8 media that came with your computer, as well as any media you used to install other programs.
</p>
<p><b>Option 2: System Refresh.<span>&nbsp; </span></b>This option will restore key system files.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It will uninstall any third- party applications, but won’t affect personal settings and files.</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>From the System Recovery screen, select Refresh. You’ll see a screen that explains what actions will occur.</p>
<p>Your PC will restart and a refresh will occur. When this is completed, there will be a file saved on your desktop with a list of programs that were uninstalled.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Don’t reinstall Webroot until an update to fix this problem is released, but feel free to reinstall any other programs on the list.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Sign in with the same password you used to start the refresh process.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Once you’ve signed in, if you have changed your password online you’ll be prompted to enter that new password once Windows 8 fully loads.</p>

    <title>edge crash with facebook - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lando801  say:</h3>
<h2>            edge crash with facebook</h2>
                    There are no comments shown on facebook posts. Everytime you try to comment it just causes Edge to crash. If I click go to IE it works just fine. This renders Edge useless. Anyone with on ideas of fixing this? I have cleared all cache, cookies, ect. and
 tried restarting the PC several times. Any help would be appreciated as this browser looks like it has alot of potential but at the moment Edge is the same as IE Just to download another browser.

<p>(<strong>EDITED 1-Hour later</strong>:&nbsp;Just had a thought...&nbsp; maybe PAGEFILE and HIBERFIL de-sync from patch/update?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also crashes your beloved 'EDGE' browser!&nbsp; (OPINIONS/THEORIES AT END)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was running a 2-year old install of W10... worked perfectly until roughly; 2-weeks ago.&nbsp; Naturally; since I hadn't done a fresh install since Feb 2015, I figured it was my numerous previous configurations.&nbsp; I downloaded the newest available release before
 the 'Creator's Release' and the problem stayed the same!&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thinking it was just loose ends, I made the huge mistake of installing and trying the app!&nbsp; This ended in a very disappointed review in the Store!&nbsp; The app, as soon as I would execute the link?&nbsp; Clogs all Four of my AMD-cores/threads at 100%, runs Disk-0 I/O
 to 100%, instantly allocates a half GB and rises quickly to 1GB RAM without stopping... to top it off;&nbsp;while in the background, my network packet rejection (not loss) races to 90%!&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Since my old install was working much better than my current one; I would assume it's Facebook with a serious memory-leak or they're causing a fatal-error with their credentials - MY REASONING:&nbsp; I can't view or edit my own FB page with EDGE...&nbsp; I can browse,
 comment, upload, etc. flawlessly on other people's FB pages&nbsp;with EDGE...&nbsp; I cannot accomplish anything with their app, except; Edit/View my own FB page!&nbsp; Any other activity in that app is exceeding 20-second lag delay when I type; don't even try to load someone's
 Photo Album!<br />

<p>I do agree the problem is a market-wide flaw... I do not believe it's&nbsp;on&nbsp;MS's side!&nbsp;&nbsp;I can watch YouTube, Netflix and stream from OneDrive simultaneously without any noticeable issues!&nbsp; My processor&nbsp;stays below 32%&nbsp;across all four cores.&nbsp; But anything related
 to Facebook or crap-sites with suspect certificates seem to get treated the same way...&nbsp;Hell; I just compiled a game from EPIC GAMES @ 5GB&nbsp;faster than the FB app could process a paragraph of plain-text!<br />
</p>
<p>P.S. - Bug-tracking&nbsp;is fun. &nbsp;MS keeps me busy but; don't complain about the hasty release of EDGE...&nbsp; If you do, you really have no clue how vulnerable&nbsp;IE had become.&nbsp; It was written/re-written across so many programming languages, most of which went away;
 never&nbsp;being secured against deprecated or obscure&nbsp;uses of 'antique' languages!</p>

                    When I try to open an .mpg file I receive the following: Windows Media Player cannot play the file.&nbsp; The player does not support the format you are trying to play.&nbsp; I just had my hard drive reformatted by a computer tech so perhaps that is the problem
 as I didn't have this problem before.&nbsp; When I click on Web Help it says most of the time the problem is having to do with CODEC &amp; that leaves me completely in the dark.&nbsp; It does show under programs that Windows Media Player is installed.&nbsp; So now what do I
 do?

            Hi.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC. During the analysis carried out by SFC on the files of the system, it will check the versions of each one of them and in case it finds one that has been overwritten or is damaged, the tool itself will proceed to recover a good version of that file to replace it. It is a tool based on the command prompt that offers several commands to perform these tasks of file analysis and recovery.
<br />
<br />Check this link, it is to run (Scannow and Dism) that are used to repair Windows system files.
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            Hi anwwi 
<br />
<br />Don't bother with sfc - RtlLib.dll is not s system file, that is belonging to a Realtek device driver
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your device on the manufactures website
<br />
<br />Check there for a Realtek device driver - usually an Audio or Network device, maybe both
<br />
<br />Download and install that Realtek device driver(s), that should resolve this error for you . . .

<h2>            Right click and download folder doesn&#39;t work.</h2>
                    <p>Dear community,</p>
<p>I have these problems recently. I have tried several solutions, but none of them could solve the problems once and for all. I have the following issues:</p>
<p>- right click doesn't open the sub-menu as I click somewhere in a folder and then the folder crashes. Also when I try to right-click an icon on the desktop, windows makes these crash-like thing (the whole screen goes grey etc.)</p>
<p>-download folder takes ages to load, but it doesn't do anything eventually</p>
<p>It seems that I have have these problems at the same time. I usually try to restart the computer, which fixes it, but sometimes restarting takes a while, and I force shutdown the system by clicking for long enough the power button.</p>
<p>Please help me out of this situation.</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>I tried to solve these problems separately. For the clicking problem I downloaded ShellExView and disabled the programs marked with red color.</p>
<p>The download folder problem was before I had the clicking problem. I have been reading some forums and one of them mentioned that some files of Autodesk Inventor may cause the problem, so I simply uninstalled it, and it seemed that it worked out.</p>
<p>I recently installed Asus Smart Gesture, which is a driver for the touch pad, and somehow it disappeared.</p>
<p>I also reinstalled the driver of the wireless connection and the speakers' driver.</p>
<p>I may have done some other changes which I don't remember right now.</p>

            Hi Jeff, this is caused by a keyboard language issue in a Windows Update . . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Paste this commend into Powershell and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the " symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a UK English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Paste this commend into Powershell and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-GB 
<br />
<br />
<br />Then, Paste this commend into Powershell and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC 
<br />
<br />That's It!

<br />
<br />Please try this workaround to set your preferred input language: 
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If the @ symbol on your keyboard is above the 2, you have a US English Keyboard 
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-US

<br />
<br />
<br />Paste this command and hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC

<p>Thank you for keeping us posted. Since you've already performed the troubleshooting steps stated on the steps suggested on the article we provided on the previous post, this would only mean that there could be either a possible corrupted file on one of your
 drivers or your programs that triggers the <strong>Blue/Black Screen of Death</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, we've reviewed the dump file you've provided us. Both logs are pointing to a
<strong>3rd party file/computer sharing program</strong> installed on your computer that's causing the problem. It is best advised to have that program installed with the latest update from their support website or ran on compatibility mode and in case that
 you seldom use the program, best to have it uninstalled if it's not being used. If you still use that program, then it would be best to contact the support team of the
<strong>3rd party file/computer sharing program</strong> that you use if you've already performed the said steps. This is so you'll be provided with further troubleshooting if the need arises.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>NOTE: Be advised that before you uninstall program and files on your computer to ensure that a
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027538/windows-create-a-system-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore</a></strong></em><strong>

            We appreciate the update. Upon checking the most recent logs you've provided, it shows that the faulting module is related to the system service
<strong>hecix64</strong>. And as for cross-referencing this to the system information you've included, this is related to your computer's
<strong>Intel (R) Management Engine Interface</strong>. What we advise you to perform at this point is to get the latest drivers and firmware update from Intel by downloading it from their website.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, then it would be best to contact your <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer</a></strong>). This
 is to ensure that your computer's hardware integrity would be diagnosed and be provided with the most appropriate actions in getting you up and running.<br />

<span>"To resolve the issue, perform the following:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Go to Windows registry.</span><br />
<span>Navigate to the following registry key:</span><br />

<span>Exit the Registry Editor, and restart Windows XP."</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>what i did was export that key from a working windows XP install and import the reg file to the failing windows
 if not U can manually create the key and send it to point to the file location if the file is missing then U copy the file don't know if the file differs from Home to Pro but its another option to take if U'r still stuck.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Any way my prob was corruption in reg for missing file the fix as&nbsp;such&nbsp;may not work. if U still have &nbsp;the problem (cause
 the post is old) then good luck</span></div>

<h2>            Update to Windows 10 not activated - Error code&#58; 0xC004F034</h2>
                    <p>I have a desktop PC with a valid copy of Windows 7 Professional on it. &nbsp;I downloaded the Windows 10 upgrade and installed it. &nbsp;Now my PC is not activated and when I try to run the Activate process, it returns the error "Error code: 0xC004F034" saying my
 license could not be found or was invalid. &nbsp; I downloaded the 64-bit install from here: &nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a laptop that had Windows 8.1 on it from the factory. &nbsp;It automatically downloaded Windows 10 overnight so I told it to proceed with the installation this morning when it prompted. &nbsp;It too is not activated and will not activate with the same
 error as above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do a Recovery process but both the desktop and laptop say they cannot go back to the old OS as needed files were deleted (I didn't delete anything after the upgrade).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried entering my valid CD-KEYs using the option to change the product key, but it says they are not valid keys. &nbsp;I guess that means they are not Windows 10 keys which is correct. &nbsp;They are the keys for my Win 7 and Win 8.1 installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I have to "buy" Windows 10 licenses now to get valid keys to activate after this "free" upgrade?</p>

            <p>Same issue here. &nbsp;The only machine that activated of mine was one that was running the Insider Preview. &nbsp;The other machine I'm working on now refuses to activate (I'm guessing they gave us a temporary key- ie. setup key) and that is not working to activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried both Windows 7 and 8.1 product keys, but I'm assuming that the prompts will only accept Windows 10 keys (which Microsoft has not distributed to us).</p>

            Found a possible solution elsewhere on the web. &nbsp;Seems it may be a problem with the MS servers not responding to all the activations. &nbsp;If you simply keep re-clicking Activate as soon as it comes back with the error message, over and over, it may eventually
 (like after 20 - 40 times) activate. &nbsp;Several people in that discussion had success after 30 or 40 consecutive clicks. &nbsp;I did to, after about 25 consecutive attempts. &nbsp;

            Same here.&nbsp; My Dell laptop tells me it is unable to activate.&nbsp; When I ask for help, the message tells me I might have to buy a license.&nbsp; My Dell has a valid, geniune copy of Windows 7 and I understood it could update to Windows 10 for free.&nbsp; The only computer
 that has updated successfully was the little netbook that I used to evaluate the preview versions.&nbsp; So, I am going to have to purchase a license for this free upgrade?<br />

            This is going to sound odd but keep pressing the Activation button without stopping. Should activate in about 15 sec or so that way. Don't wait for it to process or anything, just press it like a mad man is chasing you and you're hitting an elevator button.&nbsp;

<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Malwarebytes is as the name says, a Malware Remover!</span></p>
<p><span>Download the Free Version from the link above.</span></p>
<p><span>Download, install, update and scan once a fortnight..</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to use Malwarebytes after it is installed and Updated:</span></span><span><br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Malwarebytes &gt; Click on the Update Tab&nbsp; across the top&gt; get the latest updates.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;On the <strong><span>Scanner</span></strong> tab, make sure the<strong><span>Perform&nbsp;full scan</span></strong> option is selected and then click on the<strong><span>Scan</span></strong>
 button to start scanning your computer<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;MBAM will now start scanning your computer for malware. This process can take quite a while.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;When the scan is finished a message box will appear<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;You should click on the OK button to close the message box and continue with the Malwareremoval process.</span><span><br />
<br />
6</span><span>.&nbsp;You will now be back at the main Scanner screen. At this point you should click on the<strong><span>Show Results</span></strong> button.</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><span>7.&nbsp;A screen displaying all the malware that the program found will be shown<br />
<br />
8.&nbsp;You should now click on the <strong><span>Remove Selected</span></strong> button to remove all the listed malware. MBAM will now delete all of the files and registry keys and add them to the programs quarantine. When removing
 the files, MBAM may require a reboot in order to remove some of them. If it displays a message stating that it needs to reboot, please allow it to do so. Once your computer has rebooted, and you are logged in, please continue with the rest of the steps.<br />
<br />
9.&nbsp;When MBAM has finished removing the malware, it will open the scan log and display it in Notepad. Review the log as desired, and then close the Notepad window.<br />
<br />
10.&nbsp;You can now exit the MBAM program.</span><span><br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
<br />
If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />
<br />
If&nbsp;you do not have a Microsoft Vista DVD, borrow one from a friend.<br />
<br />
Read this Tutorial on how to do a Repair Install:</span><span><br />

<p>Hey, before you go all crazy doing system restores and all sorts of stuff that most likely won't work AND will most likely screw up your PC, try going here&nbsp;http<a href="http://www.cdspeed2000.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">://www.cdspeed2000.com</a>&nbsp;and downloading&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;"Opti
 Drive Control", it's a free program by NERO for testing your CD/DVD drives. Very good chance that your drive may just be going bad. Does the PC just tell you can't burn a CD, or does it give you a burning failed message? &nbsp;Optical drives are cheap, and most
 are not built to last more than a year or two with normal use. The fact that you can get a brand new CD/DVD burner online for less than 18 USD including tax, shipping and&nbsp;handling is a clue. (search Newegg.com if you don't&nbsp;believe me) I go through a DVD burner
 a year, and I don't really burn that much more stuff than most of my friends.(2 or 3 CD's and DVD's a week)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Either way, your description was&nbsp;vague- &nbsp;what are your specific error messages?&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Please help&#33;  Skype number does not work at all&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I purchased a skype number at $6.5 per month so I can receive US phone calls even when I am abroad. However, it seems that I can not receive any phone call to my skype number.&nbsp; All the phone calls to the skype number would show as "call failed".&nbsp; Also, when
 I tried to call the skype number from google voice, the error message is like this: "Call failed to connect or disconnected because the number was unreachable."&nbsp; Basically, it does not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me to solve this problem in a timely manner?&nbsp; This is very important to me!&nbsp; Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon checking, there is no active Skype Number subscription on your account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have purchased a subscription I suggest you check the order status if it was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the order history via this link: <strong><a href="https://secure.skype.com/wallet/account/orders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/wallet/account/orders</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, if you received an order confirmation email regarding your purchase, please check as to which account it was associated to and ensure that you are signed in to the same account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you have other concerns.</p>

<p>I also am thinking of a Skype #. Tried it for a trip to Copenhagen-- but it never worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, If I try to buy Skype won't tell me the price -- apparently to trick you into ordering.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Upon checking, most of the incoming calls for your Skype Number failed because you were either offline or the call was declined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Were you able to reach out to us before it expired to check as to why it wasn't working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the price, which specific Skype service were you referring to? All subscription rates/prices are posted on the Skype website. You are required to confirm your payment instrument with the amount indicated for each order&nbsp;before you can complete a
 purchase.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Red Faces&#47; Tint in Windows Movie Maker Upon Burning DVD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending hours making a slideshow with music and animations on Windows Movie Maker, I encounter the same issue when burning the DVD. I followed instructions&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/moviemaker-program/after-burning-the-movie-i-can-see-a-red-hue-on-the/b329c04b-27d2-44a3-9503-ab79679664c6?rtAction=1394914208282">
 provided by a moderator in a post,</a> highlighting the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, upon burning the DVD and playing it, the images are all blurry, have a red tint and are overly saturated. The weird thing is that when I save the file and play it on my computer, everything looks fine. The issue appears when burning the file on
 a DVD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greatly appreciate any help!</p>

            <p>&nbsp;It's important to know exactly how Windows Movie Maker creates a DVD. So to clarify, Windows Movie Maker
<strong>DOESN'T CREATE A DVD</strong>; it exports a WMV file to a <strong>TEMP</strong> location where Windows DVD Maker with the WMV in its que for processing. Windows DVD Maker takes the WMV file and
<strong>CONVERTS</strong> it again to a <strong>VOB</strong> format that DVD's use natively; it's just useful to know how the application accomplishes this process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows DVD Maker could be your issue.</p>
<p>As a suggestion in troubleshooting, Freemake Video Converter work very well as a DVD authoring software package. I have created a post to show how to install Freemake Video Converter without the 'optional software bundles' and to also illustrate the process
 of using Freemake Video Converter to generate a DVD for you to share.</p>

            <p>I know this is old, but the response saying that it's Windows DVD maker could be right, but there is definitely red tint to anything you save in Windows movie maker. It drives me crazy because just saving once makes it have red tint, and if you make movies
 like me with both sound effects and music, you have to save once with sound effects then use that movie to add music and save, and it makes it so red it's an eyesore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My advice to anyone who reads this is to find another free software with more features. Microsoft won't be adding any features to movie maker, so that red tint can only be fixed with other software.</p>

            Hello Scott, I did some research on this and found this site, not sure if the problem they fixed is related to your but you can see if the process will help you. I found this at PC **** website:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;http://www.pchell.com/support/svchosterror.shtml<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I will do some more looking and see what I can come up with.<br />
<br />
It is definitely associated with with a start up program, I would go into safe mode and after booting into Windows, go to start and then run and type in msconfig. Once in the config window go to start up tab and uncheck all the boxes that are not critical to
 the system. Do not uncheck you anti-virus or your spyware/ malware removal software. If the system boots up fine then go back in to msconfig and begin checking one box at a time until you get the error again. The last program box checked is the culprit and
 needs to be removed and re-installed. <br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Hope this helps, Jim

            Hi Justin,
<br />many different bugchecks mean hardware problems, mainly with memory.
<br />Your laptop is brand new so the best decision is to replace or repair it by warranty.

<br />
<br />2. Check with HP Support, their on-line documentation, drivers, and Forums. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and all the major on-board and separate device drivers. If there is not an update for gdrv.sys may be it can be uninstalled (in computer terms 6+ years is old). (See driver update methods below.)
<br />
<br />Be sure to check with Gigabyte Support to see if there are known issues with Windows 10.
<br />
<br />3. Run the memory tests (see methods below).
<br />
<br />4. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below.
<br />
<br />5. After ALL the above if needed run DriverVerifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see DriverVerifier methods below).

<br />
<br />Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory, and cables (both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Make sure the vents are clear and that the fans are working. Even though the temp is OK do not assume heat can't affect the video, sound or other system functions it those  get to hot. Try adding a small fan blowing into the vents as a test. (Those are mostly for a PC not a laptop.)
<br />
<br />Have you added any hardware lately? Have you updated any driver just before these started? (Check Control Panel - Windows Updates to see if any drivers were updated there about the time this started) Main likely culprits are Video driver, other major drivers, memory, and antivirus/antispyware/security products could be at fault as well as drive issues. 
<br />
<br />BCCode: 1a  0x0000001a  &lt;-- read this link

<br />
<br />====================================================  
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

<br />
<br />====================================================
<br />
<br />Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
<br />
<br />To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.  &lt;-- best method

<br />
<br />For the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool.
<br />
<br />Type in Cortana's search box -&gt;  Windows Memory Diagnostics 
<br />at top of list - click it. in Windows 8/8.1/10 the name is "Windows Memory 
<br />Diagnostic".
<br />
<br />================================================
<br />
<br />After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run

            Sure you may try Windows Memory Diagnostic but not all problems could be detected. But if the problem is in memory faults it will be useful to test RAM. Just set wide test in settings.

<h2>            Help with screen going to power save mode while computer is still running</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell studio xps 9000 computer with a nvidia geforce gts 240 graphics card and was originally running on Windows 7 ultimate until I got the free Windows 10 upgrade. Around the middle of December my screen goes into power save mode while the computer
 is still up and running. I have read hundreds of different ideas on what it could be. Some I have tried to no avail and the screen won't stay on long enough to do much to help correct it. However when I scanned my computer for hardware errors the screen stayed
 on through that process which took a whole day and overnight so I don't believe it is my monitor.</p>
<p>Originally I thought it was a Windows 10 problem but after reading so many other posts I am not sure it isn't my graphics card that is not compatible with Windows 10. &nbsp;On Dell's site it says that there is no Windows 10 updates for this computer and on NVidia
 it pretty much said the same, however when Microsoft tried to get me to upgrade they scanned my computer and said it was upgradable.</p>
<p>I don't care if I keep it or not I just need to know the right answer to what is wrong and get it corrected. I have scanned my computer for any problems and came up with nothing there.</p>
<p>I do have a Windows 10 ISO dvd that i can reinstall W10 and I have the original Windows 7 ultimate cd to reinstall but I don't know if either will solve my problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not very savvy on the internal "affairs" of the computer except I have changed out my hard drive a few times and added ram but know nothing about a graphics card or the right power supply etc.</p>
<p>Wondering if I reinstalled W7 ultimate would it work after W10 and if it did what do I do with W10 on my hard drive? I have way too many important files to screw this up so I am hoping someone can give me a straight answer....Is this related to Windows 10
 and what do I do to resolve the issue?</p>
<p>I appreciate any help on this I can get. Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Frustrated!!!</p>

            <p>Thanks Anne for getting back to me.</p>
<p>I have changed out my monitor cords to computer.</p>
<p>I opened the computer case and blew out the dust. Reseated the ram. Took off the fan to processor and cleaned. There was a good amount of dust so that is the reason we went through this process. Did all of this before running diagnostic tests.</p>
<p><strong>Ran all the diagnostic tests on all hardware (which the monitor stayed on the whole time during it). Results showed everything passed.</strong></p>
<p>Restored computer to an earlier date around the time I noticed this happening.</p>
<p>Uninstalled the last Windows 10 update. It is trying to install the most recent updates but my screen doesn't stay on long enough to see if it is so I left my computer running all night in hopes that it did and they failed to update.</p>
<p>I have updated drivers on the display adapters but it says I already have the latest ones.</p>
<p>I was going to try safe mode but I can't get it to go into it. Not sure you push F5 or F8 before Windows logo goes away. Have tried both but neither works.</p>
<p>I hesitate to reinstall either Windows 10 or Windows 7 ultimate as I can't afford to lose my information. I have been backing it up on an external hard drive though so may have to.</p>
<p>The main frustration is the screen won't stay on long enough to even try and troubleshoot.</p>
<p>Since I have read so many scenarios on what it could be, I am ready to go back to W7ultimate if I know that it will work because I am not ready to replace the graphics card or my computer and I liked my previous software just fine.</p>
<p>I just read where someone had problems reinstalling their old software after installing w10 so if I had solid steps to do it then I will try.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That seems like a problem with the printer itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To rule out HP's software for it, uninstall then reinstall your Printer using the correct&nbsp;Drivers and setup&nbsp;information at this HP website.</p>
<p>And there are<strong>&nbsp;troubleshooting steps</strong> for it there too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HP Website for your Printer: <a href="http://support.hp.com/ie-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>Or you can also&nbsp;ask in the HP Support Forums if the problem continues.</p>

<h2>            HP 4850 Scanner</h2>
                    I was given a HP Computer with windows 7, tried to install driver for my HP Scanjet 4850 scanner but won't take. Why?

<p>Hi Rio,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation problems are usually due to software conflicts or corrupted installers. What happens when you try to install scanner's software? If you haven't done so already, try to download and install the driver from the manufacturer's website and check
 if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Please describe your problem in more detail. Tell us what "won't take" means. Where did you get the driver? Exactly how are you trying? What happens when you try? If you get an error message, please quote it verbatim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, and most importantly, if I acquired a used computer, no matter how I got it or who previously owned it, the first thing I would do with it would be to reinstall the operating</p>
<div>system cleanly. You have no idea how the computer has been maintained,</div>
<div>what has been installed incorrectly, what is missing, what viruses and</div>
<div>spyware there may be, etc. I wouldn't want to live with somebody</div>
<div>else's mistakes and problems, possibility of kiddy p00rn, etc., and I</div>
<div>wouldn't recommend that anyone else do so either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Your choice of course, but in my view, you're playing with fire if you</div>
<div>don't reinstall Windows cleanly.</div>

You may try <a href="http://slicksolutions.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MCE Standby Tool</a>.It works in Windows 8.1 also.<br />
<br />
Also update your drivers,visit the websites of the manufacturers to download and install the latest drivers.

The tool does run in Windows 8.1 but it does not help.&nbsp; My PC will not sleep after the given time and it does not wakeup for WMC to record.<br />
<br />
This is the same PC that previously ran Windows 8.0 and sleep/wakeup worked perfectly there.<br />

            S. Sengupta is wrong. I'm having exactly the same problem. This happened from W7 to W8 and now to W8.1. I've spent hours online with MS tech support and they just give some BS about some hardware (MOBOS) not being compatible with W8.1. I have a high-end
 MSI MOBO that worked fine with the other OS's. Mine wakes up to record but will not go back to sleep automatically...only manually. MCE Standby Tool customer support is non-existent.

            <p>Since my original post I have purchased a new HP desktop and wakeup now works for WMC in Windows 8.1.&nbsp; And it goes to sleep after the recording is finished.&nbsp; I did not have to fiddle with anything.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I compared the various setting in my new 8.1 with my old PC 8.1.&nbsp; They are the same but my old PC still will not wakeup to record.</p>

            <p>I finally found the fix. Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. <span>Open the Start Menu, click on run, then type <strong>taskschd.msc</strong> in the run box and press
<strong>Enter</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. </span><span>In the left pane of Task Scheduler, double click on (to expand)
<strong>Task Scheduler Library</strong>, then click <strong>Microsoft</strong>, then click
<strong>Windows</strong>, then click on <strong>Media Center</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. On the top menu bar, click on <strong>View</strong> and then click on
<strong>Show Preview Pane</strong> and <strong>Show Hidden Tasks </strong>(to enable these features)<strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>4. In the top half of the middle pane of Task Scheduler, use the middle pane scroll bar and scroll down to the phrase:
<strong>StartRecording </strong></span><span>and click on it</span><span><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>This command is located at the 2nd to last choice at the bottom in the "Name" column, insure the "Name" column is wide enough to read all titles by dragging the column
 bar right .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>5. On the bottom half of the middle pane that appears after clicking on <strong>
StartRecording</strong>, click on the <strong>General </strong>tab.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>6. Lastly at the bottom of that tab, click on the <strong>Configure for:</strong> pull down menu and
<strong>select Windows 8.1.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My machine still listed Windows 7 in that data field even though I'm using Windows 8.1 from an upgrade off the Microsoft Store.</span>&nbsp; The upgrade software doesn't change this setting, but it is needed for proper functioning of Windows Media Center
 when awakening the PC during sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the above and it fixed the problem on a scheduled recording for the first time since installing windows 8.1.</p>

            I can't find StartRecording anywhere. Is it supposed to be under Task Status or Active Tasks? Either way it's not there. At any rate, my system does wake up to record, it just does not go back to sleep automatically-only manually.

            MCE Standby Tool doesn't work properly with 8.1. I've been using it for several years and there is always a lag of several months between OS upgrades with auto sleep after waking except it still hasn't been fixed since 8.1.&nbsp;and MST&nbsp;technical support is
 non-existent. I've&nbsp;spent many hours with MS tech support, including Level II&nbsp;and they can't figure it out either.

<div>&nbsp;Not clear what you are asking for. That tool is a third party application and</div>
<div>if they won't support it, then there isn't much anyone can do. It's an old</div>
<div>application. Additionally, Microsoft considers Windows Media Center a legacy</div>
<div>application and apparently doesn't have any developers assigned to it. It's a</div>
<div>sad situation for sure.</div>

            I wasn't asking so much as stating. WMC was still being sold with W.8 and as such should have support for a basic WMC feature as auto wake/sleep. It worked with W.8 so there is something in W8.1 that messed it up. MST is used because it does what WMC should
 do.
