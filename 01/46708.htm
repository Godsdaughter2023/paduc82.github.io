            It may help to look at the minidump files from the crashes with a debugger.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via Windows Live SkyDrive or similar site?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The following link has information on using Windows Live SkyDrive:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

            <p>The driver that appears to be causing the crash is the NMgamingms.sys:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>BUCKET_ID:&nbsp; 0x139_3<strong>_NMgamingms</strong>+1cbb</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NMgamingms.sys is a driver for the mouse that appears to be installed via Windows Update and has been known to cause the error you are receiving such as in the following thread:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/hardware/bsod-on-usb-plug-and-play-nmgamingmssys-is-broken/9c693936-e6fc-4444-9fb5-5db150c8a8a6?page=1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/hardware/bsod-on-usb-plug-and-play-nmgamingmssys-is-broken/9c693936-e6fc-4444-9fb5-5db150c8a8a6?page=1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you do the following to disable the automatic&nbsp;downloading and installing of drivers from Windows Update:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open the Control Panel &gt; View devices and printers &gt; then right-click the computer &gt; Device Installation settings &gt; then choose "No, let me choose what to do" &gt; then choose "never install driver software&nbsp;from Windows update&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt; Save Changes
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, can you do the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Desktop right-click the Action Center icon on the taskbar &gt; Open&nbsp;Windows Update &gt; View update history</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an update with the name "<span>USB Optical Mouse Input software update"?</span></p>

<p>Create a System Restore Point beforehand and restart the computer afterward.</p>

            Yeah, it did help sir..but my mouse is not already functional..<br />
My comp could still recognize the device but there is a driver error..<br />
What should i do?<br />
<br />
I did update the driver..and again for a moment my mouse responded but it again cause OS crash..<br />
Could it be compatibility issue causes this?<br />
<br />
Minidump still contain the same number and other information which i have sent to you..<br />
<br />
Is it safe that before i insert the receiver i will change the start data value in the regedit?<br />

<h2>            Reinstall Windows 10 and replace primary hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been running Windows 10 on this PC for a couple of years now. Upgraded online from Windows 7 during the free upgrade period. So I have no product key for Windows 10, I have a digital license tied to my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to reinstall Windows 10 now and replace the primary SSD hard drive to a larger one as I was running low on disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the "Reset this PC" process which successfully reinstalled Windows 10 fine, but didn't let me change the hard drive as this process works in situ.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the tool to create separate installation media for another PC, and using that after swapping in the new hard drive and rebooting from the CD, but despite everything I have seen, there is NO option to bypass the entering of a product key. I believe
 I am supposed to be able to skip this Product Key step and then after installation link the new install to my existing Microsoft account and the activiation will work, but there is no way I can see to bypass the product key entry bit. I tried entering my legitimate
 Windows 7 product key at that point, but not surprisingly, that didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the "Create recovery disk" option from Control Panel to create a bootable USB key, but the PC did not boot from the USB drive, despite me setting the only boot device in the BIOS as a USB HDD. But, my mobo is still an older BIOS one and
 not a new UEFI one so USB booting may not be as successful as it should be, but the BIOS definitely seems to support it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any tips !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

            Hi Andrew
<br />
<br />Once you boot from Windows 10 installation media, to clean install Windows 10 - not upgrade, you will get the opportunity to skip entering a product key . . .
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />You mention installing from a CD and also USB boot - what type of installation media have you created, is that on a USB Flash Drive or on a DVD?       
        </p>

            When installer ask product key, just click "I don't have a product key".&nbsp; Then you should be able to continue. When installation is finished Windows activated automatic when connected online.

<p>I don't have original Windows 10 installation media since I upgraded online from Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have since created new media 2 different ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Using the "Create recovery drive option" from the current W10 installation creates a recovery drive on a USB key which is supposed to be bootable. This USB key won't boot on my PC for some reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) As part of the "Reset this PC" option available via Settings / Update and Security, this lets you create a CD for use on a different Windows PC. Booting from this CD does not have an option to bypass entering the Product Key. There is no option anywhere
 on the Product Key screen to say "I do not have a key" - this is the bit I can't get past !!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for prompt responses guys, I appreciate the help !</p>

            Hi Andrew, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, but you must create Windows 10 bootable installation media and boot your PC from that to clean install Windows 10 and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 7. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 7 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<p>Hi again Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear - I am *not* trying to upgrade from Windows 7.</p>
<p>I *originally* upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a couple of years ago and have been running Windows 10 only ever since then.</p>
<p>This exercise is about *reinstalling* the same Windows 10, on the same PC, but swapping out the hard drive as part of the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have created 3 copies of bootable DVDs via the Media Creation Tool and they all give me the results I have described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try again though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>
<p>

            Hi Andrew,
<br />
<br />I do understand you are just trying to re-install Windows 10, I have reinstalled Windows 10 on many many system and once the installation is started by booting from the installation media, there was always the option to skip entering a product key once you follow this:
<br />
<br /> During the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers       
        </p>

<p>Hi Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again, there's obviously something weird going on at my end that doesn't make sense.</p>
<p>I'm going to try swapping my motherboard as I think that may be a problem here !!</p>

            Yes, do upload the dmp files, and <span style="font-style: italic">export</span> a full System Information report ( msinfo32 ).<br />
Saying you have tried it all without listing what you have tried is not instructive.<br />
Did the BSOD start after making any system changes or installing any software ?<br />
<br />
While the BSOD may mention the graphics drivers there are many other possibilities. It's often<br />
just a case of the graphics drivers being in use when something else triggers the BSOD<br />
(the same with the dread TDR ).<br />
<br />
Don't keep hammering away at the drivers. Get a good clean install and then move on to<br />
troubleshooting other possibilities.<br />
<br />
In the mean time (if you have not already) you may want to run a test on the RAM, and if you
<br />
have OC'd the cpu or used&nbsp; any non - default settings in BIOS for the RAM revert to default
<br />
settings.<br />

            Let me break it down...
<div><br />
<div>I have done 2 different memtests... memtest86 or whatever it is.. and Window's memtest. quite a few times, and they all came back clean. &nbsp;I have done chkdsk /r/f on both my SSD and regular HDD, which didnt come back with any errors either. &nbsp;I did a stress
 test on my SSD which is my main drive (with my games too) OCZ asked me to. &nbsp;Came back clean. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>When i started getting blue screens 2.5 weeks ago, i called evga and got a new card through my warranty... a 560 TI. &nbsp;The one i got was broken right away, fan was blasting at 100% through post and so on. &nbsp;And now i have the one that i have now which seems
 to work perfectly fine... unless i play steam games. &nbsp;I dont have a heating issue since i have 6 fans blowing in my case. &nbsp;All on pretty high.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am also currently talking to steam about why this is happening, and they are also having me do some troubleshooting steps. &nbsp;Which so far... have led to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Im thinking it has something to do with steam... and my graphics card in my opinion... but i have tried everything i know to do and nothing has worked.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Mind you i also did a clean install 4 or 5 days ago and this issue is still happening.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I only crash and get BSOD during steam games (DotA 2 and Borderlands 2) &nbsp;But when i play other games such as SC2 and bits and pieces of other blizzard games. i can play hours and be perfectly fine. &nbsp;So im totally lost. &nbsp;</div>

I have virtually the same system on my older machine, but with a MA770T-UD3P mobo, and<br />
Gigabyte GTX560ti - factory OC. I am using the 310.90 drivers atm.<br />
With the reinstall of Windows you have also updated the chipset drivers and done all the 'important'<br />
Windows updates ?<br />
<br />
While six fans is good you need to know the temps are running in the safe range. Probably not the<br />
problem, but everything needs to be verified regardless.<br />
The PnenomII 965 cpu's have a relatively low TDP&nbsp; and needs to be kept between 55-62C max temp.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I don't have either of the games you are having issues with, but if they are the only<br />
games having problems I would be inclined to focus on the games.<br />
One thing that can be a problem with games downloaded from Steam is it is more time consuming<br />
reinstalling to verify if the game has corrupt files, but that is a possibility.&nbsp;
<br />
Reinstalling Steam is relatively easy, but not always (card carrying Steam hater here ;)&nbsp; ).<br />
<br />
Sometimes AV's&nbsp; silently block things you least expect them to so try disabling your AV before playing the two problem games.<br />
There could be software or Services conflicts, even if you don't have a lot installed, so troubleshooting via Clean Boot may help -<br />

            You mentioned&nbsp; the&nbsp; dmp&nbsp; files at the end of your first post, but I should have specified them.<br />
They have to be uploaded to Skydrive as&nbsp; third party software is used to interpret them.<br />
The System Information file (msinfo32) can also be useful. Use the&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic">
File &gt; Export</span> option and upload <br />
that with the dmp files.&nbsp; DX diag is not much use.<br />
-Also do the other steps suggested.<br />

            OK then - I'm hoping some of the others more proficient at deciphering these things will come by<br />
but I have a go -<br />
<br />
Then dmps refer to the drivers generating a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA error.<br />
Assuming&nbsp; your driver install is not corrupt you may find something useful in the link below.
<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/nvlddmkmsys-pagefaultinnonpagedarea/e07abf40-f4b7-4264-a65d-933acc74f6f2">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-hardware/nvlddmkmsys-pagefaultinnonpagedarea/e07abf40-f4b7-4264-a65d-933acc74f6f2</a><br />
<br />
but -<br />
If you have already done everything suggested in the thread above, and have not re-installed the
<br />
games in question you may want to try that -<br />
-If you have not use <span style="font-style: italic">Clean Boot</span>, or tried disabling your AV yet, do so. Norton is well known for<br />
causing problems, particularly when using the full suite.<br />
Are your BIOS settings for the cpu and RAM at default ? <br />
<br />
- It looks like you have Windows Updates set to automatic. If this includes the 'optional' updates<br />
and they are updating your graphics drivers that could be a problem. It's best not to allow
<br />
automatic 'optional' updates, and graphics drivers in particular should be done manually with<br />
drivers downloaded from Nvidia.<br />
There are a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">lot</span> of&nbsp; failed Windows Update error reports, but I don't know if that is significant.<br />
- Are you playing the two games in question on line ? Do they&nbsp; only cause a BSOD when on line ?<br />
If so, I wonder if your USB modem may be the source of the problem.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the VIA karaoke audio driver may conflict with the other audio drivers ?<br />
- I don't see any driver for the Realtek HD audio, but you have the Nvidia HD audio drivers installed .
<br />
Are you using HDMI ? <br />
<br />
- Skype and Bonjour have also been known to cause problems.<br />
Sometimes programs that have automated update checks can cause problems by checking while<br />
your are playing a game, but this usually just leads to a crash, not a BSOD. It wouldn't hurt to disable<br />
all automatic update options though, if you have not done so already.<br />

            I have done everything in that link that you have posted. 



I will try to disable Norton and see where that gets me... 



This VIA was brought to my attention from u... let me explain... 



I use HDMI yes... now the drivers that are on my motherboard disc are fairly old... 


I only download the necessary ones. to get started then go ahead and update them. 



I did install the via hd audio thing off the disk. and didn't update that one... so thats probly old... with that being said... youtube videos and games is when my computer crashes. could it be the 2 audio drivers colliding with my hdmi on my video card?  so it crashes? im just thinking out loud here.... 



I uninstalled the VIA hd **** completely and i will play games and test it and see what happens... 



When it comes to the realtek audio drivers, i didn't download those.  Just left it alone with the nvidia audio drivers and the defaulted ones that get updated with windows.  And the video drivers are the one that pops up 



I also

<h2>            My Laptop keeps hanging up for no REASON&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I use a Lenovo ideapad 300. It's about a 6 months old and the problem is that it keeps freezing for no proper reason. I made sure that the start up time is decent and a less number of programs used. I don't think it's because of the number of the software
 programs installed on the system. In the past I've done a lot of editing which would be a probable reason for hanging up but now it freezes for no reason. The Anti-Virus was McAfee and it recently expired, I removed it and sticked with the Windows Defender.
 One more thing that I have to mention is that I have lost my Charger/Adapter a few months ago and ordered a cheap one on amazon (for 8$). I've used this charger for about two months, as far as I think it isn't the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can any one help me with this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Both these errors codes and messages were found when I ran the Pre Boot System Assessment (by pressing F12 when the Dell logo appears after switching on laptop).</p>
<p>Problem started like this: &nbsp;On shutting down laptop as usual, the 'installing updates' happens, but this time the screen froze for a long time nothing was happening. &nbsp;Ctrl - Alt - Del did not bring up the Task Manager, so I turned the power off, waited 10
 seconds and turned it back on again. &nbsp;The laptop started, got to the Dell logo, then to the 'Resuming Windows' screen, but did not make it to the login screen (only blank screen was showing). &nbsp;Tried switching the laptop on and off several times - did not solve
 the problem. &nbsp;Ran the Pre Boot System Assessment and got these error messages. &nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I fix this (can't even get to login screen now)? &nbsp;Thanks for your advice in advance.</p>

<p><span><span><span>·</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Have
 you made any recent changes on the computer prior to this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below and check if it helps to fix the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Try booting the system in last know good configuration mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Last-Known-Good-Configuration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Last-Known-Good-Configuration</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Try to boot in safe mode and then try to perform a system restore.
 This will help check if any non-Microsoft service is interfering with the system restore.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In Safe mode; you have access to only basic files and drivers. Refer to the link to start the computer in safe mode:</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>

            <p><span>Hello Gladiola Froese,</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen with any particular update or with all the updates?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How are you trying to install the update?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run the fixit from the link “</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Troubleshoot-problems-with-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot
 problems with installing updates Vista</a>” and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in clean boot stet and then try to install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot</a> </span>
</p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Install “System Update Readiness Tool” and then try to install the Update.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link “<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-the-System-Update-Readiness-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What is the System Update Readiness Tool?</a>” to install
 System Update Readiness Toll.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, then reset “Windows Update Components and then check if this fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link “<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a>” to reset Windows Update Components.</span></p>

            Sorry, with version 1803, Cortana's color is in accordance with your theme i.e. Light or dark,
<br />I am not sure these fixes would work now.

<p>The .bat file did NOT work after Version 1803 update. Still have the ugly white search box.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, the update has cost me 6-8 hours of time trying to fix things it broke. I have an important program which I depend on that becomes unusable every time Microsoft updates my graphics driver. Formerly, I could correct this by using Update Driver
 and selecting the driver I need from the list. Today, it has been a nightmare trying to rectify the issue and put it back to my old driver because the old driver is no longer there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SAME thing has occurred with my printer. I PURPOSELY use a printer driver that did not come with my HP printer because I needed certain features in that driver. It works flawlessly with my printer. Every time Microsoft updates Windows, it messes with
 my printer driver. I discovered wushohide.diagcab some time ago and chose to hide printer driver updates, which worked until Version 1803 installed today (5/18/18). Now the printer driver I formerly reverted back to each time Windows messed it up is NO LONGER
 IN THE LIST OF DRIVERS!!! To make matters worse, I have spent hours finding the driver I need at HP and attempting to install it. After install, it does not show in the list of drivers in Device Manager. So far, after hours of troubleshooting, research, and
 attempting various fixes, I have not successfully restored my old driver, so guess what. My printer no longer has the features I need.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does Microsoft assume they have a right to take over one's computer to the point that one no longer has any control over personal preferences?!!&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>One of staff recently upgraded to v8.25.</p>
<p>On 25/07 she logged into her PC and discovered that she had been logged out of Skype.</p>
<p>When she tried to logging back in to Skype it said that she had the wrong password.</p>
<p>So we followed the steps to reset her password and recover her account.</p>
<p>When she&nbsp;tried to logging back in to Skype it worked, but all of her contacts, conversations and credit is missing.</p>
<p>I checked her account in Skype Manager and she still has credit assigned to her.</p>

            It sounds like she recovered access to the wrong account. If she was logged onto the proper account, she would see all her contacts and her credit. All Skype accounts are Microsoft accounts. If you know her exact account name, make sure she is signing
 in with that name instead of her email address, which is probably a different account.

In "configure your speech recognition experience" (from control panel)&nbsp; there are no options or anything but search in the upper&nbsp;RIGHT corner.&nbsp; You go from the main 'control panel' to "ease of access" from that you can go to "Ease of acces center" or "Speech
 recognition". Under "Speech recognition" is "start speech recognition" or "set up microphone". If I hit "start speech recognition" The message I first posted comes up.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I hit The main heading "Speech Recognition" it puts me on on other page.&nbsp; Still nothing
 at the upper right.&nbsp; If I had hit "Set up microphone",&nbsp; it took me into the microphone setup and i completed that.</p>
<p>From the Main "Speech Recognition" it takes me to a page with 5 different options on the right panel of the page&nbsp; and three options on the left panel (nothing but "search"&nbsp; in the upper&nbsp;right hand corner.&nbsp; Right hand panel shows "Control Panel Home"&nbsp; then
 "Advanced Speech Options",&nbsp; under that is "Text to Speech"</p>
<p>If I go to "Advanced Speech Options' I get "Speech Properties" dialoge box.&nbsp; Under "language" it gives me two choices.&nbsp; One is "Microsoft Speech Recognizer 8.0 for Windows (English - US)&nbsp; and one other choice of "Microsoft Speech Recognizer 8.0 for Windows
 (English - UK).</p>
<p>To the side of that box is one that says "settings"&nbsp;.&nbsp; Here is or seems to be a problem.&nbsp; This box is greyed out and I gannot access it. I am as mentioned,&nbsp; the only "user"&nbsp; and "Administrator".??</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I have, or even need to have, any other lanquages installed and why would I?&nbsp; I only speak US english because that is where I live.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;HAVEN'T tried the link you provided but I have tried about 40 pages of Forum questions and haven't seen a good link yet in regard to this.&nbsp; They all seem to go to the same place about changing the language.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that, as good as Windows7 has been, That there would be&nbsp;SOME way to "sync" the lanquages of 'so-called' "Ease of access" and what the heck the computer is set at,.. automatically..???</p>
<p>&nbsp;I will check out your link and get back.&nbsp; Thank you very much for your responce!</p>

Sorry, I inadvertantly hit that this reply helped. Actually a message came from within my email to go to this and vote and it automatically said that I voted "yes". But they won't let you delete a vote here apparently?<br />

<p>Would having "disabled" speech recognition earlier in the "event viewer/services (local) have anything to do with this?&nbsp; I have gone back to it and enable or changed to "automatic"&nbsp; anything I thought might be connected to Speech Recognition.&nbsp; Didn't change

Hi David,</p>
<p>WOW!&nbsp; That sure seems like a lot to go through when I am the only one that has ever used or logged onto this computer.&nbsp; I'm not even sure if a "guest' could use this one...never tried.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I have had this computer&nbsp;since February this year but it has been down for a while, about three months ( I had a fire in my house and didn't have a place to set it up).&nbsp; Just got it going again about 3 1/2 months ago.&nbsp; February was when I was using Speech
 Recognition.&nbsp; Didn't try it until recently.</p>
<p>I really appreciate your <span>responses&nbsp;and</span> would like it fixed, but i'm not sure if I want to mess up the "user" situation as
 it is.</p>
<p>If I delete the Speech Recognition.exe file then put a new one in could that help?&nbsp; Just throwing out suggestions so don't laugh....yet! :-)</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions on what I might look for in the registry?&nbsp; I have some experiance in editing it and know what NOT to change or delete etc. without backing it up.</p>
<p>Thanks again!</p>

            I would also recommend testing the corrupt profile.<br />
<br />
Ignore the "fix" steps for right now, just test for a corrupt profile first - it's really quick:<br />
<ol>
<li><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create a new user account</a></li><li>Login to the new account</li><li>Run the speech recognition setup.</li></ol>
<br />
If you have the same problem, a corrupt profile is not the cause and you can just delete the new user you created. If it does work, you at least know the cause and have the steps on how to fix it.<br />
<br />
One other thing to try is run the system file checker, that will scan the system files and make sure they are good:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li><span>Click on the<span>
</span><b>Start menu</b>, choose<span> </span><b>All Programs</b>, then<span>
</span><b>Accessories</b>, then right-click on the<span> </span><b>Command Prompt</b> item and select<span>
</span><b>Run as administrator</b></span></li><li><span>Click Continue to authorize opening a command prompt with administrative privileges</span></li><li><span>Run this command in the cmd prompt:<span>&nbsp;
</span><b>sfc /scannow</b></span></li></ol>
After it is finished, it should say if it found any corrupt files or if it repaired any items - let us know the result.<br />

Hi Dave,&nbsp; I didn't do the "create a new user account just yet.&nbsp; I ran sfc and this is what it said:</p>
<p>"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>I guess I'll try the new user account and see if that does it??</p>

    <title>windows 10 stuck in automatic repair loop after updating - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pangealc  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 stuck in automatic repair loop after updating</h2>
                    <p>My computer, originally running Windows 7 but upgraded to Windows 10, is&nbsp;stuck in a diagnose/repair loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the computer turns on, I see&nbsp;the Dell logo and I have the ability to press F2 or F12.
</p>
<p>Then a&nbsp;black screen comes up with the Windows logo and spinning circle of dots and it says,&nbsp;"Preparing automatic repair".</p>
<p>Then "Diagnosing your PC".</p>
<p>Then "Repairing disk errors. This might take over an hour to complete."</p>
<p>Then&nbsp;the&nbsp;Dell logo and F2/F12 prompts again.</p>
<p>Then "Scanning and repairing drive (C:): 0% complete".</p>
<p>Then it starts over from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When I press F12 I have the option to run Dell's diagnostics on the hard drive which comes up with no errors or problems.</p>
<p>-I can't start in Safe Mode by holding down the shift key; it just pauses at the Dell logo screen until I let go, then it starts the auto repair sequence.</p>
<p>-I have a Windows 10 installation USB and I've tried using it to do a Startup Repair but that seems to be the same as the automatic repair my computer is already trying to do and it just keeps repeating what I typed above.</p>
<p>-Using the Windows 10 installation USB to access a command prompt, I tried the four boot rec commands I saw in other posts (fixmbr, fixboot, scanos and rebuildbcd); they all completed successfully but didn't help my problem.</p>
<p>-I have no restore points to go back to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I do a complete reinstall, can anyone think of anything else I can try to get me into Windows long enough to copy off my back up files or at least some key files I can't do without? Should I try going back to&nbsp;the previous build? Or use System Image
 Recovery? I don't know what those two things mean and I'm really afraid of losing my data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I'm not sure if it matters at this point, but here's what was going on before all this happened. Windows 10 did an update that changed my power settings so that my hard drive would turn off after 20 minutes. It turned off&nbsp;three times and each time, when
 I turned the computer back on it went through an auto repair but then would eventually let me back into Windows. I changed the power setting back to "never shut off" and disabled the Windows password because I was afraid in the future I wouldn't remember it.
 I haven't been able to boot to Windows since.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you with your issue with booting to Windows, we suggest that you disable the

            <p>There's nothing in my bios that says secure boot. According to a few other sources, including&nbsp;technet.microsoft.com, it appears Windows 7 didn't support secure boot so maybe I never had that option.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it looks like when someone who does have secure boot mode as on option chooses to disable it, the bios automatically switches boot mode from uefi to legacy. Since mine already is set to legacy, if I did have secure boot mode as an option, I'm assuming
 it would be disabled.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I don't have a refresh options for Windows 10 (I also don't have a reset option.) The instructions mention starting in Safe Mode but I can't do that either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been reading Microsoft's and other sites' forums for days and this seems like it's a complicated issue so I took it to the Microsoft Store this morning to reinstall Windows. Luckily for me, they were able to back up my data.</p>

            Hi Nycol, 
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Severe performance issues after update to Windows 10</h2>
                    I recently got windows 10 after updating from windows 8.1, ever since I updated my computer had been having really bad framerate slowdowns and skipping along with screen tearing and really bad audio issues. The game that these issues are occouring in (the
 only one I have) is warframe.

            When I clicked the troubleshooter link it said it was for windows apps. I didn't get Warframe off of the windows store, I got it off steam. Secondly, the outdated hardware isn't an issue as I ran Warframe at stable 30fps four weeks ago on my windows 8.1
 without any issues. Are there any other fixes you can offer me?

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>it seems like my Mail app on Windows 10 is having a problem. I send emails then i see them in Outbox but they don't leave the Outbox but still get sent...some of the emails who i still see in the outbox apparently were sent because the people replied but
 others are just stuck...</p>
<p>Also when i try to hit the sync button it doesn't really do anything and when i go in the acount settings and i want to change the sync settings for my gmail account and press save, i have to wait forever and it never stops loading....</p>
<p>
</p><p>help please ? my email is very very important for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

<p>Hi Ben,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can be due to syncing issues. We'd like to know if the sent emails that have replies of the recipients are saved on the Sent Folder. As an initial workaround, we suggest running the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows apps troubleshooter</a></strong> and see if it will help resolve the issue. If the issue persists, try deleting
 your account from the Mail app then add it again and see if the same issue will occur once you sync it. You can also check this
<strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Resolve-Sync-issues-in-Mail-and-Calendar-apps-in-Windows-10-0dd86c69-18f3-4f73-9d3d-375bdc9c3e34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> to help you resolve sync issues with Mail app.
</p>

                    Before Windows 10 I could print multiple copies with no problem. Now with Windows 10 all I can print is 1 copy no matter what I do to various settings. Now the Mopier mode is grayed out along with various other functions within printer properties dialog
 box. Am I missing something simple?

I cannot print multiple copies from any application, word, excell, note pad, etc... &nbsp;I did not have this problem prior to Windows 10. Now, with Windows 10 all the settings in the device tab of the printer properties dialog box are grayed out, including Mopier
 Mode indicating it is enabled. I cannot change this because it is grayed out also. I do not know if it is a Windows 10 issue or a Laserjet 1160 driver issue although I do have the latest Windows 10 issued driver for this device.

Solution to my problem: When I upgraded to Windows 10, the upgrade must have deleted all my administrative access settings in the "Advanced Security Settings for HP Laserjet 1160" dialog box. I had to go into the "Effective Access Tab", select all appropriate
 users, then check the appropriate boxes. All is fine now although it took quite a bit of time to get to this point as I did have administrative access for the computer. I did not realize admin capabilities was a seperate issue for the printer. I can not take
 credit for this solution as it came from an HP forum.

<h2>            Intermittent IP conflict issue resulting in unable to connect to home-group or internet at times</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this intermittent issue is driving me mad. &nbsp; I purchased a new PC running win 7 pro (my older pc retained on network runs same) and from time to time my connection with the network and internet is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To resolve I have used cmd and reset/renew IP, reset DNS, updated network adapter driver, created a new home-group, mostly used windows network troubleshooter to resolve which is 90% effective (and when so seems to reset the network adapter to fix) but all
 these fixes are short term and at least daily (other than this morning for some reason) I have to deal with this problem to use my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas which are not short term and covered already?</p>
<p>

</span></strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If issue still persist try the steps provided below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong></p>

</span></strong><strong><span>Disable IPv6:</span></strong><span> <br />
Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack. To remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6),
 that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer. Then go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: You should do this for each network connection.&nbsp; <br />

            <p>Hi Ramesh, thanks for the advice. &nbsp; I have tried these steps but still getting intermittent issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if there is some compatibility issue between my telstra provided technicolor TG797n router and my intel 82579V network card. &nbsp; For example if I don't untick the power management options "reduce link speed during system idle" and "Wake on link
 settings" the PC will not connect to the network due to IP configuration issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im wondering if the router isnt releasing the IP and renewing it for the PC after the PC has been disconnected from the network e.g. shut down. &nbsp; I looked in the router settings on another PC once and the new PC appeared to still be connected with a local
 IP even though I had shut it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible my new PC is running as a DHPC server and issuing IP's aswell, although no other device on the network is experiencing any issues so perhaps not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may relate to some setting that would interfere with the router DHPC server perhaps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any further help please.</p>
        </p>

            You may need to go into your WLM account configuration settings and check whether Nord has changed any of them.&nbsp; &nbsp;If you don't know what the settings should be, your ISP should be able to provide them, either from their website or by emailing them.

    <title>Removal of wifi card on XBOX One - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -&#91;peter&#93;-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removal of wifi card on XBOX One</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After spending quite some time in chat and over telephone without getting any information I got recommended to ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a customer that due to certain circumstances (legal reasons, not "health reasons" or anything made up like that) needs their Xbox One's to not have any wifi-functionality at all. We offer this service to the customer for the 360's, and they work
 great without it, even with the wireless controllers, but we're getting mixed messages regarding the One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is simply; if we remove the wifi card, but leave the rf board in place, should this then remove the wifi functionality without affecting the wireless controllers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both we and the customer are very well aware that all kinds of warranty goes straight out the window, and that is not an issue for either part. Disabling the wifi through software (unless we JTAG it and somehow kill it that way, but we don't want to do anything
 more invasive than the removal of the card) is not accepted by the legal department. They need the wifi functionality completely gone, nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify a bit further, since we keep getting into a loop of this kind, we only want to know if there are any technical reasons preventing the wireless controllers or similar to work if we do this. We understand that there is no guarantee that anything
 will do this and that since we're modifying the console in a way that was not ment from the manufacturer. We simply want to know if it _should_ work despite us removing the wifi card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One bonus question. Some games require updates every now and then, but as long as the console is never connected to the internet, neither the game nor the console should be able to know that there is an update and therefor not asking for the device to get
 connected again, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry if I'm having a harsh tone. I mean no harm, but have had quite a few frustrating dialogs now in a row and I've been close to panicking after trying to explain a simple question in a lot of different ways just to get stonewalled. Nintendo was a dream
 to talk to, and the nice woman I was connected with on the phone had some serious skills, knowing the devices inside out, what circuits causing what. Scary to call in and then feel like a complete novice. "You could short circuit the X with the Y and then
 remove the Z which would let the device boot up without wifi working. Be aware that the wifi would physically break and never work again though.". Exactly what I needed. Anyway, please excuse my frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

            Opening the console could be considered tampering.&nbsp; There are no user fixes for the console.&nbsp; If the console has been tampered with then any warranty is voided and Microsoft will no longer repair the console should something go wrong.

<p>Hello Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums with your issue. If you remove the wifi card it could affect the controllers. If it does, with&nbsp; the plug and play kit there is a USB that is about 8 ft. long that they can use to play comfortably. If any other inquiries you
 would need to speak with Microsoft directly as there is nothing posted about removing certain components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brad</p>
