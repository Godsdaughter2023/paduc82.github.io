    <title>Xbox One Media Remote is slow &#47; laggy &#47; non responsive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Media Remote is slow &#47; laggy &#47; non responsive</h2>
                    
<p>it uses the Kinect's IR blaster (which is lame)</p>

<p>Having a lot of issues with the new media remote, works sometimes and not others - seems slow and laggy when making button presses, does not turn on Xbox One etc.</p>
<p>I don't think there are any issues with the Kinect's IR, will change volume on TV without issue when issuing voice commands... Wonder if I just have a bum remote.</p>

<p>Is anyone else is experiencing the same issues?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Microsoft won&#39;t trust my only PC despite getting the confirmation message.</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently had to do a fresh reinstall Windows 8 on my HP Pavilion DV7t laptop after some driver issues, but now I am unable to get Microsoft to "trust" this PC and allow it to sync my account, etc. Every time I click the "Trust this PC" button, it opens
 the link in Internet Explorer, where I then sign in and successfully input the code it sends to my phone. I will then get the "Thanks for verifying your identity. Your saved passwords for apps, websites and network will now sync on your PC." webpage, but even
 after restarting my PC and doing this multiple times, my PC is still not "trusted." I have even done the "Forget all trusted devices" and tried everything again, but to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any advice?</div>
                </div>

                    i have got a Sony Vaio laptop; vpceh26eg model. its webcam was not working months ago. its icon was gone in the device manager. so i posted a question here regarding this problem. in one of the replies, it was mentioned that i should stop auto update of
 drivers and i did it.i went to control panel, devices and printers right clicked on my laptop icon there then clicked on device installation settings and then selected
<span style="font-style: italic">never install driver software from windows update</span>.&nbsp; thus it was on and off for a while and later it was working ok for months. but lately, this problem appeared again. it is not found by any webcam software. its icon in
 the device manager is gone again. i am tired of this problem . how can i fix it? the local vendor here says i must recover it but i don't want to do it. i have a bunch of software and data in my laptop and i don't want to reinstall them. please help. thanks

            <p>You have a laptop with built in webcam, any drivers are obtained from Sony support site, not windows update.</p>
<p>And if you visit Sony support, specific to your model, you will doubless find the webcam app available as a download</p>

<h2>            Taking a snapshot of one screen not both&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have Skype version 8.32.0.53.</p>
<p>When I now take a snapshot, it takes both myself and the other caller and it shares the image with both myself and the other caller. I'm very happy for this to continue, but neither user wishes to have both screens as part of the one image.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I go back to how a previous version just took one caller????? I'm happy for the other caller to decide yes or no to this for their own security. (I presume this was added for security and I think it would be a good idea to maintain each caller deciding
 for their end.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have to crop every image and this just takes time, which I don't really have spare.</p>

            The only work around is to turn off your camera before taking the snapshot.

            I amazes me how people read what they want to read instead of actually reading what is typed.&nbsp; I do NOT need to test my typing skills - that is not even close to what I asked.&nbsp; In fact I used&nbsp; to type 70wpm with no errors.&nbsp; Then I had a stroke &amp; I know&nbsp;
 will never recover that skill.&nbsp; I still type but not as good as I used to. I am trying to find a program that I can use to type on whatever I need to, for free.&nbsp; What in that statement indicates I'm looking to improve my typing?&nbsp; LEARN TO READ.

            I have relied on Open Office for years, however; I find the latest version difficult to understand.&nbsp; It's like someone created a whole different language to use when typing and using different keyboard options that I don't understand!&nbsp; Am I wrong??

            For years ago, I get used to Microsoft Office 2003 and older versions, their UI look similar and I feel convenient with habit. All this changed from MS-Office 2007, it started to use another UI design philosophy with Ribbon, that did bother me for a long time. After then, I accept that little by little, and now get used to it.
<br />
<br />So the conclusion is that you're not wrong at all, just a stranger to the latest version. I'll recommend you use an older version of OpenOffice instead or just try to get used of the new version.

<br />
<br />You could try using WordPad, which is built into Windows 10 and is completely free. You can search for it in the Start menu. Hopefully that's closer to what you're looking for.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Office Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that from your description that your computer is going in Table mode.<br />
When you set option as&nbsp;Don't ask me and always switch, computer automatically switch to tablet mode. If you want to use it in Desktop mode then fallow the steps to make changes in setting.<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;Start.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;Settings.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;System&gt;Tablet mode.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure that you select&nbsp;Always ask before switching&nbsp;or&nbsp;Don’t ask don’t switch&nbsp;under&nbsp;When this device automatically switches tablet mode on or off.<br />
Also you may choose toggle off option under&nbsp;Tablet mode&nbsp;to disable Tablet mode.<br />

            Windows 10 is supposed to intelligently detect when to go to Tablet Mode. If my computer is docked with the keyboard attached it shouldn't default to Tablet mode - which is the bug Microsoft engineers should look into. I can't be 100% sure but I believe&nbsp;this
 is a recent regression, it used to work as expected a few weeks earlier (i.e. when docked Windows 10 would go to Laptop mode and when I removed the keyboard from my 2 in 1 SurfacePro 3&nbsp;it&nbsp;went to tablet mode).

 the windows recovery was finished, i saw that windows recovery formated both hard drives and installed new windows on both drives. How could this thing happened? Why both drives?</span>

<h2>            Unable to upgrade to windows 8.1 PRO with media Center from Windows 8 PRO with media center</h2>
                    I have been trying for months to upgrade to windows 8.1&nbsp; on my ASUS i7 computer but It constantly fails.&nbsp; I have done all of the suggested steps shown on several of your forums to resolve the issue to no avail.&nbsp; I upgraded to windows 8 PRO with media center
 from windows 7 as soon as it was available.&nbsp; Now even though the upgrade to Windows 8.1 is shown in the store, it fails and will not install.&nbsp; My windows update list has been wiped and I am stuck with the system constantly trying to apply update KB2802618.&nbsp;
 I am unable to reset my windows (it constantly says there is a problem with the windows folder).&nbsp; When I try to reinstall windows 8 It fails at 90%.&nbsp; Many others are having the same problem and no one can seem to get an answer from you.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>The answers to your&nbsp;questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I have an ASUS 64-bit CM6870-US-3AA computer with Intel Core i7-3770 Ivy 16GB DDR3, 2TB, GT520, BDR.&nbsp; When I purchased it in 6/2012 it came with Windows 7 PRO.&nbsp; I updated on line to Windows 8.&nbsp; All operating systems were either included when purchased
 or downloaded so I have no original media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I answer the remaining questions, please note that I have done everything I describe both with a standard boot and a clean boot.&nbsp; If there are differences, I will note which boot&nbsp; was used, otherwise the results are the same with either boot setting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The exact message I get when trying to update to windows 8.1 PRO with media center from the store comes after the download is 72% complete and says (for either boot) is "Something happened and the windows 8.1 couldn't be installed.&nbsp; Please try again.&nbsp;
 Error code 0x8000000a."&nbsp; I also get a pop up that says "This app wasn't installed - view details."&nbsp; When I click to see the details I get no response.&nbsp; The windows shows it searching then closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; The error message about windows folder comes as a result of me running the dism check health, scan health and restore health commands.&nbsp; It is the same for either boot and for each scan.&nbsp; It states "Error: 3 - the directory c:\windows does not appear
 to be a valid windows directory.&nbsp; Ensure that the /windir option that is specified is valid."</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; When I attempted to reinstall windows 8, I did it by going to the Microsoft site&nbsp; entitled "Upgrade Windows with only a product key."&nbsp; I ran it directly from this site and I had it saved to my desktop so I could run it later.&nbsp; Regardless of which way
 I do the installation, it fails to install.&nbsp; Because my machine came with windows 7 PRO preinstalled and I upgraded to windows 8 PROand later added media center via download, I have no original media from which to install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use my standard boot process I immediately get a message that says "Set up is unable to initialize the startup folder."&nbsp; I also get another pop up that sys "Set up is unable to launch install.exe.&nbsp; The directory name is invalid [Error = 0x8007010b]"</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the clean boot process I get a statement that Windows will need to restart several times (It never does) and then it begins the installation process.&nbsp; It gets to 90% complete and I get the message "Windows 8 installation has failed."&nbsp; When I click
 the OK button (the only one provided) it closes everything and returns to my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I had windows check for new drivers and went to the manufacturers to ensure my drivers are current.&nbsp; I also ran the Windows 8.1 upgrade assistant compatibility tool and there were no apps or devices that caused conflicts.&nbsp; Everything showed compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. &nbsp;Other trouble shooting steps I used were the DISM commands to check health, scan health and restore health.&nbsp; The error I got is mentioned in item 3 above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran the refresh PC without&nbsp; affecting your files tool from the settings section.&nbsp; When I ran it using&nbsp;either boot process I got this message : "There was a problem refreshing your PC no changes were made."&nbsp; When I clicked check for solutions there
 were no results.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the windows update reset fix it program.&nbsp; When I used my standard boot process I got this message - "Problems installing recent updates - not fixed.&nbsp; Check for missing or corrupt files - detected.&nbsp; When I clicked on check for solutions there were no
 results.&nbsp; When I did this using the clean boot process I got this message "Problem installing recent updates - not fixed.&nbsp; Check for missing or corrupt files - detected.&nbsp; Service registration is missing or corrupt - failed."&nbsp; Again, no results when I checked
 for solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having problems getting update KB2802618 installed.&nbsp; When I used the clean boot process the first time I ran it I got an error code 80070002.&nbsp; When I clicked to see what it meant there results said the error code couldn't be found.&nbsp; At that point
 my list of installed updates was empty.&nbsp; I ran it again and it said it installed.&nbsp; Every time I check for updates after that I get it to reinstall.&nbsp; Now my list of installed updates showed several attempts over several days to install KB2802618.&nbsp; Some succeeded
 but three failed.&nbsp; The two oldest failures showed error code 80246007 (again this code couldn't be found) and the newest attempt (today's date) showed error code 80070002 (also couldn't be found).&nbsp; When I use my standard boot process, it always says the update
 has been installed but the update list is blank.&nbsp; It appears that I have received no updates since KB2802618 was first sent, which is probably why I can't install Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also reset the windows store.</p>
<p>

            <p>It is now 5/2/14 and still no response from Microsoft.&nbsp; All my problems attempting to update to Windows 8.1 still exist and now because I can't get KB280216 to install, I am unable to obtain and install the patch to internet explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have legal copies
 of the operating system, so I feel that Microsoft has a legal responsibility to get me the products I paid for.&nbsp; They don't seem interested.&nbsp; I wonder if there is anyone with the legal expertise who has considered filing a class action suit against Microsoft
 to force them to live up to their legal responsibilities?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm beginning to think it's time to switch browsers and perhaps abandon all Microsoft operating system products.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your response. I apologize for the long delay in responding to this thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know these information: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2) What are the exact commands that you have used with DISM to check and restore the health of the Operating System?</p>
<p>3) <span>&nbsp;</span>Do you have any external device connected to the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may please try the following methods and let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 1: Disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard)</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please disconnect all the unnecessary external devices connected to the computer (except the mouse and the keyboard) and then check if you still face this issue while installing Windows 8.1. This is to check if the issue is caused by any external devices
 connected to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Method 2: Clear the Store cache</em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may try these steps to clear the Store cache and check if that helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press the “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>R</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</p>
<p>b) Type “<strong><em>wsreset.exe</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</p>
<p>c) Reboot the computer and then try installing the Windows 8.1 update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you are using any third party security program on the computer, then you may also check if this issue is caused by its conflict with the installation process.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><em>Method 3: Temporarily disable the third party security program. (If you have installed any)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></strong></p>
<p>I request you to contact the technical support for the security program to temporarily disable it and then check the status of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Important: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</em></strong></p>

<div><span>In answer to your questions:</span></div>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>1.&nbsp; I have Norton 360 installed (it comes with my Comcast high speed internet connection.&nbsp; I have temporarily disabled it every time I try to install Windows 8.1 so that
 cannot be the problem.&nbsp; I have checked with Norton and they don't know of any compatibility problems.&nbsp; I verified that I am disabling the program correctly.&nbsp; Also, whenever I've done things using the clean boot process (as I explained earlier) I can see that
 Norton is not running, so it can't be interfering with the installation process.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>2.&nbsp; I have done the wsreset.exe process on several occasions with no success.&nbsp; I can see the upgrade app in the store and always have been able to.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>3.&nbsp; I have disconnected all external devices from the computer, except the modem (of course) and still have had no success The only external device I have connected to
 the computer is my printer..</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>I am also concerned that I am not receiving any windows updates.&nbsp; I just keep getting the KB2802618 update to install.&nbsp; When I install it, it says it was successful, but
 it never is and shows up as needed every time I search for new updates.&nbsp; In addition, there are no updates shown as installed when I ask for them to be listed.&nbsp; I just get a blank box.&nbsp; I am particularly concerned now that an update for internet explorer to
 repair the security flaw because I am not getting any news updates.&nbsp; I feel that Microsoft is now putting my security at risk.</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>With respect to the exact dism commands I used they are:</span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>dism /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth<br />
<br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /checkhealth</span></div>
<div><span><br />
dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth </span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span>Is it possible that at some point you at Microsoft will just give up trying to fix this and give me a clean copy so that I can reformat my disk and reinstall the operating
 system?&nbsp; I've already spend a lot of time on this and am getting quite frustrated.</span></div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably don't want to hear this, but at this point I would think for the long term, the best thing to do would be to purchase the necessary media from ASUS to return your machine to FACTORY status...</p>
<p>I would think around $20 US...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So many things may be corrupted by now that it will never work correctly...</p>
<p>Since your Win 8 is an Upgrade version, you need the Disks from ASUS to start fresh...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a very good chance that Norton 360 is in fact causing problems and may need uninstalled...</p>
<p>And not just a normal uninstall, but with their REMOVAL TOOL...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can always put it back in after all of your upgrades are finished...</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Problem after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Sony Vaio Laptop model E series - VPCEB46FG (Original with Windows 7 home premium 64 bit). I upgraded to windows 10 and now all my bluetooth options are gone. I can not see any bluetooth tab in either device manager or settings options (so that
 I can try upgrading the software). I tried installing software from Vaio support page (its for windows 7, not available for windows 10 or 8.1), however it says the software is not compatible so can not be installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not see anything that has bluetooth written in it within any settings options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Dear Deepak</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the help. However I am not able to do anyting that you said because I can not find any option to do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>first I downloaded the driver for windows 7 from sony website (http://www.sony-asia.com/support/product/vpceb46fg) and tried to do what you said. and I got this,</p>
<p>
</p><p>sorry but its not allowing me to paste screenshot here. but essentially it doesnt give me any option to set compatibility mod as you said. there is no property option when I right click the file rather there is one file property option and after clicking
 this no further option is available, it just gives me some information about the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I also tried to download the windows 8.1 driver from Broadcom site. While installing it starts and then goes for a indefinite search for bluetooth device. I waited for 3 hours and then stopped it. So its also not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>can you please help. I am unable to put screen shots here, if you give me some other way I can send you the screensots.</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Most AD Users Cannot Log In - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Most AD Users Cannot Log In</h2>
                    <p>I have just recently inherited the IT Administrator responsibilities for this network. This computer was updated to Windows 10 from Windows 7 about a year or so ago. Only one domain user has ever really used this computer, but other users have been able
 to log into it in the past. Now, only local administrators, the domain administrator, and the primarily user (call her Prime) can log into the computer. All others users put in username and password, the display says welcome, and then logging off. No errors
 occur. The event log (Windows &gt; Security) shows a successful sign on and then an immediate log off, but without errors. Normal event codes.</p>
<p>I created a standard local user (the old way, not using Settings) and it can not log in either until I add it to the administrators group. I have tested adding domain users to the administrators group, but this only allows a login to a Temporary account.
 It does not create a user profile.</p>
<p>I have removed the computer from the domain and re-added it. I have removed all of the user profiles (except Prime) and tried to log in as those users, but no avail. I have checked the registry to insure the login path is correct. I've check the local GP
 to make sure all users are allowed to log in. I've checked AD to make sure the user accounts don't have any computer login limitations. I've tried copying a C:\users\default folder from another Windows 10 computer to replace the one on this machine. I am running
 out of ideas.</p>

 wife's email account to create MICROSOFT login. Searched online but couldn't find solution. Thx for help.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;This Microsoft account you are connecting the Surface to, is it a brand new account you're creating or an existing account?</p>

            Hi DeborahMcGee,
<br />
<br />Homegroup has been removed in the latest Windows 10 upgrade. You can read more about that here: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deployment/planning/windows-10-1803-removed-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/deploy...</a>
<br />
<br />There are built in tools for sharing files and printers on your network without the need for homegroup.

I may be just an End-User to you very smart engineering types there at Microsoft, but it seems to me that you are intentionally trying to make Windows 10 impossible to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the decision to remove Media Centre was interesting, but I'm wondering...just how much slimming down W10 will eventually go through before it's finally as 'useful' as MAC's OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there a TON of other applications out there that can do the same thing as Media Centre and Homegroup, but surely the decision as to whether or which I want to use should be up to the End-User? I get the impression someone at Microsoft has thrown a
 tantrum and doesn't want to play with the other girls and boys. Well, for whatever reason for the sudden shift, it does not bode well. I HAD heard or READ somewhere that MS was getting out of the OS business? This is certainly one way of doing it, but how
 much of your loyal fanbase will you loose along the way?</p>

<p>Sure is shocking that the vile people at Microsoft would take away something many of us use without being clear that they were doing it or having a backup or replacement.&nbsp; People have for YEARS had problems networking home computers together under MS OS,
 MS FINALLY puts out something that doesn't suck and then removes it... yeah now I remember why I stayed with XP and 7 as long as I could.&nbsp; I really hope that Apple or Linux destroys Microsoft and their arrogance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think businesses and individuals would be running away from MS OS and their other super buggy and easily hackable programs as fast as possible.&nbsp; Thanks to businesses NOT doing that the average Joe is stuck with this crap.</p>

            Why is it that Microsoft/Windows can never leave well enough alone!? If something works, then don't mess with it. I refer specifically to Home Group networking. What idiot decided to remove it from the current Windows update? He/she should be identified
 and then immediately fired!

    <title>Windows Media Player&#47;Analog Copyright Protection&#47;TV-Out - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> perzephone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Player&#47;Analog Copyright Protection&#47;TV-Out</h2>
                    My husband and I both run Windows 7 with Windows Media Player 12, vers. 12.0.7600.16667. We both have PCs that are about a year old, with graphics cards &amp; video display set-ups that allow for TV-out connection, with both S-Video &amp; HDMI connectors. Both
 of our PCs have the most updated drivers for our video/graphics cards according to the manufacturer websites (NVIDIA on mine &amp; ATI on his).
<br />
<br />
My computer is not actively set up to display anything on our projection tv (meaning there are no cables currently plugged into the S-Video/HDMI ports), but my husband's is. If I place a commercially recorded DVD in my DVD player, and run it through WMP, it
 will play just fine. However, on my husband's PC, we receive an error that is a variation of, "Windows Media Player cannot play this DVD because there is a problem with the analog copyright protection/Windows media player cannot play this dvd because it is
 not possible to turn on analog copy protection on the output display. Try installing an updated driver for your video card.". We even received one that said it was a problem with analog copyright protection and the resolution of the computer display, which
 makes no sense as copyright protection should have little or nothing to do with the size of the computer screen.
<br />
<br />
Most of the answers I have seen online regarding the 'analog copyright protection' involve uploading new drivers for video/display cards, which rarely seem to solve the problem of WMP not playing commercial DVD movies. I am getting the impression that this
 particular error is NOT a video/display card problem, but a problem with Windows Media Player not allowing for TV-output on older tvs that lack any method of sending information back to the computer. Is there any patch or update available, or coming in the
 near future, that might address this issue?&nbsp;

            I agree. The Reader App is simple to use, has a nice clean screen, and allows me to get away from the distractions of the internet. If I had wanted to read PDFs on a web browser, I could have been doing that all along, as I access most of my papers online.
 I purposely chose to download everything and read them through Reader because I love the format so much. As a consumer, I feel I should be given this choice. I will NOT be using Edge.

<h2>            PROCESS1_INITIALIZATION_FAILED on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>A blue screen (BSOD) is shown during Windows 7 startup. I already deleted bootcat.cache file but the problem persists whenever i reboot the system. Looking for an work around, i've found that replacing bootcat.cache file from another pc would fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, when i turn the computer on, the same BSOD appears, indicting there may be hardware compatibility issues or corrupted system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - lenovo BIOS update &#34; Please load default in BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jw_p  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - lenovo BIOS update &#34; Please load default in BIOS setup menu before executing this program.&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo ideapad 330 and got a popup message that says Lenovo recommends that the BIOS should be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you press the "OK" button it states instruction #5 is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Please load default in BIOS setup menu before executing this program."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So clearly this is concerning, since I have no ideas regarding what the BIOS is set at now, and a single misstep might brick this laptop. I have not changed the BIOS at all since I purchased this laptop and have allowed all of the usual default Windows upgrades
 to occur without any changes from me at all. That is, I have not interfered with any Windows automatic upgrades at all, everything is "standard".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone experienced with this situation, and what action did you take? Did you do the update and did this cause any problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I create a "restore point" first and does this "recovery" utility save the current BIOS settings and restore them correctly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any insights. --jw_p</p>

<p>Lenovo is telling you to reset default values in BIOS … if you haven't changed something, just proceed.</p>
<p>You get to BIOS settings with F1 key at startup (just read instructions for your device on Lenovo web site) or go to Settings/Update and security/Recovery/ … advanced start up then after restart UEFI settings that will take to the BIOS page … go to the last
 page named Restart and load setup defaults (BIOS page with old fashion tabulation, up, down and entry keys).</p>

            Hi jw,
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />It actually is trying to advise you to Reset BIOS settings first, before updating. I haven't done this so I believe there isn't a need to.
<br />
<br />Lenovo Support might better give you an idea on this but I think there is no need to Reset BIOS first.

http://www.midiox.com/desktoprestore.htm</a> . Although the page only mentions up to Vista, I use it in Win7 Ultimate x64 without problems.<br />
