<h2>            Possibly hacked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. I am wondering why two credit cards are not working. I've checked each one and they both have money on them, but when I try to get a new Gold membership on my console, I keep getting a ''Sorry, there's an issue with your account'' pop up. I've asked
 my friends about this, and they think that I was hacked. Was I? If so (or not), how can I secure my account and get the credit cards to work again? Please reply.</p>

    <title>Why NTFS formatted external disk with Win2000Pro can&#39;t be read by - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trebly_auth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why NTFS formatted external disk with Win2000Pro can&#39;t be read by Window7, they are seen as RAW while they are red by XP &#63; Is it a solution without copy &#63;</h2>
                    This question is related with the ancient other one :<br />
How can I get Windows 7 to read RAW hard drives without having to format the hard drive due to important work on it?
<span style="font-weight: bold">It is more focused for me now.</span> And I re-formulate the questions and circumstances<br />
<br />
I have a lot of external disk NTFS formatted (and some little one 40 to 80Go with FAT32).<br />
When I connect the disks I have two possible issues :<br />
<ol>
<li>Good connection</li><li>Window 7 declares the disk unreadable and proposes to format it. Farther we identify that it is seen as RAW&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>When you check the disk with specialized tools everything is OK.</p>
<p>The disk can be red by XP.</p>
<p>I have not the proof (no good history document, but memory... mine), the disk which have problems are old one with medium capacities (120 to 250 Go) so I am quite sure that they have been formatted with W2k (pro). The more recent disk with 500Go capacity
 have no problems, they have been formatted as each one since 10 years in NTFS.</p>
<p>The Fat32 disk seems to be in a different situation, they are old and may be have been formatted with Win98. They come from archives. They appear OK for system checks (MBR, FAT, Read-write by sector, read FAT and look at content to files), but XP too refuses
 to read them as Windows7. May be if I restart a Win2k on an old computer I will have a good surprise.</p>
<p>So my main question is multiple : <br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>Do NTFS (and his couple with MBR) is different between W2k, XP, Vista, Windows 7 ?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it possible to be sure of backward compatibility ?</li><li>Is it possible to make changes so that the W2k NTFS should be readable with Window7 without a copy - re- format re- copy (on 17 To ...)</li><li>How to check the disk to know exactly what it is ? (The tools to check the disk give the type of file-system and many informations but not the system which has generated the disk, this while it seems that there are differences).<br />
</li></ol>
<p>Note : Specialized disk checks proposes to regenerate the MBR, when you ask this action there are for each file-system (and independently) an option to generate the MBR for W2k - XP, Vista, Window7. This seems to show that I am right. It is sure that if
 you generate a MBR with a different system that the one that have generated the FAT you will not get a readable disk on any system.</p>
<p>May be I am wrong, but there are so many facts...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p>Trebly<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>RAW isn't really a file system, it is what Windows reports when it doesn't recognize the file system. The NTFS.sys version (i.e. NTFS v5.0 introduced with Windows 2000) should not be confused with the on-disk NTFS format version (v3.1 since Windows
 XP). The NTFS v3.1 on-disk format is unchanged from the introduction of Windows XP and is used in Windows Vista, and Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>You may </span><span>convert the NTFS 3.0 volume to NTFS 3.1 using Windows XP. Refer the section "Converting NTFS Volumes Formatted by Using Windows 2000” from the link.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457112.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457112.aspx</a></span></p>
<p><span>You may also convert RAW External hard drive file format to NTFS file format. Windows 7 doesn’t read the files until it is formatted.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note : </span></b><span>Formatting erases any existing files on a hard disk. If you format a hard disk that has files on it, the files will be deleted</span></p>

    <title>Email messages keep appearing on desktop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jp_25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email messages keep appearing on desktop</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am having an interesting issue with a user at the office. Namely, Their individual email messages keep appearing on the desktop as envelope icons. **Something to note: every time I would log off and try and log back in after having cleared the desktop, it
 would freeze up and windows explorer would stop responding, at which point I would have to tell the window to close explorer, and then it would fully log into the desktop and the icons would reappear** After I backed up the files in an archive folder, and
 then deleted and rebooted, the icons/messages reappeared. I then thought perhaps this was a virus/malware. I ran a ComboFix scan, but nothing major deleted. Still the issue persists. Next, I did a system restore at a time when the user reported normal functionality
 - again the messages populated the desktop. Finally, I used ccleaner to clean old files and to clean old registry files. After all is said and done the issue still persists. I'm not too sure what to try, or what could be causing this.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
John<br />

<h2>            Devolu&#231;&#227;o de valor de compra onde line por engano</h2>
                    <p>Boa tarde,</p>
<p>Após contato na central de atendimento da Microsoft por não ter milha solicitação resolvida optei por pedir ajudar por aqui e sugerir adequação da política de aquisição nose jogos do XBOX .&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meu filho de 8 anos durante jogo on-line acabou adquirindo um pacote no interior do jogo sem saber que era uma compra&nbsp; real.... Fato que percebi após receber notificação do banco. Diante disto acessei a conta da Microsoft e constatei o fato. Ato continuo
 contatei a central da Microsoft&nbsp; relatando o equívoco e pedindo o entorno do valor por estar dentre dos 7 dias para solicitar reembolsos conforme preconiza o código de defesa do consumidor no Brasil.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Contudo fui surpreendido pela Microsoft falando que por ser compra de um "pacote de consumo" e não o jogo não há&nbsp; reembolso! Aí eu pergunto! O pacote é&nbsp; para um jogo, não foi utilizado, relatei que foi comprado por equívoco&nbsp; ( pois processo de compra ocorreu
 dentro do jogo - para uma criança não é&nbsp; possível afirmar que entenderia se tratar de aquisição verdadeira&nbsp; - meu filho disse " não sabia que era de verdade pai"). Assim, a Microsoft deveria rever seu protocolo de indução de vendas no interior de jogos ( pois
 não pede senha ou destaca que aquisições são verdadeiras ) criar método de verificação&nbsp; em duas etapas inclusive para estas compessoas... fato que evitaria tô estar dor de cabeça e total descaso da empresa em entender o fato corrido e reembolsar o valor de
 um produto que nem vou usar!!!</p>
<p>Espero ter alguma resposta favorável sobre o entorno do valor de produto adquirido de forma equivocada e até mesmo induzida para os usuários dentro de jogos!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aguardo&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            Unable to find any drivers for USB devices</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>I seem to be unable to connect devices via USB and have my Win7 Pro (x64) locate the correct driver for it.</strong></p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I connected a wireless mouse. I placed the USB receiver into my laptop, I saw the little animated icon in the system tray looking like it was installing something, but after about 20 seconds a bubble told me that driver installation
 had failed - a driver could not be located.</p>
<p>This morning I connected a headset (headphones &amp; microphone) via USB and got the same result.</p>
<p>In both cases the devices show up under <em>Other devices</em>&nbsp;with a little exclamation mark.</p>
<p>Also, in both cases I could connect the same devices into another laptop (Win7 Ult. x64) and both the mouse and the headset work as expected, but on my laptop the drivers cannot be located.</p>
<p>In the case of the mouse, I found which driver the other laptop had installed for it, located the same on my laptop (it was installed) and manually assigned this driver to the device, but was then told that the device could not be started.</p>
<p>I've placed my system disk back in the drive and asked it to search the disk for drivers, but that doesn't turn up anything either.</p>
<p>Short of re-installing Windows (which I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
do not</span>&nbsp;want to do), can anyone suggest what might be going wrong?</p>

<p>I've got it working.</p>
<p>What I eventually did was to perform a repair install of the OS. Ok, so I now have around 100 updates to download, but aside from my wallpaper changing, nothing else seems to be disturbed.</p>
<p>And the first time I booted up after the repair install, I connected both the wireless mouse and the headset and voila! Both had their drivers automatically installed and were running within about 10 seconds.</p>
<p>So the issue wasn't that their are no Win7-compatible drivers. It must have been something done to my OS that prevented it from recognising which driver new USB devices should need.</p>
<p>Thanks for all your suggestions.</p>

You should get into the habit of thinking of backup.&nbsp;&nbsp;E.g. if you have spent a lot of time and effort composing consider the possibility that if the send fails you may lose what you're sending; so at least before clicking Submit, press Ctrl-a, Ctrl-c; then
 you would have your typing saved in your ClipBoard so that it could be pasted into a second reply frame.&nbsp; N ote that ClipBoard data is very transitory so if there is any possibility that you are going to be using the ClipBoard&nbsp;for something else first, you
 would be wiser to paste it into a Notepad window and thus have it saved a bit more permanently.&nbsp; Wiser still to actually use the Notepad window to do a Save As...&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g.. in case you were visualizing the possibility of having a power failure or system crash
 before you finally posted that copy of your composition.&nbsp; ; )<br />
<br />
BTW both of your problems aren't really problems with IE but issues with different aspects of your OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. your first could be caused by an idle timeout of 10 minutes on your&nbsp;connection to the Internet while your second could be caused by having a 10 minute
 idle timeout before your screensaver starts.<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>As Robert has mentioned, if you have set the screen saver time as ten minutes, then the monitor will turn off automatically
 if there is no activity on the <br />
computer &nbsp;for ten minutes.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</span>1.</span><span><span>
</span></span><span>Right click on a empty space on the desktop and click on
<strong>Personalize.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Click on the
<strong>Screen Saver</strong> link at the bottom of the window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3.</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Below the screen saver drop down menu if the time is set
 as 10 minutes, you can increase the time.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4.</span><span><span>
</span></span><span>Click on Apply and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t help,&nbsp; then I suggest you to change the power plan on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer these links for more information:</span></p>
<p><span>You may also create a new power plan and check if it helps.</span></p>

    <title>Pairing controllers wirelessly. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drose4rizzle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pairing controllers wirelessly.</h2>
                    <p>So, I have a controller that I want to connect via Bluetooth. I have a desktop and I also have a Bluetooth adapter. Whenever I go to add the controller, I see the symbol, start pairing with it, but I never get asked to enter a pairing code which ultimately
 ends in the failure of the pairing. How can I work this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(By the way, I'm using a DualShock 4 Controller. The Bluetooth dongle I got only came in a package&nbsp; with a CD and that was it.)&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anybody could post an answer that would be great!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>It's possible that you're not able to pair your controller due to incompatibility with
 the Bluetooth adapter.&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>We'd like to learn more about your concern so we could provide the proper resolution. We just have a few questions
 for you:</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span><span>Just to confirm, did your Bluetooth adapter come with the controller when you bought
 it?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Have you checked the manufacturer's website for additional software needed to use the
 controller in Windows 10, since this controller is specifically built for a game console?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Were you able to install the Bluetooth drivers through the CD without any problems?</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Are you able</span> to connect other Bluetooth devices to your computer through the Bluetooth adapter?</p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Whenever you try to pair the controller, do you get an error message? If yes, please
 post a screenshot.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</span></span><span>
<br />
</span></p>

<p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: The Bluetooth adapter was a separate purchase.</p>
<p>2: Yes and I found nothing.</p>
<p>3: I did install the drivers through the CD but an application called CSR Harmony is what is being installed.</p>
<p>4: To be honest, none of my devices have Bluetooth, so no.</p>
<p>5. Yes. I will show you the message I get along with the process of pairing.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b2af249-2940-406e-9d0b-abb64b83383f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9b2af249-2940-406e-9d0b-abb64b83383f" /></a></p>

<p>No prompt to enter a pairing code shows up resulting in the message above.</p>
<p>6:I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, using several different YouTube videos to try and solve the problem. (This all was very frustrating trying this and that for over 3 hours straight.)</p>

<h2>            Game update wasn&#39;t starting, so I restarted my Xbox One, game is deleted afterwards</h2>
                    <p>Well as the title described, I had a game update (for Red Dead Redemption 2) on the 11th of December, but it wouldn't start downloading.</p>
<p>I restarted my Xbox One and came to the conclusion that the whole game was deleted... This is kind of frustrating as RDR2 is 90GB to download, and while my internet is fast, it still takes around 3 hours to download and install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some way to make sure this doesn't happen in the future?</p>

<p>Hey Jaydee thanks for taking the time to bring this issue to us!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We suggest, if it hasn't already been done, to clear the Game Cache since the corrupted file could be left on the console even after the content is deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<div>
<p>How to clear Game Cache on the Xbox One:<br />
Settings</p>
<p>System<br />
Storage<br />
Clear Local Saved Games&nbsp;<br />
Yes and Restart&nbsp;<br />
<strong>IF THE CONSOLE IS CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET</strong> no progress or purchase data will be lost, what we accomplish by doing these steps would be to resync the profile to
 the cloud getting rid of any corruption as a byproduct.&nbsp;<br />
Give these steps a shot and let us know if we can further assist in this or any other issues or inquiries!!&nbsp;</p>

            Some games instead of just changing and adding to the original game install the entire updated game. I do not know if this is the case with your particular game but based on the behaviour you describe it is probably the case. There is no way to know before
 you start the update either unfortunaly as thr size of the update doesn't show until after the update has begun. This is up to the developer as to how they want to apply the update. If the update is big enough or changes key parts of the game sometimes this
 is the best way to prevent further problems.

            Enable the built-in Administrator per the instructions below and log into it. Disable the incorrectly setup parental controls and create users per the recommendations at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
<span>If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [press Enter]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Remove the installation DVD and reboot the computer. Now you will be able to log into the built-in Administrator account.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Windows 7 installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Windows 7 System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the same one where you can choose Safe
 Mode. Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Windows 7 Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2009/windows-7-system-repair-discs/</a>
<br />
<span><br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as
<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. If you are creating the bootable DVD in an older operating system (XP, Vista), you will need to use third-party
 burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a> ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively.<br />
<br />
Once you have fixed things, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions below and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP, Vista and all other modern operating systems, Windows 7 is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges in Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult.&nbsp;</span> <span>
It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may be more than you want to do. Better not to put yourself into a bad situation to begin with.</span>
<span><br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

            Hi  Poppins0294
<br />
<br />Did you install the Lite version of Windows 10 or did you install the genuine version of Windows 10. It would be highly unusual to not have the Windows 10 UWP apps after a clean installation.
<br />
<br />If you installed the Lite version of Windows 10, those Apps cannot be added into that version, because the underlying framework has been removed from Windows 10
<br />
<br />Where did you get that Windows 10 installation Media?       
        </p>

            One of my friend has installed it for me. He downlaoded it from his computer because he got genuine Windows installed with his new Laptop. So, I took his help. I am not sure about Lite version, what does it mean but he said that this OS is purely configured
 for speed purpose. So, I am not sure but it might be the light version. Is there any possible way to check or something?<br />

            Hi Poppins0294
<br />
<br />Yes if your friend says his version is purely configured for speed, it is the Lite version of Windows 10 and that underlying infrastructure is missing . . .
<br />
<br />That is not an official release of Windows 10, if you want to be able to use the Microsoft Store and all the UWP apps, you will need to swap over to the full version of Windows 10, it won't cost anything, but it will mean you will have to clean install Windows 10
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />

<br />Save that file to your Desktop and close the Snipping Tool

                    <p>I'm trying to trace the logon and logoff times on a desktop. <br />
<br />
I'm aware of xperf's boot traces which includes the logon info (Winlogoninit and ExplorerInit) but that includes rebooting my desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would like to just trace my logon and logoffs that would include the services that start up/pnp/and possibly the winlogoninit and explorer phases, without rebooting. Since I'm assuming rebooting may impact the time of a logon vs. just loginning on a desktop.
</p>
<p><br />
Are there any programs that can trace logons/logoffs? </p>
<p><br />
If anyone has any ideas or input, Itd be greatly appreciated! </p>

Thank you, I've actually seen the page before. Is there another way to trace logon without switching users?

            I only due regular updates, i don't ever change anything that I can think of. I've done the troubleshooting updates from the help section and the Fix-It thing you linked me to. After it ran, windows update told me that there were no updates to install...until
 I restarted later tonight and the updates came back. I checked and those three updates have never been successfully installed (listed as failed several times with none successful) &nbsp;I'm about to try the clean boot followed by Method 3 if that doesn't work.
 I'll let you know, and thanks for the help!

    <title>Remote NDIS Network Adapter BSoD Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote NDIS Network Adapter BSoD Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently been tethering a lot with my Android phone on my Win7x64 PC and each time I tether the Remote NDIS network connection disables itself after a few hours and the USB port my phone is connected to stops sending power. The phone still believes
 it's connected till I stop tethering and then it too doesn't detect the USB port. I can plug it into another USB port at this point but the only way to get everything working again is by shutting down which causes a BSoD with the error BUGCODE_USB_DRIVER.
 But after that the computer works well till it randomly loses the connection in the same manner. I did find a post explaining that it was the NDIS 5 drivers causing the issue but switching to the NDIS 6 drivers in Win7 didn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few things that may help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom built PC with all drivers (chipset etc) up to date.</li><li>Happens with usb8023x.sys and usb80236.sys drivers.</li></ul>

            <p>Hello Niranjan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply. I went ahead with you suggestion and tried Driver Verifier but it was inconclusive when watching usbhub.sys (mentioned in the BSoDs). This is a screenshot of it while experiencing the symptoms mentioned in the OP:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/933ba85a-6ade-4ca4-a759-f90cff607e64" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/933ba85a-6ade-4ca4-a759-f90cff607e64" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks fine to me. I watched the usb80236.sys driver as well but that appeared to be fine too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I took a few more steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalled and reinstalled all USB Controllers using Device Manager.</li><li>Disabled USB Selective Suspend.</li></ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I am still experiencing the issue. Is there anything else you think would help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h3> janeroberts_cham  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to add an html email signature to Windows 10 Mail</h2>
                    <p>I'd like to know how to add my html email signature to Windows Mail. It works for outlook, but when I add it via the signature window it looks fine, but anyone receiving the signature also receives attachments of the images even though the images are hosted
 on my server...so I am wondering how to amend it so that my images are not embedded/attached on sending the email, or perhaps there is a better way to implement the html signature?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I say, Outlook is fine, but Mail is not working properly. What am I doing wrong? Or perhaps it cannot cope with html emails with hosted images?<br />

            Hello 
<br />I'm Peter F  independent  Advisor 
<br />
<br />Looks like the windows mail doesn't accept hosted images.
<br />I would recommend creating the HTML again.
<br />How to create the HTML 
<br />Open up your email program.
<br />From the File menu, click New and then Mail Message. The New Message window opens.
<br />From the Insert menu, select Picture… (Live Mail users select Insert | Image | Inline…)
<br /> Navigate to the image file you wish to insert.
<br />Click the Open button. Your image should show in the New Message window.
<br /> Optionally, you may add text.
<br />From the File menu, select Save As…
<br />Type your File name and select HTML as the file type.
<br />Close the open window.
<br />How link  the HTML 
<br />From the Tools menu, select Options.
<br /> Click the Signatures tab.
<br />In the Signatures section, click the New button.
<br />In the Edit Signature section, select the radio button for File.
<br /> Click the Browse… button.
<br /> Navigate to the HTML file you just created. You may need to change the file types list to HTML Files.
<br />Highlight your file and click Open.
<br />Check your desired Signature settings.
<br /> Click OK.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> in the documentation Say 
<br />You can't create hyperlinks, change the font or font color of your signature, or add images.
<br />
<br />A signature is either on or off for a specific account. If you turn a signature off for one or all accounts, you can't add the signature manually while creating a new message.
<br />in this link below you can see this note 
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create-a-signature-in-mail-for-windows-10-c07a46ad-8258-45b1-926a-4429a0aa1f9a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/create...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope it helps

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps.
<br />Windows Mail cannot have html signature.
<br />
<br />Better way to implement the html signature:
<br />Copy and past html from browser to the end of email 
<br />You can make a program or web to do so (getting email ---adding signature--&gt;send it to you or whom you want ,
<br />Add a clickable link and you can design a html page using java script or linking to an html page
<br />

            Do you have a box that plugs into the power in your wall and has a battery in it so that if the actual flow of electricity stops, anything plugged into certain ports in that box will continue to function for some finite amount of time (until the battery
 runs down)?

<h2>            Alt key stuck most of the time</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having serious problems with the Alt key getting&nbsp;stuck randomly but very very often to the extent that I can't log in, I can't write an email, browse the web or use my computer properly.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da52e5bd-071a-4dd4-b788-84e5513a137e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/da52e5bd-071a-4dd4-b788-84e5513a137e?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>The problem started when I had to reinstall my system recently due to a hard drive crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some facts:</p>
<p>- My Microsoft Natural main keyboard is not faulty. I have tried 3-4 different keyboards so far. They all behave the same.</p>
<p>- My system was functioning perfectly before the latest re-installation.</p>
<p>- My mouse is not faulty. I have a Logitech wireless mouse. I tried to use my system with other no-name&nbsp;USB&nbsp;mouses. The same behaviour remains...</p>
<p>- I haven't added or changed any hardware or software since the problem started to occur.</p>
<p>- Since the problem appeared, I can't use left Alt/Shift in order to switch between my languages.</p>
<p>- I have 3 PCs set up&nbsp;in my house based on my Microsoft account: My main computer and 2 more used by my 2 children.</p>
<p>- When the problem occurs, the only way to go ahead is to either bring on the Virtual Keyboard and press the Right Alt key, then the Left Alt hoping it gets unstuck or log out/restart the machine. Unfortunately, the virtual keyboard trick doesn't always
 help...</p>
<p>- I needed to bring on the virtual keyboard and press right Alt, Alt in order to unstuck the Alt key, about 15 times&nbsp;writing this message so far...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been researching the problem for far too long to remain still sane. I know that I made the mistake to add a US-International keyboard at some point and I've read a lot of times that it could bring me such problems when used in combination with other
 keyboards. I am a Greek National living in Germany so I have 3 languages and 3 keyboard layouts installed. Needless to say that I have removed the US-International keyboard since I read about it but my situation did not improve.<br />
</p>
<p>I have also read that this behaviour could be because of Profile syn settings between my PCs and my Microsoft account. I have in each PC added again (just in case...) and then removed the US-International keyboard, disabled profile sync settings and then
 went online and removed settings from each device under my account. The problem remains...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a person to ask easily for help, I like to research my problems and provide my own solution but I am afraid that I can't take it any longer. I need help from a person that knows more about this issue and can advise me accordingly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP!</p>

<p>Hi Panos2000,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the details on your post, this can definitely help us identify the problem. Reloading the windows driver might do the trick. Try these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the <strong>Start</strong> menu button, and click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong>Keboards</strong> to expand.</li><li>Right-click on <strong>HID Keyboard Device</strong> or any similar keyboard driver and select
<strong>Uninstall device</strong>.</li><li>Restart your computer and Windows will automatically reinstall the latest available driver.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, you can download the <strong><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=849754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Mouse and Keyboard Center 3.2</a></strong> for your Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, I would like to know if you are experiencing the issue on a different user profile as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
        </p>

<p>Adrianne, thank you so much for looking into this! This issue is really driving me nuts (as you can imagine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately no...</p>
<p>I uninstalled the driver as suggested, both a generic "HID Keyboard Device" as well as a "Microsoft USB Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 (Mouse and Keyboard Center)" were present under Keyboards in Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted but the issue was still there (I log in using a picture cause I usually have no keyboard access during login).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue does persist and it is also present on another account that I have created since last week on my PC which is NOT linked to a Microsoft account, it is just a local one. I do have to mention however that I had selected to copy my language and region
 settings to welcome screens and new user accounts so I'm not so sure if this helps...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have started to make plans on where exactly to build your statue, hired a sculptor, etc. Please come up with another suggestion...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>
<p>Panos</p>

<p>Thanks for getting back to us.</p>

</p><p>This almost sounds like a certain program is making the Alt key stuck. To find out, I would suggest doing a clean boot. This is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that
 occur when you install a program or an update. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Start</strong>, search for <span><em>msconfig</em>.</span></li><li>Select <span><strong>System Configuration</strong></span> from the search results.<br />
<br />
<span>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f4013453_en_1" /></div>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li>On the <strong><span>Services</span></strong> tab of the <span>
System Configuration</span> dialog box, click to select the <span>
<strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong></span> check box, and then click <span>
<strong>Disable all</strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<span>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f4013455_en_1" /></div>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <span>
System Configuration</span> dialog box, tap or click <span><strong>Open Task Manager</strong></span>.<br />
<br />
<span>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f4013456_en_1" /></div>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab in Task Manager, for each startup item, select the item and then click
<span>Disable</span>.<br />
<br />
<span>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fmsegceporticoprodassets.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f4013457_en_1" /></div>
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li><li>Close Task Manager.</li><li>On the <strong><span>Startup</span></strong> tab of the <span>
System Configuration</span> dialog box, tap or click <strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then restart the computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, starting your PC in safe mode could also help. This is a stricter process which starts Windows on its basic state leaving only a limited set of drivers like your mouse and keyboard. Check this article to see how to perform

<p>It seems that Turtle Blocks runs from within something called Sugar, this Sugar program is started by booting your computer into Sugar from a bootable CD or bootable USB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try Sugar</p>
<p>"You can try Sugar by downloading it to a CD or USB key and then using it to boot your desktop or laptop computer. (Sugar will not change anything on your computer—it uses the USB instead of your hard disk.) You can introduce Sugar to your child’s school
 using USB sticks as well. With Sugar, children grow into confident, joyful learners and realize their unlimited potentials."</p>

<p>It's not a Windows file type. The file is opened by an application called Sugar, which you have to download from the same company. From their page:</p>
<p>"Originally developed for the One Laptop per Child XO-1 netbook, Sugar runs on most computers. Sugar is free/libre and open-source software."</p>
<p>The Sugar software is linux based so they are recommending&nbsp; you install it on a USB thumb drive that you can boot the computer from, if your computer is capable of this. Or&nbsp;there is a version you can run&nbsp;in a virtual machine running in VirtualBox.</p>

<p>Hi Rose,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick reply. &nbsp;I have since learned more about this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right click on the mp3 file and select "Properties", there it states that the length is 08:06. &nbsp;Yet when I play it on Media Player, it runs to 08:11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I solved the problem simply by making a new file with Audacity while playing the original mp3 file on Media Player. &nbsp;I used the new file with Movie Maker and it worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, brain-dead, low-tech "solution", but it fixes my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There must be something wrong with the original mp3 file. &nbsp;But since I now have the movie I want I am not going to look into this further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />Once you perform a factory reset all your personal data will be wiped out from your device and it will seem as a new one. If you follow the instructions reported on Microsoft site, all will be done perfectly without any risk for your privacy.
<br />Please let me know if you have more doubts or if this solves your doubts.
