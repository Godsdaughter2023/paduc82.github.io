<h2>            Intel 82579V Network Adapter Not Working Since Windows 10 Clean Install</h2>
                    <p>I have carried out a clean install of windows 10 (previously used windows 7) . Since changing to windows 10 my intel network adapter is not detected at start up. The model is shown in device manager as 82579LM after I click on scan for hardware changes in
 the device manager an ethernet connection is established and the device model changes to 82579V. I have tried installing drivers but this does not solve the problem. I have an ASUS P8Z77-V motherboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read extensively on these forums and internet and not found a solution that works. I have contacted both ASUS and intel and the solutions they offered have not worked either.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I have already contacted intel and ASUS I am wondering if Microsoft could please address this issue. I have read on the internet that lots of people have experienced network adpater issues since updating to Windows 10. I am wondering if this is more that
 just a driver issue, is there something in Windows 10 that is preventing my network adpater from being detected?</p>

<p>I have had a response from ASUS today, please see below and advise what is the next course of action.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid ASUS is not responsible for what Microsoft recommends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ASUS can only recommend using the ASUS product as it was designed and supported. Please note that regardless of when you purchased the motherboard, the model is outdated and support is limited. We can only recommend using Windows 7 for full support regarding
 your hardware.</p>

<h2>            Shadow muted on minecraft for 9 months. When does it end&#63;</h2>
                    HI. I have had my account for a while so I'm not sure if it's actually 9 months or more but I do know that it is really annoying not being able to use chat. Does anyone know how long these things last or how I can get unmuted? Thanks in advance.

            Shadow muted is where you're muted on all featured servers. On my end everything looks fine but nobody sees my chat messages. I have every possible setting I could find relating to ingame chat set to not restrict so I know it's not a setting I have to
 change even though xbox support was adamant that it was

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>you need to have the drive partition as unallocated space and then create the new partition when installing the Windows 10, you can try the below workaround to fix this problem.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Delete all the partition which are already created and make it as unallocated space.<br />
<strong>STEP 2: </strong>Now insert the Windows 10 installation media and start the installation process.<br />
<strong>STEP 3: </strong>In the installation you will be going to a steps where it asks for the partition to install, just select the “Drive options” from there instead of selecting a partition which is already there.<br />
<strong>STEP 4:</strong> Now with the unallocated space -&gt; Create a new partition.<br />
<strong>STEP 5:</strong> Finish the installation process. </div>
<div>
<p>if the issue persist I would suggest you to refer the below article.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 64 bit &#34;Windows is loading files&#34; reboot loop. This - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit &#34;Windows is loading files&#34; reboot loop.  This is not a question, but a tutorial of sorts.</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased an Asus G73JH laptop at Best Buy two days ago.&nbsp; Let me stress that I was and still am happy with this computer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 Home 64 bit </li><li>Intel Core i7 </li><li>ATI Mobility Radeon 5870 GPU </li></ul>
<p>After uninstalling bloatware, installing Avast 5.0 free edition and updating the virus definitions, I updated my stock device drivers from the Asus site (there are some compatibility issues when updating from the respective hardware provider's sites) and
 rebooted.&nbsp; After the reboot I configured Windows to my taste and rebooted to ensure that the settings were saved if the computer should happen to freeze.&nbsp; When Windows started again, I used Windows Update while I began the process of transferring my files
 from my external hard drive.&nbsp; These files are all clean, and pass deep scans with all search options enabled in Avast 5.0 free and Malwarebytes 1.46 paid version.&nbsp; When the transfer was complete, there were 26 updates waiting to be installed and I chose the
 option to install before shutting down.&nbsp; When the installation was completed the computer shut down and I hit the power button to turn it back on.&nbsp; I saw a black screen and a status bar that said "windows is loading files" before the standard Windows 7 start
 screen loaded.&nbsp; After that screen, a very generic background appeared with the busy icon quickly replacing the cursor.&nbsp; It idled for about 10 seconds and rebooted.&nbsp; The loop was infinite.&nbsp; Please note that I
<strong>did not</strong> create backup discs after I got my system where I wanted it.&nbsp; I intended to do so after the updates so that the backup would be complete.</p>
<p>Here is what I found while trying to fix this, in no particular order:</p>
<ul>
<li>None of the options given after pressing F8 allowed windows to boot.&nbsp; Safe mode loaded to the safe mode screen in Windows without hanging up on any files and rebooted after idling for a seconds.&nbsp; Disabling the automatic restart after failure only brought
 the Blue Screen Of Death, notifying me of a memory dump. </li><li>The system repair disc that I made on a different computer after this happened loaded fine, but there were absolutely no errors shown in any of the tests it performed.</li><li>System restore does not fix the problem. </li><li>A Windows XP home with SP3 installation disc will ask to format the partition.&nbsp; This was unacceptable because I needed the data I had<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">moved</span> from my external drive.
</li><li>I tried Linux Zorin, Pardus, Ubuntu, and Xubuntu but none of them would allow me to access the Windows file structure.&nbsp; These all loaded off of their respective discs, so I knew it was not a hardware failure or malfunction.</li><li>My recovery partition loaded properly, but again, this was not an option.&nbsp; I just needed to see if it was intact.</li><li>I was able to choose the load drivers option and from there I could access my file structure.&nbsp; I was also able to copy folders to my external hard drive after plugging it in.&nbsp; Note that when doing this it does not give confirmation of the copy and paste.&nbsp;
 Be patient.&nbsp; Also, it only copies folders and all of their contents.&nbsp; Nothing in the folders will show up using this method and you will not be able to choose specific files.</li><li>Since Windows did not fully load, I was unable to use services.msc. </li><li>Using the repair disc to load a command shell worked, but I was unable to launch the control panel to manually uninstall the updates so I do not know if it would have made a difference.&nbsp; If anyone has a command-line entry within the command shell (not in
 the RUN command within Windows) that will open Control Panel, please post it here.</li><li>I was able to access the registry through the shell, but I do not know the appropriate values to change so I did not alter it.&nbsp; I'm only saying this in case someone that is familiar with editing the registry has this problem.&nbsp; They might be able to find
 a fix. </li><li>There are absolutely no forums that have a universal fix to this error. </li><li>I did not think of trying to open Windows Explorer from command until now.&nbsp; Doing this may have allowed my to move files or uninstall.&nbsp; I do not know.</li><li>Microsoft cannot fix this error. </li><li>By using the recovery partition after I dumped my data, I found that it will give the option to make a new partition on the same drive.&nbsp; I did not choose this option because I had what I needed, I did not want a dual installation of windows, and I did not
 know if the file structure on the first OS would remain intact.&nbsp; I did a full reset and am typing this on the laptop in question.&nbsp; Again, there are no hardware issues.&nbsp; I have updated everything and backed it up, but I am keeping automatic updates off.&nbsp; If
 you do this, you will want to go to your taskbar and open the Action Center (not the automatic updates window).&nbsp; There is an option to no longer receive notifications about that error.&nbsp; I enabled it.</li></ul>
<p>I finally called Microsoft Technical Support at 800-642-7638 (800-MICROSOFT) to get help.&nbsp; If this happens to you, save yourself some time by asking to be transferred to a Windows 7 specialist.&nbsp; Despite answering the automated system's questions, I did not
 get through to the right division when it first rang through.&nbsp; I had to explain the problem twice.&nbsp; When the tech picks up and goes through the formalities, explain the problem.&nbsp; After they confirm what your support question is regarding, tell them what you
 have tried to fix the issue at hand because it will help speed the process.&nbsp; The tech that I spoke to researched it for a few minutes and his response was that I had already tried everything.&nbsp; My remaining option was to back my files up.&nbsp; If this is happening
 to you, you might need to cut your losses and reformat or do a full system recovery.&nbsp; The tech taught me how to transfer specific files using the notepad.&nbsp; I will include the entire process for those that are not familiar with it.</p>
<ol>
<li>Boot from a Windows 7 repair disc.&nbsp; If you are not given the option to boot from CD or DVD after inserting the repair disc, restart your computer and press F2 when the first screen comes up.&nbsp; This should take you to your BIOS, but the specific key may be
 different on your unit.&nbsp; If F2 does not work, refer to your computer handbook or user guide.&nbsp; In the BIOS, locate the portion that allows you to change device boot order.&nbsp; When you find it, move your DVD drive to the top of the list.&nbsp; This is usually done
 by pressing + or minus, but may be F5 and F6 depending on your BIOS.&nbsp; There should be instructions on the screen.&nbsp; After you have done this, choose to save your configuration and exit.&nbsp; When the computer reboots, you should see a message that tells you to
 press any key to boot from CD or DVD.&nbsp; Do this.</li><li>Inside the repair disc there is an option to load a command prompt.&nbsp; Click this.</li><li>Connect the removable drive you wish to transfer files to. </li><li>Inside the shell, type the word "notepad" without the quotation marks and press Enter.&nbsp; It should load notepad, but if it does not you can try typing: "C:<strong>"</strong> and pressing Enter.&nbsp; Again, and in any future examples, do not type the quotes.&nbsp;
 When the directory changes, type "notepad" and press Enter.&nbsp; If notepad does not load, I don't know what to offer.&nbsp; If it does, go to the File menu, and click Open.&nbsp; When the box pops up, there will be a drop-down menu that has by Text Files" selected by default.&nbsp;
 Change this to "All Files" and browse to the folder you need to access.&nbsp; If it is in "My Documents", you will find it by going to C:, then going to Users, then choosing whatever folder has your name or profile under it.&nbsp; It will probably not be the Administrator
 folder.&nbsp; You should now be able to select the files and folders you want to copy.</li><li>Go back to the shell without closing the open window and type "notepad" again, hitting Enter afterward.&nbsp; If you are unable to see the command shell, close the "Open" window, move the notepad to the side, and move the shell to a corner of your screen.&nbsp; Then
 browse back to the folders you need.&nbsp; Once the second Notepad opens, go to Files &gt; Open again, but this time go to the removable drive and open it.&nbsp; You will want to move and re-size the windows until you are able to able to see both sets of your files at
 once. </li><li>Left-click the folder you wish to copy over, and drag it to the open window for your removable drive.&nbsp; You will not see confirmation that anything is happening, but you should move your cursor to the folders you are moving files from.&nbsp; It will change to
 a cursor with a square and a plus-sign (+) below and to the right of the cursor itself.&nbsp; When the cursor changes back to normal, the transfer is done.&nbsp; If you are moving small files, it may be quick enough that you will not get a change in the cursor.&nbsp; If
 it is normal when hovering over&nbsp; the first window, it is done.&nbsp; Also, you will not be able to switch windows or browse while the transfer is happening.&nbsp; When you are able to affect the windows or folders, your transfer had completed.&nbsp; Once you have transferred
 a folder or file, right-click on the file/folder and select "Properties".&nbsp; Note the size of the directory or file on the disk.&nbsp; Then do the same in your removable drive to confirm that all of the data has transferred without errors.&nbsp; If the sizes do not match,
 repeat the process until they done.</li></ol>
I hope this helps.&nbsp; I will be posting it in many forums.<br />

            You have just saved my life. Usually when people say "Save my life" they mean it in a non literal sort of way. I mean it literally. My computer is my life/job and I nearly lost all of my data. WIthout the data I would have lost my job. No money. No house.
 End of the world. You are amazing. Thank you so much for going to such great lengths to help us out.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Ntoskrnl.exe manages the running of the Cache Manager, the Executive, the Kernel, the Security Reference Monitor, the Memory Manager,
 and the Scheduler and other system services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform a clean boot and check if there are any third party software or program causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform a clean boot</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Go through the article below and follow the procedure.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: You must
 log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the
 original error message, or experience the original behaviour if the problem still exists.</span></p>
<p><span>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend
 that you do not use the System Configuration utility to change the advanced boot options on the computer unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope the information helps. Please keep us posted on the issue. We will be happy to assist you further.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am getting blue screens every now and then. I'm not sure what is triggering it other than possible driver conflicts (ASUS Smart Gesture, ASUS ATKpackage, Realtek HD audio) but I have already tried to target those drivers one-by-one. If someone is able
 to help me decode this blue screen dump it would be very much appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Due to some of the site restrictions we are unable to analyze the minidump file link you have attached in the above description.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please provide us with details on the below asked questions to assist you further on the issue.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Since when are you facing the above issue, did you make any system changes prior to the issue?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>What is the error message/error code received when the BSOD occurs on the PC?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Have you installed all the latest Windows Updates on the PC?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>BSOD errors are caused mostly due to the incompatible, corrupted or non-updated device drivers installed on the PC. The errors also occur if any of the programs/applications
 are installed which is not compatible with the operating system.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have mentioned the issue may not be driver specific, check if the BSOD is triggered due to any of the recently installed application/program by uninstalling
 the same on the PC. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists,
</span><span>perform <strong>
<span>System restore</span></strong> by following the steps from the link below and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you think an app, update, software or a driver that you recently installed or uninstalled caused problems with your PC, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a
<strong><span>restore point</span></strong>.
<strong>System Restore</strong> doesn’t change your personal files, but it might remove recently installed apps and drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to<strong><span>Restore from a system restore point
</span></strong>from the link below:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></strong></a></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Though it is said that
<strong>System Restore</strong> does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>During <strong>
System Restore</strong>, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss
 of important files as well.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After performing system restore, install all the updates and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Write to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>

<h2>            Win Explorer in Win 10 refreshing every few seconds.</h2>
                    <p>Updated from win 8 (hated it) to win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than a noticeable lag when loading several programs including Google and Firefox, and a subsequent lag on those browsers after they are loaded, &nbsp;my biggest gripe is Explorer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what you are doing in a folder, it refreshes the screen and resets your view to the top of the page every few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are attempting to move a few files it will copy them to the same directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I shouldn't be, I am still constantly surprised at software that's been released with Obvious flaws. &nbsp;I still wonder if the code writers actually use the software.</p>

<h3> kc_russell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Ignores power settings and hibernates after 5 minutes</h2>
                    Recently applied the 8.1 upgrade for my PC (Dell Vostro 200). Now the device ignores the power settings and hibernates after approx 5 minutes of user inactivity.
<div>The device goes into hibernation regardless of any running processes (e.g. ignores streaming video or Windows Home Server backup process).</div>
<div>Video drivers up to date</div>
<div>BIOS up to date</div>
<div>Have run power settings troubleshooter which reset power settings to "Balanced".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise. This appears to be related to 8.1 upgrade.</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            Thanks for your reply, but this makes no difference.
<div>There are no updates for me to apply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Since I upgraded to 8.1, the power settings are simply ignored, and the PC hibernates after 5 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is a Windows bug - if you search the internet, a number of people are reporting this problem, and it seems Microsoft are unable to provide a solution. All I see are suggestions to reset the power schemes or upgrade drivers.</div>

<div><br />
<div>In safe boot mode, the computer appears to shut down correctly after 10 minutes.
<div><br />
<div>I have not performed the clean boot procedure, because this appears to involve disabling every service one by one. If I do this and have to test the time out on each occasion, this is a very time consuming operation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As I said originally, the computer has been working correctly on Windows 8. The problem with the power settings has occurred since the 8.1 upgrade. I have not changed any other services or added or removed programmes on the computer. The computer just
 ignores the power settings and hibernates after approximately 5 minutes, regardless of other activity.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am now having to manually invoke my WHS backups, and keep the computer active &nbsp;manually until each backup completes.</div>

<div>I have disabled all services with msconfig, disabled all start up services in Task Manager, and performed the clean boot.</div>
<div><b>My PC still ignores my power settings and hibernates after 5 minutes.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I also created a new "Always On" power plan &nbsp;with screen and computer sleep set to "Never".
<b>The computer still hibernates after 5 minutes, even with a clean boot.</b></div>
<div><br />
<div>I am still having to back up my PC manually using Windows Home Server, because the automated backup is always interrupted by the PC hibernating.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As per my original post, this appears to be a Windows 8.1 operating system problem. Please advise how I can resolve this.</div>

            Sorry to hear you have the same problem. Lots of people seem to have problems with Win 8 refusing to stay asleep, but I was starting to think I was the only person experiencing the opposite problem.
<div><br />
<div>I would like to get some more suggestions about how to debug the problem. I have tried disabling all my services and startup activities, as recommended, and the same problem occurs, which reinforces my belief that this is something to do with the 8.1 update.
 That's the only thing that has changed on my PC. Whatever is making the PC hibernate seems to be running completely independently of my power settings.</div>

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><span>Hi, friends. For days, I have been frustrated and stressed out because I could not print
 anything from my laptop. I have a Lenovo Z50, running on a Windows 8.1 OS.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Specifically, in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, every time I click the
<em>Print</em> icon, or press <em>Ctrl+P</em>, or go to <em>File&gt;Print</em>, nothing happens. By “nothing,” I mean the Print Dialog Box does not appear and the whole Adobe Reader just freezes and is
</span><span style="font-style: italic">not responding</span><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I thought it was a specific problem with Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, so I uninstalled and
 reinstalled it again. Still, the problem remains.</span></p>
<p><span>I discovered that this also happens to Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft
 PowerPoint.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I already tried the following “fixes” to no avail:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>Uninstalling and reinstalling my printer’s driver</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Stopping and starting the print spooler</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Updating my printer’s driver</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Restarting my laptop</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>This just happened out of the blue, and I could not remember any major changes I have
 made to my laptop before this thing happened.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For a student, this really stresses me out. I hope you could help me.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Thank you so much,</span></p>
<p>

    <title>Internet access disabled after Windows Updates applied - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gringita_360  say:</h3>
<h2>            Internet access disabled after Windows Updates applied</h2>
                    After the latest Windows Updates are installed, I lose all connection to the Internet. I can still see my network, but not anything on the internet.<br />
<br />
I spent an hour yesterday on the phone with my ISP verifying it was neither their system nor a hardware issue with my modem or router.&nbsp; I spend another 1/2 hour on the phone with Dell Support.<br />
<br />
It turned out the issue was my DNS was corrupted, and the only way to get it back was to perform a System Restore to 8/16.&nbsp; Everything was fine after that... until Windows Update ran automatically last night, installing the latest two so-called critical updates.
 I don't know which one is causing the problem, but my DNS was wiped out again, and I have again had to restore to the 8/16 recovery point.<br />
<br />
I've turned off Windows Update for the moment because I don't know how else to solve the issue; in the absence of any other change to my system, I suspect it's the updates themselves that are doing something to my DNS. Does anyone else have this issue? Is there
 a better solution or another way to resolve it that doesn't require me to avoid all Windows updates for the foreseeable future? Is there some way of finding out if/when a later critical update resolves the issue created by these?<br />

            <p>The cause has now been identified as McAfee Updates rather than Windows Updates - they were both released at about the same time.&nbsp; If any of your PCs have McAfee then they might be confusing your test results.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>See this "critical" McAfee notice -</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS101446" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Some customers may experience a loss of network connectivity and/or errors in McAfee Security Center after a recent update</a></p>
<p>You should do the McAfee fix, if applicable.&nbsp; The McAfee link applies to consumer products but there are corresponding notices for corporate ones - see, for example,</p>
<a href="https://kc.mcafee.com/corporate/index?page=content&amp;id=KB76004" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Corporate KnowledgeBase - DAT 6807/6808 Causing Issues with VSE 8.8.x</a>
<p>I have McAfee but the connection started working again of its own accord so I thought I was clear of problems. However, when I checked it said it had been doing routine checks for updates but failed when I told it to do one manually. So staying with McAfee
 without following their fix procedure would have put my PC at risk by not being updated and, as further McAfee announcements have since explained, the application was not referring to its threats database correctly [hence, possibly, the variation in the degree
 of severity in user experiences]. <em>Actually, I removed McAfee then installed <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-GB/windows/products/security-essentials/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Security Essentials</a> instead &amp; my IE response is quicker than I have known it [even though I had had the McAfee add-ons disabled for ages].
</em></p>
<p>I've had to run the McAfee MCPR removal a few times before and it caused a licence problem if the PC was not connected to the internet during the removal. The McAfee support chat had to reset their records to allow reinstallation-reactivation. Here's their
 chat link - <a href="http://service.mcafee.com/LocaleSelect.aspx?lc=1033&amp;sg=TS&amp;pt=1&amp;st=CHAT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
McAfee support - contains the link to chat</a></p>
<p>- - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>If you don't have McAfee then Windows update KB2705219 might be an alternative cause as uninstalling that has
<em>appeared</em> to fix the problem for some users.&nbsp; But, personally, I think they might have only achieved a temporary fix&nbsp;[I thought my PC was okay at the time but it turned out not to be the case, as explained above] &nbsp;<em>To uninstall an update - Control
 panel, Programs &amp; features, [left-hand side of the window] View installed updates. Wait until the system has finished searching for the list of updates. Select required update then right-click &amp; Uninstall.</em></p>

<h2>            Skype for Business to SharePoint integration issue with contacts &#40;Windows 10 Pro&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I have never experienced this issue before on Windows 7 however since transitioning to Windows 10 I have noticed this from the very beginning.<br />
<br />
For some reason and I don't know if this is a Windows 10 issue specifically but I cannot view my contacts status on SharePoint whilst being signed into Skype for Business 2016.</p>
<p>***It does not even show the contact card if I were to hover over a name. So based on that I understand it's liekly not a 'presence unknown' issue, it's simply just not working as if I was not signed into Lync***</p>
<p>I installed Windows 7 on a virtual machine on my Windows 10 computer and installed office 2013 and 2016 on the Windows 7 VM and it works just fine, statuses are visible on the browser. No issues from what I can see. However the issue exists on my current
 setup in windows 10. Not specific to Office 2016 as I have encountered the issue on Office 2013 via Windows 10 as well.
</p>
<p><br />
I signed out of Lync on the Windows 7 VM and I could not view contacts statuses, the same effect that I am experiencing on Windows 10 except I definitely am signed into SfB....</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Previous setup:</span></p>
<p>Windows 7 Professional (Fully up to date)<br />
<br />
Microsoft Office 2013 (Fully up to date)<br />
<br />
<br />
***Lync presences were visible in Outlook and SharePoint with no issues.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Current setup:</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span>Windows 10 Pro (Fully up to date)</p>
<p>Microsoft Office 2016 (Fully up to date)</p>
<p>Have also used 2013 for about 3 weeks on Windows 10 whilst still having the same issue, but upgrading to Office 2016 in an effort for potential resolution.</p>
<p>***Lync presence is only visible in Outlook but not SharePoint (office browser plugin is running too)</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Browsers tried:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for your reply.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I totally understand that you have met this issue. The factor is that t</span></span>he behavior that the Skype for business presentence is not displayed in SharePoint site is currently not available because the code controlling the Skype for
 Business presence was updated for Exchange Online but has not been implemented within SharePoint Online which cause that presence is not displayed in the SharePoint sites. This will be updated in the future versions of SharePoint online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your understanding and patience.</p>

    <title>Display Not Detected After Application of KB4284835 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sad_bunny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display Not Detected After Application of KB4284835</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am posting this request for help under "devices and drivers" as I suspect the problem might be driver related, but I would be happy to have this corrected to "Windows Update" if more appropriate.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a single hardware platform that uses removable 2.5" SSD drives in order to permit me to "dual boot" between 2 different versions of Windows 10 on the one PC. I have 2 licensed [both purchased] copies of Windows 10 Pro 64-Bit for this machine. Both
 have recently been updated, first to build 1803 [on May 27th] and then to the "Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 (KB4284835).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The hardware configuration for the system is:-</p>
<p>Motherboard: MSI Big Bang Power II (silly name, but actually a quite decent board)</p>
<p>GPU: nVidia 1080GTX</p>
<p>Disk: all Samsung 850 Pro SSDs [total 4 volumes, ranging 256Gb to 1Tb]</p>
<p>Audio: Creative X-Fi Titanium </p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 3 monitors connected to this machine. All are identical, Dell U2415W monitors, with 60Hz, 1920x1200 displays. The configuration of the monitors as seen on my desk are:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left Screen - DisplayPort on the GPU, mini-DP on the Monitor</p>
<p>Centre Screen - DVI-D on the GPU, HDMI on the Monitor</p>
<p>Right Screen - HDMI on the GPU, HDMI on the Monitor</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are Windows-level differences between the two builds:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. "Office Build"</p>
<p>This runs MS Office 2016, graphics software such as Adobe Photoshop CS5, Lightroom, etc</p>
<p>This build <strong>does not</strong> use nVidia's "surround spanning" virtual desktop technology.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. "Games Build" </p>
<p>This runs the Steam Client, the Origin Client and a bunch of stand-alone games titles</p>
<p>The build <strong>does use</strong> the nVidia "surround spanning" virtual desktop technology.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the application of the 2018-06 Cumulative Update for W10v1803, I now have slightly different symptoms on both of my "builds":-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Office Build - I have only 2 working monitors, the "DisplayPort" screen [my left monitor] is not recognised by this Windows Build</p>
<p>2. Gaming Build - the machine boots, I see the BIOS POST screen, I hear the Windows Audio sound as the system comes up, but nothing at all displays on any of the 3 monitors - it "looks" like an entirely dead machine...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not the first time I have experienced this issue with a major Windows 10 Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Steps Taken</strong></p>
<p>Since I am unable to do anything with the "Gaming Build" at the moment, I have instead tried to work with the "Office" build.
</p>
<p>I have downloaded the latest nVidia Driver direct from the nVidia web site. This is driver version 398.36, using the file,</p>
<p>
</p><p>398.36-desktop-win10-64bit-international-whql.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>This evening I have tried to refresh the nVidia driver in the hope that doing so would "allow" my office machine to see all 3 monitors and work again. Initially I performed a generic installation [a basic upgrade] and asked the installer to download the
 driver and the PhysX components only [I do not use HDMI for audio and I do not have 3D capability running via the GPU.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This "upgrade" proceeded smoothly, the machine rebooted OK... but I still only have 2 monitors.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then repeated the "upgrade" process, except this time I asked for a "Clean Installation" - which warns that it will wipe out all preceding configuration files and parameters and give a "clean" installation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither approach made any difference, I still have just 2 working monitors. Trying to use the more advanced display detection capabilities in the nVidia driver produces this result:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So it "sees" something and "sort of" recognises it as a digital display. However, I am unable to set it active, and attempting to do so seems to hang the mouse cursor for a period of about 15 seconds.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the "Gaming" build is concerned, I am completely at a loss as to know what to do. For what it is worth, I had a similar result the last time a windows update caused me display issues. I was able to repair the office build with help, but the Gaming
 build required a completely clean Windows installation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would prefer not to be left facing that option this time around. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance or assistance that anyone can offer with this would be very much appreciated. I am sure it is no help to say this, but... this is the second time in two major updates that Windows 10 has completely screwed my displays. There is NOTHING unusual
 or "custom" or "special" about them. This is a standard windows build with an entirely generic 1080GTX and yet this is the second time this has screwed up...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone give me any form of assurance that this is not going to happen again please?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help that anyone can offer. </p>
<p />

<p>
</p><p>A close read will show that there are slight differences [for example today I see the missing monitor as "digital display", which wasn't the case in March...&nbsp; but the symptoms are depressingly similar...

            Hi Bunny.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Let me assure you that you have been most thorough and already completed the first half of the steps I would have given for this.  In addition to the following steps 
<br />If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback and may interact with you.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />See here for troubleshooting monitors further including varying screen resolution between them:  
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-doesnt-detects-second-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-windows-10-doesnt...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-setup-dual-monitors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/how-to-...</a>

<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else works I would roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhat belated interim update... </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been travelling with work and in light of the difficulties I'd experienced, I took my PC to a local specialist and asked them to check it over for me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first observation to report - something I should have considered trying for myself - is that both of the "Office" and "Gaming" builds appear to work if just one single monitor is connected to the PC. Unfortunately this does not help us diagnose the root
 of the issues, but it does indicate that the problem relates to aspects of multi-monitor support.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second observation is that apparently both of my machines were running slightly older releases of nVidia drivers. Not particularly ancient - both about 3-4 months old.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're going to bring both machines fully up to date with driver version and then see if that solves the problem. If it does, then it would suggest that the Windows 10 update "assumes" but does not check to confirm that the latest [or reasonably recent] drivers
 are in place. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm about to fly out again tomorrow, but should be back on or about Saturday 11th, so will hopefully have some news by then.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Final update in "closure" of this ticket. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating both machines to the latest nVidia driver, whilst using just a single monitor to operate the PC, appears to have solved the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not conclusively prove that having the nVidia driver at the latest release would have enabled this Windows update to work properly, but it certainly points the finger of suspicion and dependencies between the OS and GPU driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance; all working now... </p>
