<h2>            Touch Screen help for Gateway ZX4800 AIO</h2>
                    <p>I have aquried a Gateway model ZX4800 AIO computer for my granddaughter. She lives with us and was born with acondiplasa (drawfisium). She is now 10 years old and doing quite well in school, but her hands are very tiny. This computer was given to me by a
 sister and brother-n-law because it had stopped working and Best Buy techs said the motherboard was fried. That turned out not to be true, I diagostied it to be just a bad display screen, which I just recieved and installed. The computer works great, but I
 am lead to believe, by info on the internet,&nbsp; that this is a touch screen computer. I have not yet figured out how to get the touchscreen part&nbsp;to work by touch. Does anyone have any info on this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help you might share,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>No error message or anything of the sort is provided. Any thoughts? Also, the download site for Surface Pro 4 Platform Installer doesn't appear to have been updated with the latest firmware yet: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498

</span>
<p>If your current build is working, I'd stick with it until MS pushes out some new patches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do want to go ahead, another trick to try would be to run Disk Cleanup, click "Clean Up System Files" and clean up everything it identifies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS still hasn't updated their surface platform installer page with the new firmware, so I don't know if there's a manual install process available.</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;my partitions and drives I deleted when I tried to install windows before</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Make sure your Surface is turned off and plugged in, and then insert the USB</div>
<div>recovery drive into the USB port.</div>
<div>2. Press and hold the volume-down button while you press and release the power</div>
<div>button.</div>
<div>3. When the Microsoft or Surface logo appears, release the volume-down button.</div>
<div>4. When prompted, select the language and keyboard layout you want.</div>
<div>5. Select&nbsp;Troubleshoot&nbsp;, and then select&nbsp;Recover from a drive&nbsp;. If prompted for</div>
<div>a recovery key, select&nbsp;Skip this drive&nbsp;at the bottom of the screen.</div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>Be sure to select the&nbsp;Troubleshoot&nbsp;option on this screen. Don’t select the&nbsp;Use a</div>
<div>device&nbsp;option. If you select the&nbsp;Use a device&nbsp;option, your Surface will reboot</div>
<div>from the USB recovery drive again and the reset process will start over.</div>
<div>6. Choose either&nbsp;Just remove my files&nbsp;or&nbsp;Fully clean the drive.</div>
<div>The option to clean the drive is more secure but takes much longer. For example,</div>
<div>if you’re recycling your Surface, you should clean the drive. If you’re keeping</div>
<div>your Surface, you just need to remove your files.</div>
<div>7. Select&nbsp;Recover.</div>
<div>Surface restarts and displays the Surface logo while the reset process</div>
<div>continues. This can take several minutes.</div>

<p>Hi Mohan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Most likely, the error message <span>0x800704cf that you're getting is a possible corrupted or missing files due to the challenges with the network location that can't be reached by the system. This is a common reason why sometimes we encounter issues with

<h2>            forefront identity management pros and cons</h2>
                    Hello, I am soon to be giving a presentation to my university on the pros and cons of using identity management, specifically they are interested in forefront, however I have not come into contact with an ID manager before and instead of a websites bias,
 I would much appreciate some first hand experience from users, specifically how easy was the transition, any problems. Overall how has it helped your system for the better, and what problems occurred once it was implemented. Thank you for any help you can
 provide

<h2>            Cant add my creditcard or mobilephone as a payment for my microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>Hey!<br />
<br />
I bought an xbox one in august and at the same time I bought nhl with my mobile as a payment. But when I'm going to add my mobile again as a payment it says " can find your account"<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried with my brothers account but it's the same problem with his. I really don't know why it worked before but now when I want to ad the mobile as a payment for the xboxlive. I just can't. Tried with my brothers phone number on my account and it
 didn't work either.<br />
<br />
I where in contact with the Xbox support here in Sweden but they didn't do anything to help me. The best advice I got where to make a new account and " gift" games between the accounts.<br />
<br />
Would really appreciate if you guys could help me</p>
<p />

<p>Thanks for bringing this situation to our attention. I understand you are having trouble adding your mobile phone number to your account in order to make purchases.&nbsp; Here is a useful support article regarding how to

Manage your payment options online</a>. Have you tried adding a different payment method such as a credit or debit card? You may also want to consider contacting your service provider of the mobile phone and see if they have any information or options regarding
 your mobile payment options.</p>

<p>
Hello<br />
<br />
Yes I have tried to ad my debit card and it just says that my information is wrong, but what's weird about that is that I have purchases before both with the credit card and my mobile. And my service provider doesn't see anything wrong with the service or my
 mobile<br />
<br />

Thank you for answering so quickly

            Hi Robert

<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:

            Hi RobertPU,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Give a try to this.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 search bar and type "Xbox". select the Xbox trusted store app. now select the gear from the icon list on the left side of the Xbox app. This will bring up the settings menu, now select the Game DVR tab and now, turn off the option(s) to take screenshots and video of your games. close the Xbox app, restart the computer and see if the same thing keeps happening.
<br />
<br />Regards.       
        </p>

<p>Did you download the games from from Steam, or another online retailer ?&nbsp; Any issues that the original disc versions would</p>
<p>have had with Win10 should not be a problem with the remastered download versions.Can you offer more details of what is, or is not happening ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What brand and model graphics processor is your machine using ?</p>
<p>- The games worked on 32bit what ? The remastered versions of all three games you mention require
<p>The reason for this is the games use more system RAM than 32bit Windows is capable of using.<br />
</p>
<p>- It looks like the remastered games specify VRAM as well,&nbsp; so they may not run on Integrated graphics processors either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If your hardware meets the games system requirements and the game is crashing,&nbsp; running Steam's
<em>Verify Integrity of Game Files </em></p>
<p>tool may help fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- EDIT: I found I could get the Remastered Bioshock 2 free from Steam by redeeming my disc key, and the game</p>
<p>runs a bit better than the original disc version.</p>

<p>OK, in their wisdom Microsoft have removed the option to change font sizes on toolbars, menus, icons . . . etc. in the Creators Edition, there is no fix at all for this one, sorry!</p>
<p>
</p><p>They have moved all the settings for display over to the new Settings app, soon the whole of Control Panel will be moved over and Control Panel will be gone</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lots of users are giving out about this change, so maybe Microsoft will re-think allowing users to change font size in a future update</p>
<p>
</p><p>All you can do now is to right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings and set a scaling factor that suits you, but please note everything scales with this option . . . text, windows, icons . . . etc.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a portable (doesn't Install) program called winaerotweaker that will probably resolve your problem with text and icon sizing if you want to try it out...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It resolved a similar problem on my machine...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition... If you have another similar machine with Win 10, or even Win 7, you can set it up as you wish... Then export the registry key&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop\WindowMetrics...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then on the newer builds where the Display and it's Advanced Settings is missing, you can then just double click on the exported file and "Merge" it back into the registry...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the method I now currently use... I only need to double click a single file instead of changing multiple settings...</p>

&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community forums and providing an opportunity to help you.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. What is the previous operating system from which you have performed file back up ?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Mean while follow the steps given below and check:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Manually connect the external hard drive to the new pc.</div>
<div>2. Go to This pc and open the connected external hard drive.</div>
<div>3. Select the&nbsp; files which you want to transfer it to the new pc by right clicking on it and copy it &nbsp;and paste it at you preferred drive which you wish to.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

<p>
</p><p>My previous operating system is Windows 7 and &nbsp;had recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I ran the backup program. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have individual files on a second external hard drive but they are incomplete. &nbsp;So I would, if I could, like to use the first and complete hard drive that I mentioned. &nbsp;But the files are zip files. &nbsp;I don't know very much about this process. &nbsp;I have
 looked at the files and I don't understand how to find the ones that I really need. &nbsp;I have a huge amount of pictures and graphics from my old computer (over 1TB). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all else fails, I can use the second hard drive back up files, but I will lose the last couple weeks of work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find the correct zipped files to open and copy on my best backup external hard drive? &nbsp;If I could just get those, I"d be more than happy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I use the back up to put my files on my new computer?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail Stopped Syncing - Tuesday night 21 February</h2>
                    <p>My issue is that Windows 10 Mail ceased syncing on two separate PCs in my home overnight Tuesday 21st February. Both are connected to the Internet via a TalkTalk router. Internet access continues to operate normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. This problem is identical on both computers in our home (i.e. it is not machine specific)</p>
<p>2. Sync failure occurs on both our main Outlook.com account and on a secondary Talktalk account that we also use (i.e. it is not service provider specific).</p>
<p>3. Any attempt to send a message simply results in it being left in the Outbox</p>
<p>4. On both email accounts it is not possible to access Change Sync Settings as this option is "greyed out".</p>
<p>5. Both our Outlook.com and TalkTalk accounts can be accessed via the Web and are being updated properly (i.e. there is no problem with passwords and the accounts do not appear to be blocked in any way).</p>
<p>6. Manually forcing Sync appears to result in the inbox message count being dramatically reduced (you can see the count running down) but inspection of the accounts via respective Webmail services reveals that all inbox messages remain intact!</p>
<p>7. I have checked the Privacy settings for both Mail and Calendar and these are "turned on" as they should be.</p>
<p>8. I have tried running "Reset" via Settings - Systems in the Advanced options for the Mail and Calendar app but this just seems to result in ever fewer old messages being loaded and still no syncing of current messages.</p>
<p>9. I have run a Norton Quick scan to double check that this problem is not caused by a virus - no issues reported.</p>
<p>10. I have re-booted my Talktalk router in case this was causing a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot understand how both machines can be experiencing the same problem when neither was touched at the time the issue arose. Did Microsoft apply some update overnight on 21st February that has caused this problem? It appears as if Mail on both machines
 has gone into some kind of syncing loop, which might explain why the Change Sync Settings option is greyed out.
</p>
<p>I do hope that someone can assist with this as it has already wasted almost two days of my time.! Since "Reset" does not solve the problem, I could use PowerShell to remove the Mail and Calendar apps and then reinstall but I am reluctant to do this if there
 is another underlying cause. Help please!!!!</p>

            <p>Dear Paola,</p>
<p>1. I am using "Outlook Email" at Outlook.com as the mail server. I have a second account at TalkTalk, which is also not syncing. As stated, if I sign on to my account at Outlook.com. everything is being updated normally. The same applies to my TalkTalk account
 which I can access through their Webmail.</p>
<p>2. No changes were made whatsoever - as stated problem appears to have&nbsp;occurred overnight, Tuesday 21st February</p>
<p>3. No error messages or notifications are being received in the Windows 10 Mail App.</p>
<p>4. Same issue has impacted both machines in my home, both running the latest version of Windows 10. One is a laptop, which connects to router by WiFi, the other a desktop, which connects to router with Ethernet cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems pretty obvious that either something has corrupted the Mail App on both machines.&nbsp;I would add that I run the latest version of Norton on both machines and this is not reporting any intrusion problems. I have run Norton Quickscan manually as a double
 check.</p>

            <div>Dear Paola,</div>
<div>I had already read and tried/checked everything set out in the help document to which you refer<strong> before
</strong>posting my question on the Microsoft Community! I only posted on the Community as a least resort having researched all available "help" over a period of two days. The only action not so far taken is to&nbsp;try to delete and then re-install the secondary&nbsp;TalkTalk
 account. However, this would not help because our principal email account is the MSN/Outlook account and that cannot be deleted as the document says.</div>
<div>I would add that after many resets, I still have no syncing but, occasionally, Test Messages sent to self from the Mail&nbsp;App now&nbsp;appear to be arriving&nbsp;sporadically BUT they are still showing as being in the Outbox in the Mail App and do not move to the
 Sent folder even though they are shown as both sent and received when I sign in to Outlook.com!</div>
<div>I would appreciate:</div>
<div>1. Microsoft examining whether any updates were applied on Tuesday 21st February; and</div>
<div>2. Authoritative advice from Microsoft on how to reset/reinstall the Mail App safely - as previously stated the "Reset" function does not solve the problem.</div>

            <p>Dear Paola,</p>
<p>Over the last couple of hours, Windows 10 Mail appears to have gradually come back to life!</p>
<p>Sequence of events as follows for your info.</p>
<p>1. Message sent to self 2 days ago remained in App outbox but was visible as both sent and received message in Outlook.com at 13:21 Hrs GMT.</p>
<p>2. Further test messages sent using both MSN account and TalkTalk accounts appeared to be transmitted promptly, despite remaining in outbox on Mail App. Syncing still not operational.</p>
<p>3. Added existing largely unused Hotmail account in Mail App&nbsp;on Laptop (already exists on Desktop). Noticed that this automatically showed sync turned on for Mail, Calendar and Contacts. Found that "Change Sync Options"&nbsp;no longer "greyed out" on other two
 email accounts (MSN and TalkTalk). Reviewed settings on all accounts. Noticed that&nbsp;incoming update option defaulting to "By Usage" but current indicated as "Anytime", Changed to "Anytime" clicked Done and Saved. Still no syncing.</p>
<p>4. Ran "Reset" for Mail &amp;&nbsp;Calendar in advanced options. Restarted Mail and suddenly everything appears to be working on Laptop.</p>
<p>5. Checked desktop. Found "Change Sync Options"&nbsp;no longer "greyed out". Updated to confirm "Anytime" as per 3 above. Still no Sync. Ran "Reset", restarted Mail App and as with Laptop, everything OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks to whoever "flicked" the right switch and sorted this out. I would be interested to know what caused this problem because it has given me three days of aggravation and heartache!</p>

            <p>Dear Paola,</p>
<p>1. Tried "reset" on the desktop computer. Second time round, this resulted in partial removal of the Mail &amp; Calendar App! I say partial because the desktop icon disappeared and it also disappeared from the Apps list in "System"
<strong>BUT</strong> MS Store reported the software still present when attempting to reload.</p>
<p>2. In the end my son used "Powershell" to remove the App on both computers and this then enabled the App to be reloaded from the MS Store. Since then, Mail functioning tolerably well, although the inbox message count is not correct since MS upgraded Mail
 to provide "focused" functionality.</p>
<p>3. It cannot be in the interests of MS for amateurs such as myself to edit the Registry using Powershell in order to resolve problems with Windows 10 Mail. Rather than issue further upgrades, I consider that MS should focus on the stability of the existing
 product. Certainly, the "Reset" function needs to be looked at and made more robust!</p>
<p>4. As to what caused these problems, I am still at a loss but my guess would be some interaction with Norton? Overnight on Tuesday 21st February, either MS or Norton or both released software changes that caused the same problem on both computers, both of
 which run the same version of Windows 10 and Norton.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Issue: </strong><em>When I tried to call another Skype user using the number he provided, Skype tells me I must purchase Skype credits.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, Skype-to-Skype call <em>(audio and/or video)</em> is free. The system will only ask you to pay when using premium features such as SMS texts or making calls to a landline, cell or outside of Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that the application is registering the action as a call to a mobile number instead of searching in the directory. If the other user you are trying to call created his/her account using his/her account using a phone number, try searching for his/her
<strong>exact Skype username </strong>or <strong>their account's display name </strong>
in the directory instead of the phone number. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Issue: </strong><em>Also, when he called me, no button/icon appeared for me to answer the call.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Follow-up question</strong>: Did you receive a call notification but you do not have the option to answer it? Are you signed in to multiple devices at the same time? Please confirm the exact Skype version you are on (not latest or recent) so we can
 further check on this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not hesitate to get back to me so I can further assist you. </p>

<p>You wouldn't, at least not directly. The 360 outputs video over HDMI or the AV port, not both at the same time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have a chance if you have a receiver that provides downconverted output over Composite, but it's doubtful. You'll probably need an HDMI capture device like a Blackmagic Design Intensity Pro or Shuttle.</p>

<p>You can't.. You get what you pay for. The easycap can only record in SD.</p>
<p>--</p>
<p>For your latest post, there's no way AT ALL your MAC is good enough to record with that. Besides the specs, it also requires a USB 3.0 port which going off your specs I'm assuming it's pretty old meaning it wouldn't have one anyways. Another thing is you
 would need more than a 64gb HDD. I have a 500gb dedicated to recording and it constantly fills up.

    <title>HP P7-1010 was crashing like crazy after upgrading to windows 10, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danjer9  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP P7-1010 was crashing like crazy after upgrading to windows 10, and continues to crash once a day after reverting back to windows 7. Help&#33;</h2>
                    <div>So here's the story:</div>
<div>A few months ago, I decided to do the free update to windows 10 while it was still available. My windows 7 HP P7-1010 pc was fine before then, no crashes or anything. During the first update attempt, the progress bar was stick at 100% for hours so I had
 no choice but to hold the power button till it restarted. The second update attempt was a success, but it had to do the windows 10 download and installation again which took a long time, but once it reached 100% the installation finished as expected. However,
 that same day I started using windows 10, the computer started crashing many times. It would restart, and after 20-30 minutes, it would crash again. So I immediately came to the conclusion that it was windows 10's fault, so I reverted back to windows 7 the
 very next day without a hitch. However, after using windows 7 for a little while, it crashed. And it continues to crash at least once every day (though that's far less than when it was on windows 10, when it would crash like every half hour). So now I'm thinking
 that me attempting to update to windows 10 (twice) in the first place has perma-borked my poor pc.
</div>
<div>I've continued to use my pc, even though I know it will crash around once every day (though it auto-restarts pretty quickly). Before I buckle and invest in a new pc, I thought I'd try asking around for a potential solution. Here's some things I noticed
 while using the pc:</div>
<div>-Keeping the task manager opened all the time, I noticed that firefox would steadily creep up to &gt;1,000,000K, though that would only lag my computer till I closed firefox. My pc sometimes crashes even if firefox isn't open and the memory usage meter is
 only halfway full. AKA my pc crashes at seemingly random times.</div>
<div>-If I'm watching youtube or any sound is playing through the speakers, when the pc crashes, the sound will hang and the screen will glitch out. Usually it just auto-reboots, but sometimes it's a bsod</div>
<div>-I ran the checkdisk utility multiple times on boot, with no errors found</div>
<div>-I ran memtest86+, with no errors found</div>
<div>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated, and thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the link to a folder with a three-part screen-capped pic of what it says everytime after my pc reboots from a bsod (it doesn't appear if my monitor glitches out/sound hangs and the pc auto-reboots). I also included two of the minidumps from when bsod's
 occurred.</p>

<p>A lot of times when reverting to the earlier operating system after the upgrade to 10, whether it be 8/8.1 or 7, system files and drivers do get corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The advice I give&nbsp;is to preferably&nbsp;clean install Windows 7 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Make sure that you have the latest updated Drivers:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to your Computer or Hardware Manufacture's website &gt; Driver and Software Support Section &gt; look up your Computer or Hardware Model number &gt; then your Operating System &gt; locate the correct Drivers &gt; download and install them.</p>

<p>Whenever you perform a new/clean/fresh install you need to visit the hardware/motherboard manufacturers WWW site and download the Windows driver (7 or 10) that they suggest - did you ever do that after your new/clean/fresh installs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For an HP system you need the serial number of the unit and enter it on their WWW site here for your desktop system:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/desktops" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/desktops</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Or their Support site may be able to detect your system and you can see the drivers they suggest:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f89d3688-a642-46bc-9456-78ce734ad3e2?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f89d3688-a642-46bc-9456-78ce734ad3e2?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>To start look for chipset, video, audio, network (LAN), USB drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never use Windows Update or Device Manager to get drivers - always start with what the hardware manufacturer suggests.</p>

<p>So I used Sumit-Windows Insider MVP's suggestion of using&nbsp;DDU to completely uninstall my graphics driver (ati radeon hd 4200), which of course put my display on standard vga adapter after the reboot. I then went to:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-pavilion-p7-1000-desktop-pc-series/5080737/model/5110006?sku=BV703AA</p>
<p>
</p><p>and not knowing exactly what I needed to install, I downloaded and installed these three in this order (I hope the order I installed them doesn't matter):</p>
<p>1. "ATI Graphics Driver Update" released on Apr 3, 2012</p>
<p>2. "Original ATI Graphics Driver" released on May 31, 2011</p>
<p>3. "ATI Graphics Driver Update" released on Feb 17, 2012</p>
<p>
</p><p>My pc restarted each time after installing each of these, but at no point did the ati radeon hd 4200 option reappear in the display adapter list. Now I'm stuck with standard graphics vga adapter as the only option, with a max resolution of 1400x1050 and
 black bars around my screen. Where do I go from here? Did I miss downloading something from the hp drivers page I linked? Thanks in advance!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried running sfc /scannow at this point to see if it would bring back&nbsp;ati radeon hd 4200, but after the scan completed it reads "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations"</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also, no minidump file was created, not sure why. Anything else I can link to give you guys more insight on this? I'm really at a loss here, since memtest or any of the other scans that were suggested didn't come up with anything</p>

    <title>How to fix partitions deleted by Windows Update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to fix partitions deleted by Windows Update</h2>
                    
<p>The latest round of updates has wiped four partitions by changing the partition table on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Having been on holiday for three weeks with no net connection, I found a multitude of updates apparently needed when I got my laptop back home.&nbsp; Luckily for me, I downloaded my pictures from the laptop to the desktop machine before doing the updates.&nbsp; (The
 laptop is fully protected by McAfee, with no reported problems.)</p>
<p>One of these has changed my partition table so that only the C: drive is available.&nbsp; The rest of the [previously allocated space is now apparently 'Free Space' according to the Disk Management utility in Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.</p>
<p>Nice one!!!&nbsp; I now don't have my Programs, Data, Pictures or Media partitions.&nbsp; Also, the Registry is in a mess as it still thinks that all the programs installed into the Programs partition are present, but can't find them as there is no partition!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>It seems I am left with an install from scratch to sort out the mess - unless someone out there knows better???</p>
<p>Thanks a bundle, Microsoft??!!??!!</p>

<p>An update on what it took to fix the mess created by the latest updates from Microsoft on my Dell Studio laptop running Windows 7 Pro. 64-bit.</p>
<p>The updates rewrote the partition table so that four of my five Windows partitions were 'removed'!!</p>
<p>I found a recovery program testdisk-6.11.3 which seems to come (once again for a VERY useful tool) via the Linux community, but runs on many platforms.&nbsp; It took several hours for it to do the scanning of the disk, but it did find all of the partitions.&nbsp;
 Incidentally, they were marked as 'deleted' - thanks a bundle, Microsoft!!!!!</p>
<p>It tried to restore them, but didn't manage to sort out the booting properly.&nbsp; That might just have been me, but I did think I had set the OS partition to be made bootable.</p>
<p>Anyway, after the reboot to supposedly sort out the problem I had no machine at all as it was missing a boot manager.&nbsp; So, out with the OS install disk and try the 'Repair' facility provided.&nbsp; It found that booting was a problem and promised to fix it -
 but this is a Microsoft progam afre all.&nbsp; Guess what - no fix.&nbsp; Exactly where I was before the 'fix'.</p>
<p>I failed to panic and ran the repair again.&nbsp; Got a completely different interface this second time and, after a series of checks it came back with an offer to fix the errors found.&nbsp; Since it gave a report to check, I did precisely that.&nbsp; Several test in
 the list - the last one was the important one.&nbsp; It had found - guess what . . . . . a boot problem.</p>
<p>Since it once again claimed to be able to fix this I let it do its stuff.&nbsp; After the reboot - Bingo!!&nbsp; All my partitions are back working.</p>
<p>One massive relief!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>PS: if you have the same problem set a side a day to sort it out, because that's what it took me!!??</p>
<p>PPS: If you buy a computer without an OS Install disk you won't be able to do what I did described above. The computer had a 'Recovery' partition, but it was no use at all with the mess the updates made of the disk partitioning.<em>&nbsp; Lesson: no OS install
 disk - find another supplier!!!!!</em></p>

<p>thing I want to download etc., I thought I could do so from my PC and it would do so. Not when I log into the 360 and have all this material queued still.</p>

<p>Your 360 will need to be on to enable the download to start, even if you queue items from the website, and you can then turn it off and continue the download providing you have Background Downloads enabled.</p>

            Windows offers its built-in utility for backup which you can access from Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Backup
<br />

<br />
<br />While Windows inbuilt backup is good and but with each update of Windows 10, this is creating more problem. This is not very reliable and sometimes, people do report problems. There are quite a lot of free utilities (+paid ones also) which are used by folks worldwide. Most of them prefer Free edition of Macrium Reflect which you can download and install from

            step one, choose and install third party backup software. <br />
<br />
windows backup is being deprecated and Microsoft recommend using third party software for backups.
<br />
the free version of Macrium reflect seems popular and is the one I prefer. <br />
can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
