<h2>            Microsoft Xbox 360 steering wheel and pedals won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work with Forza Horizon</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a used Microsoft Xbox 360 steering and pedals (old style), in good condition it was claimed. Once connected a green light turns on next to the&nbsp;steering wheel, the steering wheel connects to Xbox correctly. I am able to use the all buttons in
 centre of wheel to start game. However when game starts I cannot steer at all or use pedals. I'm sure everything is connected properly. The only thing to note is I did not receive an installation disc with the&nbsp;wheel! Do I need this?</p>

<p>Hi Player872496488,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If this is the steering wheel you purchased it does appear that Forza 2-4 support the steering wheel. &nbsp;Is there some calibration you need to do in the options menu to setup the wheel within the game itself?</p>

            Hello IsiahMu√±oz,
<br />
<br />You should be able to access TruePlay from the Settings app in Windows. Press the Windows and I key at the same time to access Settings. From there, click on Gaming then click on TruePlay on the left navigation panel. From here you should be able to Enable/Disable TruePlay by toggling the slider.
<br />
<br />Let us know if you need any further assistance. Thank you.

<h2>            Will using a CronusMax to use an Xbox Elite on a 360 WITHOUT using the mods result in a ban&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p><p><br /></p><p>First, let me briefly explain what a CronusMax does. There are two main things it can do:</p><p>1. Allows usage of any controller on any console (for me, using an Xbox One Elite on an Xbox 360).</p><p>2. Allows various unfair advantages such as auto-aim (I am NOT going to use this part of it!).</p><p>I simply would like to use my Elite on a 360 so I don't have to buy something like a Scuf to be comfortable. I absolutely don't intend to use any of the cheats that the device has (which are completely optional), and I understand that if I did I would be very likely banned (and rightly so).</p><p>Thank you very much.<br /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to the community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your query, the icon that is on your desktop is likely the one causing the issue. You might want to delete that first before reinstalling the Skype app on your device. This&nbsp;will ensure the new shortcut that will be created once you reinstalled the
 app will be connected properly with Skype. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may redownload the app through this link: <a href="https://go.skype.com/windows.desktop.download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 Leapfrog Connect as an exception. Nothing works! Leap Frog support keep saying it's a firewall problem but it can't be because I turned off the firewall and it still would not connect. I am getting Error Message 53.

            Hi,<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the methods mentioned below and check if it helps.</div>
<div><strong><br />
Method 1:</strong> I would recommend you to perform clean boot and then try to install Leapfrog Leapster Explorer.<br />
Performing clean boot helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates or uninstall and re-install the program.</div>
<div>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</div>

</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, make sure to place the computer to start as usual as mentioned in ‚ÄòStep 7‚Äô from the KB article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:&nbsp; </strong>install the program in compatibility mode and check.<br />
<strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</strong><br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the advanced support links and pdf files provided and check if it helps troubleshoot the issue -<a href="http://www.leapfrog.com/en/pages/support/product_pages/leapster_explorer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.leapfrog.com/en/pages/support/product_pages/leapster_explorer.html</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p>
</p><p>why are You trying to make Messenger 2.0?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are You not worried about legal consequences when completely copying Facebook?</p>
<p>Also are You not worried about customer consequences when striping all useful features and introducing unuseful ones?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype was always more of a official way of communication with people, for me.</p>
<p>And if I wanted to be bothered by suggestions to talk to people I may know, who 99% of time I do not know I would go to some social network site.</p>
<p>You created list of unwanted people, but You are not capable of allowing me to create my own lists of people I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this really a viable business model to appeal only to people of mental age 15 and less?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my humble opinion You should invest all that time of copying others to copy Your own features from Real ("Classic") Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>old time Skype user (Until somebody makes copy of Original Skype.),</p>

<h2>            Still on 1607&#47;Anniversary Update, missing 1703&#47;CU and 1709&#47;FCU</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have several Windows 10 systems running. They are all except one running 1709/FCU (as offered by Windows Update).<br />
The last system (my main desktop) is still running version 1607 (Anniversary Update). I have not yet been offered 1703 or 1709 (Settings | Update Status is still showing "Good news! The Windows 10 Creators Update is on its way...").</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I know that I can use the "Update Assistant" to force an update to 1709/FCU, but it is puzzling that the update is not offered automatically by Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I wonder why this is the case?<br />
Anything I can do/investigate?</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>Everything seems to run smoothly, and I&nbsp;am receiving the latest updates for version 1607 (like the January 3th KB4056890 and January 9th KB4033393 etc.).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>One clue: I keep getting the somewhat mysterious KB4023057 update. I can see that remsh.exe ("C:\Program Files\rempl\remsh.exe") is running on startup and that log files are being created on each boot etc. (like "C:\Program Files\rempl\Logs\Remediation.001.etl"
 today).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>My system is rather plain (minimal and standard software, fairly recent and standard hardware):</p>

            You have one of a few options to consider here:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Backup and perform a clean install - you have exhausted everything thats reasonably possible. Sometimes, your system has some unknown underlying issue that creates a blocker for upgrades. Save yourself: time, frustration and just perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Yes, its a chore, but this man made stuff and it ain't perfect and it will never be. 
<br />
<br />Its better for you to have your data and go through the annoying convenience of reinstalling apps and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Backup:
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-manually-backup-and-restore-your-files/45859954-c9c3-403f-b997-e96c8e001963">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />	Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Don't bother with the upgrade.
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives. 
<br />
<br />How to block it:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-10-feature-update-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/block-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Option 3: upgrade to another release such as Windows 10 1703 
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<h2>            windows 10 nvidia driver permanently damaged my notebook</h2>
                    windows 10 updated my graphics card (Nvidia GT630M) in my Asus n53sm today. everything was going fine when it suddenly crashed, rebooted itself and then the screen was not working anymore. if i try to turn my computer on, the screen does not light up like
 it does when you turn on a normal computer, it just keep its "turned off black". it doesn't seem to reach the BIOS launcher at all. I can¬¥t do anything on it anymore<br />
That driver actualization just broke my laptop.

            <p>Unlikely. &nbsp;It may have found an issue that already existed, but usually device drivers (and that one was supplied by nvidia, have you contacted them?) would not damage actual hardware (unless it just makes them run and run at full blast, causing heat and
 burning things up - but other things usually keep even that from happening.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other words - sounds like a coincidence.</p>

            How it sounds like a coincidence ????<br />
the crash happened literally 30 minutes after the driver actualization, i can't acces BIOS or windows so i can't know what went wrong. the notebook doesnt work at all now.<br />
i have not got any response from nvidia yet<br />

            <p>It wouldn't sound like a coincidence if there wasn't some possible connection that could be inferred - that is EXACTLY what makes it able to be called a coincidence.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Again - sounds like there may have been something wrong with the system already and it happened (by chance) to die soon after that device driver (nothing else changed - at all?) was updated and/or that device driver (provided by nvidia) accessed the already
 'bad' part of the card and it killed it (chances low.)</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Software rarely kills hardware; even when it does happen, it is not usually a QUICK occurrence unless the hardware has some defect that is known and can be taken advantage of to cause quick damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Contact ASUS first, nvidia second . . .</p>

<h2>            Can I save a PNG file as a PDF file&#63; How would I do this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am attempting to change the file format of a picture so that I can upload it to VistaPrint. Currently the file in the PNG format is too large. Because I plan to print this as a fairly large poster I need to keep the file as large as possible to prevent
 "blurring" when it is enlarged and a PDF should work for this. I have been unable to find a way to save the picture as a PDF. I attempted to open Windows Reader and open it within that app but have not been able to find a way to do so. Any suggestions would
 be helpful.</p>

<p>Update:</p>
<p>I did just find a workaround, though I am still interested if anyone knows of a way to accomplish my original question.</p>
<p>My workaround was to open the picture in Paint then save the file as a TIFF. This allowed me to upload the picture to Vistaprint, though it is still a large file. I am uncertain what the quality will be but I wanted to share this option for those encountering
 the same issue.</p>

            Well, the workaround did not work. I'm&nbsp; not sure what is causing the file transfer error but I tried twice to upload the file in the TIFF format. This is one of the file formats that Vistaprint accepts. So, any suggestions would be welcome.

    <title>How to stop unnecessary data collection on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rayana1997  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop unnecessary data collection on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I saw that France is suing Microsoft for "collecting excessive personal data and tracking browsing by users without consent." The lawsuit also says that the data collected is "irrelevant to the operation of the service" and that they must stop within 3 months.
 I live in the United States but does anyone know of a way I can also stop this unnecessary data collection?</p>

            <p>You can use an operating system that doesn't connect to the internet - like DOS. But that will be of limited usefulness to you. You also need to consider that a great deal of software, not just the operating system, needs to know a lot about you to work
 properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And isn't it disingenuous to rail about your operating system when your bank and your phone company collect copious amounts of data about you, to say nothing of your cable TV provider, utility companies, doctors' offices, credit card companies, online service
 providers, social media networks, smartphone apps, etc. etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What really matters isn't whether your data is being collected - that's impossible to stop - but how that data is being used and how it's being protected. Personally, I trust Microsoft more than I trust Facebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also hide in a cave and live off the land. In that case you only have to worry about surveillance drones and satellites.</p>

<h2>            Why cant i download programs or open pdf files&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    HI<br />
&nbsp;I have 2 month old dell desktop Pc running Vista.<br />
I had a virus recently which with the help of Mcafee i think i have managed to get rid of.<br />
It would appear my pc is running correctly and i can connect to the internet and surf the web. BUT i can not download any files or programs from the internet. I have tried to download, amongst others, AVG free, ccleaner, spybot. I get the download message,
 click to run, or save, the program downloads as per normal. Then when it ask me to click to install, the windows just close and dissapear and there is no trace of the program.<br />
&nbsp; Something else that happens is that i have dowloaded both spybot and avg to a memory stick using my Laptop and the same happens. They will not install on my pc.<br />
<br />
Also today, i received via my hotmail account a PDF file from a trusted source and exactly the same, the document will not open. ( i do have adobe installed and working correctly)<br />
<br />
This is driving me crazy, i hope someone has some suggestions as to what is going wrong.<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Rob<br />

            HI<br />
&nbsp;I think ive solved the problems now completely.<br />
&nbsp;It would appear the main problem was Nortons systemworks 2003, which i had installed on my pc but was causing some conflicts.<br />
I have now managed to remove this completely and i can now download programs and also open pdf and excel docs which previously i couldnt.<br />
<br />
There does seem to be a massive amount of strangely named files etc on my PC, and considering the pc is only a couple of months old i do think there is a lot of left over files from the virus.<br />
<br />
So while all seems to be working well i do think i need to clean up windows Vista.<br />
<br />
Many thanks for all your help , it certainly helped me clean up my PC<br />
<br />

    <title>I was falsely reported of cheating&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> that obese cat  say:</h3>
<h2>            I was falsely reported of cheating&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>While playing at a table, a $25,000 buy in, on WSOP: Texas Hold 'Em, a player with the gamertag of
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong> messaged me and told me him and four others reported me for cheating. They are only doing this because I was upping the bets quite a bit and they didn't like that much seeing as they were losing money.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Message Number One from him: "4 people give you a negative rep and a report ***"</p>
<p>Message Number Two: "haha we report you for cheating haha"</p>
<p>Message Number Three: "4 people from this table have report you"</p>
<p>Message Number Four: "we think you was banned 2 people from my friends works by microsoft you nooby"</p>
<p>Message Number Five: "you didnt understand aryan"</p>
<p>Message Number Six: "so we report you again"</p>
<p>And lastly, Message Number Seven: "4 people haha ***"</p>
<p>I apologize for using this language on the forums, but this is directly quoting the messages I have gotten from him. He admitted to falsely reporting me and abusing the system, and I am just concerned that my account will be banned due to false accusations.
 I. in no way, cheated. I just wanted to post this as I was directed to by somebody from the support center. I do not wanting this affecting my account seeing as it's false, and, if at all possible, I would hope something is done about his taunting, racially
 discriminatory&nbsp;language, and abuse of the report system.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Lucifuhr - It's best to create your own thread instead of bumping an old one. The enforcement team does not issue bans without proof. So you would not get banned for having false complaints filed against you. You would have had to do something to violate
 the terms. You can post here if you have questions about why you were banned - <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi  jpaterjr,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There has been an ongoing issue with windows update servers. Many users worldwide have been reporting it.
<br />
<br />There is absolutely nothing wrong with your computer. 
<br />
<br />UPDATE RELATED ACTIONS
<br />
<br />As a workaround, you can try to change your DNS to either Google DNS or Open DNS (This fix worked for few and didn't work for others. If this doesn't work, I would suggest you to wait out.)
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type ncpa.cpl and Enter &gt; Right click on your network &gt; Properties &gt; Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) &gt; Hit properties &gt; Make sure below ones are checked
<br />
<br />Google DNS
<br />Select Use the following DNS Server Addresses &gt; Preferred DNS Server - 8.8.8.8 &gt; ALternate DNS Server - 8.8.4.4
<br />OR
<br />Open DNS
<br />Select Use the following DNS Server Addresses &gt; Preferred DNS server : 208.67.222.222 &gt; Alternate DNS server : 208.67.220.220
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>I tried everything suggested by both Diego and Vijay. All with no success. I did notice that when I tried to update an app the downloaded size increased sporadically while the download speed started at better than 1.3 M/sec but continually decreased until
 I again got the error. So... Still not working!</p>

    <title>Xbox One controller w&#47; rough left analog - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spinergy02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One controller w&#47; rough left analog</h2>
                    
<p>So I pre-ordered an Xbox One package that came with a day one console/controller, a game, and a second regular edition controller.&nbsp; The day one edition controller works fine, but the second regular edition controller has rough movement in a few locations
 on the left analog.&nbsp; Basically, when the stick is pushed all the way up and then rotated to the right there are 3 distinct spots where you can feel a bit of grinding.&nbsp; Has anyone else noticed this problem with their controllers?&nbsp; I ordered this package online
 so returning through the store would be very timely and undesired.&nbsp; Does Microsoft have any sort of quick replacement policy like they do with the broken consoles?</p>

<p>Hey Spinergy,</p>
<p>Just wanted to give you a warning about sending the controller back. One is they don't actually fix the controller: they just send you a new one. Moreover, whatever issues you had on the previous controller will happen again and again and it's a never ending
 cycle of the controller becoming unusable because of the faulty design. Also, it takes about two months on average for your controller to come back in the mail which is rather surprising as all they did was send you a new controller. Also, you have to pay
 for the shipping of your controller not Microsoft. Finally, whatever complaint you send along with your broken controller will not be investigated trust me. Please whatever you do don't call or chat message on the a Microsoft support as they are from the Philippines,
 do not have the xbox one and you can barely understand their run on sentences. To give you some examples of how the service with Microsoft support the guy kept saying he or none of his department ever heard of this left analog stick issue even though it's
 posted all over their forums. Worst was when I sent him the link to the forums and instead of actually looking at the left analog issues on the Xbox support form he kept asking how my holiday was going haha. This would go on for two hours as it was literally
 like talking to a wall. What they do is they don't answer for five minutes on each question you ask hoping you'll leave the chat or hang up. Then when they finally come back on they just say how sorry they are and want this issue resolved and then it comes
 back to sending your controller back and them sending you a new one that will just break on. As of right now, the controllers being sold out there for xbox one are extremely terrible for sports games. I have NBA 2k15 and have gone through ten controllers in
 three weeks. For the six years I had xbox 360 I only went through two controllers. It's laughable at this point. Because the controllers will keep breaking I'm actually going to buy a ps4 in the meantime until Microsoft does a recall on the controllers. I'm
 hoping with the holiday season coming up that more and more people especially their retailers will call Microsoft to compain about the faulty design. You are better off buying an xbox one controller at target or best buy. At least you will get a full refund,
 get another new controller and not have to pay a fee. Hope this helps. </p>

            In the McAfee forums, there are several posts similar such as:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://community.mcafee.com/message/241542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://community.mcafee.com/message/241542</a><br />
<br />
I would pursue your issue out in their community since they already seem to know about it.<br />
<br />
I would also suggest that, unless you are really fond of McAfee or you are being forced to use it, you consider replacing it with something that has a smaller footprint, uses fewer resources, and does not have these problems - something like Microsoft Security
 Essentials that you can get here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a><br />
<br />
MSE supplemented with the free versions of MBAM and SAS should keep your running pretty clean unless you are a daredevil like me:<br />
<br />
Download, install, update and do a quick scan with these free malware detection programs (not at the same time) and remove any threats:<br />
<br />
Malwarebytes (MBAM):&nbsp;<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.malwarebytes.org/products/malwarebytes_free</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS):&nbsp; <a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.superantispyware.com/</a><br />
<br />
SAS will probably report a bunch of tracking cookies and you can just let it delete them.<br />
<br />
Even if you keep McAfee, I would still supplement it with MBAM and SAS since no single AV program seems to know about everything.&nbsp; If your McAfee says your system is clean, I would interpret that to mean - McAfee didn't find anything it knows about.&nbsp; It is
 prudent to use more than one reputable scanner to get more coverage.<br />
<br />
If you do choose to switch (and you can't have both at the same time), you need to be sure to use their uninstaller program that you can get from here:<br />
<br />

<br />
Your system will reward you with better performance.<br />
