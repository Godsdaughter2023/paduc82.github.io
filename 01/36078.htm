<p>Hey there, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/632ee988-29b0-4076-85e2-0747159440d2" title="Ammy007">
<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to move this over to the Skype forums, so you can get better help regarding your question. However, there is only so much the community can help you with in regards to this question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks to be that your security proofs have been changed, and your Account is restricted for 30 days. What I mean is, during this period, you will not be able to edit personal information nor change passwords until this 30 day period has passed. This is
 to prevent&nbsp;other people from hacking/gaining access onto another persons account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thus meaning, if you try to access <a href="https://account.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.live.com</a> you will only be able to see basic information when you sign in and will not be able to see personal information that is on that account. However, you will
 still be able to send and receive emails and use other Microsoft services. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, </p>

<h2>            Webcam will turn on but shuts itself off after 30 seconds</h2>
                    When I start up my webcam there is an image displayed but after a few seconds it will turn off. Especially when I turn on the video record, but after I stop it it goes back on for a bit then just black is displayed. The blue light goes out also. Why is
 this?

<h2>            Windows XP won&#39;t load on my old Dell Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I have an old Dell Desktop running XP Home Edition Service Pack 3. Originally I had a conflict between IE8 and a Norton Antivirus scan which prevented IE from Loading.</p>
<p>After attempting to solve the problem without success I replaced IE from a backup. The restore&nbsp; completed ie all files etc were restored from the backup but the restore window looped. I left this on for an hour or so before closing the window with a the
 last program&nbsp;&nbsp;supposedly running.</p>
<p>Windows closed down ok but would not boot up.&nbsp;It gets as far as the welcome sign then goes to the Dell Wallpaper with a cursor arrow. I have tried re-booting in Safe Mode and used some of the diagnostic options but without success. What next please?&nbsp;</p>

                    My Xbox 360 was recently stolen and I never wrote down the IP address for it. Is it possible to obtain the IP address from just having an online account? also, Is it possible to trace the IP address next time it&nbsp; signs online to gain a physical street
 address for police info?

            <p>You can go to <a href="http://www.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com</a> and sign into your account then go to Manage Payment options then that should bring up your credit card information then click remove and that should take care of your card being removed. If for
 some reason you have trouble removing it you can call support and they can remove it for you. You could also check your local pawn shops as well and if you had registered your console, support will have your serial number on record and then you can get your
 Xbox back if you do find it at a pawn shop. Hope that helps some.</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 type cover still dead</h2>
                    Ok, just reporting back. the firmware update from 2-6-19 for "update to typecover filter driver' made no difference. After download and restart it seemed as though type cover was working again; however, after several days, the battery ran mostly flat while
 sp3 was off. when restarted, type cover dead and no driver seen in device manager. Had to totally kill the battery again and restart to get the type cover functioning again.

<a href="https://aka.ms/surfacerepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a>, this will fix the hidden issue of your device.<br />
•After, we need to do the Windows update, Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Updates &gt; Check for updates.<br />

<p>Thanks Barb. I agree that it appears that it is unfixable at least at this point. The frustration from this "update" is unbelievable. I was just "excited" when a firmware update appeared in my windows update specifically for the type cover filter driver.
 Obviously it did not fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion on the alternative type cover although I see mixed reviews on it.</p>

<div>Basically, Microsoft has discontinued Surface Pro 3 and they are not even</div>

<div>it is not going to happen. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>have this issue (and do not know how many SP3's were afflicted by batterygate,</div>
<div>but my own SP3 was afflicted and stopped running on battery). </div>

<p>Hi Barb,</p>
<p>I contacted MS support about a month ago; very helpful individual who stayed on the line and on my surface for most of the afternoon with no success. She then suggested I do a complete usb re-image and sent me the link for the Win from their site. I did
 that overnight. As you know, this did not solve the problem. I reported back to her the next day and she said she'd escalate it to her manager and get back with me. After that, "crickets" I emailed her about a half dozen times to follow up...nothing. So I
 guess that is my answer from MS [obviously I would not name anyone on a public forum].</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the "no fix". I would "get" this if this was a hardware problem on a machine well past the mfg warranty period and I would chalk it up to a computer that is several years old and just move on but since it functioned perfectly UNTIL the software update
 was pushed down on it and killed the type cover, I cannot accept this. MS needs to step up, write an update or figure out how to rollback the previous update that has rendered so many type covers useless. I am not asking for special treatment but just for
 MS to "undo" their mistake at this point. Not too much to ask..</p>

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a></p>
<p>However, chances are you having MUCH more work to do!</p>
<p>NB: If you had no anti-virus application installed or the subscription had expired *when the machine first got infected* and/or your subscription has since expired and/or the machine's not been kept fully-patched at Windows Update, don't waste your time
 with any of the below: Format &amp; reinstall Windows.&nbsp; A Repair Install will NOT help!</p>

<p>1. See if you can download/run the MSRT manually: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>NB: Run the FULL scan, not the QUICK scan!&nbsp; You may need to download the MSRT on a non-infected machine, then transfer MRT.EXE to the infected machine and rename it to SCAN.EXE before running it.</p>
<p>2a. WinXP =&gt; Run the Windows Live Safety Center's 'Protection' scan (only!) in Safe Mode with Networking, if need be:<a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/howsafe.htm</a></p>

<p>3. Now run a thorough check for hijackware, including posting requested logs in an appropriate forum, not here. DO NOT SKIP THIS STEP!!</p>

                    Bought Spore for PC. Using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Attempted compatibility fix which didn't change the error.<br />
<br />
Changed Permisions&nbsp; to "Allow" and didn't change any thing.<br />
<br />
Using a PC that meets all requirements.<br />
<br />
Is there a work around?<br />

<span>I searched why this was happening and learned Hybrid Sleep and Hibernation causes this kind of problem to happen, but I checked and they were never enabled. Since there was nothing else I could do for my computer, I manually rebooted it and signed
 back in, but doing that caused two of my most used programs not to open when I clicked on them without an error, so I reinstalled them and one of the installer.exe's caused explorer.exe to freeze when I clicked on it so I ended the program and reran explorer.exe
 and the freezing continued, as for the other program, it still remained unresponsive after I clicked to open it, so I manually rebooted my PC again, but this time, "Starting Windows" was terribly slow and so was the "Welcome" screen, I couldn't even get passed
 it, now I frequently get the Safe Mode option screen (the black screen) and the recommended Startup Repair. I tried using Startup Repair but it told me it could not automatically fix the PC's problems.</span><br />

            The key to your problem is in your very last observation: The unknown owner. You need to seize ownership of the folder. Check this link - it works for Windows 7: http://www.vistarevisited.com/2008/01/09/how-to-take-ownership-of-a-file-or-folder-in-vista/.
 You could even run takeown.exe if you're comfortable with console commands.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Surface 3 screen problems</h2>
                    My screen has been messing up over the past couple of days. The screen seems to shift to the right and then loop back around. I'm attaching a picture but it may be difficult to understand what is happening to the screen as it is not as dramatic as some
 of the other times. The color contrast also seems to mess up as well.

<p>Jasmine,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The experience occurred during the summer but after I updated my surface it stopped occurring until last week when it began again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I have checked to make sure all apps are updated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. It seems to be occurring across multiple apps including google chrome while I use the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. All I've done is checked for updates and run the troubleshooter but nothing has popped up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>If it is doing it within seconds of the computer being booted from cold, suspect overheating.</p>
<p>If a laptop, get it checked out at a service centre.</p>
<p>If a desktop, remove the side service panel and check that the power supply, cpu and any case fans are working. Use compressed air (carefully) to remove dust buildup.</p>

            Could be a combination loose or faulty hardware.<br />
If you have any non-essential external devices connected to the computer on startup, try disconnecting them and see if you are able to boot successfully to the desktop.<br />
<br />
I would make sure all the following components are updated such as your Network adapter, video card, audio etc. You can try booting into Safe Mode and do a clean boot in Normal Mode then check for the appropriate updates.<br />
<br />
If the problem persist, try booting into Safe Mode, boot your PC, just before the system loads the Windows operating system; hit the [F8] Function 8 key on your keyboard which will launch the Advanced Boot Options menu. Select Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. reboot in Normal mode and update. <br />

 the modem and restarted the computer, but nothing works.

<h2>            Problem with reset</h2>
                    So, I reset my computer so i could free some space and also to make it good as new, and the reset goes good, then takes me to another Screen. It says "Installing Windows". I wait a few minutes. Those minutes became hours. When it went to 66 percent, it
 shows 86 percent for a few seconds, then the screen turned black. I thought maybe it finished, but nope. Went back to the same screen at 64 percent, then 66 percent, then 86 percent, then turns off and repeats the same thing. It says the pc will reset serveral
 times, but im worried <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e42ad7b-3d0e-4fb6-86b8-b8363ff4dcce?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Dominique,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files. To assist you better, we'd like to know What Windows version are you using? If you're on a Windows 10 device, does your PC respond when you press BIOS setup keys such as F2, F10, ESC, or DEL key
 to start the BIOS Setup? If yes, we suggest that you repair your device by creating a Windows 10 bootable media (I.e USB or DVD) using the
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Media Creation Tool</a></strong>. Once you're ready with the bootable media, follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Insert the Windows installation disc in the disc drive or connect the USB, and then start the your PC.</li><li>When a message <strong>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD appears</strong>, press any key.
</li><li>Select a language, time, currency, keyboard or another input method, and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li><strong>Click</strong> <strong>Repair</strong> <strong>your</strong> <strong>
computer</strong>.</li><li>Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>On the Choose an option screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. Select <strong>
Advanced</strong> <strong>options&gt;Startup</strong> <strong>Repair</strong>.</li><li>Wait for the process to complete.</li></ol>

<address>apart from gridlock, im disappointed that Clock Tower is the only gears 1 map to come back! (not that i dont like clock tower, its the 1 map i really wanted back!) if this is actually the final list. but im sure they will have more gears 1 maps than
 this.</address>

<p>20 maps? &nbsp;That is pretty good. &nbsp;I would like to see more gow1 maps though.&nbsp; War Machine, Canals, and Escalation would probably be my top 3.&nbsp; Why is DayOne making a comeback? &nbsp;That map was terrible.&nbsp; Also, where are you getting this list from?</p>

<p>These were the maps listed on the leaked gameplay, although i have heared that no flashback maps will be on the disc and might not make it as a day one code either. so might have to wait for the returning maps, still 16 maps is more than gears 1 and 2 had
 at launch i think.</p>

    <title>Vista 32-bit to Windows 7 64-bit - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Vista 32-bit to Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    Dear All,<br />
<br />
I appreciate that an update from a 32-bit OS to 64-bit is not possible, and so I shall have to run a clean install. Can I however, still buy an upgrade CD and use that to do the clean install, or will I have to purchase a "new version" as it were.<br />
<br />
My processor is an Intel Core 2 Duo (T7500) which, as far as I am aware, is 64-bit compatible. (I do have Ubuntu 64-bit on it, so I can also assume so).<br />
<br />
Also, if a 'Custom install' (clean) is done, will it essentially install Windows 7 as another partition and the delete the vista one, or the other way around. Seems a strange question I appreciate, but at the moment I currently have 17.7GB free and according
 to Windows, 7 requires 20. I could quite easily get rid of a load of content, but I'm interested in how the process works.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Ian Clark

            You can buy the Upgrade version.<br />
You should install 7 on the same partition as Vista, it will remove Vista and install 7.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>32bit to 64bit Custom Clean Install Steps</strong> <br />
<br />
You can use an upgrade disk, but you can't do an in place upgrade from a 32 bit system into a 64 bit system, the only way is to do a custom clean install. This means you'll have to reinstall all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to an
 external storage before doing so with Windows Easy Transfer. Here are the steps according to Microsoft:<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a> ) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation
 and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Back up your files and settings. To avoid losing anything you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on to an external hard drive. Windows Easy Transfer (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a>
 ) is a free tool you can use to copy your information (but not programs) from your PC and then put them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer, instead you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, or on CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
3. Locate the original installation disks and any associated product/license keys for the programs currently on your computer because you'll need to manually reinstall all your programs after you install Windows 7. You might be able to download some programs
 from the Internet.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC, restart, and boot from the DVD. When asked "Which type of installation do you want?" click "Custom (advanced)."<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to install all your programs.<br />
<br />
