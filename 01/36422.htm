<h2>            Need some help with this. False ban on user.</h2>
                    
<p>A friend of mine who is/was part of the Ambassador program was banned a couple hours before this original post. It stated that he was and I quote. "Impersonating" a member of the Ambassador program. I'm actually here on his behalf because my feed on Facebook
 exploded with his outrage. He recently applied for the job of being an XBox Ambassador and I was talking to him when he was doing the evaluation, he passed the tests and his Bio was permanently changed&nbsp; "ENFORCEMENT UNITED" and he tried to change it back to
 his original Motto which was "SUAV Bro?". He was permanently banned and its a false ban which means someone is abusing admin rights hardcore.</p>

<p>Here is the link to his Ambassador page. As he just started he has no points or tenure but its all there and its all the proof you need.</p>
<p>https://ambassadors,xbox,com/Profile.aspx?gamerta=ApatheticxKarma</p>
<p>I'm not trying to shame anyone, I'm not reporting anyone and i know I'm breaking a rule of the CoC by bring this up as it makes it look like he is using my account to defend himself.</p>
<p>Please help.</p>

<p>You cannot get banned for impersonating a member of the ambassador programme.</p>
<p>You can get banned for impersonating microsoft staff as an ambassador.</p>

<p>Have they even added the tests yet?</p>

<p>No one from microsoft or the ambassador programme would do that to your bio.</p>

<p>Yep, he went through a mile long questionnaire for about &nbsp;an hour. And yes, his bio was changed to that and it would not let him change it. I've actually seem a lot of Ambassadors on Live with it who play MP. The idea of it is that how could he be impersonating
 if the link provided is all the proof needed that he was in fact not impersonating anyone but himself? I've actually put the post on the PET portion of the site and see if they can do anything, didn't know it was there until I saw a lot ppl being directed
 there for stuff like this.</p>

<p>Once again,you get banned for impersonating microsoft staff,ambassadors are not microsoft staff.</p>
<p>What`s more likely is he has used his newly given "power" to make someone think he is microsoft staff.</p>
<p>That would definitely get him a ban.</p>

<p>What it was was a poor choice of wording in a sent message. He had found someone who was cheating in a game and said he was going to send his name to a Hack Enforcement member if he wouldn't stop whatever action he was doing. (Lets face facts here, you will
 find everyone cheating and you can spam that report button all you want, nothing ever happens) The defender (The supposed Cheater) might have changed up the words or some
<strong>[Moderator removed:Profanity]</strong>. <br />
<br />
The ban stands and cannot be reversed. But at the same time it makes me wonder, he was caught cheating and was threatened to have his name sent in, and the good Samaritan gets [Mod edit]Something seems a bit off on that. And there wasn't any rules being broken
 and it wasn't a silly attempt. I was trying to help a friend like anyone would do for theirs.</p>

<p>Please tell your friend he will need to enquire about his accounts ban in the suspension forum. Daft Badger provided the link earlier in the thread.

As only members of the PET have access to information regarding user specific bans I am locking this thread up.&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Second-hand Win 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> threegreens  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second-hand Win 7</h2>
                    <p>I have browsed the forum but not found this specific topic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be interested in buying a second-hand full <strong>retail</strong> Windows 7 DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 1: &nbsp; I assume that if the seller has upgraded to Windows 10 before uninstalling Windows 7, the Windows 7 key is no longer valid.&nbsp; Is this correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a valid full retail key for Windows XP.&nbsp; Would I be OK if I used a second-hand "Upgrade to win 7" disc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>

            <p>Even if the seller has upgraded to Windows 10, it still does not grant transfer rights, since the Windows 10 Free Upgrade is an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

                    I have a Lonovo desktop computer running Windows 8. &nbsp;I am using Pinnacle 16 Ultimate video editing software and have edited about 2 hours of video with DVD menus. &nbsp;When burning to DVD the whole project renders OK then when creating an export file the whole
 project is processed which gets it to about 33% of the export procedure as a whole. &nbsp;Then the export procedure carries on and gets to 62% before stopping with an internal error code "0xFFFFFC15". &nbsp;Please can you let me know how to sort this out?

            Hello, what do you need the driver for? 
<br />
<br />There are sites that offer the driver, but if you give me more info i can probably find a more secure one.

            Your best bet will probably be to download the drivers from your motherboards manufacturer 
<br />

<h2>            what is msisadrv non-plug and play&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It seems I have limitations and unauthorized users remotely changing settings ect.....&nbsp; all of my protection software says I am fine, but I believe from using console, task mgr. performance&nbsp; monitor ect... that something is superceding my authority.&nbsp; Its
 like my computer is acting as a server at times and hidden files and many non plug and play drivers that have no available origin.&nbsp; MS is supposed to be downloading current drivers ect... I also have had recent hardware changes that I am not aware of installing.&nbsp;
 I am the only one with access to this computer physically, but I believe there is a compromise and dont know what to chase around.&nbsp; It is alot of work to identify every process, service, definition, driver ect and still know which one is being expoited the
 wrong way.&nbsp; Is there any advice as how to locate the rouge and find its source?&nbsp; This" misisadrv" non plug and play is an example.&nbsp; Also, even though i reload windows 7 after reformatting the hard drive, and have in</p>
<p>stalled all updates, I still have outdated certificates for my drivers, from micro-soft. help?</p>

<p>hi, i'm back but this time with details.</p>
<p>every thing has back to normal (no blue screens,no cmd problems...) and rest the boot problem .now i can't access to the pc because of boot problem.with recovery cmd and my simple dos commands knowledge i find some important details:</p>
<p>-i log into advanced recovery and do every thing without typing password or selecting os or account!strange..</p>
<p>-first when chkdsk move to jornal USN he says that i haven't enough free space for that but i have 192Go free</p>
<p>-every bcd log says that bcd and system is located in d:\ but i have installed it on c:\ and when the pc was working he says that windows located on c:\.</p>
<p>-i have find some thing about "ramdisk=[H:]\recovery\windowsRE\Winre.wim,{41f4e81e-85b1-11e8-a433-f773acb98d4f} i know that H:\ on my second hard disk and windows 8.1 on the pass was installed on it i didn't format it because he is 250Go and i use 216Go
 of it but i deinstalled it with msconfig and delete windows folder (he left 2 files on it) bcdinfo on windows\system32\logfiles\srt said that i have 2 "chargeur de d,marrage windows"in french the default on d:\(c:\ on the truth)and other on ramdisk=[H:]\recovery...
 both of them in \windows\system32\winload.exe</p>
<p>on "options de p,riph,rique"in french with messing y on the log says that description windows recovery is on H: path on \recovery\WindowsRE\boot.sdi and there is no D:</p>
<p>the bootfailure on the same SRT folder says ▯and two spaces ..i have noticed that when i press F11 on BIOS booting and select my second hard drive he give me a little bit old blue recovery options and windows 8.1 is selected to recover and when i select
 my primary hard drive to boot he sometimes gives me a windows logo blue stuck and no moving white points and sometimes give me black screen for minutes and an old windows 7 boot manager (black and white) style error says that and exepted I/O error on the \bcd\windows\winload.exe</p>
<p>-microsoft DiskPart v10.014393.0 with copyright 1999.2013. microsoft(this is windows 8.1 copyright!!) says that Disque 0 is 232G and he is SAMSUNG!! but that's my second hard drive</p>
<p>and the second was seagate 1TB and that's my primary one.</p>
<p>-let's move to the SrtTrail.txt and i think that's the (failed) automatic repair and he said that every test finished with code 0x0 exept "test des métadonnés de disque"in french has been terminated with code 0x32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; please repond faster as you can</p>
<p>note: i'm worry about the activation code so the clean install is impossible because i have an old 1603 activation code and i don't think he work with that version.</p>
<p>note: i was an old win8.1 user and i know that windows boot manager error screen was like win7</p>

    <title>Windows 10 constantly freezes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 constantly freezes</h2>
                    Okay, so I searched online how to improve wifi performance for gaming and a tutorial told me to enable Adhoc support 802.11n. After enabling my computer constantly freezes and the only way to get it working again is to manually turn it off and on again.
 Whenever I try to disable Adhoc support 802.11n my computer instantly freezes. Also whenever I try to restart, my computer freezes. What should I do because my computer is pretty much useless now.

<h2>            Surface Pro does not turn ON or OFF pressing the power button</h2>

<p>I have tried all combinations with the power button and the volume up ,etc...to&nbsp;turn on the Surface.&nbsp; Only hitting multiple times the power botton, the Surface starts at some point. Some times takes an hour to start. Every time is getting worse.</p>
<p>I already reset to original setting and nothing happens.</p>
</div>

<div>Once the Surface is&nbsp;ON you can not turn it&nbsp;OFF pressing the power button. I also press it down for up to 30 seconds and nothing happens.</div>

<div>The botton feels ok physically.</div>

<div>Has somebody had the same situation that can help me out?</div>

<div>Thank you very much.</div>

    <title>How Do I Reset Windows 10 Messaging App&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How Do I Reset Windows 10 Messaging App&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was hoping someone could help with a problem I am having with the Messaging app.&nbsp; On my Surface Pro 3 I am currently using 2 accounts; a company domain account as the main login, and a Microsoft account that is associated with a variety of apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally the device was set up with a different Microsoft account, but I recently added a new Microsoft account and deleted the old one.&nbsp; This worked fine, most apps automatically changed to the new Microsoft account, although some required me to sign
 out of them and sign back in for everything to work.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this does not seem possible for the Messaging app (I am referring to the default "Messaging" App included with Windows) since there is no sign out function.&nbsp; The app currently notifies me in the Action Center when I receive new messages, but
 when opening the app is either completely blank or takes me to the store to download it again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to either:</p>
<p>1) Delete the Messaging app and reinstall it (in hopes that it will pick up my new MS Account correctly)</p>
<p>2) Force the Messaging app to log out (registry change etc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Nick</p>

<p>MS appear to have deprecated the features in the messaging app that allow you to send recieve SMS messages - Cortana can now do this though.</p>

<p>To reset the Messaging app, go to Settings-Apps &amp; features, Find the messaging app, click on advanced options, then RESET</p>

            Hi Den.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is no Photo Viewer app in Windows 10.  The old Photo Viewer app was discontinued.  
<br />
<br />Use the Photos app. Here's how to import pictures from it:

    <title>Mincecraft Windows 10 redemption code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sapphiremoon96  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mincecraft Windows 10 redemption code</h2>
                    <p>This account I am on, this is my girlfriend's account. I purchased Minecraft W10 on my account, then separately on her account. I just installed a new SSD for her 2 days ago and I installed windows 10 all fine and everything. She wants me to install Minecraft.
 No problem, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I told her when we first purchased it on her account that if she ever changed her storage or got a new computer that she'd be able to download it again because it is locked onto her microsoft account. Apparently I'm wrong. Apparently if you try to go
 to your account page and order history on the microsoft website and click on install, you get a redemption code. Okay? Now enter the code. It's already been redeemed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just called support. I had to repeat the code 5 times. Then she seemed to be high because she totally forgot what my problem was, she thought I was saying that it had been redeemed on another account other than my girlfriends. No So she says "I'll put
 you on a brief hold to figure this out." I am waiting, then I hear the line switch, and you know when you're being sent to another agent. So I wait thinking maybe she at least filled him in on what my problem is. I even asked him, do I have to explain everything
 that is going on or did she tell you? He told me I would have to explain it again. *Slow clap* nice joooooob microsoft, nice job. Great support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm gonna ask the community and maybe you guys can actually give me an answer, how the hell do I get the code that is already on my girlfriend's microsoft account to work??

<h2>            I can&#39;t update KB3156421, problem with opencl.dll</h2>
                    <p>For the last 2 months, I can't update windows update. &nbsp;The problem seems to be with the cumulative update, being the latest update KB3156421.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did sfc /scannow and read the txt, it said it can not repair opencl.dll. &nbsp;Upon reading, i found out that opencl.dll has something to do with intel graphic display driver, so i updated to the latest version driver from Intel. &nbsp;I confirmed the opencll.dll
 is updated in windows since the date modified has changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I tried to update again, but it is still giving me opencll.dll error (can not repair).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have two windows 10 machine, one being the PRO (the one with this problem) and one is the regular win 10 (the working one, so I can get the working files from the reg win 10 if necessary to swap the corrupted file)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I can't attached file, so this is the exceprt</p>

            <p>Opencl.dll not fixable by sfc is a known issue. You should not be concerned with it. There was a pinned post by Microsoft here explaining that. Please explain your issue with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you getting an error message?</p>
<p>2. What happens when you click the "Check for updates" button? Does it find updates? Does it download them? Does it try to install them?</p>
<p>3. Right-click on the Start Menu button and select "Run".</p>
<p>&nbsp; a. Enter "<strong>perfmon.exe /rel</strong>" (without the quotes) in the box and click "OK".</p>
<p>&nbsp; b. This will bring up the Reliability Monitor. This should indicate any updates or problems which have occurred recently. What does it say?</p>

            <p>1. Do not be concerned with the opencl.dll error. I get that also when I run sfc and I have no issues with Windows Update. It is a problem between Windows and NVIDIA that either Microsoft or NVIDIA need to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Did you try running the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Update Troubleshooter</a>? [Most of these troubleshooters seem to be worthless but it is worth a try.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Did you try running the DISM command without adding the external source? That is what the Microsoft site suggests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. There are two options to get Windows back to normal: Refresh and Reset. Refreshing your PC reinstalls Windows and keeps your personal files and settings. It also keeps the apps that came with your PC and the apps you installed from the Windows Store.
 Resetting your PC reinstalls Windows but deletes your files, settings, and apps—except for the apps that came with your PC. You might want to consider doing the Refresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. If you want another option, I suggest you go to the Windows TenForums. This forum is not run by Microsoft and the people there are pretty good with solving Windows 10 issues. The General Support Forum is
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/general-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only posts in other forums that seem to resolve the issue contains suggests a "repair install". Here is how to do it if needed.</p>

            <p>I suggest you go to the Windows TenForums to see what they can do. There is a way of resetting Windows Update (I thought the WU Troubleshooter did that, but maybe not).</p>

    <title>System Crash after Reverting from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 7 Pro - - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelyyz  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Crash after Reverting from Windows 10 Pro to Windows 7 Pro - Help&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to help a friend of mine from Italy. I am in Canada. She is not very knowledgeable about computers, so I am trying to help her step-by-step, by phone. Quite challenging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>She has a desktop HP Compaq dc7900 convertible minitower with Windows 7 Professional 64-bit installed on it. She claims that, without doing anything herself, she found Windows 10 being installed as an upgrade on the computer. At the time, she was not ready
 to upgrade to Windows 10 and, as soon as the program finished the installation, she activated the option to revert to Windows 7. The process was completed 'successfully' after about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, when the computer restarted, it displayed the error that the Windows files are damaged and repair is necessary using the Windows 7 installation disk. Unfortunately, my friend could not find her installation disk for Windows 7, so it's probably lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I suggested that we try to re-install Windows 10 from DVD. I guided my friend to create an installation DVD from an ISO image of Windows 10. She booted up from the DVD, selected the 'Upgrade' option (not 'Custom'), the computer recognized Windows 7 to
 be upgraded from and then the computer asked to remove the DVD and restart normally to continue the installation process (see the attached screenshot).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, after restarting, she is getting again the damaged Windows screens (see attached) and we could not get past these screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could be done to repair my friend's computer? Thank you for your valuable help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. It appears that the computer originally came with Windows Vista, as it has a Vista recovery partition on it, but later on my friend upgraded to Windows 7. We could, of course, restore the computer to Vista, but then we could not upgrade to Windows 10
 for free.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Michael,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
To assist you better, share the information;<br />
-&nbsp; What is the complete error message related to damaged Windows screens that you receive?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to perform a startup repair using the installation media and check again. Follow the steps provided below:</div>
<div>
<p>1.&nbsp;On a working PC, go to the link</p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows7</a></span></p>
<p>2.&nbsp;Download the installation media and then run it. <br />
3.&nbsp;Select Create installation media for another PC. <br />
4.&nbsp;Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit). <br />
5.&nbsp;Follow the steps to create installation media, and then select <strong>Finish.
</strong><br />
6.&nbsp;Connect the installation media you created to your nonfunctional PC, and then turn it on.<br />
7.&nbsp;On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.

            <p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the site you mentioned but could not download Windows 7 because it was asking for a Product Key. As I mentioned, my friend could not find her Windows 7 installation disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I remembered I had bought an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">upgrade</span> version of Windows 7 Professional back in October 2009, which I never used. I input my Product Key and then the website required to also select a language. The only
 available options were French and Korean - not sure why - which are both useless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, I made a .cdr image of my own Windows 7 disk on my MacBook Pro using Disk Utility (Image Format: DVD/CD Master, Encryption: None), converted it to an .iso image in Terminal (<span>hdiutil
 makehybrid -iso -joliet -o [filename].iso [filename].cdr</span>) and uploaded the file to the cloud for my friend in Italy to download. She then made a Windows 7 DVD using the exact steps that she used to make the Windows 10 DVD previously (using CDBurner
 XP).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem now is that, unlike with the Windows 10 DVD, the computer would not boot up from the optical drive when the Windows 7 DVD is in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to boot up the the computer form another device (e.g. USB stick) to access and launch setup.exe on the Windows 7 installation disk? How? I was able to boot up the computer using Linux Ubuntu from a USB stick and could read the Windows
 7 installation disk, so the data on the disk appears fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions or ideas would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you, again.</p>

    <title>How to find and delete windows dump files - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to find and delete windows dump files</h2>
                    I have a question. Where does windows keep dump files and how can I delete them? As part of my AV software it finds junk files and wants me to buy a program to remove them. And one of the things it tells me about is windows dump files. The problem is I
 can't find where they are. If I can find them I can just delete them myself without needing to buy or download anything. Can someone tell me how to delete these dump files?

            Hi KreeperKing
<br />
<br />Yes, you can just delete the Dump Files, you may need to provide permission
<br />
<br />You will find the dump files in C:\Windows and in C:\Windows\MiniDump
<br />
<br />However, the most successful way to remove all dump files is:
<br />
<br />Open File Explorer
<br />Click on your hard drive
<br />On the Manage Tab, click Cleanup
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete
<br />
<br />Start Disk Cleanup again
<br />Let Disk Cleanup do its initial scan
<br />This time in the resulting dialog, click 'Cleanup System Files'
<br />Let Disk Cleanup run another scan
<br />Select Everything in the list and choose Delete

            That is my problem. I do not see any dmp files inside the windows folder and the windows\minidump folder is empty it does not show me anything, but my AV software (I use AVG) says that windows dump files take up almost a GB yet I cant find any of them.
 I understand that I could use CCleaner to remove them but I just want to know why I can't find them.

            Hi CreeperKing
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer, just do a straight search on your C drive, by typing *.dmp in the search box at the top right, does that find the location of the dump files?

            Well I did not find any files called windows.dmp or any thing like that but I did show me two folders called dmp one is located in windows\syswow64\com and the other is in windows\system32\com. I don't have permission to open them, and because of where
 they are I don't want to bother them, but it might be possible that the dump files are in there. I guess if they get to large I will just have to use CCleaner to remove them.

<h2>            Xbox one x flickering</h2>
                    <p>There is a flickering happening when I play or watch in 4k. Has&nbsp;happened twice in the past two months since I bought the console new. First time it stopped. This time it has been a few days and it is still happening. If I switch to 1080p it's fine. Have changed all settings trying to figure it out and did a hard reset on Xbox. Also does it in all HDMI ports on tv. Tv is a Vizio m70-e3. I also have a video of it. Any solutions?? Havent bought a new HDMI cable yet.&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/q3cdV-f9_cM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://youtu.be/q3cdV-f9_cM</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/q3cdV-f9_cM?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/q3cdV-f9_cM?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain

</p><p>-Set color depth to 10bit! (Do not set it to 12bit!)</p><p>
</p><p>-Uncheck YCC 4:2:2!</p><p>
</p><p>Both of above 2 settings must be set.  neglecting one will cause flickering.  I've been playing without a single flicker after it.</p><p><br /></p>

            If you haven't swapped out the cable yet, as your post indicates, I would suggest you try that next.
