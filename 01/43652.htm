<p>I want to know if Your Shape game download is region free? (i.e. to know if i can download it from a physical location different from the account region)</p>
<p>an early response would be appreciated.</p>

<p>No actually. I stay in Oman which is not a 'live' region and my account is registered in India as a result. Your shape game CD is unavailable in Oman for some reason and i want it badly. Although I can arrange for purchase of the microsoft points in india
 to my gamertag, I understand that downloads in Oman would be successful only if Your Shape download is region free. That is the reason for my question. Thx,</p>

<p>You should just assume that if you don't live in a LIVE supported region that you will have issues with the marketplace.

            Best bet: Type "Sticky Notes" into the start menu, click it when you see it. If you want it to stay in the taskbar right click the sticky notes (in the start menu or taskbar" and select "Pin to taskbar".

<h2>            xbox accessories &#40;turtle beach stream mic and xbox chatpad&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a new xbox one s.&nbsp; I had previously had the chatpad with my old xbox one and swapped it over to the new controller.&nbsp; Everything worked</p>
<p>Then my turtle beach stream mic arrived so I tried to plug it in and use it.&nbsp; Didn't seem to recognize the mic and now the chatpad did not work either I noticed.&nbsp; I plugged the mic into my ps4 and it worked, and also into my pc and the mic worked.&nbsp; I updated
 the firmware from the pc and tried again with the xbox but nothing worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset the xbox to factory and when it booted back up the chatpad worked again.&nbsp; I plugged the mic in once all restored to with apps and games and the stream mic worked.&nbsp; I quit playing xbox and watched a movie then turned the xbox off</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next morning neither the chatpad are recognized nor the stream mic.&nbsp; When I goto the xbox accessories settings of xbox it won't load.&nbsp; It only shows the rotating circle that shows it is loading.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very frustrating as the mic works elsewhere.&nbsp; Do not want to have to reset the xbox every day to use the accessories I purchased</p>

<p>Hi DirtyHeysoos,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your post, It seems that there are some issues with the console's operating system, to correct issues like this, try performing an

<h2>            Paid apps on Windows RT, Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8</h2>
                    Hey, I've purchased apps for my Surface and I found how to get them on my PC, but why do they try to make me pay for them again on my new Samsung Ativ S Running Windows Phone 8? I thought that they work cross platform.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help!

            <p>Hello Andre4w, <br />
<br />
Go to the app's page in the Store.</p>
<p>Open the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/charms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share charm</a>.</p>
<p>Choose how you want to share a link, and then follow the instructions. For example, you can share using most mail, messaging, and social networking apps.<br />
<br />
You need to change the Windows Store account to the account from which you’ve purchased apps.<br />
Look at the link <a href="http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/windows-8-tip-share-apps-between-multiple-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> that will walk you through the steps for sharing between accounts and devices.
<br />
<br />
Here are some links that may help with getting to know Windows 8 better.<br />

<p>That's great but doesn't cover the fact I have bought Fruit Ninja on my surface but would need to buy it again on my Windows Phone 8 device. Apple let you install the tablet version of a paid for app at no extra cost.</p>

            Are you sure you actually need to purchase the app again? I've noticed that when upgrading from Windows Phone 7.5 to Windows Phone 8 (I know, not exactly the same as Surface to WP8)&nbsp;that many of the applications I had previously purchased would still show
 a "Buy" button, however, after selecting buy it would recognize I had already purchased it and ask if I wanted to install it - without purchasing again. Additionally, I know this shouldn't need asked, but the Microsoft account you used to setup your Windows
 Phone is the same as the Microsoft account used to setup your Surface, right?

<h2>            Wiping and reinstalling Windows 10 Pro without any product key details</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an unpaid director of a non profit organisation called Wyldwoods (offers classes and respite to kids and adults with learning difficulties in the UK) and they have a laptop on site for them to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunatly the carers on the site haven't been monitoring properly when the clients have been using it and now it's virused to the max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember upgrading it to Windows 10 a few years ago, but other then that I cant remember much about it, and there's no Product Keys on it to confirm what it even originally came with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously this is now a real problem as I need to wipe, reformat then reinstall a fresh Windows 10 on it but i'm worried on how on earth I can reactivate the fresh version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned on the laptop 20 minutes ago and it's still booting up, that's how bad it's been infiltrated. Unless it boots up, I cant even see the product key it has now, let alone see if it has a digital license or anything to tell me how it was activated last
 time (although if it was an upgrade of Windows 7 it wouldn't have needed activating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my needy question is....How on earth do I fix this please??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're a non profit organisation so we really cant afford to buy a new copy, let alone a more modern laptop</p>

            Hi Stephen, no need to worry, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a product key, and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            Hi Stephen
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />If you can still boot to the desktop...
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 performs a clean install again

<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience assist with personlizing your Windows experience such as creating a user account, connect to a wireless network and adjust privacy settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />Choose your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone then click Next
<br />
<br />Read and accept the End User License Agreement
<br />
<br />If you want to customize your privacy settings, you can do so now. Please note, you can always do this after setup (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy). For now, lets use Use Express settings
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next
<br />
<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows
<br />
<br />OPTION 2:
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

            Hi Stephen,
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable installation media
<br />
<br />On the Dell Precision M4400, when you boot up, on the Dell Logo, repeatedly press F12 to bring up the temporary boot menu, from there you should be able to select the installation media to boot from
<br />
<br />If not, on that workstation, repeatedly pressing F2 on the Dell logo will bring you into BIOS

<p>Will it matter if I replace the 32bit version of windows 10 pro that is on the laptop (found that out after it finally booted after 45 minutes!!!!) with a 64 bit version, or would it have to be exactly the same version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then again, the laptop only has 4gb of RAM so would it really make any difference?</p>

            Hi Stephen
<br />
<br />Your Windows 10 licence covers both the 32bit and 64bit versions, however considering the specs of that laptop, the 32bit version would run very fast on that, and perhaps not so much the 64it version . ..

            Actually, it can act as a key for both OS. If you want to get back to previous OS after installing Windows 10, You can use the recovery media that will be made available when Windows 10 launches officially.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some users have been reporting, specific make and models just stop working after either upgrading to Windows 10 1809 or a specific cumulative update under 1809.
</p>
<p>Your best option is to do as you already did, rollback or try uninstalling the specific cumulative update that triggered the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALso, make sure you file a bug report:</p>
<p>https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Open the Services window (Windows key + R, type services.msc, press enter).</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Select Print Spooler and click the Stop icon, if it is not stopped already.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Navigate to C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS and open this file. You may need to show hidden files or enter an administrator's password.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Delete all contents inside the folder. Do not delete the PRINTERS folder itself. Note that this will remove all current print jobs, so make sure no one on your network is using the printer.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Return to the Services window, select Print Spooler, and click Start.

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've solved this by doing the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open a powershell or cmd console as administrator, goto c:\windows\system32 and type the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>takeown /f&nbsp;c:\windows\system32\spool /r /d y</p>
<p>icacls c:\windows\system32\spool /grant *S-1-3-4:F /t /c /l /q</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>now go to c:\windows and type:</p>
<p>
</p><p>takeown /f c:\windows\temp /r /d y</p>
<p>icacls c:\windows\temp /grant *S-1-3-4:F /t /c /l /q</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That should solve the problem.</p>

<h2>            HP Photosmart 7150 Driver</h2>
                    I need the print driver for a HP Photosmart 7150. No longer supported by HP.

            <p>On the HP support page for the Photosmart 7150 (<a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-photosmart-7150-printer-series/72880" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-photosmart-7150-printer-series/72880</a>),
 HP says that a driver for this printer is available from "the Windows built-in solution."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although the "Learn more" link following that message is broken, what HP means is that you should connect your printer to your computer and when the computer detects it, you should get a pop-up asking for permission to connect to Windows Update.&nbsp; You should
 allow this and make sure that you have a working Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't get the pop-up message, there are two more methods to use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Disconnect the printer</li><li>Click the Start Orb and then click Devices and Printers</li><li>Click "Add a printer"</li><li>Click "Add a local printer"</li><li>Select "Using an existing port" and leave the default "LPT1: (Printer Port)" and click Next</li><li>Select "HP" in the left section and scroll through the entries on the right to confirm that you do not have "Photosmart 7150" listed (the "Photosmart C7100 Series" and "Photosmart D7100" Series are not the same as your printer).</li><li>Click the "Windows Update" button</li><li>Wait (this may take quite some time)</li><li>When the update is complete, look through the list again.</li><li>Click "Cancel" to close the Wizard</li></ol>
<p>If in step 9 you find that the "Photosmart 7150" is now included in the list, connect your printer to your computer, turn on the printer, and it should install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If in step 9 you find that there is still no entry for the "Photosmart 7150," you'll have to do things the hard way, which is Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Using Internet Explorer (only), go to <a href="http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=photosmart%207150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=photosmart%207150</a></li><li>You will see that there are 51 entries for this printer.&nbsp; I cannot tell you what the differences may be between different downloads.&nbsp; Here's what I would do if I were you, but this is only a guess:
<ul>
<li>select one of the items dated 3/21/2007</li><li>click on the item name to see some detail.&nbsp; If the "Architecture" line says X86, the item is for a 32-bit version of Windows 7; if the "Architecture" line says AMD64, the item is for a 64-bit version of Windows 7</li><li>Make a note of the item that is intended for your version of Windows 7; pick the one that says "(DOT4USB)"</li><li>Click the "Add" button for the item you selected</li><li>Click "View basket" (just below the search box at the upper right)</li><li>Click "Download" -- a pop-up window will open</li><li>Click the "Browse" button in the pop-up and respond to the UAC prompt as necessary</li><li>Select the location to save the item (I suggest your Desktop) and click OK; click Continue</li><li>After the file has downloaded, close all of the windows</li></ul>
</li><li>The item you downloaded will be a folder named something like "Hewlett-Packard&nbsp; - Printing - HP Photosmart 7150 Series (DOT4USB)" -- this folder contains a *.cab file, which is a compressed file that needs to be expanded before you can use it.&nbsp; There are
 several methods that you can use to do this, but I suggest that you download and install free 7-zip (<a href="http://7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://7-zip.org/</a>)
<ul>
<li>Create a new, empty folder in the same location where you saved the downloaded folder (e.g., your Desktop); call this something such as "HP 7150 Driver"</li><li>Start 7-zip and click File &gt; Open<br />
</li><li>Browse to the folder you downloaded and then double-click on that folder so that the cab file (which probably has a very long name indicating all of the languages included) is showing in the 7-zip window</li><li>Click "Extract" and then click the "..." button to the right of the "Extract to" box; select the new empty folder you created and click OK</li><li>click OK and when the extraction is complete, close 7-zip</li></ul>
</li><li>The contents of the new folder should look something like the following (you may not see the filename extensions (cab, cat, inf) unless you have configured Windows to show these):<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44f9d618-1522-435d-bc71-c3be5ca0e964" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44f9d618-1522-435d-bc71-c3be5ca0e964" /></a><br />
</li><li>Click the Start Orb and then click Devices and Printers</li><li>Select any item in the "Printers and Faxes" section</li><li>Click "Print server properties" at the top of the Devices and Printers window</li><li>Click the "Drivers" tab</li><li>Click "Add" to open the "Add Printer Driver Wizard"<br />
</li><li>Select the proper processor (32-bit or 64-bit)&nbsp; Do not select "Itanium"</li><li>In the "Printer Driver Selection" window, click "Have disk"</li><li>Click "Browse" and go to the folder where you had extracted the contents of the downloaded cab file (e.g., "HP 7150 Driver")</li><li>Select the file.&nbsp; If more than one file is shown, select "hpp7150s.inf" (or hpp7150s if file extensions are not shown).&nbsp; Click Open and then click OK</li><li>You should now be at the following window:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b671eb3c-b46d-41f9-95cd-c6c235944b52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b671eb3c-b46d-41f9-95cd-c6c235944b52" /></a><br />
</li><li>Click "Next" and then "Finish"</li><li>You should now be back at the list of printer drivers in the "Print server properties" dialog, and the list should now include a driver for your HP 7150.</li><li>Connect your printer and turn it on.</li><li>If all goes well, your printer should install now.</li></ol>

                    <p class="contentStandard">Bluetooth was working well for a long time last year using a bluetooth USB adapter, and I was using it until late November or so. I used it again this week (we are developers developing on UWP with the Windows Bluetooth stack) but
 the Bluetooth settings disappeared, and I'm getting a bunch of related errors, such as:</p>

<p class="contentStandard">We have purchased other Bluetooth USB drivers from different brands, but apparently they all use the same driver. There are bundled software with the devices (for Windows 8.1 - on the instructions some of them have a note that we
 have to uninstall the bundled device for Windows 10, which has its own drivers) and while they may work with Windows 10, they include a different Bluetooth stack, and we can't use those because have to use the Windows 10 one for development purposes. Other
 screenshots attached. Tried on different machines, one with a working built-in Bluetooth, but the error is the same for the device. It is either listed as CSR 8510 A10 or Generic Bluetooth &nbsp;.</p>

<p>
</p><p>There is an option to Update Driver Software when you right click on the device in device manager. Instead of using Update Online, we selected Browse Computer for Driver Software. Instead of selecting a path, we chose "Let me pick a list of device drivers

<h2>            How to recover files from Found.000 folder to its original format</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We ran <strong>chkdsk</strong> on one of our disk &nbsp;on windows 2012 R2 server and it was running since 4 days and stuck at 10% and doing nothing, So we just restarted the server. After restarting the server we were unable to see the files we had before we
 ran chkdsk on the disk and later when we checked in the hidden folders and files we found it had created a new folder with name
<strong>Found.000.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>How can we restore these files and folders to their original format?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please us with the steps to restore these files to their original format as this is a very important data and we need it back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Reputation meter creates unwarranted negative reviews - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gimpyolman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Reputation meter creates unwarranted negative reviews</h2>
                    
<p>Once someone is avoided how ever many times the reputation meter drops to AVOID ME in big red letters.&nbsp; Once a player sees this many automatically do EXACTLY THAT... they mark them Avoid ME.&nbsp; The poor choice of wording used by Xbox then&nbsp; creates a never
 ending cycle the player can never redeem themselves from as Xbox has already poisoned the game atmosphere and placed a sub-conscious directive&nbsp; in the other player minds and the person with this this reputation score can never break the continuous flow of
 avoidance even if the player does not deserve the feedback.&nbsp; Furthermore, there is no appeal process in which to counter this and no way to address a rating system based only upon if someone likes how you play or don't play.&nbsp;&nbsp; Negative feedback should be limited
 only to voice -- i.e. rampant live name calling or profanity that can be reviewed by Xbox for validity and or hate/spam messages and nothing more as far as the reputation meter goes.&nbsp; If someone doesn't want to play with someone that is their choice and right
 but that doesn't mean the person they don't want to play with should be punished or given a negative rating or red flag on their profile simply because someone doesn't think they play well enough to encounter again, or had to leave because of events within
 the home they can't see or know about, or plays too well for them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Xbox has poisoned the game atmosphere, in my opinion, and arbitrarily branded many honest, decent players with a virtual scarlet letter with the current configuration. &nbsp; If you play live
 you have 12 other players.&nbsp; A match lasts about 10 minuets each.&nbsp; That is potentially 72 players an hours (give or take a few) ... in just an 8 hour span a player could potentially interact with 576 different players ... It doesn't take a rocket scientist
 to see with that many potential players in various moods how someone could acquire sufficient avoidance to get a reduced reputation. &nbsp; Couple that with the AVOID ME comment and it is even easier to see how it could and would stay there. &nbsp; Xbox needs to reevaluate
 how it does a rating system and to allow for a review or appeal process or simply do away with it and just fix it so if you are avoided you don't link up again, or at least greatly reduce the odds.&nbsp; Let's face we have enough cheating without putting up with
 AVOID ME type ratings that can't be cleaned up because once one gets this rating they aren't allowed to play openly ... and the system becomes worthless...</p>

<p>I've often wondered why they took out the "Prefer Player" option.</p>
<p>I don't know how the system works on Xbox One. I just watched a video where it said Microsoft claimed they can sniff out false complaints, but how?</p>
<p>Ok if I'm in a game now and I see someone cheating, I report them.</p>
<p>But I bet everyone here knows there are players out there that will report someone just because someone beat them fair and square in a game ( basically sore losers ) so how does Microsoft know a genuine complaint from a false one? I don't see how they can,
 I could be wrong though.</p>

<p>You guys are blinding yourselves, if you ask me... Even worse then that, you're trying to spread false (or at the very least unproven) information by taking advantage of this public forum.</p>
<p>Sure, you will interact with a lot of players over a given time, but do you know how many of them are going to actually take the time to look at every other player's profile, much less yours? Not many - most will just move on to the next match without a
 care in the world. You guys act as if the sky is falling - it's not.</p>
<p>Sure people can report you out of spite (losing, for exmaple), but it won't do them any good. The enforcement team has already gone on record to say that you will never be punished for being too good. For being rude, cheating, etc. yes, but never for being
 too good. They investigate all claims and unless you give them just cause, you have nothing to be concerned about.</p>
<p>The idea that someone will report you simply because you're already in the red is simply ludicous. Why would they even do that (again, unless you give them cause to)? If they did that, all they would accomplish is make it less likely for any future reports
 they make to be taken less seriously by the enforcement team (they have no tolerance for little boys and girls who cry wolf).</p>
<p>If you're worried about a large group of people reporting you, you don't have to worry about that either. The enforcement team takes multiple reports of the same type of report (say cheating, for example) from multiple people that are placed roughly around
 the same time-frame and lumps it into a single report rather than many. This helps prevent people from abusing the system to spite others (by using the power of clans and such). In addition to that, in a lot of cases, the reporting player will have interacted
 with the accused in some way (via message, party, same game, etc.). They ignore reports that don't meet that very simple criteria because they know it'll just be hearsay - which is what you're spreading BTW.</p>
<p>If your rep has taken a hit, fixing it is easy - it just takes time. You're right about it limiting who you play with, but that's done on purpose. Xbox Live doesn't want unsavory sorts inter-mingling and ruining the fun of decent, genuine people. Picture
 a wagon with a bunch of people on it. You fall off of it because you're drunk. As you attempt to get back on the wagon, you're unable to because the people on the wagon don't want your filthy drunken breath back on the wagon. The only way to get back on is
 to wait out your drunken stupor, become sober, and then get back on. In other words, you're not restricted from playing online - just from matchmaking. My advice is to play with friends - rely on them to help get you into multiplayer games. Accept their invites
 or join them. Use them as the crutch you need to get back up on your feet. Unfortunately, if you're in the red, it may take a while - and we're not talking week; we're talking potentially months here.</p>
<p>The enforcement team has stated that they send multiple warnings as your rep drops too and you can even ask why on the enforcent team's site (which, I'm sorry to say, I don't have the link to). They send it via XBL messages and to your account's email. If
 you don't check either very often, it may be no surprise that you may have missed it and think you were instantly put into the red (perhaps it went to your junk mail folder?).</p>
<p>Speaking of feedback, there is none - not for negative or positive. There is only reporting others, blocking communications, and muting. The latter 2 don't effect your reputation at all. As for the 1st, if you limited it only to communications, then the
 system would be overrun with rampant cheaters, thieves, and others who like to abuse the system. I don't know about you, but I wouldn't want that at all...</p>
<p>There are ways to appeal if you think you've been wrongly accused to - the enforcement site is 1 such way.</p>
<p>If what you say was actually true, then everyone would be in avoid me status, but they're not. Myself and many others here have been playing for years (I've been around for 9 at least) and have NEVER had any issue with the reputation system (on the 360 or
 the One).</p>
<p>The system is far from worthless - it works.</p>
<p>Now open your eyes before you do any more damage...</p>

<p>I went to the GoW site and there does appear (unfortunately) to be an issue with that game that can affect your rep.</p>
<p>I've heard in the past that games like HMCC has an automated system that automatically punishes players rep for doing certain things, like team-killing or quitting a match early, for example.</p>
<p>It seems to me that GoW:UE has a similar feature, but it's player controlled instead of being automated (or having a medium where an official investigates the reported violation 1st, as is the case with many CoD games) where you can report players via an
 in-game interface that DIRECTLY ties to your rep. So, naturally, people have taken advantage of this. While I admit, this is broken, the good news is that official support has taken notice and will be fixing it soon.</p>
<p>In the meantime, I would recommend NOT playing GoW online until after the fix to avoid such issues. There's still plenty of things out there for you to play.</p>
<p>If you've already taken a hit to your rep because of this broken aspect of the game, you can state your case on the Xbox subreddit that is linked in the Gears of War site's mega-thread (sorry, I don't recall the link - otherwise, I'd post it here) that addresses
 the issue - it's pinned at the top of the Gears of War UE forum.</p>
<p>I'd also like to add that this issue seems to only be isolated to GoW:UE and should not be conducive of the reputation and enforcement system as a whole.</p>

    <title>Lost progress on a SAVED Movie Maker project - impossible to continue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moolker  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost progress on a SAVED Movie Maker project - impossible to continue</h2>
                    Hi, this happened twice already and I don't want to waste more time editing video and losing progress again - so I'm asking. I loaded about 3,5 hours worth of GoPro video to Movie Maker in order to cut it and after about half an hour (after getting down
 to 2,5 hours worth of material), the videos on the right suddenly start disappearing under the cursor. I can't continue working so I turn Movie Maker off and when I load the project, there's nothing - except for the timer, saying the project has 2,5 hours.
 But no video, no sound, no nothing. It's very frustrating. Happened twice already. Why? And is there any way to recover it? Thanks...

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> </span></span>Ensure you have installed the latest version of<strong> Windows Live Movie Maker
</strong>using the below link:<strong>&nbsp; </strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> </span><span>Check that the files you are using are of a
</span><strong><span>supported format</span></strong><span> – Some file formats are not supported by Windows Live Movie Maker.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please find the&nbsp;list of supported formats using the below article:<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Ensure that your </span><strong><span>Video card drivers
</span></strong><span>are up to date</span><span> - Movie Maker makes extensive use of the video card GPU (graphics processing unit). The display driver affects the reliability, performance, and compatibility of the video card with different software.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To determine the version and video card driver date, <strong>run the DirectX Diagnostic Tool
</strong>(dxdiag):</span></p>
<p><strong><span>DirectX Diagnostic Tool</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Click on <strong>Start button</strong> and type <strong>“dxdiag</strong>” in the Search programs and files box and press Enter key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on the <strong>Display tab </strong>and you will see the driver details including the driver version.</span></p>
<p><span>3. If your video card driver seems outdated please go to the video card driver manufacturer and see if a newer version is available.
</span></p>

<h2>            Random Jscript Script and Cascading Style Sheet Document Files</h2>
                    Today I was cleaning out my Downloads folder and I came across one weird one. I thought it was just full of files my friend had sent me on skype, as it was labled in her name, but when I opened it I found weird pictures from my facebook friends that I
 never ever downloaded. There was something more absurd, too. I found tons and tons of weird Jscript Script and Cascading Style Sheet Document Files... What are these? I have two example pictures:&nbsp;

<h2>            Auto Renewal trying to take money from Cancelled card</h2>
                    
<p>I have received 5 emails from Xbox support telling me that they have been unable to take the auto renewal fee for Xbox live.</p>
<p>I have a prepaid card to use but it will not accept this code as valid payment.<br />
<br />
Please advise, though i will not pay twice for a subscription so paying on a credit card isn't and option<br />
<br />
Thanks</p>

<p>Since they have attempted to charge you, you now have accrued a balance you have to pay off before you can continue using gold on that account. You cannot add a prepaid card until that balance is paid off. You can see the balance you owe at

            File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

    <title>How do I downgrade from Win10 Pro to Win10 Home&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I downgrade from Win10 Pro to Win10 Home&#63;</h2>
                    Hey! I upgraded to Windows 10 from 8.1 back in November and got a product key for Home for Christmas. Turns out the free upgrade defaulted to Pro. I've tried everything I can think of to downgrade to Home, but it hasn't worked, and going back to Win8.1
 isn't an option. Any help is very welcome!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, Windows 10&nbsp;Pro&nbsp;has&nbsp;a few more features&nbsp;compared to Windows 10 Home <strong>
so downgrading achieves nothing and wastes the Christmas gift you received.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>By leaving the PC you upgraded from 8.1 Pro to 10 Pro&nbsp;it will leave you an extra key code that you can use on a new (custom built) PC at a later time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mark</p>
        </p>

            Already tried changing the registry. Didn't work for me. Guess I'll be running to the store when I can to nab a thumb drive, then. Thanks!

</p><blockquote>...Turns out the free upgrade defaulted to Pro. I've tried everything I can think of to downgrade to Home...</blockquote>
<p>Actually the upgrade from Home to Pro was Microsoft's doing. I'm sorry I cannot recall where I saw that message a couple of times but it was Microsoft who offered it and not a glitch of any sort. So think of it as a gift of a free upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the life of me I cannot think of why you would want to downgrade yourself anyhow since the Pro version has everything the Home version does and then some. The Pro version is no more complicated to use. The only reason I can see you wanting to downgrade
 is because you are trying to be an honest person and not keep something you unintentionally got, and I truly commend you for that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, this was not a glitch, you did not receive the Pro version by accident, it was given to you free by Microsoft. Again, I saw a message saying so on my own machine, I just forgot where it was or when it was that I saw it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to your Home version product key, I'm almost certain you can still use that to activate your new Pro version.</p>
