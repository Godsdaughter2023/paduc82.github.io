<p>I have a similar problem. When I try to play with others in public matches the game session ends after character selection. It's so annoying and I can't find the solution to this problem. However I have played a few games with a friend in private match and
 it worked fine. You can add me and we can play private matches in the mean time until this problem can be solved.</p>

<p>This game is not distant friendly. The furthur away the players are , the higher the ping, and disconnection happens. Need a very good internet connection and need to be close to the other player to play this game fine. &nbsp;You should be able to play with players
 having four bars white when idle. This is a problem with all netherrealms games including mortal kombat 9. The error message will be "The game session is no longer available"</p>

<p>Hi same thing goes for me i picked the game up on saturday. Started playing for a bit in practice mode and bam i get a disconnect, thought ok i reconnect maby the connection in the network was lost, so i reconnected and ten minutes after that another disconnect.
 I looked on my pc and wireless connection on my phone everything stays online and has internet its just the xbox. So i tried staying on the dashboard for an hour and no disconnect, i played ssf4 with some friends for a few hours no disconnect. Then i put back
 in INJUSTICE: GODS AMONG US and there the disconnects come back again. Its realy frustrating cause i would like to play against some friends but cant cause i get disconnects like every 10 mins with that game its realy annoying. Plus its not my internet connection
 i got a download of 30Mbit/s and an upload of 11Mbit/s. hope that this problem gets fixed soon cause i cant realy think of the stupid disc having problems and disconnecting me -.-</p>

<p>Haven't had that problem in regular Ranked/Player matches. It happens sometimes on King or the Hill/Survivor lobbies, even though I have decent Internet connection. I suppose its just high ping.

<h2>            WINDOWS 7 64-bit - Microsoft Wireless Transceiver for Bluetooth 2.0 doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to install my <span>Microsoft Optical Desktop Elite For Bluetooth Keyboard</span> for Windows XP - Portuguese version. I checked the Windows 7 Compatibility Center here<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Microsoft%20Optical%20Desktop%20Elite%20for%20Bluetooth%20104Key%20Keyboard&amp;v=Microsoft&amp;uid=M54-00013&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=1&amp;s=optical%20desktop%20elite&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Microsoft%20Optical%20Desktop%20Elite%20for%20Bluetooth%20104Key%20Keyboard&amp;v=Microsoft&amp;uid=M54-00013&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=1&amp;s=optical%20desktop%20elite&amp;os=64-bit</a>&nbsp;and
 I can see that the 104 Key version is compatible with Windows 7. The Portuguese version is 105 Key but I guess this is not that important in this case.</p>
<p>The problem is with the Microsoft Wireless Transceiver for Bluetooth 2.0 - I plug the Transceiver (USB port) and I get a pop-up saying the driver didn't install correctly. I already tried all the common procedures (hardware troubleshoot, reinstall, Windows
 Updates, drive updates...).</p>
<p>I can see the device in the Device Manager under Bluetooth Radios. I used "update driver software and the outcome is "the driver software for your device is up to date".</p>
<p>So I checked Properties and the error message is "This device cannot start. (Code 10)". I was not able to find this code in other threads.</p>
<p>Then, under the Driver Details I found that Driver files are all C:\Windows\system32\... As my Windows 7 is 64-bit I started wondering if there is any problem here.</p>
<p>Don't know whatelse to do... Any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!<br />

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The Code 10 error pertains mainly to hardware and device driver issues or to compatibility issues between hardware drivers and additional software that is installed
 in Windows. Therefore, we recommend that you troubleshoot these issues by focusing on device drivers, on device configuration issues, and on hardware compatibility issues. You might need to update the chipset drivers and the USB controller</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the article given below for more information.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You may also try deleting the USB "Upper Filter" &amp; "Lower Filter" Entry</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious
 problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.</span></span></p>

    <title>How to have identical version of windows on both computers that - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jared-1  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to have identical version of windows on both computers that replicate each other 24&#47;7</h2>
                    <p>hi, I have two high spec gaming computers, one a desktop , on a laptop, now the thing is , if I visit family etc or anytime I am not in my room I am on my laptop as primary computer but when I am in my room , the desktop is better spec for gaming, however
 my problem is, I want EVERYTHING to be identical on the two machines and I want them to update 24/7 so if I download something on one, it will download on to the other, if I install it on one , it will install it on the other.</p>
<p>similar to if I had a server hosting my user account. however I have no server.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the whole "install programs" is not possible at lease allow me to make the system identical to the point of files transferring to both and the user interface being identical, so apart from missing programs I would not tell the difference?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know windows 8 has something similar, but it doesn't support file transfer and all user settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows 7 and 8 to chose from as the basis for this "connection"</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>You won’t be able to replicate things from One Computer to another Computer.<br />
For ex:&nbsp;You need have to install Windows Updates on both the Computer, you won’t be able to share the Updates. It won’t support.</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may create a Home group in both the Computers; Homegroup makes it easier to share
 files and printers on a home network. You can share pictures, music, videos, documents, and printers with other people in your Homegroup. Other people can't change the files that you share, unless you give them permission to do so.</span></p>
<p><span>The suggested link will help you in creating a Home Group.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/help/homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/help/homegroup-from-start-to-finish</a></span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></p>

            <p>No this was not helpful, i am fully versed in the simple features on windows like home group</p>
<p>And in what way will home group transfer settings, programs, etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did not say anything about windows update i said, they must update files etc 24/7 and as far as updates go, they would come From Microsoft which would be possible with the simple auto install updates program, but again i did not say updates.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a simple question that asked nothing of home group, this is what gets me about forums,
</p>
<p>I ask a Simple simple question and get some random answer that is not even close to what i asked, i said settings and files, not just files, if i wanted just files i would have goggled it if i had not already know about home sharing and just done that without
 asking</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>i am sorry, but its people like you who treat people like me as if we were slightly retarded.</p>
<p>i did not ask for home sharing! just to make it clear to people, i want a facility that tries to replicate the settings of one computer onto the other 24/7 so when i go on one it is the same as the other!.<br />

            <p>i am asking a technical question which requires an answer of "no there is nothing that would do what you asked" or yes this does the things you said is had to do and maybe the things you want it to do "</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>not, use home group</p>

<p>like saying to a guy who asked is there a way to make my petrol car more efficient with fuel and you going, yeah don't drive it. &nbsp;its just to unbelievable of a silly answer.</p>

<h2>            I lost my internet connection</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All and thank you in advance fro helping me out</p>
<p>I have a Dell Inspiron 1501, AMD Sempron processor Windows Vista Home Basic I lost my internet connection after trying to upgrade my free version antivirus Antivir Avira&nbsp;by using a trial version. My laptop was kind of slow before that incident occured. I
 tried the last known good configuration, I also tried many other tips as system restore but none worked out. I even tried to format my hard drive, but as previous times I was not able to format my hard drive. I keep getting a message as such some files on
 the&nbsp;hard drive&nbsp;are corrupted with a certain error messages, I was not even able to reinstall Windows Vista and get rid of the old version of the operating system. Will anyone help me to solve this problem completely? I am very grateful to each one of you</p>
<p>P.S I am not able to connect to the Internet with my laptop</p>

<p>Try using the Antivir Avira Removal Tool at: <a href="http://www.free-av.com/en/tools/3/avira_antivir_removal_tool.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.free-av.com/en/tools/3/avira_antivir_removal_tool.html</a>.&nbsp; The normal uninstall process may leaves peaces of it behind which cause problems with loading new versions or other AV programs (or other programs in general).</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, try uninstalling it using Revo <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html</a>.</p>
<p>I'd uninstall both versions (the original and the trial) until this is sorted out.</p>
<p>See if that helps. It might resolve the problem (assuming you are not infected but you've already received advice about that above.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with Internet Exploerer and in my opinion no good reason to switch to Firefox.&nbsp; Although this may be a browser issue, it seems to be a bit more than that from your post.&nbsp; You might want to try using IE with no add-ons to see if you
 can connect that way:</p>

<p>If you REALLY want to check out IE, then restore it to its original condition to see if that helps.&nbsp; In doing so, you will lose some information such as your history (but the process tells you what will be deleted and gives you the opportunity to continue
 or cancel.</p>
<p>Does the behavior persist if you Reset IE Advanced settings (RIES)?<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/923737</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lets look at some general troubleshoting steps to see if we can identify and resolve the problem:</p>
<p>====================================================================================================================</p>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.<span>&nbsp; </span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption
 post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning networking (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p><span>Hi Namcy,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand you are experiencing performance issue on the computer, you are unable to access internet and also unable to perform a complete format re-installation.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you get any error message when you try to access the internet?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As Amiroof suggested you may run a virus scan on the computer, performance issue may be caused by viruses that may have infected the system files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us try to fix the internet and performance issue rather than performing a complete re-installation
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Boot the computer in safe mode with networking, to do this, follow the steps below,</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Access the advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the
<strong>F8 key</strong> before <span>Windows</span> starts. On the advanced boot options menu select
</span><strong><span>safe mode with networking</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persists in safe mode with networking you can infer that the issue
</span><span>could be driver or software related.</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine as expected in safe mode with networking then try step 2</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put the computer in clean boot and test (in the normal mode)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow
<strong>Step 1 </strong>in the link below,</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><span>After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if you seldom use that software
 you can consider uninstalling it.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> - Remember to put the computer
 back to normal startup <strong>follow step 7</strong> in the link.</span></p>
<p><span>Run the fixit available in the link below to improve computer’s performance
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps mentioned in the link below to improve your computer’s performance issue
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Ways to improve your computer's performance</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-your-computers-performance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Ways-to-improve-your-computers-performance</a>

</span></p>
<p><em><span>If the issue persists and you wish to perform a complete format clean installation, let me know
</span></em></p>
<p><span>Also provide the exact error message you receive when you attempt a complete reinstallation</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important: -
</span></strong><span>All DATA, programs and drivers installed on the computer will be lost, it is recommended to take a backup before you attempt any installation.</span></p>

<h2>            xbox live gold membership</h2>
                    
<p>hi there, ive been told conflicting information and I wonder if anyone could tell me a definitive answer.</p>
<p>I am new to xbox , recently bought one for myself and my son for Christmas, we got a free one month trial which didn't work properly so I had to phone Microsoft, after a long 45 minute wait a couple of days ago I finally got through to a lovely advisor from
 Ireland who apologised for my free trial not working and saw that I was legit, he didn't know why It didn't work but told me to pay for it ( a month trial) and he would refund me, while I was on the phone he advised me about buying a year code rather than
 a monthly one next time as it was better value, he also informed me if I did that soon it would add on to my "one month" code. (Ie instead of it running out 27th jan 2015 if I bought a year it would run out 27th jan 2016). He also nicely advised me that you
 could buy codes from certain legitimate websites (ie amazon) that&nbsp;offered&nbsp;online codes that were even cheaper than buying the physical copies.</p>

<p>Now today ive purchased 2&nbsp;x 13 month xbox gold subscription codes ,&nbsp;which I was going to&nbsp;add to my account, however my friend whos&nbsp;unlike me used xbox live told me because my&nbsp;current month is technically a free trial ( because I was refunded) it wouldn't
 stack, he also told me the codes wouldn't stack together either. I have looked online for the information and found conflicting reports. Obviously I don't want to use these codes together if they wont stack (ie add an extra 26 months onto my subscription).
 But&nbsp;ive also read online that these codes will probably have expiry dates (I have received my codes and cant see anywhere&nbsp;that states if and when they expire).</p>

<p>Please could someone help a noob , don't fancy another 45 minute phone call if I can help it.</p>

<p>thanks a lot in advanced and all the best wishes for&nbsp;this festive season:)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just wait until the month runs out just to be on the safe side but as DB says you can stack the 2 you have bought but isn't your son going to be on live ?</p>
<p>As a side note even though you won't need them for a while CD Keys is a good site for xbox live :)</p>

    <title>Day One Edition Controller keeps disconnecting. Worst Customer Service - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Day One Edition Controller keeps disconnecting.  Worst Customer Service ever.</h2>
                    
<p>I just spent an hour on a call with Tech Support to no avail.&nbsp; I have a Day One edition Xbox One.&nbsp; When I received it the disc drive wouldn't work which is another documented issue with the first run of consoles.&nbsp; Ever since I got the xbox one my controller
 randomly disconnects.&nbsp;This happens with all my controllers so its not a controller issue.&nbsp; I am only 12 feet from the xbox&nbsp;so this is not the issue as it happens when I am 5 feet from it.&nbsp; My router is on the other side of the house and hardwired&nbsp;so this is
 not the issue.&nbsp; My controllers are updated so this is not the issue.&nbsp;My friend who bought a day one addition also had the same issue in addition to all the users on this thread.</p>

<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4677/t/1627064.aspx?pi7962=1</p>

<p>It never bothered me enough to go through the warranty process because it didn't matter with most the games I was playing if it went down for a couple seconds here and there.&nbsp; Now I am playing Forza 6 online and it really affects the outcome of the race
 when my controller disconnects.&nbsp; I figured it was time to call in to get it fixed.&nbsp; First of all I figured with documented issues like this that Microsoft would have a recall warranty in place similar to what they offered on the 360 with the Red Ring of Death.&nbsp;
 I found out they do not and that it was going to cost me $135 to replace my Xbox.&nbsp; This kinda sucks but I chalked it up as the price I pay for not calling sooner about the issue.&nbsp; Than I find out they wont send me a new/refurbished box and place a charge on
 my credit card if I don't return the old one.&nbsp; This means I would need to go without my xbox for some time and rewire my entire entertainment center so that we could watch TV in our family room.&nbsp; Needless to say I will not be doing that.</p>
<p>I have been gaming for over 30 years and never been as frustrated as I am with what just transpired.&nbsp; I have owned at least 10 Xbox 360's and this Xbox one.&nbsp; I have also owned many Sony products which I never once had problems with.&nbsp; You would figure that
 Microsoft would be more open to taking care of their long time customers.&nbsp; I am heading out the door to go pick up a Playstation 4.&nbsp; I am also considering replacing all 6 of my Microsoft PC's with Apples just because I feel that this is not the experience
 I expect as a long time customer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The whole situation could have been handled differently.&nbsp; They could have replaced my unit for free since it is a known issue.&nbsp; They also could have sent me a replacement which I would have paid for and had me return this one with the insurance of billing
 my credit card if the unit was not returned.&nbsp; This did not happen either.</p>
<p>You have now lost a good customer.&nbsp; If I need to spend $10,000 to send a message that you cant treat good customers like this and expect to retain their business than that is just what is going to happen.</p>

<p>well we all knew xbox one was going to have problems when it first came out and was going to have problems for a couple months after it came out. you should have known new consoles would have bugs in them sorry they haven't solved your problems. but have
 you tried seeing if others on the forums have had issues with it.</p>

            <p>Hey Raptor Captain,</p>
<p>Very sorry to hear you need to send your console in for repair. You do have two options; you can choose to follow the normal warranty process to send the console in and wait for the console to be sent back, or you can choose the advance replacement and have a console sent to you first and all you would need to do is send the console back in that box. The overall process takes an average of 14-21 days.</p>
<p>For more information, please check out our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/warranty-and-service/getting-your-product-serviced-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Service FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>We completely understand a repair is not ideal, but it will be the best route to take in this scenario.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've got the same problem with my Day One edition. My wife's Sunset edition works fine. Mine has always had the controller disconnect randomly but I always thought it had to do with the kinect. Disconnected the kinect recently and it still drops controllers.
 You got a faulty unit like me.</p>

<p>Just wanted to pile on here</p>
<p>Yup .. day One customer .. had controller disconnecting issues since day 1 (to Raptors point above .. its a console issue not the controllers)</p>
<p>moved rooms - changed routers - different tv's - sat next to the unit - plus every recommendation online</p>
<p>i paid full price for this thing .. much to my wife's displeasure </p>
<p>Im now out of warranty and just gave up calling and complaining as nothing was being done about it
</p>
<p>bought forza 6 and prayed that for some reason i wasnt going to keep having issues (silly me)</p>
<p>Its just a matter of time before this thread gets locked like the rest .. without resolution</p>

<p>I might as well add on as well.</p>
<p>Day One console with random controller disconnects. &nbsp;I bought a new controller thinking that was the issue... But the problem still exists. &nbsp;Everything will be working fine then all of the sudden the controller will start flashing. &nbsp;Normally it reconnects
 within 10 seconds but sometimes it takes longer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So can this get repaired under a warranty?</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear you're having controller disconnection issues. Please be sure that you run through all the steps on this page for Xbox One Wireless Controllers Disconnect. I'm afraid if none of the steps on that page help, the very last option is to replace or repair the controller.<br /><br />To check out the repair status be sure to check out the Warranty FAQ Mister Beep provided above. If your console is no longer under warranty then a replacement is going to be your best option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I have recently had the same issue however it developed into the controllers not connecting to the console unless I had the controller plugged into the xbox one. Frustrated with this I contacted Microsoft through the live chat. I had to keep the xbox on
 dashboard to see if the issue could be resolved. </p>
<p>After 30 minutes of having no success on chat I removed the controller from the usb cable to find that the connection had been established again. I tried the second controller which had the same issue and surprise &nbsp;it worked. I haven't noticed the controller
 disconnecting however this could be to early to say if it has fixed the issue completely.
</p>
<p>I don't know if this will work for everyone but I wanted to share this as I have lost two days of playing FIFA 16 (Attempting to become the next Jose Mourhino on career mode). I have provided feedback to the guy on chat who seemed impressed that I had resolved
 my issues to see if Microsoft could provide an update to fix these problems. Also I tried all the solutions on the xbox support page and none worked</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>
        </p>

<p>I have a day one console and mine keeps doing the same with the random disconnect. So not fair for microsoft to expect us to pay to repair a known fault from their manufacture. I got burned with the red ring of death and now this, seems they cant make a
 reliable console and expect you to pay for the priviledge. It would pain me to switch to the ps4 but i will not be paying for a known manufacturing fault to be repaired.</p>

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen. <br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and provide a link to it so we can analyze it.
<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<strong><br />
</strong><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (Major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model. <br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and
<br />
then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to<br />
show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

 correctly, but something is wrong in the registry.&nbsp; <br />

So I can't reload Windows Live Mail 2012, so what is the next step?&nbsp; What is a good replacement that with pick up all of my emails and contacts from the Window Live Mail 2012 program. &nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface 2 - Windows RT 8.1  Rebooting with KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED error</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface 2 is showing the following error.&nbsp;It then reboots and does the same again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6533efe-91c8-4c2e-8347-d7b528e3ecc0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a6533efe-91c8-4c2e-8347-d7b528e3ecc0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the following:&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Pressing <strong>Power Button </strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Volume Up&nbsp;</strong>to enter BIOS setup, but this does not work. Continues to boot to the error above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Pressing <strong>Power Button</strong> and <strong>Volume Down</strong> to boot from USB, but this does not work either. Freezes on "Surface" logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is some important photos stored on the surface, how can I recover them?&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

    <title>Unknown Internal Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sitruc9999z  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Internal Error</h2>
                    I purchased two games on the internet that require the games to be activated online before they can be played. I have a good internet connection, but everytime the games try to register I receive a message saying that I need to be connected to the internet.
 When I click the button saying I am connected, I receive a second message that says "Unknown Internal Error." If anyone could provide help in regards to this issue I would greatly appreciate it. The games are Grand Theft Auto Vice City and San Andreas and
 they were purchased online from gamestop.

            Likely it's some problem on GameStop's end if your setup is correct like you say.&nbsp; Your best bet would be to contact GameStop directly and inquire with their support about the problem so they can help you.

            I have 4 games on the list when filtered to show only original xbox titles (TR: Legend, Burnout Revenge, Jedi Starfighter, and Splinter Cell: DA). All 4 games give this same error message, so i know its not a problem with the disc (visual check also shows
 zero scratches on discs). I have tried holding power to shut down, it does nothing.&nbsp; Maybe MS should work out all the kinks before touting a function that doesnt work.&nbsp; Or provide working troubleshooting for the issue instrad of just saying to reboot your
 xbox.

            I made a mistake looking at the list. 3 of those games, the ones i actually want to play, are xbox 360. The only one thats actually compatible is jedi starfighter. The others only compatible if they're the 360 version. Epic Fail, MS...im gonna have to
 stop bragging about how good you are.

<h2>            Windows 7 Fax Cover Page Editor Issue</h2>
                    I've been trying to edit a cover sheet using the Windows 7 Fax program. &nbsp;I am trying to make a cover sheet for our employees to use for customers that is personalized to show the name of the customer. &nbsp;I add in the [Recipient's&nbsp;Name] field in the editor.
 &nbsp;You would think when you go to send the fax it would populate that field with just the recipient's name, however it doesn't. &nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I dial out to fax, I use the dial pad icon in the upper toolbar. &nbsp;When you do this, it shows the name of how you are faxing, along with the associated number in the same field. &nbsp;EX: John Doe &lt;+1 (111) 111-1111&gt; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ........ &nbsp;This causes issues.
 &nbsp;Now when I go to preview the cover sheet, the name field is populated with all of this. &nbsp;Is there any fix for this or work around?&nbsp;</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 charger replacement</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my Surface is less than a year old and the charger has been giving problems for the last month or so, need to wriggle the cable at the brick end to get it to charge. &nbsp;Two days ago it has failed completely so I'm unable to charge my Surface. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to contact Microsoft to get this replaced seems impossible, I'm in the UK and am using&nbsp;www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support to either talk to an agent or request a call back, but none of the either start chat or call back buttons do anything when
 I press them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried different browsers, IE, Firefox, Chrome, all the same... also sometimes when I log in it randomly says Live Help is closed even though I've been trying from 9am this morning. &nbsp;Anyone else having issues?</p>

<p>Só um aviso, se for o caso como o acima citado, você não perde a conta, só a live. Caso tenha perdido também a conta pode ser uma caso de suspensão ou banimento, mas em qualquer dos casos eles enviam email da conta em questão.</p>
<p>E infelizmente o suporte tem que esperar até amanhã mesmo.</p>

<p><span><span>HI veronica Munitz,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the exact error message you are getting?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>First make sure you have installed updated drivers for your hardware.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer this link:<br />
</span></span><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into safe mode and check if you get the bluescreen error.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Steps to boot to Safe mode</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;Restart your computer if it is powered on.<br />
</span></span><span><span>2.&nbsp;Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.<br />
</span></span><span><span>3.&nbsp;Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.<br />
</span></span><span><span>4.&nbsp;Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.<br />
</span></span><span><span>5.&nbsp;Select Safe Mode and press Enter.<br />
</span></span><span><span>6.&nbsp;You should see drivers loading, and then Please wait.<br />
</span></span><span><span>7.&nbsp;You should then be at the Welcome Screen.<br />
</span></span><span><span>8.&nbsp;Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Start your computer in safe mode:</strong><br />
</span></span><strong><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></span></a><span>
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If you do not get bluescreen, then a third party program might be causing this problem.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may perform a clean boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows 7:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig</strong> in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;type the password, or click Continue.)<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart<br />
7. Log back into your Account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the problem does not return while your computer is in clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing
 interference. You can try to determine<br />
which background program is causing the problem while the computer is in clean boot mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To find the process or program at cause follow the steps starting at
<strong>enable half of the Services items</strong>, from the following article:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Refer this link for more information:</span></strong></span></p>

</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>To restore your
<strong>Normal </strong>startup:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1 .Click Start, type
<strong>msconfig </strong>in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. (If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,<br />
&nbsp;type the password, or click Continue.)<br />
2. On the General tab, click Normal Startup.<br />
3. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></span></p>

    <title>Purchase error- unable to purchase apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasmine leila  say:</h3>
<h2>            Purchase error- unable to purchase apps</h2>
                    <div>I received a windows store credit voucher of which I redeemed and now my account says it is credited by £25. However, every time I try and purchase an app it keeps saying:
<strong>Purchase error, make sure the payment info for your windows store account is correct</strong>.
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Obviously I haven't added a credit card to my account because I don't need or want to seen as there is already money on there to spend. I can download any other app as long as it is free but just always have this trouble for paid apps which sucks 😔</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any advice would be greatly appreciated!</div>

Hi Jasmine,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
<span>Which app are you trying to purchase from Windows store?<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to reset Windows store and see if that helps.<br />
<b><br />
Reset store cache.<br />
</b><br />
a. Press the Windows key + R<br />
b. Type: WSReset.exe and click ok.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then As the issue is related to billing, I would suggest you to contact Windows store support.<br />
</span><br />
