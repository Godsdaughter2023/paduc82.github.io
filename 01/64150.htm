<h2>            Nvidia not compatible</h2>
                    <p>Nvidia Ge Force 6200 was installed and works fine in my window 7computer, then I tried to upgrade to window 10 and I got a message as such : Nvidia Ge 6200 display is not compatible.</p>
<p>I have replaced my Nvidia video card and uninstalled the software but window 10 still kept the same message.</p>

            <p>As mentioned in my statement, &nbsp;I got a message saying:" Nvidia Ge 6200 is not compatible with windows 10"</p>
<p>So I removed the Nvidia card and replaced it with the original Standard VGA Graphic card, but I still got the same message about the Nvidia card although it is no longer in the computer system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not able to download windows 10 at all. Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            <p>where is the message? &nbsp;In the Get Windows 10 app or when you tried to upgrade? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GeForce GT 620 is supported in the latest 7/29, 353.52 driver. &nbsp;You can install it from here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.geforce.com/drivers/results/87789</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a different page than the 352.xx page that also shows up on a search for Windows 10 nvidia drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that will throw you a curve is that the GeForce installer will report failure when you install when it should say "requires a restart to complete the installation." &nbsp;Ignore the failure message and restart and it will work fine. &nbsp;Windows update
 will later list the driver as ready to install. &nbsp;It appears to but that too is a glitch since it is already installed. &nbsp;It all actually works but the messages are partly wrong.</p>

            <p>Why don't you try this. Go to microsoft.com then to store then to windows then to all windows then to upgrade now. On that page scroll down to "<span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">If
 you'd like to create a USB drive or DVD to download once and upgrade multiple PCs - Click Here."&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>There you can download the Windows 10 Download tool and run it. Good luck. I think you will enjoy Windows 10 once you are up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. Let it upgrade and install drivers for the first hour before everything works good.</p>

            The GT 620 is a good card and Windows 10 likes it fine. &nbsp;I chose the GT 640 for one computer and a GT 730 for another. &nbsp;All three are very good and affordable choices. &nbsp;It is all in the driver. &nbsp;The 7/29 driver is the one that you want. &nbsp;As I said take
 installation failure messages with a grain of salt. &nbsp;nVidia driver updates don't usually require a restart but I had to do that on both my computers that use nVidia. &nbsp;And then things were great.

            You must <em>upgrade </em>to Windows 10, not clean install, or it will not activate. &nbsp;If you saw a screen requesting a product key then you were not upgrading. &nbsp;To upgrade, insert the media with the computer running. &nbsp;Do NOT restart the computer with the
 media already inserted.

<h2>            Halo&#58; Combat Evolved xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Ostin xbox liven kautta<em> Halo Combat Evolved pelin</em> mutta se ei toimi. Virehesanomassa ilmoitetaan että peli vaatii xbox 360 alkuperäisen (?) kovalevyn.<br />
Ilmoitus sinällään ei kerro vian syytä koska<strong> minulla on xbox 360</strong> mutta kovalevyversio on uudempi jossa on 4GT muistia.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Olen saanut sellaisen käsityksen että ongelma on nimenomaan kovalevyssä kun siihen asentaan vanhan pelin : jokin emulointiohjelma ei osaa lukea vanhan pelin tiedostoja ??<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 255, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 153, 0, 1)">MIelestäni pelin ohjeet ovat puutteelliset ja ongelma selviää
<span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">vasta sitten kun pelin on ostanut</span></span><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">.</span></strong></span>Mikä avuksi ?? Voiko ostosta reklamoida tällä perusteella ??<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Saattaa olla että jos vanha peli olisi löytynyt dcd/cd versiona xbox konsolille peli toimisi ?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Ostin konsolin juuri siksi että voisi vielä pelata vanhaa haloa halvalla... Muut pelit/demot näyttää toimivan...<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Toinen ihmettelyn aihe liittyy tilin kuvakkeeseen joka on tietokoneella erilainen kuin konsolissa , miksi ? En löytänyt tilinhallinnasta sellaista kohtaa mistä kuvakkeen voisi muuttaa.VOiko kuvakkeen muuttaa , miten ? Konosolin kuvakkeen vaihdosta en vielä
 tiedä oikein mitään...en ole vielä "kerenyt " katsoa" ...<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;Internet yhteys näyttää pätkivän ihmeen usein jos aseteuksissa ei sitten ole jossain jotain aikakatkaisua tms. ??<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            how do i fix winlogin.exe error if i cant do a windows repair</h2>
                    Hi Guys<br />
<br />
I am getting a winlogin.exe error before windows boots up. When I put the windows cd in and try to do a repair it skips that step.<br />
So how do I fix this winlogin.exe problem. I can boot up the harddrive on another computer and pick it up as a seperate drive and try repair it like that.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions<br />
<br />
* I have copied and pasted the winlogin.exe from the <u>dllcache</u> into the normal
<u>system32</u> folder and then tried to boot up the harddrive but still had the same error popping up.<br />
<br />
Regards<br />
Corey<br />

            There are lots of winlogon.exe errors - some that will not allow your system to boot or login, some that will complain and allow your system to boot and login, but some things will be afflicted.<br />
<br />
You tried to do a repair and it skips that step?&nbsp; What step is that?&nbsp; If you do not have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (most people don't), you will not be doing a Repair Install anyway.<br />
<br />
Tell us how you copied and pasted the winlogon.exe from the dllcache to system32 - did you move the HDD to another system to do that or did you copy the file some other way?&nbsp; It's a good thought, but isn't there more to your winlogon.exe error to tell us?<br />
<br />
Remembering that we can't see what you are seeing and don't know how or what you have done up to this point or anything about your system, tell us exactly what your winlogon.exe error says and something about your system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
Thank you MS Answers owners, for continuing to make the resolution of simple problems as frustrating and time consuming as possible.<br />
<br />
Please provide additional information about your system as best you can:<br />
<br />
What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
What is your XP Version and Service Pack?<br />
<br />
Does your system have IDE drives or SATA drives?<br />
<br />
Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation:&nbsp; Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE), McAfee, Symantec, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!,&nbsp; Panda, Trend Micro, CA, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.<br />
<br />
Was the issue preceded by a power interruption, aborted restart, or improper shutdown?&nbsp; (this includes plug pulling, power buttons, removing the battery, etc.)<br />
<br />
Does the afflicted system have a working CD/DVD drive (internal or external)?<br />
<br />
Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your installed Service Pack (this is not the same as any Recovery CDs that came with your system)?<br />
<br />
What do you see (exactly) that you don't think you should be seeing and when do you see it?<br />
<br />
If the system used to work properly, what do you think might have changed since the last time it did work properly?<br />
<br />

            Normally when you put the Windows CD in then it give you the option to do a new installation or repair the installation for some reason that is not there.<br />
<br />
-Homebuilt system 160GB harddrive with an Intel Core2duo processor<br />
-XP professional SP3 32 bit<br />
-The system is using SATA drives<br />
-I was using norton anti-virus on the system<br />
-There was a power failure just before the problem started.<br />
-The system has no cd-rom but I have mounted the hard-drive to another pc to try repair it.<br />
-Yes I have a genuine Xp professional CD<br />
-I get a winlogon.exe error just before the windows page comes up with the loading status bar "the application or DLL C:\windows\system32\shell32.dll is not a valid windows image" there after you click ok for the couple of other errors and it reboots.<br />
-it might be a virus or data corruption from the power failure<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />

winlogon.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application or DLL C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
Clicking OK you see:<br />
<br />
lsass.exe - Bad Image<br />
The application or DLL C:\WINDOWS\system32\shell32.dll is not a valid Windows image.&nbsp; Please check this against your installation diskette.<br />
<br />
Clicking OK you see:<br />
<br />
User Interface Failure<br />
The Logon User Interface DLL msgina.dll failed to load.<br />
Contact your system administrator to replace the DLL, or restore the original DLL.<br />
<br />
There is a button to click to Restart, which when you click it, takes a while to restart the system.<br />
<br />
You won't get far with messages like that.<br />
<br />
Since you have a power failure, the first thing to do is to run a chkdsk with error correction on the afflicted drive since such things can cause corruption of the NT File System (NTFS).&nbsp; Repeat the chkdsk with error correction until it reports no more errors,
 see how things look and <i>then </i>start replacing suspicious files.<br />
<br />
Since your system has no CD/DVD drive, I suggest putting the HDD back into the original system, creating a bootable Hiren's USB thumb drive from which you can run the chkdsk with error correction as many times as necessary and see how things look.&nbsp; You will
 like Hiren's when you get the hang of it.<br />
<br />
If you need to replace any file(s), you should start with the shell32.clll of which there is also a copy in the dllcache folder (like you did with winlogon.exe), then see how things look.&nbsp; The file could really be corrupted or the problem could be that XP just
 can't find/read it due to NTFS corruption.<br />
<br />
FYE:&nbsp; It the shell32.dll file was <i>missing</i>, you would be seeing a message like this:<br />
<br />
winlogon.exe - Unable To Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because SHELL32.dll was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
You can do all this (and more) from Hiren's and it might be easier than moving the HDD back and forth between platforms to see if what you did worked or if there is more to do.<br />
<br />
In the event that the HDD is just so afflicted you can't figure it out, you can use Hiren's to copy off your personal files/folders to an external drive but I guess you could do that by slaving it in another system too.<br />
<br />
Here's how to get started:<br />
<br />
<br />
I am going to recommend you use Hiren's boot CD (it will also go on a USB flash/thumb stick/drive).<br />
<br />
This is good for you because it has many more tools on it that on the XP Recovery Console CD, does not care about your Administrator passwords and you will not have to futz around in your BIOS if any afflicted system has SATA drives - Hiren's can deal with
 that.<br />
<br />
You will have a whole bunch of cool tools that you don't have in the XP Recovery Console...&nbsp; a registry editor, password resetter, and a desktop that looks like Windows XP so you will feel comfortable maneuvering.<br />
<br />
You can also easily copy your personal data (documents, images, music.) to an external drive.<br />
<br />
From a working system, first download the latest version on Hiren's Boot CD from here (it is a substantial download but worth it):<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (look near the bottom of the page).<br />
<br />
Unzip the Hiren's to some folder where you can find it.&nbsp; There is a Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso in there that you are going to need next.<br />
<br />
Hiren's has instructions to make a bootable USB that you can use, but it requires you to first burn the .iso to a CD and some other steps, so I suggest another way and here's how:<br />
<br />
Download RUFUS 1.3.2 or whatever the latest version is from here (read some stuff on the page so you can know more about it):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://rufus.akeo.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://rufus.akeo.ie/</a><br />
<br />
I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is!&nbsp; This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />
<br />
Launch RUFUS and all the defaults should be okay, for the Device, choose your USB drive letter, Quick format, FAT32, label it if you want to and in the Format options box, click the little icon that looks like a CD and a window will open.&nbsp; Navigate that dialogue
 to point to the folder that contains the Hiren's.BootCD.15.x.iso that you unzipped earlier and the box should change to say ISO image (RUFUS understands the Hiren's ISO file).<br />
<br />
Double check you have the right Device selected in the top (NOT you HDD) Click Start, acknowledge the warning and let it finish (it will take a little while) as it copies the files.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Hiren's ISO is also good size.<br />
<br />
When RUFUS is done, it will say 'DONE' in the bottom.<br />
<br />
Put the USB stick in the afflicted machine and reset/reboot and press whatever key you need to press to get to a boot menu where you can select the USB as the first boot device (that is F11 for me).&nbsp; If you don't see a boot menu choice, you will have to adjust
 your BIOS to boot from the USB first instead of the HDD.<br />
<br />
When the Hiren's menu comes up, choose the Mini XP Mode and it will start loading (slowly from a USB drive) and eventually you should see a Windowsy looking desktop.&nbsp; You should recognize that part and feel comfortable, but it is not your desktop - it is the
 Hiren's desktop!<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It may take a long time for chkdsk to complete or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear
 to go backwards sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>

            P.S.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a USB thumb drive, you could run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; and replace the file with the drive slaved in another system, but you will just have to keep moving it back and forth to see if things work or not.<br />
<br />
Maybe you you will get lucky with just the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; and that might be all you need to do.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Office Not Installed in New User Account</h2>
                    I recently installed Microsoft Office 2013 last month on my Windows 7 PC.&nbsp; I created a new User Account a few days ago, but for some reason, Microsoft Office is not installed on this account.&nbsp; It still works fine on the other 2 user accounts on my PC,
 but it is just a nuisance to have to switch between user accounts to use Office.&nbsp; Is there anyway to fix this?&nbsp; I have tried to repair it on my account, but nothing seems to have happened.<br />

 so I have to restart my PC using the on/off button. These freezes are&nbsp;completely random, sometimes it will happen 5 minutes into logging in, others it may go a couple of days without happening. But usually I'm getting one or two per day, sometimes even three.
 I thought I had fixed the problem last night, but alas, it froze on me 30 minutes ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />

 didn't work, so I removed one stick and ran on one, it froze so I swapped, and it froze again (I've been trying to fix it for a month or so now). I've installed a hotfix that apparently fixes the problem (The said 64 bit Windows 7 does this sometimes), but
 nothing, I've updated Direct X, uninstalled just about any program that people have said causes freezing sometimes, but still nothing. It should be noted that this PC is relatively new. I had made one a few years back but gutted it a few months ago and replaced
 almost all the parts. I installed a new CPU, Motherboard, RAM, DVD Drive, and Graphics Card.&nbsp;</span><br />

<h2>            Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller For Windows &#40;Wired&#41; Hardware Issues</h2>
                    Hello, I bought the controller last year from Thailand, and I currently live in Bangladesh. It's been more than great at all times and served me well till today, it started acting weird, suddenly.&nbsp;<br />
It's not a driver problem for it, but it has to do with the controller it self. See, when the wire is moved even slightly, the controller disconnects. This is probably something wrong with the wire, correct? But, what do I do now? I can't play anything or use
 the controller. It works but the part of the wire where it connects to the controller seems very fragile and disconnects at the slightest budge. Please, any help is appreciated! :(

                    <p>I am attempting to upgrade FSX to SP2. I have downloaded SP2, but when I attempt to install, receive a message stating that Installation cannot be performed as SP1 is not installed.</p>
<p>I've searched on various websies for SP1 including&nbsp;Microsoft Update Downloads, but unable to find SP1.</p>

 takes me to Microsoft.com web page and displays "Page Cannot Be Found"</p>

            Hi David
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn't fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It's possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don't have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack's Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don't see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<br />I recommend creating a specific power plan for this rather than editing a current plan.

<p><span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">So I know previous gamer pics are rendered moot since they arent the 1080p format for the X1. &nbsp;And while the ones we get to pick from are cool/cute.. (i have the dead cupcake).. it would be nice to have game specific ones again.
 &nbsp;I assume the collection will be built up with them once more games release, but it was just some food for thought since there doesnt seem to be any for DR3, Forza, Ryse, etc. &nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(128, 0, 128, 1)">The one I currently use (that you can see on the forums) &nbsp;is the cult of rapture logo for Bioshock. &nbsp;I really do miss it to be honest on the X1. &nbsp;I'm a customization junkie and just was curious if this 'bothered' anyone else?&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi AW-7,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something similar just happened to me.&nbsp; The first time they serviced it, they replaced the adapter and that resolved the problem.&nbsp; 5 months later it started happening again and this time they replaced the battery, the motherboard, and the platen (thank heaven's
 it is still under warranty).&nbsp; Luckily, with the new adapters, the battery began charging and the experience did not seem to damage it in any way (but you should keep your eye on it anyway just in case).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way they were able to tell on my laptop - a Dell E1705&nbsp;(besides just experience and common sense) was to go into the BIOS (at boot there should be a brief flash on the screen telling you how to enter BIOS setup or the BIOS menu (usually F2) and check
 on the information concerning the battery.&nbsp; It showed that the AC adapter was "unidentified" instead of showing "90W" which it should when working properly and that the battery was not full and not charging although plugged in.&nbsp; They changed the motherboard
 and platen the second time because it too could cause the adapter not to be recognized by the battery (or the battery not the recognize the AC adapter).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The beeping is being caused by power settings and sound settings which are set to notify you of a low and/or critical battery condition.&nbsp; In a normal situation, the computer will run just off the AC adapter and does not need the battery (that's one way to
 help maintain battery life is to let it periodically run down and recharge if you ordinarily leave it plugged in most of the time).&nbsp; If you remove the batttery entirely, will the laptop power up?&nbsp; If not, it is most definitely at least the AC adapter and/or
 the motherboard.&nbsp; Eventually the battery will get so low it will either go into sleep or hibernation or the system will shutdown (you should turn it off normally before allowing it to cold stop like that).&nbsp; If so, then I would expect the beeping to go away
 as it will no longer detect a low battery charge as there is no battery - but then you'll want to be sure to use either a battery backup UPS or at least a surge protector if not already in place because if you lose battery the laptop will crash hard and that's
 not good for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using 32-bit Vista Business SP2 and in Control Panel / Sounds / Sounds there is an option for Low Battery Alert. The default it to have this on. In this situation you may want to turn it off to avoid the beeping (though I'm at a loss as to why it "messes
 up your computer" when it does so as all it should do is beep). Also, you may want to go into Control Panel / Power Options, click on plan settings, and click on Battery.&nbsp; It will provide you with levels for low battery and critical battery and provide you
 with actions to take when that occurs.&nbsp; If you cannot run the system without a battery and it is so low that the alerts have started you're probably down to 11-5% remaining.&nbsp; You may want to adjust the actions to nothing for low and shutdown for critical as
 5% is about as close as you want to get to the point where you may crash.&nbsp; Then you just need to wait until it is repaired and/or the appropriate parts are replaced.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While you still have some life in it, it's best to contact the manufacturer (they's certain have the correct parts) or a reputable computer repair shop to get a proper diagnosis (perhaps over the phone at first), a determination of what needs to be fixed,
 the applicable costs and timing, if it's still under any type of warranty, and what needs to be done in what order.&nbsp; They may find the AC adapter is OK and it's just the battery (or vice-versa or both or more).&nbsp; But that's essentially where you need to start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

    <title>Credential Error. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wacko is bad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Credential Error.</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, so as of now i am on a second account. Because my account all of a sudden has this credential error on it.</p>
<p>First, my account was called in stolen by a friend, which i cleared up with him, so it was locked from redeeming any codes on it.</p>
<p>Then, i called Xbox Customer Support, asked to have it unlocked and gave them all my info, and they said they would contact me via email or phone.</p>
<p>So i gave them both, and have yet to get a response. Now, i go to sign in and i get this credential error and it tells me to go to account.live.com.</p>
<p>I went to that site and signed in and it says this.. </p>
<p>"Sign-in with&nbsp;<b>*MY EMAIL*</b>&nbsp;is blocked for one of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone entered the wrong password too many times. </li><li>If you signed up for this ID through an organization, you might not be able to use the account yet."
</li></ul>
<p>I reset the password via email reset AND text message code on my phone.</p>
<p>BUT when i do that, it still wont let me sign in and it gives me that same message. (Quoted above)</p>
<p>I just want my account back and to be able to play online again.</p>
<p>If i dont get my account back within a few days, i am canceling all my subscriptions to xbox live and calling it quits.</p>
<p>This has happened twice now, and instead of giving me my last account back, they permanently banned it.</p>
<p>The account i want back is: Play For Fleece. </p>

<p>Hi Silvian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Cortana doesn't respond when you speak into your PC, it might relate to hardware failure, or that a process is conflicting with Cortana. For us to isolate the issue in using your microphone to talk to Cortana, kindly respond to the questions below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is the microphone you are using is a built-in microphone or is it an external one?</li><li>Have you tried using other microphones to your computer?</li><li>Aside from setting up your microphone, what other troubleshooting steps have you done? This is for us to know and to avoid any duplication of efforts on your end.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Update caused desktop to be unavailable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryonyburniston  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Update caused desktop to be unavailable</h2>
                    <p>Windows update pop-up asked me to restart my laptop the other evening which I delayed as it wasn't convenient at that time. About 2 hours later I decided to restart the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On restarting I got the usual login screen but then the desktop took a long time to come up. When it did, I got an error message saying "Location is not available, C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile\Desktop is not accessible, access is denied. On clicking
 ok, the desktop was black with no icons except the recycle bin. I could not click on the start menu or anything, no internet or sound working. When I tried to open the recycle bin I got the error message Explorer.EXE, An attempt was made to reference a token
 that does not exist. Task Manager was available but could not run any programs from within it, got same token error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried restarting the computer, shutting down completely and restarting - no change</p>
<p>
</p><p>I shift+restarted - tried various options and troubleshooting, no help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarted in safe mode, desktop was the same but I could open cmd&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled the issue and tried several suggested solutions including running system file checker, dism clean up image check - all reported as being no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the desktop directory within&nbsp;C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile was empty while the one within user was not. So I copied the user directory to the systemprofile directory. While this resulted in my normal desktop shortcuts etc being visible
 in safe mode (not in normal mode), some programs were working but any folder threw up the token error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions as to how to fix my laptop?</p>

<p>Just an update: I came across another post concerning this issue and there was a suggestion to boot up the pc and when you get to the sign in screen, press shift on the keyboard while you click restart on the screen (under power icon). Keep holding shift
 until you see the recovery screen. Then try to roll back (did not work for me) or resetting the pc. I am happy to say that resetting worked. Hope this helps someone else!!</p>

<p>I've run into a couple of machines that have had this problem. I've had these steps fix the problem, not sure its the only solution. Maybe it will direct someone to a quicker fix.</p>
<p>For these steps you will have Windows 10 installation media created on another machine. Don't use an old one, create a new one so that it has the latest build, link here&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</a></p>
<p>Login an account that is an admistrator account. ignore the error messages you get when you login.</p>
<p>2. CTRL + ALT + DELETE</p>
<p>3. Choose Task manager.</p>
<p>4. Choose File -&gt; RUN. type cmd.exe, check the run as administrator box</p>
<p>5. type "net user administrator /active:yes"&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;CTRL + ALT + DELETE</p>
<p>7. Sign out.</p>
<p>8. In lower right hand corner, choose the now unlocked Administrator account and sign in. Its been asking to reset the password. either choose a password or leave the fields blank and hit enter. We will disable this account later when fixed.</p>
<p>9. Once the account logs in, insert the Windows 10 media, either flash drive or dvd is fine, but it runs much faster off of a good usb drive.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp;CTRL + ALT + DELETE, choose task manager again</p>
<p>11. FILE -&gt; Run. choose browse. Find the installation media and choose the setup.exe file on it. Click ok, make sure the run as</p>
<p>administrator box is checked.</p>
<p>12. This will launch the windows 10 setup. You should be able to click next through all the prompts to start setup. If you created the latest installation version it should say that it will keep all your files and settings. If its doesn't say this, I recommend
 recreating your media with latest media creation tool from MS. I've only tested these steps with the latest installer.</p>
<p>After the installer finished, login to the Administrator account. The error messages should now be gone. Log off the Admin account and login to your main account.</p>
<p>click the Start button, type cmd.exe, it should show up in search box, right click and choose Run as Administrator. In command windows type&nbsp; "net user administrator /active:no". type "exit"&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Admin account is now disabled and your system should be back up and running.</p>

 not running either edition and download the free Windows XP Mode program which will allow you run older programs:</p>
<p>Running Windows XP Mode requires:</p>
<p>1) Windows 7 - Professional, Ultimate or Enterprise (Not supported in Home Premium).</p>

            <p>Hi Mikaila,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Antiphishing directory is created when the anti-phishing filter for Internet Explorer is enabled. If you disable this filter, which is entirely up to you, it will likely disappear. Either way, this is not anything that will cause harm, and is in fact
 intended, so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick</p>

    <title>Windows desktop location not found - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackawao  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows desktop location not found</h2>
                    A couple of weeks ago I received my new custom made PC, running windows 7 pro. I set it up and installed the ATI drivers using the disk provided with the system, it had a lot of updates to do so I restarted it. The computer completed the updates and when
 I logged in to my account it 'prepared my desktop' again and when it logged in I revived an empty desktop with the windows classic theme. A pop up saying C:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop refers to a location that is unavailable ect. I also
 receive a ballon saying 'failed to connect to a windows service'
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After a restart the computer boots like it should, however this happens once every five times I boot. I shouldn't be having this problem with a new PC.&nbsp;</div>
<div>It would be great if someone could tell me the cause of the problem and the easiest solution to fix this.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Many thanks</div>

            The folder&nbsp;C:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile is the profile folder used by the Windows System account, e.g. when you create a scheduled task to be run under the System account. If its name pops up during the normal logon process then some misbehaving
 third-party software has modified the registry entry that determines the correct profile location (which is usually C:\Users\Jackawo.

<h2>            Windows couldn&#39;t complete the requested Changes&#58; Error Code 0x80004005</h2>
                    I have a .net framework 3.5 problem.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a program that requires .net Framework 3.5</div>
<div>When the program asks if I want to install .net framework. I click yes.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After waiting for a couple of seconds, windows says the .net framework 3.5 (including 2.0 and 3.0) is successful installed, only, after I try to run the program again. Windows prompts again to install .net framework 3.5 (including 2.0 and 3.0). And the
 program I try to run simply closes.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I uninstalled all the previous .net framework versions, and disabled .net framework 4.0 in windows features. However, if I try to disable .net framework 3.5 (including 2.0 and 3.0 (and subfolders)). I get an error message saying: Windows couldn' t complete
 the requested changes: Unspecified error, errorcode 0x80004005</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I try to install it on demand. (By downloading the .net framework 3.5 from the microsoft website), it says that I need to have installed .net framework 3.5 (including 2.0 and 3.0). So Basiclly I need to have .net framework 3.5 installed, in order
 to install .net framework 3.5 .....</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have looked all over the internet, and couldn't find any solution. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I preffer for an solution without reinstalling my OS. I run windows 8 Pro.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to verify the .net framework versions. The only version windows can find is .net framework version 1.1 and version 4.0. Version 3.5 isn't installed according to windows. But windows says when running a program it is installed succesfully. And .net
 framework 3.5 is in the list of windows features.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
