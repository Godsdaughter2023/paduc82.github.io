<h2>            NVIDIA GeForce GT330M Your display won&#39;t work.</h2>
                    I am registered to upgrade from Win7 to Win10 and have used the "Check your PC" facility in&nbsp;the "Get Windows 10" app. The above error message is displayed. What do I do? Should I try to download&nbsp;a updated driver on my own, or will Win10 sort it out when
 released next week? I do not want to risk everything getting fouled in the installation process. My desktop PC is a Sony VAIO VPCL13M1E.&nbsp;

<p>My version is Microsoft Windows 7 Home Premium 6.1.7601 Service Pack 1 Build 7601.</p>
<p>The Sony website says that Sony&nbsp;are testing the Windows 8 upgrade to Windows 10, but&nbsp;are not planning to do this for the Windows 7 version of VPCL 13M1A. They warn that I should not allow the Windows 10 upgrade to be installed. The NVIDIA web site is not
 much help either. &nbsp;Shall I abandon the upgrade, or shall I wait to see if Sony or NVIDIA issue a new driver?</p>
<p>Another worry I have&nbsp;is that&nbsp;I&nbsp;use WMC to display TV&nbsp;that is input from a USB TV receiver dongle. I understand that WMC is not available in Windows 10. Is their any other way to display TV? I wonder if the two problems are interconnected.</p>

    <title>Toshiba Laptop Windows 8 Failure to Configure Updates ... Reverting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom nc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Toshiba Laptop Windows 8 Failure to Configure Updates ... Reverting Endless Loop</h2>
                    <p>I bought a new laptop (Toshiba Satellite C55-A5281) with Window 8.&nbsp; After going through the normal new computer set up, I saw that there were 108 updates ready for Windows 8.&nbsp; Yes, that is one hundred and eight!&nbsp; OK, might as well get them done before loading
 anything on to the new computer, right?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hours and hours later ... I was still in an endless loop.&nbsp; I have already been through the whole F8 key thing after forcing it to shut down and restart up&nbsp; ... then did the refresh deal to try and fix it.&nbsp; Then I started the whole update process over and
 got the same thing .... Hours later, again.&nbsp; I actually let it run over night.&nbsp; Same ugly loop again.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe trying to do 102 updates all at once is not a good idea.&nbsp; But I have no idea which ones to try to do first.&nbsp; Or exactly how to do just a few at a time.&nbsp; And if I have to do them one at a time and each one takes hours, I may not live that long ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I knew going in that Windows 8 would be a challenge ... but unfortunately it is looking way more challenging than what I expected.&nbsp;
</p>
<br />

            <p>I did the full restore .... and then did a complete reformat to reset it all back to factory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I did just a few updates at a time ... instead of all 102 at once. &nbsp;It took forever, but seemed to work. &nbsp;Then I got a notice to update to Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I did that as well (took hours) and all seems to be working now. &nbsp;I probably have 20 hours of downloading
 (and waiting) and downloading (and waiting) time with all of it. &nbsp;I hope it is all over and I can get on with normal computing life. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            AE4 VOID &#47; FREE HAVOC DLC DOWNLOAD GLITCH</h2>
                    
<p>Hello fellow gamers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this article I am going to give you a brief summary of events that have happened since yesterday until today for me. Last night around 2:30am EST I had finished a game of TDM and was awarded a supply drop, within said
 supply drop to my surprise was a link to get the AE4, I had originally thought I received the actual gun and was stoked. Then to my surprise when I clicked on it it took me to the Xbox live marketplace purchase screen for the Havoc DLC pack, that's not even
 the best part.... in the total section it read "FREE". I know right!? Absolutely crazy so at this point I was beyond stoked and clicked purchase and started the download. After about 30 min or so it finished, so I figured now I get to check out these dope
 new guns and really get into the game....not so much. Everything Havoc DLC related in the game was still un accessible and said I needed to purchase the Havoc DLC pack or a Season Pass. Even though I had already downloaded the DLC?</p>
<p>So after this I went into my Settings then Storage and the game to see if the file was even in there and it was in fact in there. So after troubleshooting a bit and restarting the system and clearing the cache and what not I figured I would just call Microsoft
 to resolve the issue. I called their support team and began speaking about this apparent glitch with Call Of Duty to one of their agents and even he was shocked at the premise of this glitch and started to walk me through every possible way to rectify the
 problem. He pulled up my account information through Xbox live and confirmed to me that I did in fact have the user license for the havoc DLC in my account on their end and was confused himself as to why it wouldn't be letting me use it after we went through
 every possible step to fix the issue. So after almost an hour of talking and troubleshooting his hands were unfortunately tied on the Microsoft end of things and so he referred me to speak with Activision directly. So I immediately started a support chat with
 one of their agents and the real fun began. He completely avoided any direct communication about the issue I had brought to him and denied the possibility that the DLC could be free and kept prompting me to purchase the season pass and or the DLC. I have screen
 shots of the entire process of downloading the DLC and how I found it in game as when I seen it was free my first thought was "no way, this has to be a glitch" so I took a screen shot of the purchase screen with the total reading FREE with my hand in the picture
 holding a piece of paper with the time, date, and my gamer tag on it. According to the agent this wasn't good enough and he needed a screen shot of my account transaction history.. Well following their glitch with this download once I downloaded unfortunately
 it didn't show up in transaction history as it was a free download. He basically in many not so blunt words told me good luck there was no solution to this issue. This extremely rude and un supportive customer service was continued for 4 and a half hours.
 I sent every kind of proof one in that situation could possibly send all the picture proof needed to set a firm case including time stamps, pictures of the game screen itself with my gamertag and everything. One part in particular that was simply outrageous
 in the chat was when after blind siding me he said " Is there anything else I can assist you with further?" So I simply replied, "Yes I would like to speak with your supervisor" He then replied " I understand, but unfortunately ive given you all the necessary
 information needed at this time"</p>
<p>After all of this I finally gave him enough proof that I downloaded this pack and all I wanted was for them to help me make it work , and in the end he ended the conversation with Sorry but there is no issue on our end pretty much in a few other words and
 it is a problem with Microsofts servers apparently even after I spoke to them twice while in chat with this guy to again confirm that I do own the user license for the DLC. Just passing this information on to the next dissatisfied gamer to give you a fair
 warning, any doubters of these claims I have pictures of the entire conversation between myself and the agent at hand and will gladly e-mail you the proof,&nbsp;Activision has absolutely terrible customer service and little knowledge on how to fix problems correctly
 with their customers. I truly hope this helps you out in the future of your communications with them and their agents.</p>

            Going back that far with System Restore isn't a good idea. System Restore is best used to fix immediate problems. I wouldn't go back further than maybe a week, week-1/2. What printers are installed and how - locally or network printers? The First Question
 Of Troubleshooting: If the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?

                    <p>I just got a new MacBook Air, and was having the same problem on my old MacBookPro. &nbsp;Skype doesn't ring on it but it will ring on our iPhones and my husband's iPad all at the same time. &nbsp;Can too many devices with the same account prevent one of them from
 ringing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, when we try to make a call from the Air to another laptop, it thinks the other party isn't available, when they are online, on Skype and actively waiting for our call. &nbsp;So we can't seem to use Skype for anything on the laptop. Any advice? Thanks :)</p>

    <title>CHANGING DEFAULT SAVE LOCATIONS IN WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kylef4048  say:</h3>
<h2>            CHANGING DEFAULT SAVE LOCATIONS IN WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I have an SSD for my win 10 boot drive, and I have read various solutions to changing default save locations for documents, programs, photos, etc. The easiest seems to be to create a new folder on my D: drive and then move photos and docs by individually
 right clicking on the target and then change the save location to the new folder on D: drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was also noticing when i type 'default' in the Win 10 settings it brings up a selection to 'change default save locations'. My question is, if I do it this way, does it just create a partion on my D: drive, or will it actually create new folders for each
 of the selections? (There's a drop down box).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p>Thanks for the help. The Malware removal software you recommend is not compatible with my Windows 10 64 bit system though. I was able to find were the Malware was located, in&nbsp; Pokki app that was installed from Acer when I purchased the PC. I just removed
 all of the Pokki software and it took care of the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This Bontio Media Malware would pop up every time I would log onto my PC asking me to select it for my browser home page and web search. I don't know were it came from and couldn't eliminate it. I would deselect the agree to terms box and close it out but
 it would come back up every time I would log back on to PC. I performed a full PC scan with MS security and it wouldn't find anything. MS may want to look into this and come up with a solution.
</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>John&nbsp;</p>

            I went to 'Settings'. Then 'System', "Apps and Features", searched on Pokki in 'type an app name'. Deleted both Pokki apps that were returned.&nbsp; All good now!!

<h2>            Windows 10 April 2018 update 1803 may cause BitLocker boot problem on small laptops</h2>
                    <p>After recently updating Windows 10 Home Edition to April 2018, version 1803 on a Dell Inspiron 13-5378, the computer could not boot without my entering a Recovery Key into a BitLocker screen.&nbsp;&nbsp; I find: Device Encrypt is installed and turned ON; a TPM chip
 needs to be present for BitLocker to work; my computer does not have a TPM chip.&nbsp;&nbsp; Turning Device encrypt OFF, decrypting the device, solves the boot problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does Upgrade 1803 install Device Encrypt on windows 10 Home Edition, where it only existed before on Pro or Enterprise?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, owners of small laptops like mine will have the same problem as I had, because many small laptops to not have a TPM.</p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection - how do I enter computer name&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 Professional and a friend of mine is using the same. &nbsp;I would like to take remote control of his computer through the internet. &nbsp;I have been reading instructions online on Remote Desktop Connection. &nbsp;I will make sure that he enables
 Remote Desktop by choosing either "Allow connections from computers running any version of Remote Desktop (less secure)" or "Allow connections only from computers running Remote Desktop with Network Level Authentication".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I want to access his computer remotely, I will go to Start Menu | All Programs | Remote Desktop Connection. &nbsp;When I do this, it asks for the computer I want to connect to and a username. &nbsp;My friend and I are both connected to the internet by typical
 service providers (cable). &nbsp;I can ask him his computer name, but I don't see how Remote Desktop would be able to resolve his local computer name through the internet when we are not on a domain or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The instructions say that you can also enter an IP address, but that confuses me too because his computers IP address is a local address like 192.168.1.100 assigned by his cable modem/router. &nbsp;I don't see how Remote Desktop would be able to find him that
 way either. &nbsp;Do I have to also enter the public IP address of his router or do anything else special to connect to him?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,<br />
Paul</p>

<h3> drg40  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are Offline files available in Windows 7 home premium&#63;</h2>
                    2 questions. <br />
<br />
1 my version of W7 Ult is on a small, fast disc. I'd like to put my offline copies onto another disc on the system large enough to handle them (lots of photographs) is this possible?<br />
<br />
2 W7 Home Premium won't touch offline files. I can't find anywhere that tells me if offline files are implemented in Home Premium. If they are, any clues what I might not have turned on? I guess you might need more info - if I knew what to send it would help!<br />

<p><span><span>Hey<strong> drg40,</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>It is possible to put Offline files onto another drive and this can be done through a Directory Junction which can redirect to a new location of Offline files.</span></p>
<p><span>a. The Offline Files are stored in the folder
<strong>%SystemRoot%\CSC</strong> (which usually is <strong>C:\Windows\CSC</strong> or a different drive letter in place of C). First, create a folder on a partition with large space and give it an informative name, say<strong>, D:\Offline Folders</strong>
 as a suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span>b. You need to delete the existing folder and create a junction in its place. For this, boot into Safe Mode as an administrator and delete the CSC contents and folder.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>del /s /q %SystemRoot%\CSC should to the job.<br />
<br />
</strong>Below are the steps to get into Safe Mode:<br />
<br />
<br />

<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tap the F8 key after your computer initially powers on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you see the Advanced Boot Options menu you can stop tapping.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the up/down arrow keys to highlight your selection.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select Safe Mode and press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should see drivers loading, and then please wait.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You should then be at the Welcome Screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Logon to your computer using an account with Administrator privileges.</span></span></p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>c. Having created the new location folder, and deleting the existing CSC folder, now is time to create a Directory Junction for CSC folder with the following command:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>mklink /J<span>&nbsp;
</span>%SystemRoot%\CSC<span>&nbsp; </span>&lt;new-folder-path&gt;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>for example:<span>&nbsp;
</span>mklink /J<span>&nbsp; </span>C:\Windows\CSC<span>&nbsp; </span>"D:\Offline Files"</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Now, whatever is meant for location<strong> %SystemRoot%\CSC</strong> gets directed to the new location.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: The quote marks in "D:\Offline Files" were required because of a space character in the folder name, otherwise not necessary.<br />
<br />
The above information is taken from the below link where <strong>samc1</strong> has given a brief description about Offline Files:
<br />
</span></span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/6af0cf60-84f6-4e48-b0a1-2780a5fd7b7a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7files/thread/6af0cf60-84f6-4e48-b0a1-2780a5fd7b7a/</span></a><span><span>
<br />
<br />
about your 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; question, we are sorry to say that Windows 7 Home Premium doesn't have the offline files feature.<span>&nbsp;
</span>That requires Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

                    We just had a local computer company do some work on our computers.&nbsp; The ended up installing new versions of Windows 7 Home Premium on three of our computers.&nbsp; They also installed new (maybe used, not sure) hard drives on the computers.&nbsp; I noticed on the
 COA sticker they put on that it was an OEM version.&nbsp; I'm concerned that this may be in violation of Microsoft's licensing agreements.&nbsp; These are all existing computers, several years old.&nbsp; They did not give us the packaging or DVDs.&nbsp; I ran a check on the license
 key &amp; ID.&nbsp; The ID on the sticker does not match the ID on the computer per the key software.&nbsp; The key does match.&nbsp; I have been getting mixed answers from this question on other sites.&nbsp; It appears to me, through my research, that they should have installed
 retail versions, not OEM versions.&nbsp; What version should have been installed to stay in compliance?<br />

            <p>First I wonder why they didn't use the product key on the COA / Sticker that came with your computer to re-install Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I question why all three computers needed new hard drives, did all of them fail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the OEM versions they installed, each should have come with a 25 character product key, so ask for the OEM packaging and product key for each system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also an OEM version is tied to the 1st computer it is installed on and can not be used on another computer or should the original computer's motherboard fail it will not activate on a replacement motherboard unless it is an identical motherboard in every
 respect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As long as each computer has been activated you should be in compliance but to be certain download and run the Microsoft Genuine Advantage Diagnostic Tool:<br />

            <p>Thanks for the response but I think I need to clarify a bit more.&nbsp; It's the product ID's that don't match, not the product keys, they do match.&nbsp; After more reading I discovered the product ID can change during installation.&nbsp; I guess the real question is:&nbsp;
 "Is the company that installed the OEM Windows 7 on my computers in violation of their agreement with Microsoft.&nbsp; Once they open the package they accept the EULA, correct?"&nbsp; The OEM products are only to be installed by assemblers building new computers or
 refurbishing old ones for resale.&nbsp; Are they allowed to install the OEM software on an existing computer owned by someone else that they (the computer company) are not selling?&nbsp; I thought our existing computers would require the retail version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like these are system builders you allowed to work with the hardware/software installations.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A.</strong> The current OEM System Builder License allows system builders to distribute Windows desktop operating system licenses in the following ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>Preinstalled on a new PC.</li><li><strong>Unopened</strong> OEM System Builder Packs can be distributed to other system builders by themselves. Note that they must remain unopened so the receiving system builder can accept and be bound by the break-the-seal license agreement that is affixed
 to the pack.</li></ol>

            <p>They are allowed to install OEM versions of Windows 7, but the product key must be unique for each of your computers (they can't use the same key on more than one computer0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The EULA is accepted during the installation process.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>"Are they allowed to install the OEM software on an existing computer owned by someone else that they (the computer company) are not selling?&nbsp; I thought our existing computers would require the retail version."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes they are allowed to install a legitimate OEM version of Windows 7 on any computer but as mentioned:</p>
<p>One product key = One computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the diagnostic utility I mentioned on one of the 3 computer and post your results (Copy button).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will give us a better look at what they installed.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I now have two conflicting answers, yours and smittychat's.&nbsp; </p>
<p>According to smittychat's answer the OEM software can only be installed under two different scenarios.</p>
<p>The license and user agreement stuff I read on this site doesn't appear to allow them to install it on computers that they are not selling.</p>
<p>How do you respond to smittychat's post?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not at work now but I will run the test you mentioned when I get back to work.</p>
<p>I have no idea why they would install three hard drives.&nbsp; Not to mention they installed smaller drives.</p>
<p>I became suspicious of their motives after I noticed the hard drives swapped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>What they installed were OEM System Builder licenses, which really should only be installed on new computers by professional system builders reselling computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless of this, non-System Builders are known to purchase these license because they are cheaper than retail licenses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really there is nothing preventing you from using them, Microsoft is not gonna come knocking at your door over this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, its unlikely to get or afford retail licenses these days, especially full version retail licenses.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>There is nothing wrong with using it too, especially since all future releases of Windows will be full versions anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OEM licensing rules still apply, although persons have managed to transfer to new motherboards without issue:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>

As has already been pointed out, assuming you are really referring to your Taskbar, first you need to make sure it is unlocked and not auto-hiding (via right-click Properties).&nbsp;&nbsp; After that you can drag it up using a mouse pointer or to do it using the keyboard
 press Alt-Space, S and CursorUp.&nbsp; (just as you can resize a normal window using the keyboard.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then, if desired, relock it and turn on Auto-Hide again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If HP doesnt have a win7 driver there are none, and the fact it worked under winxp is immaterial, time to purchase a new scanner that supports win7
