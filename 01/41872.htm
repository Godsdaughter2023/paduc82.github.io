<h2>            Canon Pixma MP140 Won&#39;t scan under windows 8 &#40;64&#41;</h2>
                    I have the latest drivers from Canon and can print just fin.<br />
<br />
The scanner, used from MP Navigator 3.1 returns a 'scan failed' error when attempting to scan.<br />
<br />
The scanner set-up wizard will only try to access the scanner using omni-page and gives no opportunity to select MP Navigator.<br />
<br />
When forced to test the scanner (fully installed with latest drivers and powered up) the wizard reports that it cannot find the scanner.<br />

            Thanks Santhosh,<br />
<br />
I had already tried this, but I've found an answer now.<br />
<br />
For some reason the set-up defaults to the Omnipage SE&nbsp; application to scanner handle events.<br />
<br />
Try this:<br />
<br />
Power on the connected printer and place a document to scan on the platen.<br />
<br />
Press the SCAN&nbsp; button on the printer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At the bottom of your desktop window stack a window pops up inviting you to choose Omnipage or or MP Navigator applications to handle the scan.<br />
<br />
Select the MP Navigator option and continue. MP navigator will continue to work until you power down the printer and re-start it.<br />
<br />
Scanning from the printer driver (Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Devices and Printers\Canon MP140 series Printer) works all the time, but you loose the MP Navigator functionality.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that here is a better way to fix this, but the above works fine for me for now.<br />

<h2>            Gears&#58; Judgment Skin Missing out of TOTAL Skin Pack&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So when Gears of War: Judgment came out Tuesday, Epic released the armor and weapon skin packs. They released a Total Skin pack that is supposed to include all of the armor and weapon skins. However, upon purchasing the Total Skin pack, I noticed I was missing
 the Neon Armor Skin still. I talked it over with other gamers on the official Epic Forums and we all discovered that the Neon Armor Skin is available only if you buy the Epic Armor Skin Pack.</p>
<p><br />
So one armor skin is missing out of the Total Skin Pack. And the only way to receive the armor is to buy another skin pack, since the armor skin is not sold&nbsp;separately. I was advised by Ron (Xbox Support) to post in here so others can see this issue. I hope
 that since I am bringing this to everyone's attention this issue can get fixed swiftly. I hope to hear from someone shortly on why the Total Skin Pack is missing one skin that is only available in another pack and whether or not this is being worked on or
 looked into.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;EBG DJ Vash 40! I just tried getting the Total Skin Pack here in the office and it gave me the Neon skin. So I'm thinking we should be able to solve your issue.<br /><br />What I would suggest is:<br />-Go into your storage device and delete the skin pack from your hard drive (Go to settings, then system, then storage, then your hard drive)<br />-Clear your cache (use this guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache</a>)<br />-Restart your Xbox 360 console<br />-Go into your download history and redownload the Total Skin Pack (use this guide: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content-history</a>)<br />-Load up Gears and see if you have the

            <p>Awesome! I'm glad to hear it! I ask myself, "What is the point of playing multiplayer if I can't shine with a majestic neon glow?" And I answer myself, "There is no point...none at all!" Seriously though I'm really glad this worked for you. Definitely point anyone else you see with this problem to this solution and hopefully it'll work for them too. ^_^</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for your drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays all<br />
devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>Thanks for bringing this situation to our attention here on the forums. I understand your getting error messages and are unable to get our console to fully boot up is that correct? You have already tried a Full Factory reset? And you also mentioned the Offline
 System Update is not working either is that right? If that is the case I would recommend looking into

            XBF George L, I'm not sure if you work for Microsoft or are a volunteer? But if you work for Microsoft then I think it is offensive for you to write "Thanks for bringing this situation to our attention...". It is offensive because this "situation" has
 very clearly been brought to Microsoft's attention many, many, many times and is clearly a MAJOR issue with the xbox one consoles and yet Microsoft is seemingly trying to make money off the issue by forcing people to get their consoles serviced, or, more likely,
 buy a new console! It's horrendous behaviour from Microsoft.&nbsp;

<p>You can also report this problem using the Xbox Insider Hub app so we can investigate it further:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your console, install the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</li><li>Hold down the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>

<p>It would be nice if we could use the Xbox Insider Hub to report the issue but this error means we cannot do anything at all. By this I mean, the console does not allow anything else to be done until the update is completed, but it won't complete the update.
 Especially now, after trying a factory reset to fix it, I cannot choose any other option but 'update' so I am unable to even choose the option to go offline so i can't even access settings - literally the only thing i can do as part of the setup process is
 select to run the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is beyond infuriating! I have just wasted hundreds of dollars on Xbox games for my children for Christmas which they will not be able to play, not to mention the cost of having to purchase a new console.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Simon,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community and I really appreciate the efforts. This issue may occur if the System or Software registry hives have become damaged or corrupted. You can follow the steps mentioned below and check if that works:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Remove any external connected devices and then boot up. This includes printer, camera, external hard drive etc. (except mouse and the keyboard). If this corrects the issue, add the devices back one at a time until you discover the piece of hardware
 causing the issue. Then get any updated drivers\software for the device.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Also you can refer to the link below and check if that helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Unable to refresh or reset PC after Automatic Repair fails in Windows 8</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2823223?wa=wsignin1.0</span></p>
<p><span>If Method 1 and 2 does not work then try:</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Your best option would be to contact store from where you purchased the laptop and request another or verify your current product key as without the product key we can’t assist you further. Once you get the product key, create installation media for
 Windows 8/8.1 if you do not have a disc. You can refer to the link below and follow the steps:
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to create installation media for a PC refresh or reset:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 4:</span></strong><span> </span></span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to perform a startup repair using Windows 8 bootable DVD or USB drive.</span></p>
<p><span>a) Insert the installation DVD or USB and boot Windows 8 from it.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the ‘<strong>Windows setup’</strong> page select <strong>the ‘language to install’</strong>, ‘<strong>Time and currency format</strong>’ and the
<strong>‘keyboard or input method’ </strong>and click on <strong>‘next’</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Click on ‘<strong>Repair your computer’</strong> and select ‘<strong>Troubleshoot’.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>d) Click on ‘<strong>Advanced options’</strong> and select ‘<strong>Automatic Repair</strong>’ and select the operating system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 5: </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists then you may perform a refresh of the Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps below for the same-</span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Boot with the Windows 8 DVD and then select <strong>“Next”.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span>b) Now, select “<strong>Repair</strong>” and then select “Refresh your PC”.</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the article below for detailed information -</span></p>

<h2>            trouble installing kb2800095 error 80070005</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>After running Windows Update numerous times since April 9, I have two updates that will not install, and fail everytime they run.</p>
<p>Update for Windows 7 for x64 based systems KB 2890005 and KB 2908783. &nbsp;Have tried using MS Fixit, downloading hotfix files, running sfc /scannow etc. &nbsp;Nothing seems to work. &nbsp;When restarting the computer to process updates, they look like they are going
 to complete, but then fail, and Window reverts the files, and reboots. &nbsp;They continue to be in the Selected updates in Windows update everytime the computer is shut down. &nbsp;Have failed at least 20 times. &nbsp;Any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks for help</p>

            <p>FWIW, I had this exact problem - those two updates continually failed with error code 80070005, and I had problems with drivers not installing, and networking was broken in VirtualBox. After trying various permissions-fixing tools, the final solution was
 to run Malware Bytes, which found various infected files and registry keys (neither MS Security Essentials nor Security Scanner found them!). Once I had it remove those, everything started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Audio Sync &#47; DPC Drop out from NDIS.sys and TCPIP.sys</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been having regular audio desyncs. Using advice from other forums I have tried the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 updated drivers - network and sound</p>
<p>2 reverted drivers to motherboard makers authorised drivers (from their website) - network and sound</p>
<p>3 disabled dynamic tic</p>
<p>4 ran full windows antivirus and malware bytes scan - all clean</p>
<p>
</p><p>Latency Mon shows that NDIS.sys and TCPIP.sys are causing DPC dropouts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one have any more advice or can help fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see below from a Window Performance Analyser TCPIP is causing the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1aa9f1ad-8b75-4c5b-bcc0-cdc782831f44" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1aa9f1ad-8b75-4c5b-bcc0-cdc782831f44" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know if its related but when downloading e.g. game updates my CPU jumps to 100% cpu usage, Process Explorer shows SYSTEM to be using 40%+ of my cpu, and this seems to be NDIS.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dde3c3d3-dc69-4698-9961-6c1c0cc98070" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dde3c3d3-dc69-4698-9961-6c1c0cc98070" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone able to help?</p>

<p>It is possible the issue is with a third party software that installs a network enabled filter driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For instance older versions of&nbsp;Adguard WPF driver has been known to do this:</p>

<h3> erikaram  say:</h3>
<h2>            App installed last tomorrow&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I recently (today on 1/17/2018) downloaded an app from the windows store. I also had recently changed my PC name so idk if that matters. Anyways upon downloading this happened&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
It shows that the install date for the app was tomorrow? Even though it was clearly today under recently installed apps on my Microsoft Account. Is there a way to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I know my thing just finished an Update for my system and it updates apps. Could this be the update date? Cause it says tomorrow which is really odd. My clock on everything is set auto so it's not that cause it is fine everywhere else.</p>

            As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<p>Thanks for the&nbsp; updates , but&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp; was not aware of 1803 upgrade issue, so&nbsp; after the installation removed old windows&nbsp; files from&nbsp; my system to save&nbsp; the space :(</p>

<h2>            Excel Word download</h2>
                    Dear support team,<br />
<br />
since I have Vista installed on the laptop, I can not download Excel or word documents sent by mail to my laptop any more.<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do or set up, in order to be able to open up easily older versions of Excel or Word with Vista?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot for your answer, in advance.<br />
Best regards<br />

            <p>I have spoken with Microsoft who advised to try the following software repair tool
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://aka.ms/softwarerepairtool-kbarticle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Software Repair Tool">http://aka.ms/softwarerepairtool-kbarticle</a>
</p><p>
</p><p>However it did not work, they told me if it doesn't succeed to return the surface book for a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that ideal solutions but maybe its a problem with the surface book or factory install and there will continually be problems.&nbsp; Microsoft did say they will fully support the replacement/refund so customer service is great.&nbsp; It is a bit of pain returning
 an item and waiting on a replacement in the hope that the same problem does not happen again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If anyone does have any suggestions other then this option let me know but i feel it maybe the only and best option as there could be bigger problems ahead.</p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error occurs from a corrupted system file and renaming SoftwareDistribution folder to SDold is a usual remedy to this issue as reported by several users. Since the issue still persists after renaming SoftwareDistribution folder, we recommend running
<strong>Windows Store app troubleshooter</strong> and see if the issue will be resolved:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>X </strong>and click on <strong>
Control Pane</strong><strong>l</strong>.<br />
2. Change <strong>View by</strong> from <strong>Category</strong> to <strong>Large Icons/Small Icons</strong>.<br />
3. Click on <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> and select <strong>View all</strong>.<br />
4. Select <strong>Windows Store Apps</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also suggest that you reset Windows Store cache by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press the <strong>Windows ke</strong>y + <strong>R</strong>.<br />
2. Click <strong>Run.</strong></p>
<p>3. Type WSReset.exe and click <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns. </p>
<p />

<p>Hello thanks for this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the suggestions you give have already been tried as per the post, and reading the comments of other posts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is not just with Windows Store but also with not being able to connect toto Windows 10 updates so am not sure why it has been move down on just the store section of the forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time - Microsoft technical team do not understand how this has happened or a way to fix it other than a replacement.</p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've noticed my brothers computer (exactly the same as mine, model and all) connects within a couple of seconds after waking from sleep. Upon waking my computer from sleep, it takes about 1-5 minutes for my computer to reconnect to the internet, I check
 my device manager and it shows its enabled but the two Vitual Miniports say they both cannot start. &nbsp;Any help?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t change my gamer pic on Xbox App.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been trying to get a custom gamer pic but it says I'm not old enough. My account used to be a child account back when I first got Xbox back in 2012 but I now have a Adult account. My account settings for my birthday are definitely old enough also. When
 I try to change my gamer pic though on the Xbox app it says I'm not old enough as well as on my Xbox. If there is a solution for this it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Brian</p>

    <title>Am getting many different error messages trying to clean install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andreasp_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Am getting many different error messages trying to clean install windows on Laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i am having quite alot of trouble getting a clean install on my HP laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a: HP Probook 650 G1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some background info first: The harddrive was failing and i thought this would be<br />
a great time to buy a new ssd for the laptop, which i had been planning to do<br />
for quite some time, i also wanted to update from windows 8 to 10. I have changed hdd's and ssd's on many other laptops and desktops before&nbsp;and thought this would be the same, however!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I finally got the ssd and the hdd was practically dead and not working anymore, so<br />
i swapped them out and plugged my usb which i had installed windows on from the<br />
media creation tool. It went nearly flawlessly through the installation with pretty<br />
much no hickups, then the laptop restarted and nothing happened, i couldn't boot to the<br />
ssd, so after trying a couple of times i decided to just install it again.</p>
<p>This time however it took upwards of 5 minutes just to acces the bios, the laptop<br />
was all of a sudden ridicolously slow.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I updated the bios, formatted the ssd and tried again. And to make a very long story:</p>
<p><br />
Some times i could not even get into the bios, or it would take 5 min+,</p>
<p>sometimes i couldn't format the partition, so windows wouldn't intstall.</p>
<p>Sometimes windows would nearly finish installing then saying something was corrupt.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>These are only a couple of the many problems i have had. I have tried compiling a list of every single error<br />
i have had, and every single solution i have tried.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm at a point now though where&nbsp;the problems are simply starting to loop into eachother, meaning that when fixing one<br />
problem i just get another, when fixing that i get another again etc.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm posting this really hoping that someone out there knows a solution to this.<br />
It just seems really weird that this laptop worked fine a couple of days ago, and<br />
now it just simply won't do anything.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Errors and problems:<br />
Bios would not start,<br />
Windows would not boot from usb,<br />
Windows stuck at "Setup is starting",<br />
Windows cannot format ssd (even when it's all unallocated),<br />
Windows cannot create a partition,<br />
Windows cannot delete / format partiton,<br />
Windows installation stuck at 0% then giving me an error message (can't remember what it said)<br />
Windows getting halfway through installation then giving me an error message,<br />
Windows finishing installation then giving me an error message (corrupt files)<br />
Windows complaining about GPT drive<br />
Windows complaining about MBR drive</p>
<p><br />
Taking out 1 stick of ram<br />
Using differing usb's,<br />
Using differnet ISO's,<br />
Using Media Creation tool,<br />
Using Rufus with different ISO's,<br />
Installing windows on the ssd from a another machine (it worked, so the SSD is not faulty)<br />
Tried swapping ssd with another laptop HDD which has worked perfectly in the past (it did not work)<br />
Tried with Legacy Bios, UEFI Bios &amp; UEFI + CSM<br />
Tried changing partition stucture from MBR to GPT and the other way around<br />
Tried using Diskpart to format, clean and create partitions.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure i have forgotten some things, either way these are most of the things i have tried.<br />
Please help..</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot from the USB, try opening Boot Options at the HP screen...</p>
<p>My HP uses ESC then F9 to do this I believe...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are installing using UEFI Bios, look for your flash drive listed as "UEFI USB"... if using Legacy Bios, look for just the old fashioned "USB"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Flash Drive needs to be created specifically for Legacy or UEFI Bios... they are for the most part not&nbsp;interchangeable...</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI flash drives need to be&nbsp;as GPT... FAT32... Legacy Flash Drives need to be formatted as MBR... NTFS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Create Media Tool may or may not create the Flash Drive as you need it...</p>
<p>RUFUS works very well providing you choose the correct settings...</p>
<p>
</p><p>RUFUS should look like this for a Flash Drive created from a Create Media ISO for UEFI Bios...</p>

            This doesn't fix the problem unfortunately, this might be why i had experienced black screen while booting from usb. But at the moment i can get into the windows installer, but from there it gives me a variety if error messages.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't think of any clear reason that would be happening...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that the original problem was not the HDD, but a hardware issues with the laptop... and maybe not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that a HDD from another machine has failed to work in addition to the SSD kind of points that way... And the slow accessing of the Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try resetting your Bios to default... Or better yet, Reset the CMOS chip...</p>
<p>How you would do this on your laptop is unknown to me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a button, a jumper, or maybe removing the internal watch battery, if it has one... Removing the laptops main battery and leaving it unplugged overnight may do it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have a Bios setting causing some of the problems... Look to make sure Secure Boot and Fast Boot are disabled... Although if you are booting at all, that seems like that would eliminate those...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check to see if you have a "CSM" setting... If so, turn it on...</p>
<p>This setting smoothes out some of the variances between UEFI and Legacy Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also try installing into Legacy Bios and see if that makes a difference.</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Check the BIOS for a setting called any of these and set it to ENABLED<br />
<br />
"Non-Execute Memory Protection"<br />
"Data Execution Prevention"<br />
"No Execute Memory Protection"<br />
"Execute Disable Function" with a sub-menu of 'No-Execute Page Protection Technology."<br />
or similar wording<br />
<br />
It might be called CPU protection - Set it to enabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also possible that your laptop is simply not compatible with Win 10... There have been some that are not..</p>

<h2>            Event ID 1033, status&#58; 1603</h2>
                    
<p>When I&nbsp;am installing a simulation software on Windows 7 64bit the installation stops with a window popped up telling me "The wizard was interrupted before [application name] could be completely installed". I checked in the event log/viewer and the message
 says "Windows Installer installed the product. Product name [xxx]. Product Language: 1033 .... Installation success or error status: 1603."&nbsp;This was done using administrator login.</p>
<p>I have googled as much as I can and have also tried compatibility features available with no joy.</p>
<p>This software installs well with Vista Home Premium SP3</p>
<p>Anybody can help?</p>

Also, try signing out then in. </blockquote>

<p>I have the same phone and iOS and latest updates, I can only make a call when my phone is connected to wifi, I know this is a known issues but no one at Microsoft seems to want to answer why this is happening. I have full mobile reception with 4G coverage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype will work all the way through to the other person picking up then it cuts out, I have run the Skype test and all results came back fine, as soon as I turn my wifi on it connects not a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend has the same issue, this never used to happen before and is very frustrating as I just purchased a Skype number hoping that people can call me and it will ring on my mobile but this doesn't happen so whats the point of having it!</p>

<h3> saumil khare  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to update App Installer in Windows 10 Pro Microsoft Store</h2>
                    I am able to install all available application updates in Microsoft Store except
<strong>App Installer</strong>, An update is available for App Installer but whenever I try to update this app it fails and gives me error message
<strong>"Something unexpected happened, Reporting this problem will help us understand it better. You can wait a bit and try again or restart your device. That may help. Code: 0x80070003"&nbsp;</strong>The question is, why only this app can not be updated to the
 latest version. Please help me out on this issue.

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />I will suggest you to try the  following procedures below:
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows App Troubleshooter 
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down to the bottom &gt; Click Windows Store Apps &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter 
<br />
<br />Try to download it again 
<br />If didn't work 
<br />Reset the Microsoft store 
<br />
<br />2. Reset Windows Store in Settings 
<br />Type Apps in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Apps &amp; Features &gt; Scroll down &amp; click Microsoft Store &gt; Click Advanced Optons &gt; Reset
<br />
<br />
<br />If the issue persist I would suggest you to following the  procedures below: 
<br />
<br />Re-register Microsoft Store app for Current User 
<br />
<br />1. Terminate the Microsoft Store app to make sure it's closed and not running. 
<br />
<br />2. Open Power-Shell as Administrator
<br />
<br />3. Copy and paste the command below into Power-Shell, and press Enter.
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
<br />
<br />4. When finished, you can close Power-Shell, and try opening the Microsoft Store app again .. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If still didn't work, try to Re-register Microsoft Store app for All Users 
<br />You must be signed in as an administrator to be able to do this option. 
<br />
<br />1. Terminate the Microsoft Store app to make sure it's closed and not running. 
<br />
<br />2. Open an elevated Power-Shell 
<br />
<br />3. Copy and paste the command below into the elevated Power-Shell, and press Enter. 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
<br />
<br />4. When finished, close the elevated Power-Shell, 
<br />
<br />5. Restart the computer to apply. 
<br />
<br />6. Try opening the Microsoft Store app again. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />
<br />Best Regards,
<br />
<br />Diego R.

            Thanks for your reply, I tried all above steps but nothing worked. the strange thing is in Microsoft Store shows that App Installer is installed and an update is available, but during Troubleshooting process It goes through reset app process and opened
 App &amp; features menu but there is no such App Installer app is listed. It looks like App Installer in not even installed in my system but then why Microsoft Store is showing an update for this app?

            ok I understand. Then I recommend you to repair the Microsoft Store
<br />
<br />. Follow these steps: 
<br />
<br />1) launch powershell 
<br />2) Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted 
<br />3) Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />Restart your system

<p><span><strong>Original Title:<span>Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device.....</span></strong><br />
</span><br />
Arrrrgh!&nbsp; Been having a terrible time trying to get the scanner function to work on my Epson Stylus CX7000F.</p>
<p>I get the all too common but seemingly unfixable "Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device...Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to intall it...The system cannot find
 the file specified".</p>
<p>The printer/copier/fax work fine but no go on the scanner.</p>
<p>I have tried the "fixes" at epson.com numerous times with no luck.&nbsp; This includes their uninstall/install&nbsp;reccomendation&nbsp;many times, even trying this proccess in safe mode and clean boot.</p>
<p>I have run the Microsoft ATS "fix it" program with no luck.&nbsp; It detected the error and stated that the problem was fixed but, guess what?&nbsp; No it isn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have clicked install driver/update driver from the device manager.</p>
<p>I have tried the work around, eliminating the "LowerFilters" entry from the registry.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; You&nbsp;got it, no luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, before I go and buy a new printer/scanner, with no guarantees they will work.&nbsp; Does anyone have any other suggestion?</p>
<p>I am running Vista, 32 bit.</p>

            You can also try and replacing or installing the ntprint.inf file.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I had a similar issue on a Windows 7 PC and noticed that this file was not present.&nbsp; I simply copied the file from another Win7 PC.&nbsp; The printer I was trying to install was a Brother MFC-J410w.
<br />
<br />
The file can be found here C:\Windows\inf<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone. <br />

<p>Hello MS Support,</p>

<p>I bought a PX4 Turtle beach headset with a Microsoft adaptor.</p>

<p>The sounds of the game is working fine however I can't speak with my friend in a party.</p>

<p>They can hear me but I cannot hear them.</p>

<p>If I plugged the headset we have when we buy the Xbox then unplug and plug my PX4. I can hear them till I speak after that, I cannot hear them again.</p>

<p>are you aware of that issue? is this a configuration issue? MS need to update the controllers?</p>

<p>Regards</p>
