            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the system goes into sleep mode, it's <em>still </em>turned on, but goes into a 'standby' mode and places the system-state into RAM to be quickly retrieved/restored upon wake cues. Given the system is still consuming energy, and technically still
<em>on </em>during this process, a power surge would still have the potential to damage the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Patrick</p>

    <title>Can you leave Windows 10 dictation on indefinitely until you stop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can you leave Windows 10 dictation on indefinitely until you stop it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have used the dictation feature in Windows 10, if I don't say anything for maybe 10 seconds, dictation stops on its own. I would like to leave dictation on for a long period of time with many periods of silence. Can you change a setting so that dictation
 will stay on indefinitely, and it will only stop when you give it a stop command? Or, if you can't keep it on indefinitely, can you increase the amount of time it hears nothing before it will automatically stop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

I left the machine a few hours to see if it would eventually load however it simply sat with no further messages.<br />

A few days later I tried to add BBC iplayer and was unable to the message below was displayed:<br />

<span><span>Hi Alan Treen,<br />
<br />
Thanks for visiting answers.microsoft.com forums.&nbsp;</span></span>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>
<span><span>I was doing research and found some useful advice from another one of our Support Engineer’s.</span></span>
<span><span>Try the steps below to see if it fixes your problem.</span></span>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong>Verify that the Windows Installer Service is not already in use.</strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span>The Windows Installer service can only run (1) setup instance at a time</span></em><span>.
 If you receive this error it is because another setup or configuration is already in progress.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you have not started an install or uninstall action this may indicate a problem with another program that is continually
 trying to configure itself on startup. If you see a notification, every time that you boot, that a program is being configured this particular program is the culprit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to temporarily resolve this issue.</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will need to open the Windows
<strong>Task Manager</strong> and identify whether or not the installer service is presently running. If it is running in we can manually end that particular task, and this will allow you to proceed with your installation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Caution</span></strong><span>:
<em>Please use caution when ending a process or thread in within the Task Manager. Ending a process can cause a program to close and cause any unsaved data to be lost. If a system process is closed, a system component may no longer function correctly.</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To end the Windows Installer task do the following:</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the
<strong>Taskbar</strong> and select <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; - or -</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press
<strong>Ctrl+Alt+Delete</strong> and then select the <strong>Task Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the
<strong>Processes</strong> tab, and then click on <strong>Show processes for all users</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on
<strong>Continue</strong> or provide administrator credentials if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the
<strong>Image Name</strong> column search for a file called <strong>msiexec.exe</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you locate this field, and have not started an install/uninstall we will want to end this process.</span></p>
<p><span>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the
<strong>msiexec.exe</strong> process, and select<strong> End Process</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You will receive a confirmation, and you will need to click on
<strong>End Process</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>10.&nbsp; Once you have done this go pack to
<strong>Programs and Features</strong> to see if you can successfully install/uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to permanently resolve this issue.</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the previous troubleshooting resolved your inability to install/uninstall programs you will want to confirm that this
 behavior does not happen <strong>every time</strong> you turn on your computer. If this issue is persistent then you will want to identify what program is constantly using the Windows Installer (msiexec.exe) service.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Often times when you manually end the process as described above the program will automatically try and restart its installation.
 You may see a window saying “&lt;Program name&gt; is being configured…” which would readily indicate which application is at fault. You would simply need to uninstall, and then reinstall the application at fault.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you aren’t so lucky you may need to manually locate the program. One method you can try is using
<strong><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/121ff6a6-181e-4e8f-83bb-c7b1f3c6d71a1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Selective Startup</span></a></strong> (Clean Boot). If you clicked on the previous link you can skip the section
 titled “<em>Identify the system service that is causing the problem</em>” section. Once you have narrowed down which application is the problem you can remove and reinstall it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please let us know if you still have problems.<br />
</span></p>

<h2>            the remote device or resource won&#39;t accept the connection</h2>
                    With Windows 7 Pro when trying to map a network drive attached to my wireless router I get an error. Following the diagnostics, I receive the following message (the remote device or resource won't accept the connection). The wireless router is an Apple
 AirPort Extreme n model with a Seagate GoFlex Desk 3TB attached with a usb 3 connection. The Seagate disk works fine when connected directly to my Lenovo Z570 laptop but not when connected to the wireless router. I tried Apple support but they played dumb
 and stated that because I was using a PC, to access the router, that they wouldn't be able to help me. Is there someone here that knows both MAC and PC systems that can help me sort this out?

<h2>            Uninstalling software in Windows 7 vs 10</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I recently made the transition to Windows 10 and have loads of bloatware on my Yoga 920 laptop that I want to completely delete. On my old Windows 7 machine I used third party software to ensure all traces of the program I wanted to delete was removed, as it's
 well known that you could never fully remove a program if you uninstalled using Windows Control Centre.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me if this how been resolved in Windows 10, or do I need to get some third party software again? If I do, could you please advise the best program to use.<br />
<br />
Thanks&nbsp;<br />
<br />

            Similar to Windows 7, Windows 10 does not have a complete uninstaller. I recommend using Revo uninstaller to uninstall programs:

            Hi Tom, I write software for a living . . .
<br />
<br />With regards to uninstalling software, it is up to the developer of the software to write a good uninstallation routine so that it removes all traces of their application, including registry entries, temp files, application and any dll's used.
<br />
<br />Regardless of which version of Windows, the installation of software depends on the Software developer. 
<br />
<br />Because there are so many badly written installation routines out there, you probably should use a 3rd party application to completely uninstall software
<br />
<br />A very good free offering on the web is Revo Uninstaller, it does a really good job and will uninstall applications that Windows cannot remove . . .

    <title>Intermittent problem&#58; duplicate networks &#38; no Internet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jheikkinen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intermittent problem&#58; duplicate networks &#38; no Internet connection</h2>
                    <p>Every so often, seemingly completely at random, computers on my home network abruptly stop being able to connect to the Internet. There is no error message and it doesn't seem to correspond to any particular thing I (or anyone else) is doing; browsers and
 other programs that require an Internet connection simply stop working, reporting that I don't have a connection. The (very few) things I do over the local network without requiring Internet connectivity, like accessing shared drives, still work, but anything
 that needs the Internet just quietly fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this happens and I mouse over the Network icon in the notification area, it says I&nbsp;<em>do</em> have an Internet connection, but it also shows me being connected to two networks. One will be the correct one (which is just called "Network", call me creative)
 and the other will be the same but with a seemingly random number between 2 and 10 appended, like it might say I'm connected to both "Network" and "Network 5".</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Sometimes</em> disabling and re-enabling the network adapter fixes the problem, other times it still does the same thing (including the same number appended to the name of the duplicate network) after I re-enable it. Similarly,
<em>sometimes</em> resetting my router works and other times it doesn't, there seems to be no way to predict or control which will happen. Sometimes the problem is fixed quickly and easily, other times there's absolutely nothing you can do about it except wait
 a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem occurs on both a Windows 7 machine with a wired connection to the router, and on a couple of different Windows 10 machines that connect wirelessly. It doesn't necessarily occur on all the machines at once; it sometimes affects the wired connection
 but not the wireless ones, sometimes the wireless but not the wired, sometimes both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In what may or may not be a related problem, sometimes seemingly at random, other (usually Android) devices, such as my phone, randomly lose their connection for a few hours then get it back. In some ways the problems are quite similar: they happen entirely
 unpredictably, basic troubleshooting stuff sometimes does and sometimes doesn't fix them (for at least my phone, powering it down and turning it back on is fairly reliable, but not 100%), when the basic stuff doesn't work there's nothing for it but to wait
 a few hours at which time the problem will magically fix itself.&nbsp;Unlike the Windows devices, though, the Android ones can't connect to the wireless at all when this happens; they lose all network connectivity, not just Internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen a few similar problems reported here but nothing exactly like this. Any ideas?</p>

            The duplicate network thing, at least, pretty much has to be a Windows issue, or at least a bad interaction between Windows and the router. It happens on all and only Windows machines.

            <p>Although all Windows devices are affected, the issue is not limited only to Windows computers because it also happens on your other devices on the network such as your phone. These devices have common connection which is your router. It clearly shows that
 there's something wrong with your router that's needed to be checked. We highly recommend that you need to contact your internet service provider or the router manufacturer for assistance.</p>

<div><br />
</div>
<div>I downloaded the&nbsp;&nbsp;DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer, because the game uses DX 9.0c, but the same error occurred.&nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></span></p>
<p><span>If you get this error message at the end of the installation, it simply means that the installer has failed to detect DirectX 9c. There are two steps to solve this:<br />
<br />
<b>Install the latest DirectX End-User Runtimes :</b><br />
<br />
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=35</span></a></p>
<p><span><br />
This won't fix the installer. However, it'll insure that you've got the right dll files so that the actual game can run without crashing.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><b>Method 2:</b><br />
Remove the DirectX folder from the installer's directory :<br />
<br />
If you've got the digital download version, that's a fairly straightforward process. Unzip the installer somewhere using the executable that was given to you. The installation should start automatically. Cancel it without installing. Go to wherever you've unzipped
 the installer and delete the subfolder named DirectX.<br />
<br />
Start the installation by running autorun.exe within the installer's directory. Install the game normally. At the end of the installation process, the program will ask that you reinsert the disc. Just press OK without changing anything.<br />
<br />
The installer should skip the part where it verifies your installation of DirectX (which means you'll avoid the error message).<br />
<br />
<br />
If you've got the DVD version, you'll need to copy it on your hard drive first (so that you can remove the subfolder). I haven't tested this.<br />
<br />
Invalid CD-KEY during the installation<br />
<br />
For some obscure reason, uninstalling the game and reinstalling it in the same folder results in this error message.<br />
<br />
The uninstall leaves a file behind called nwncdkey.ini. It appears that this file is actually the culprit here.<br />
<br />
Just delete it before trying to install again.<br />
<br />
As an example, if you're trying to install the game in<br />
C:\Program Files\Atari\Neverwinter Nights 2\<br />
<br />
Make sure that there's no nwncdkey.ini there first!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong>You may also try to install the game in Clean Boot state.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. If yes, you may have to contact the program manufacturer for any updates
 or uninstall and re-install the program.</span></p>
<p>Refer the following Microsoft KB article for more information on how to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7:</p>

<p>
</p><p>After&nbsp;updating windows 7 to &nbsp;windows 10 everything seemed to work great. NO I cannot click on the windows icon in the lower left corner to pull up the black box with start and other programs. I have also lost my Office 10. What can I do to fix this besides
 go back to windows 7. All I get from Microsoft is the runaround. I AM 63..............this should not take a rocket scientist.&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>The new Desktop and the changes to the Start Menu in Windows 10 can be quite a challenge for a user migrating from Windows 7. It is important therefore to customise the displays to suit the way you wish to work and to give easy access to the
 programmes you use regularly.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you use two or three programmes much of the time you may find it convenient to pin programmes to the Taskbar and use Jump Lists. In the first image below you will see a total of 15 programme icons including Excel, Word, Internet Explorer,
 and other less known programmes pinned to the Taskbar. It is for you to choose what appears there. What follows next is one way how to do it.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The program files for the principal Office 2010 components are:<br />
Excel = excel.exe<br />
Outlook = outlook.exe</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Word = winword.exe</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you need other exe file details please ask.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can open or run any program e.g., Excel, by selecting the keyboard shortcut
<strong>Win+R, </strong>type<strong> excel.exe </strong>and press the<strong> ENTER
</strong>key. An Excel work sheet opens and an icon is temporarily added to the taskbar, usually at the bottom of the screen. Right click on the icon and select
<strong>Pin to taskbar. </strong>The next time you<strong> </strong>want to open Excel you click the icon. If you right click the icon you will see recent Excel files you have opened. You can click any recent file to open the file. If you want to be able to
 access a particular Excel file regularly right click the file and select <strong>
Pin to this list</strong>. The right click options linked to the taskbar icons are known as Jump lists. You can use these procedures with Word, Outlook and many other programmes.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You can customise the Desktop by deciding which panels appear on your Desktop and their position. Click the
<strong>three lines</strong> <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">1</span></strong> icon in the top left corner of the desktop and then click
<strong>All apps</strong> <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">2</span></strong> at the bottom of the left pane.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Screen does not respond after locking computer</h2>
                    <p>After locking computer using Windows + L, the screen remains turned on for about 2 minutes and then goes black and does not respond to any key or mouse movement. I have to force restart it every time this happens. I have tried following with no avail -
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Use powercfg /DEVICEENABLEALL function to make sure computer wakes up from sleep with every available device</p>
<p>2. Used SFC command to check and repair errors with cleaner image of Windows created from Windows Image Creation Tool</p>
<p>3. Run MSCONFIG to check whether any service is causing the problem and disable them as i was not able to repair them</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help as this is getting very frustrating as I have to either prolong auto turn off time which is eating a whole lot of battery for laptop and I have to leave laptop unattended as this issue makes me restart laptop rather than logging softly.</p>
<p>I do not want to reinstall a clean copy again as it will be time consuming and i have to download all apps and security settings again.</p>

            Hi, Reginald,
<br />
<br />Change the lockscreen timeout to eliminate the black screen.
<br />Before  editing Windows Registry ensure you create a backup so if anything goes wrong you can Restore it to previous settings.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>
<br />
<br />Start &gt; Type Regedit &gt; Press Enter
<br />Navigate to the following key:
<br />
<br />HKEYLOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\7516b95f-f776-4464-8c53-06167f40cc99\8EC4B3A5-6868-48c2-BE75-4F3044BE88A7'
<br />
<br />On the right side, double-click the Attributes DWORD.
<br />Change the value from 1 to 2.
<br />Click OK.
<br />'
<br />This enables the option on Windows 10 called "Console lock display off timeout."
<br />
<br />Customize Settings:
<br />
<br />Use the Windows key + X keyboard shortcut to open the Power User menu and select Power Options.
<br />Click Change plan settings link for the selected plan.
<br />Click Change advanced power settings link.
<br />On Advanced settings, scroll down and expand the Display settings.
<br />You should now see the Console lock display off timeout option, double-click to expand.
<br />Change the default time of 1 minute to the time you want, in minutes.
<br />Click Apply.
<br />Click OK to complete the task.
<br />Test the new settings by locking your computer. The screen shouldn't turn off until the time you have set expires.
<br />
<br />There was an update in 2014 for the key commands not working.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3016725/the-lock-screen-is-black-or-blank-and-does-not-respond-to-keyboard-or" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/301672...</a>
<br />
<br />Try turning off the NumLock Key to verify if the keyboard wales up.

<p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. It partially solved the problem. </p>
<p>There is another one. I changed settings under what closing lid does to do nothing and then i locked laptop and closed the lid. I reopened in 5 minutes and screen was again non-responsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution?</p>
<p>Also, that 2014 update is for preview build. I don't think it will apply to current build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            I had the same trouble with Sleep option. Screen never responded to key commands.
<br />
<br />Have you disabled Fast Startup? If yes, re-enable and verify if the Lock Screen key commands now work.
<br />
<br />Right click on Start &gt; Select Device Manage
<br />Right click on Mouse &gt; Select Power Management
<br />Check Allow this device to wake the computer
<br />Click Ok
<br />Do the same steps with Keyboard
<br />Next  &gt; Select Human Interface Devices
<br />Perform the same steps for USB ports
<br />
<br />Look in Bios for Power Management
<br />Ensure USB Wake Support is checked/Enabled
<br />
<br />Power Options &gt; Change Plan Settings
<br />Change Advanced Plan Settings
<br />Scroll down to USB Settings
<br />Click USB Selective Suspend Settings
<br />Change On Battery and Plug In to Disabled
<br />Click Apply, OK

<h2>            Windows 10 and Windows 7 dual boot - no selection screen</h2>
                    Hello everyone. I had a machine with Win 10. I installed Win 7 and after the install I had the selection screen to choose between Win 7 and Win 10. It disappeared after I booted for the first time into Win 10. Now the PC starts in Win 10 directly without
 any selection screen on boot. Everything appears to be OK when I check, see here
<a href="https://i.imgur.com/ApNwPG7.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/ApNwPG7.jpg</a> however I cannot get the selection screen to appear.<br />
Thanks in advance.

            Thanks, it seems EasyBCD is a paid programme. I tried different ways on how to get to the boot menu and when I restart from Win 10 the menu appears, but when I turn the PC off from Win 10 and then start it, the boot menu does not appear. Strange...

            Hello Justin Jacob
<div><br />
<div>
<div>You made no mention of other websites that you cannot access so I don't see this as a connect issue. If that's the case then you should verify with your IT department to see if you need any type of security settings changed or add to be granted access
 to the site.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am making the assumption the you are using the 64bit version of Internet Explorer since you are using Windows 7 64bit. &nbsp;If the issue lies within the realm of using 32bit vs 64bit then use the 32bit version of the browser located in<i><b>&nbsp;</b><span>C:\Program
 Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe.&nbsp;</span></i></div>
<div><i><span><br />

    <title>Second monitor sporadically disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adam johnson965  say:</h3>
<h2>            Second monitor sporadically disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>I built my PC in November of 2016 and have not had this sort of problem&nbsp;until now. About once each day but not always, the second monitor will randomly disconnect and display a 'no signal' message as if it was just unplugged. I can bring the display back
 by&nbsp;putting the computer to sleep and then waking it, but the problem persists after reinstalling the device, checking hardware connections, and checking drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My primary monitor is connected via HDMI and has no issues. The secondary is a VGA monitor that is connected to the graphics card with a DisplayPort adaptor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<p>OS - Windows 10 64-bit</p>
<p>CPU - Intel i5-6600k</p>
<p>Memory - 8GB DDR4</p>
<p>Graphics - Geforce GTX 1050 Ti</p>
<p>Storage - 128GB SSD, 1TB HDD @ 5400RPM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried a few things to no avail, any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Under settings&gt;system&gt;display, I am still seeing the proper 1 and 2 setup&nbsp;configuration, and I can still interact with my second monitor, I just can't see anything on it. I am able to move windows around and click things by guessing where to click, but my

<p>Sher,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled my graphics card and made sure to delete the drivers before reinstalling it, but my problem persists. GeForce Experience says that I have the correct driver for my gpu, which is version 390.65 released on 8 January 2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interesting note is that my monitor had shut itself off today when the new driver went up, and during the driver update process the monitor came back on by itself. I am going to use my computer normally for a few days to see if the problem has improved.</p>

<p>In this case, we recommend that you contact your device manufacturer to gather information if there are new release or an updated driver that may fix the issue. This is also to identify what is causing the problem and to determine if this is a hardware related
 concern. Otherwise, you may also refer this to a local technician to check if there is a physical damage on your graphics card including the VGA cable and the display port adapter.</p>

<p>I have an update, but I think that my situation is weirder than I previously thought. I noticed that the monitor blackout issue only occurs&nbsp;when I sat down at my desk, which would indicate a bad connector. I blew my connectors out with compressed air and
 tightened everything up, and I have only had a few sporadic&nbsp;issues since then. The only thing still confusing me is that if it was a&nbsp;connector issue, then why would putting the PC to sleep and then waking it work? I guess I'll never know, but I'll settle for
 the issue to stop.</p>

tried to invoke gpedit.msc but it is apparently not avialable to me<br />

Hi gary weiner,<br />
<br />
There is no gpedit feature in Windows 7 Home premium<br />
<br />
In this case, it is true that terminating the backup and restarting would make the overall backup faster. The issue manifests when the data getting backed up as part of same backup is huge. Breaking the data getting backed up into parts would help alleviate
 the performance issue considerably. Since file backup is inherently incremental, the backup after the previously canceled one would only backup data that was not backed up as part of previous backup.<br />
<br />
It is also true that choosing "Better Performance" over "Quick Removal (default)" also improves the backup throughput. But accidentally removing the external disk (or power shutdown) could cause some of the data backed up to not get persisted to the disk. So
 need to deal with this cautiously.<br />
<br />
You might want to temporarily disable your security software and try again.<br />
<br />
The issue has been identified to occur on systems with large data set size.&nbsp; Please refer to the following post for further details and workaround.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsbackup/thread/1ba794f6-0bac-443b-9e22-5b8f175c69ba" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/windowsbackup/thread/1ba794f6-0bac-443b-9e22-5b8f175c69ba</a>
<br />
<br />
Windows Backup always does compressed backup. As a result backup time will be more when compared to simple file copying. However since the subsequent backups would be incremental, where in only the files that change would get backed up, the subsequent backups
 should be much faster.<br />
<br />
Also, are you including system image backup as part of backup configuration? If so, the data getting backed up would also include the used space in the boot/system volumes<br />
<br />
You may cancel the process by getting into Task manager(Crtl+Alt+Del) &gt;&gt; Processes &gt;&gt; locate and "End Task" and then put your computer in a
<strong>Clean Boot</strong> state and try back up again.<br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
<strong>Follow the below steps to put your computer in clean boot state:</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Note </strong>If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
1. Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
2. Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
3. On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
<br />
4. On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
5. Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
Check the below link for more details on clean boot:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />

 the one month free trial, I already finished making my account, so can I still go back and get it without having to give a credit card or pay pal

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>You can create a PayPal Account for free. However, you can't use your existing account "MAXO17" for the free month anymore.</p>
<p>In order to get the free month you need to create a completely new Gamertag on the console itself, and then use the "Join Xbox Live" option, where you are asked for a Credit Card or a PayPal account.</p>
<p>Since you already have your Live ID email linked to MAXO17, you can't use that email with that new account just now (you can change Live IDs, but it's a long process, and there is a waiting period of 30 days for new accounts
 to change Live IDs)</p>
<p>But look at it that way: Depending on where you buy a prepaid Live Card in stores or online shops, you can get Xbox Live for less than US$3 a month. So it's not really worth the hassle to try and get the free month.</p>
<p>If you're really eager to try the benefits of a Gold Membership, some Games have 48hour codes in the box, so you can try the Multiplayer functions of the game for free. However not all Entertainment offers work with a 48hour
 Gold Membership (as it&nbsp; is not a "full" Gold Membership).</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Sorry, even for the free trials you need to have billing information as well as a credit/debit card or PayPal in order to participate in the trial. There is unfortunately no way around it. You can always go to a retail store and get a prepaid visa card and
 use that with the trial but that would really be the only alternative.<br />
<br />
Since you've already gone away from that screen and created the account it's unfortunately not possible to get back to the 1 month free trial screen. You would need to start a new account with a new e-mail address in order to be able to get the 1 month free
 trial to come up again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player&#58; how do I know what codec I am missing&#63;</h2>
                    How do I know which codecs I am missing? I am trying to watch a webinar, but once it downloads I get a message from my Windows Media Player saying "Windows Media Player cannot play the file because the required video codec is not installed on your computer".&nbsp;
 I tried to download to 2 free updated codec packages, but I keep getting this same error.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There isn't a way to determine the codec used to compress a file with absolute certainty, but the following are your best options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To determine what codec was used with a specific file, play the file in the Player, if possible. While the file is playing, right-click the file in the library, and then click
<span>Properties</span>. On the <span>File</span> tab, look at the
<span>Audio codec</span> and <span>Video codec</span> sections.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Use a non-Microsoft codec identification tool. Several are available on the Internet.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>You might be able to tell the format of a file by looking at the file name extension (such as .wma, .wmv, .mp3, or .avi). However, there are limits to this approach. Many programs create files with custom file extensions. And it's possible
 for anyone to rename a file without changing the file's format. A file with the extension .mpg or .dvr-ms, for instance, is usually just an AVI file that has been compressed by using some version of an MPEG video codec.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X - Something went wrong</h2>
                    I was having some issues today with apps crashing and videos not playing and the tiles on the home menu not loading properly so I decided to use the restart my xbox option and after about 20-30 minutes of a black screen with no discernible progress I decided
 to hold the power button and turn off the console and unplug it for 30 seconds and plug it back in and turn it back on to see if that resolved it. Since doing this, every time I try to turn the console back on I get sent to the something went wrong screen.
 I've been through several different error codes at this point and every time I boot it back up I end up back on this screen. I tried doing the restart option there but that failed and put me right back at the same screen. I tried doing the reset option to
 keep my installed games and apps but that got as far as 2% into preparing before going back to the same screen. I then tried doing the full reset which did the same thing. I tried doing the update from the usb drive as well as th

            It sounds like you went through some basic troubleshooting step, if those have not worked and any of the links with help from the other ambassadors fail. Consider scheduling a possible repair. Is your console still under warranty?
