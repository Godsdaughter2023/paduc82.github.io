</p><p>Just to confirm, your phone disconnects when used as a mobile hot spot only on a specific network?<br />

Were you able to check if the signal is good?</p>

            actually, my laptop disconnects the WiFi, my phone keeps working well and it has signal when I check with another phone.<br />
you know my problem is why my laptop disconnect the WiFi from a specific network and this network is my phone's hot spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
sorry for being late.

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

<p><em>"so i hard reboot my laptop. after that i tried to play league of legends"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you rebooted Windows again via&nbsp;<em> Start Menu &gt; Restart</em> after doing the hard reboot ?</p>
<p>Doing a hard reboot prevents Windows from sorting out settings, etc. so when this is required it's good practice
</p>
<p>to reboot again properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Nvidia recommend you never use Device Manager to uninstall or update your graphics drivers.</p>
<p>Always use the driver provided for download by the mfg of your laptop.</p>
<p>Before installing the driver from the mfg of your laptop, uninstall the current driver via Programs and Features, and</p>
<p>Reboot before installing the new driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you continue getting DirectX errors try repairing .NET. Many DirectX errors that cannot be fixed by reinstalling DirectX are</p>
<p>actually caused by a corrupt .NET install.</p>
<p>The misleading DX error has been a common problem with Win10.</p>
<p>- Repair .NET . </p>

    <title>Why does my horribly slow PC sometimes pop up a Your System Is Low On - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeff a. davis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does my horribly slow PC sometimes pop up a Your System Is Low On Virtual Memory box&#63;</h2>
                    <p>That box says:</p>
<p>Your system is low on virtual memory. Windows is increasing the size of your virtual memory paging file. During this process, memory requests for some applications may be denied. For more information, see Help.</p>
<p>But there isn't any Help button. The only button says OK.</p>
<p>I've tried to Google this and even manually look in some Help sections of things on my Windows XP Tablet PC but I didn't find anything that would help me. So I've come to this site to ask for Help.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this box telling me anything important that I should know? </li><li>Could this possibly be related to how awful this PC acts sometimes?</li></ol>
<p>I've asked a few Questions on this site in the somewhat recent past trying to find out how to make this PC operate better. I think that it has always been a bit too slow and my wife, who is pretty familiar with using computers at home and in her corporate
 job, has always hated this Motion LE1600 tablet PC of mine. I've always used it only as if it's a desktop PC. It is ALWAYS on a desk hooked to a keyboard, mouse, MAXTOR One Touch backup E; drive and an Iomega CD R/W / DVD read only. It is hooked to fast Time
 Warner cable internet thru a router and to 2 printers thru a Dynex ethernet switch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the max ram chip&nbsp;for this&nbsp;tablet&nbsp;that is here at <a href="http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html</a>&nbsp;and I installed it a few months ago and even learned how to have my tablet recognize it and use it. Now this RAM shows up in my system when I right click on My Computer and hit Properties. It says 1.49 GB of RAM
 and it used to say about 1/3 or 1/2 of that since it had a minimal RAM chip&nbsp;to work with the built-in RAM.</p>
<p>So I'm beggng for some personal help here as I would really like to get this tablet PC working much better since it cost me a lot new and I have it set up with lots of nice accessories and programs. I don't consider it to be too old or outdated and it sure
 isn't just some Legend piece. Motion just replaced selling these LE1600's with LE1700's a few months ago on their site and they&nbsp;still obviously support this model and sell drivers and BIOS&nbsp;for it at
<a href="http://www.motioncomputing.com/support/driver_download_1600.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.motioncomputing.com/support/driver_download_1600.asp</a></p>
<p>I've considered lately just shipping it up to their support department to look it over and maybe fix anything that isn't right. But I'd sure rather do that myself with some help from you folks on&nbsp;this site so I wouldn't need to pay for some "repairs" that
 may or may not solve the slowness and could compromise my security with stored passwords etc and also might involve them forcing me into a deal where I'd need to restore programs and docs. My Outlook PST data file is big and I don't want to lose that. And
 My Docs has many old docs and photos of my kids growing up and my NASCAR driving mini-career.</p>
<p>On this PC I will sometimes click on a link on Facebook or on an IE 8 tab and nothing happens for way too long. Sometimes 6 or 8 seconds and sometimes I leave the room and the mouse is still swirling on the same page and nothing has happened. Then I might
 hit the IE Refresh button and it pops Not Responding up in the blue area at the very top of the screen. I also get way too many End Nows when I do&nbsp;a Restart or a Shut Down and I think that I've gotten these on Log Off also.</p>
<p>More bad behavior is that sometimes when I double-click on a file to open it, it will seem as though nothing is going to happen. Sometimes I'd swear that I've waited and waited and nothing ever did happen. Other times I've gotten tired of waiting and did
 it again and then after a while two of the same thing will finally pop open. This happens sometmes when I click the IE or Outlook icon down it the Quick Launch next to the Start button,
</p>
<p>I'd like to say here that even though I can now sort of spit out some of these terms, I am NOT someone who is in any way a person with much knowledge of computers. I've just had to mess around with it a whole lot recently to complete that Clean Install thing
 that Microsoft had me do to solve some issue that me and a bunch of others were having. And I do have a good level of interest in computer stuff. But that's REALLY where it ends. Trust me. Please.</p>
<p>So could I please ask for some help on this?</p>

<p>That box says:</p>
<p>Your system is low on virtual memory. Windows is increasing the size of your virtual memory paging file. During this process, memory requests for some applications may be denied. For more information, see Help.</p>
<p>But there isn't any Help button. The only button says OK.</p>
<p>I've tried to Google this and even manually look in some Help sections of things on my Windows XP Tablet PC but I didn't find anything that would help me. So I've come to this site to ask for Help.</p>
<ol>
<li>Is this box telling me anything important that I should know? </li><li>Could this possibly be related to how awful this PC acts sometimes?</li></ol>
<p>I've asked a few Questions on this site in the somewhat recent past trying to find out how to make this PC operate better. I think that it has always been a bit too slow and my wife, who is pretty familiar with using computers at home and in her corporate
 job, has always hated this Motion LE1600 tablet PC of mine. I've always used it only as if it's a desktop PC. It is ALWAYS on a desk hooked to a keyboard, mouse, MAXTOR One Touch backup E; drive and an Iomega CD R/W / DVD read only. It is hooked to fast Time
 Warner cable internet thru a router and to 2 printers thru a Dynex ethernet switch.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought the max ram chip&nbsp;for this&nbsp;tablet&nbsp;that is here at <a href="http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.memoryx.net/mocolectapcm.html</a>&nbsp;and I installed it a few months ago and even learned how to have my tablet recognize it and use it. Now this RAM shows up in my system when I right click on My Computer and hit Properties. It says 1.49 GB of RAM
 and it used to say about 1/3 or 1/2 of that since it had a minimal RAM chip&nbsp;to work with the built-in RAM.</p>
<p>So I'm beggng for some personal help here as I would really like to get this tablet PC working much better since it cost me a lot new and I have it set up with lots of nice accessories and programs. I don't consider it to be too old or outdated and it sure
 isn't just some Legend piece. Motion just replaced selling these LE1600's with LE1700's a few months ago on their site and they&nbsp;still obviously support this model and sell drivers and BIOS&nbsp;for it at

http://www.motioncomputing.com/support/driver_download_1600.asp</a></p>
<p>I've considered lately just shipping it up to their support department to look it over and maybe fix anything that isn't right. But I'd sure rather do that myself with some help from you folks on&nbsp;this site so I wouldn't need to pay for some "repairs" that
 may or may not solve the slowness and could compromise my security with stored passwords etc and also might involve them forcing me into a deal where I'd need to restore programs and docs. My Outlook PST data file is big and I don't want to lose that. And

Motion Tablets were slow.&nbsp; Honestly, although I give lots of tips on how to speed up a computer, my suggestion would be to replace it with something refurbished and newer (if you still want XP) or just newer *if* you are willing to do the pre-research (before
 buying) and make sure that everything in the new system has a Windows XP supported device driver to use if you put XP on it.</p>

            Naman. I did a Run on your Step 1 and I will now restart my PC and see if this fixed it so this won't ever happen. I sure hope it does. I don't know anything about this technology and I really just want my tablet pc to behave!

            <p>I get so confused when more than one person jumps in. I'm not complaining since I really do appreciate any and all help that I can get but as a user, it can be really&nbsp;difficult and confusing when more that one person jumps in at the same time to offer similar
 things to try that probably overlap with the other person's stuff.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm all lost on this mess. Let me tell you what I did yesterday. I bought and ran both FixCleaner for $40 or so and DriverUpdate for $?. I bought their 3 year or unlimited license 3 computers deal on both and I ran them after they gave me a little
 help since one of them needed some # along with my email address in order for it to be activated and I had somehow never seen that number and couldn't find it anywhere. Those programs both&nbsp;stayed buse&nbsp;and did stuff for several hours.</p>
<p>After all of this was done, I have/had 5 interesting results:</p>
<ol>
<li>My tablet's external monitor was just black but the tablet's screen was still displaying to I had to figure out where to set it to mirror and then to only light up the external monitor so the tablet would stay dark like it had been before all of this.
</li><li>My monitor's display was suddenly much too big on everything so I needed to figure out how and where to adjust that setting so that stuff like Outlook and Facebook on my IE8 would be displayed in small enough text so I didn't need to be constantly scrolling
</li><li>My sound isn't working on my plugged in speakers or on the internal speaker. I just started a new Question on that deal but now I realize that it had to have been related to this and I should have just asked for help in a Reply on this Question.
</li><li>This latest work has my tablet&nbsp;acting much quicker than it has recently. This is GOOD! It seems to log off or Restart without a bunch of End Nows.
</li><li>I know have some new AVG Secure Search page that pops up when I open a new tab in my IE8. I have always seen just a blank page on new tabs even though&nbsp;&nbsp;my homepage is set to go directly to Facebook.</li></ol>

            Part of the problem is "too many cooks." <br />
<br />
Another problem is you are trying to follow advice from Microsoft Support Engineers that have no idea what they are doing. It may sound right, and you may think they would know how XP works, but they DON'T.
<br />
<br />
They don't even know how to spell XP. Fix it? They don't get it. i will LMAO on that one. Relax. Fix one thing at a time. If your system is a piece of ****, it is a piece of **** - and maybe you can't fix it.
<br />
<br />
We know you love it, but how much time have you spent here? If you are pushing it beyond the limits of technology, that's they way it goes sometimes.
<br />
<br />
Here is my suggestion: I will remotely connect into your system, I will call you on the phone and we will actually talk, you will show me the issues and we'll fix them. If it is "too late" for your system because it is outdated, I will tell you so. I've got
 a couple old POS here too. I can fix 'em though. <br />
<br />
Nobody has even asked you fundamental questions.&nbsp; The basics.&nbsp; You are spinning your wheels.<br />
<br />
It is not hard to solve the problems.<br />
<br />
Ask information.&nbsp;&nbsp; Get it.&nbsp; Process it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Figure it out.<br />
<br />
I've been to your office.

<h2>            laptop won&#39;t finish downloads</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>About a month ago, I started having issues where I will be able to download part of a file.&nbsp; Most of the time, I can download 99% of the file, but it will never complete and sometimes will attempt to install the application, app, file, whatever; but will
 fail of course.&nbsp; Sometimes, I will get within 10 kb of a complete download, but it will get stuck.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Again, this is not just the app store.&nbsp; It's anything.&nbsp; videos, programs, music, anything!&nbsp; Even streaming music will "stick" anywhere between 1 and 99% while buffering.&nbsp; I also have some programs installed (not apps) that will attempt to update part of
 their files and will get stuck.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have searched through the web trying to find answers, but most don't have to do with my exact situation, and/or they are an answer to an older op system.&nbsp; This is my last hope.</p>
<p>Here are my specs:</p>
<p>Relatively new HP 2000 (bought in December 2013)</p>
<p>Intel Pentium 2030M 2.5GHz</p>
<p>4 Gb ram</p>
<p>64 bit op system</p>
<p>windows 8.1</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Currently running, as a trial, Norton antivirus</p>

            <p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1. Yes, I added an internet filter named SafeEyes.&nbsp; But I disabled it to see if that helped, and it hasn't helped the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>2. No, I can load webpages fine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>3. I went to tools on internet explorer and made sure downloads were enabled.&nbsp; I disabled for a short time Norton's firewall, and antivirus.&nbsp; But none of this helped the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>4. I primarily use wireless connection.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This is where it gets interesting.&nbsp; I decided to try the easiest approach and that was to use a wired connection, and everything has worked.&nbsp; I was able to download some files that I have been needing for a program I use on the laptop.&nbsp; I was also able to
 listen to streaming music and videos.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even with Norton enabled.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But when I unplug and go wireless again, the problem returns.&nbsp; I am refraining from trying your methods until you can respond to this to see if there's another way to address the issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Brown,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you were able to download files using a wired connection, this could be an issue with weak Wireless signals. Make sure&nbsp; to put your wireless router somewhere where it will receive the strongest signal with the least amount of interference.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still face the issue, then you may try the steps suggested in the previous post and check if it helps. Keep us updated on the status of the issue, I will be glad to help you further.</p>

<p>Yes, me too, I have win10 home, same thing, says installed under control panel list programs &amp; features; shows fail, in the window 10 setting menu under updates, view recent updates....with the same error code. I went thru what it is supposed to fix, tho,
 and some things aren't working any differently(full screen games, apps) still shut down, slow down, etc, this was supposedly one of the fixes,,,so I've still been searching!</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I've had the same problem, and I finally found on the web the solution that worked for me: run as administrator, in the command line, these two commands:<br />
<br />
DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
It worked!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue might be due to corrupted Windows Update components. We recommend that you
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>reset the Windows Update components</strong></a>. Resetting the Windows Update component wipes the slate clean and should cause Windows to begin the update process again. It will check what updates it has, what updates it needs and download and install
 as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to the result.</p>

<p>That's very nice of you, thx for the tech-support. but...hum....</p>
<p>
</p><p>frankly I think that's too much for this tiny issue. Windows is running perfectly fine now, and I think I got this patch already, if I was&nbsp; correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm now caring about is what's gonna happen when the next updates coming (probably next Tuesday). Will I be able to get the next update correctly?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;First it was chrome then a week or so later Excel started doing it.&nbsp; The program open and they show on the task bar if you move the curser over them you can see that the program is open but you can not enlarge the small window the controls for enlarge and
 minimize do not show only an x to close.&nbsp; I do not know of any software changes unless there was an update for something.</p>

</p><p>1. What happens when you click on the small windows&nbsp;of the application, do they maximize?&nbsp;</p>

                    I have been unable to find a USB or Bluetooth GPS module that will work on Windows 8 modern/store/metro app. (There are some that will work with old-style desktop apps.) Can you recommend an add-on GPS receiver that works seamlessly with modern Windows

<h2>            Windows 7 Backup Failure&#58; Error Code&#58; 0x80070002, &#34;The system cannot find the file specified.&#34; &#40;Repeatedly with hitachi portable HD, but no error with WD external HD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday, in frustration at the lack of memory on both my computer and my 1TB external hard drive (I have tons of .CR2 files from photography), I deleted the Windows Backup files from my WD external hard drive (they were taking up more than 200GB of space).&nbsp;
 I planned to start over by saving to a hitachi portable hard drive instead, but I keep getting this error code.&nbsp; I've read and tried the various support topics on the web, but nothing has worked.&nbsp; Finally, I tried again, and successfully ran Windows Backup
 by saving to the original WD external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both hard drives have adequate free space available and both have a NTFS file system, so I do not know what is causing the Windows Backup error when I try to back up to the hitachi portable hard drive?&nbsp; Also - what file is the system actually looking for?</p>
<p>

    <title>New External Mic setup help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denniey  say:</h3>
<h2>            New External Mic setup help</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Toshiba M700 tablet.&nbsp; On the front of it is port for a microphone.&nbsp; When I attempted to record me lectures on the internal built in mic I was unable to hear the professor very easily so I asked
 for a external mic for my birthday.&nbsp; It is a Sony ECM-DS30P Electret Condenser Microphone.&nbsp; The computer shows it is plugged in on Control Panel &gt; Realtek HD AudioManager under the analog option, but I can't get any systems or programs to acknowledge it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The info on Realtek is-- Realtek HD Audo: 6.0.1.5624</p>
<p>Audio Driver Version: 6.0.1.5624</p>
<p>Direct X 10</p>
<p>HD Audo Controller: 6.0.6001.18000</p>
<p>ALC268</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really would appreciate any help, I won't need One-Note this week because my first final is Monday, but I start classes again on the 6th and would like to be able to use the audio record device in
 One-Note so I can take notes while my professors are being recorded (that way I will have my notes, their slides, and audio--I have reading problems so trust me it helps).</p>

            Hi Denniey,<br />
<br />
I am not sure if your Toshiba will automatically use the external mike or whether you will need to press a Fn key to enable it, but here is a link to a Microsoft article on how to verify your microphone settings:<br />

<h2>            Slow connection speeds when I test my network connection</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox 360 network connection test shows my connection running at download speeds of 5.5mbps. &nbsp;I am connected thru WiFi and every other device I have connected to the same wifi network runs at at least 40mbps and my connection speeds i pay for its 100mbps.
 &nbsp;Any suggestions as to why my xbox runs at such slow connection speeds would be much appreciated. &nbsp;I have a slim model. Thanks</p>

<p>Your Network Statistics are your connection to Microsoft's servers. Given the fact that you don't really need to have a 100Mbit connection to Microsoft for any content, it slows down. You'll never get your 'true' internet speeds when connected to Xbox live,
 especially over WiFi. That and the WiFi chip inside Xbox 360s is pretty garbage anyway.</p>

<h3> jinionline  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to WINDOWS 8 REFRESH OR RESET</h2>
                    <p>You needn’t reinstall Windows 8 to fix a majority of system problems you may face from time to time. Instead, you can utilize the 'Refresh' and 'Reset' option. Both the options are reminiscent to the 'Restore
 to Factory Default' option in a mobile device. Whereas the 'Refresh' option preserves your files and installed programs; the 'Reset' option deletes them and takes back you PC to the day it was first purchased. So it’s always advisable to 'Refresh' the PC first
 and keep the 'Reset' option as a last resort. </p>
<p>To choose between these, you need to know about what the actual problem is with your Windows 8 PC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>How to 'Refresh' or 'Reset':
</b></p>
<p>If your computer is working fine you can access these options from the Windows 8 Control Panel or from the classic Control Panel. Otherwise you can access the same from the boot option menu via the PC Settings.</p>

<h2>            Audio not working after 1511 update</h2>
                    <p>When I upgraded to windows 10 I lost my sound. &nbsp;A very nice gentleman from Microsoft ended up taking control of my computer and fixed the problem. Well Microsoft has updated windows 10 to version 1511 and I again have lost the audio. &nbsp;I have tried all the
 things I was told to do when it went off before and nothing works. &nbsp;I have looked in device manager No yellow !. &nbsp;The message say again that no drivers are installed and I have tried to install from all possible sources. &nbsp;Is this going to happen every time
 Microsoft updates?</p>

    <title>Remote Desktop - frequent disconnects - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Remote Desktop - frequent disconnects</h2>
                    <p>I like the Remote Desktop Metro app (I know... it's not Metro... but I don't know what to call it).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is very nice to have it full-screen, and be able to quickly toggle between sessions... or snapped to the side, and see all of my sessions in smaller windows.&nbsp; Very slick.&nbsp; I frequently use it to keep up to 10 persistent connections open.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if I bring another Metro(?) app to the front, frequently when I go back to Remote Desktop, it re-initializes and I have lost all of my connections, forcing me to reconnect.&nbsp; It's pretty disruptive to my workflow to have to randomly go through all
 of my server sessions and reconnect them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts on what might be causing the disconnects, and how to prevent them?</p>

            <p>While looking for options, I found the "Remote Desktop Connection Manager" that is available for download from here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An overview of the tool is available here:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So far, it seems to do a terrific job of managing multiple server sessions.&nbsp; I love that you can organize them into tree hierarchy, and connect/disconnect entire groups of servers at once.&nbsp;
 Thumbnail views are available for each connected desktop.&nbsp; Best of all, you can specify your login credentials just once by setting them on the top of the tree, and everything underneath it will inherit your credentials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is a better option than either the Remote Desktop Connection tool, or the Remote Desktop Windows app.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Wireless Network Adapter</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please help! My wireless network adapter qualcomm atheros QCS61x4A is not working. I tried scan for hardware changes and that did not work. I also tried uninstalling it and then restart my PC. It showed up on device manager but, the WiFi and
 adapter was still not working. I think I accidentally uninstall it on control panel. Does anybody know how to make the wireless network adapter work again so my WiFi can work on my pc?</p>

    <title>Problems with activation of Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> achisto  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with activation of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello guys. This is the first time I'm coming to the forums for help so please excuse any obvious errors I may make. I'll try to be as accurate as possible in my problem description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some days ago I helped a friend of mine upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10. He was running Windows 7 Home Premium OEM:SLP and we made a backup of the Product Key just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we created a DVD with a downloaded .iso and also made a copy of the "<span>GenuineTicket.xml" we had created using "</span><span>diegatherosstate.exe".
 Just upgrading was not a possibility as the Laptop was so **** up with random software that he wanted a clean install.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The install itself went well but I mistakenly selected to install Windows 10 Pro instead of Home. After the install I copied the "GenuineTicket.xml" into "</span><span>C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\ClipSVC\GenuineTicket“,
 started the service via cmd and net start ClipSVC and afterwards restarted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When looking into the registration menu the system is still not showing itself as activated. Instead it tells me an error message with error code 0x803f7001.</span><span>&nbsp;After
 searching through a lot of forums here I stumbled above my mistake with&nbsp;accidentally installing Pro instead of Home, with the only solution being to install Windows 7 again and upgrade to Windows 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So well I headed to the Windows 7 Download page which tells me to enter the product key. Thank god I had saved that before. But somehow the site won't accept that key, telling me it is invalid. After searching the web
 after reasons for this it occurs that it may not work because the key was part of the OEM version and one-use-only.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So now I'm sitting here without any idea what else to do. Windows 10 can't activate itself because of the wrong version, Windows 7 won't accept my key and it seems as there is no way out of this. Although I thought
 I'd be one the safe side with&nbsp;backing up all the needed information before.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I hope you know any help to this problem and maybe also an easy solution I just didn't find yet!</span></p>
