<h2>            PC randomly slowing down after upgrade to 64-bit</h2>
                    Just upgraded to Windows 8 Pro 64-bit from Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit to enable more RAM.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now, I find the PC randomly slows down and I practically cannot carry out any tasks and then 5 minutes later, it goes back to normal. &nbsp;However, after another 5 minutes, this happens again. And so on.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have checked start up processes and practically nothing is running.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Specs are:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 8 Pro 64 bit</div>
<div>Intel Core 2 Duo @ (around) 2GHz</div>
<div>4GB RAM</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi<b> RossPollock,</b></span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Windows Community. I understand that your computer slows down after installing it to Windows 8 operating system.
 Correct me if I am wrong.</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will definitely help you in fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate if you could answer the following question:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Do you receive any error code or message?</span></p>
<p><span>2. Have you made any recent hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Please follow the below methods and check the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the below steps tor Run the Performance Troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press
<b>Windows + W</b> key simultaneously, type <b>
system maintenance</b> in the search tab and hit <b>Enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and check the issue.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to perform Clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:
</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and
 then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>e) On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check
 box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>f) On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window
 under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>g) Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services
 check box.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Service
 list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only
 half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience
 the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing
 the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the Startup
 Item list.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only
 half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still
 experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes
 the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem
 can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Step 7:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps in the below link.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Windows hangs or freezes:</span></b></p>

<h3> fernandogonzalez_3003  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So this is something new to me, "Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart, we're just gathering some error info...." and then there it says "Stop Code: DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL" and underneath that it said "What failed: WDF01000.sys"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this means and it has happened multiple times already. It usually happens when i'm using the program ABLETON LIVE (music production program) and or when I connect the external devices (keyboard, launchpad) to my laptop via USB. I reinstalled
 the program and it still happens, the program is the one the equipment brought and I need it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what causes this, I already cleaned and backed up everything to an external drive. I have a Dell Inspiron 13-7359 Signature edition with 8GB of ram and 256 SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kindly appreciate any help or comment</p>

            <p>Hi Fernando,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Ableton Live is the only program that has been installed prior to the issue, we recommend creating a back up of the files.&nbsp; Then do an uninstall and re-installation the software with administrator privileges. It is also recommended that you check the
 developer's support website to check if they've pushed any updates relating to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have any more questions, feel free to contact us.</p>

<p>I found out that the "dd-MMM-yy" can be a bug(Of course I am not sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the format "dd-MMM-yy" seemed to be the best option.Maybe someone will put this idea in Windows Insider Program.</p>

            The "dd-MMM-yy" format or "dd-MMM-yyyy" is often a way to specify that the month is spelled out completely or may use MMMM. Useful, sometimes necessary. The "dd-MM-yy" produces the abbreviated month.&nbsp; Yes, setting under change Date / Time in Win10, long
 and short version

                    Why oh why do I find dozens of Scrxxxx.tmp type folders with hidden PAC, LOC, BLK, OPT &amp; DAT files, in my temp local file folder; they're small but the idea still pisses me off, after loads of crashes lately, inc the one that erased whole program files,
 that led to the finding of that Flame thing. Has that bloody Lockheed Martin lot (homeland security?), Mosad, UK's GCHQ got inside my PC kit, for no good reason, god-damnit?

            <p><span>HP? Certainly not old chum; I prefer to make it myself, to my own exacting specs, but I ain't a snob. And thanks for asking. As for antivirus and malware, let's just say I prefer a selection,
 as in my varied experience, one trick ponies ain't up to much. And they all read differently, have different categories’, can't standardise for obvious commercial reasons, there'd be no point in plurality, we have to appear capitalistic somehow, good god,
 I'm tired.... And disk cleaner, well it does what it says in the box, bit of a chore; having to sift through ever increasing complexities. It's a wonder none of us are unofficial theoretical physicists by proxy, where's my certificate; that's what I'd want
 to know after years of clean up. And I wouldn't touch so called 'registry cleaners', not even the ones that aren't loaded with you know what for a quick buck, or you complete identity.</span></p>
<p><span>All in all, I just want to know how it is these folders are being created, in bunches of 3-5, contents hidden, small, contain system conditional parameters maybe screen shots, key logging, etc.;
 bit of paranoia for you there. Individual file details report by default they're openable/controlled by MS OS (Windows Shell Common) by or as a default setting. They route; Local disk (?:) /users/profile/AppData(hidden file)/local/Temp/ Scr(nomenclature).tmp
 and the contents I'm concerned about are likewise hidden, the Scr(nomenclature).tmp folder reports 0kb usage, or empty upon mouse over, until one opens the folder to reveal a few Kb is in fact used, but for what is the $60,000 question. Not that there's any
 60 Grand coming from me on any opinion, guesstimate or a resolution. They can be removed quite easily, but what is there function, friend or foe? There is one possible or I don't know, maybe a commercial reason for the things.</span></p>
<p><span>On mouse over as previously stated, they appear to also be the product, property child of or in the employ of ABBYY FineReader, as a ‘document folder; a piece of kit to control a scanner that
 was bundled in with a recent purchase of an Epson All-in-One printer/scanner. But I'm quite sure, if I removed that approximately benign piece of software and relied on win7 scanner defaults, it might not make that much of a difference; reason being mother
 (Windows Shell Common) ship. The reason I think that it is of a concern also is, ABBYY probably isn't the host, there's something in this that is maybe part of the MS Office suite, embedded by MS, by way of an acquisition, or 3rd party; who can say, so it's
 allowed &amp; perfectly OK then? Oh; yes. I expect they're relatively harmless, mostly, at night; mostly (PC asleep, &amp; Aliens allusion there). And like or not if there's ever a million or defined number of them, they'll self-destruct, after phoning home of course;
 nothing's for nothing. No such thing as a coincidence, Dirk gently, holistic gumshoe agent, skewed fuzzy logic, possibly.</span></p>
<p><span>Perfectly sane, we are to believe, some social groups and or individuals are gifted with an ill-defined vague sort of knowledge, or a quite possibly fallacious truism to die for, not the flying
 spaghetti monster, you know the other deities, that need a lot of cash, and worshiping for some odd capricious hedonistic reasons; whilst it (the deity) cares about us so damn much, it'll give us the means to destroy ourselves, and the only place we have to
 live in or on. In easily less than 100,000 years, so some other people say, I'd go with the latter’s opinion, being rational subjectively; but what do I know, what does anyone know. In the face of some humans, or the (special needs) chosen one tribal types,
 who have thermo nuclear devices, to throw about in a Mutually Assured Destructing fashion. Hmm. Or if they don't want to pay a fair price for bananas, cocoa, coffee, oil, or any commodity, really. And at not a reasonably fair rate; and they've an unswerving,
 rapacious ever growing need, to be able to 'fix' a price; and usually for all the rite, or ritual, the wrong, say wrong reasons, people; huh-uh, amen, eye say amen. Anyone following this .... I'm bushed.</span></p>
<p><span>As I mentioned earlier, my concern is more one of the casual collection of personal data in the background anyway, either mischievous, personally invasive, criminal or a bloody liberty an infringement
 of usually taking place, by a ‘big brother’, organisations or governments’; I don't like the idea of that. I have nothing nefarious to hide principally, no previous criminal, anti-social, sociopathic murky or disgusting behaviours; but there's a principle
 we all should hold dear. Keep out, of what may not be of any interest to anyone but the individuals' privacy. Shop loyalty cards are about as far as I'm prepared to go on that score; we have to abide by what’s turning out to be mostly bent bankers, governments,
 legal enforcers and the lawmakers. Isn't it about time the clock was turned back a little on the ‘I know where you live’ culture/pastime for fun &amp; profit; or plain malicious practises that, kind of started with Richard Milhous Nixon, though you can be sure
 it was occurring well before then anyway; but not on to recent scales.</span></p>
<p><span>The thing that bothered me was, whilst looking for a universal file opener, ha-ha, seriously folks; I found out on Wiki, the innocent .OPT file type was conjured up by some organisation, originating
 in the lumber/paper industry, and is now after several mergers, take overs, etc. The property of a
<strong><span>LexisNexis Group</span></strong>, all very split infinitively prosaic but they handle data, legal data for - you name the price, I'd guess, big money or social control protocols to consider outfits (agencies,
 covert or otherwise). So, thing could well be a MS acceptable commercial legislative global interests, necessity; otherwise malware invisible invasion, on behalf of ? exactly; riddle me that. All I do is stream TV shows, movies I pay for, several news outlets,
 no independent journalism, complain some, and do a bit of shopping; in between meals, bodily functions and sleep; if I'm lucky at my age; bloody neighbours, et al. So, guys; hope this pastiche wasn't just some politico agitprop rant for you all; it's been
 real, usually is stuck out in the wilds of wherever it is I reside. Happy trails, rants and stuff to one and all.</span></p>
<p><span>And thanks, PalcouK; for a rapid response, noted. Cheers chap, make a difference; I know I used to, whenever. Doesn't cost to, be real, does it. ^-^ Ciao, baby sitters. Keep your ends up, where?
 That’s up to you, none of my bees' wax, just like it should be, there a summation..... Not brief, … ta-taa.</span></p>
<p><span>PS. And well done if you did read it, all; and remember, there are no quick and easy answers. Only 2 things are certain in life, death &amp; taxes.</span></p>

<h2>            Remote Desktop Connection - Network Level Authentication</h2>
                    Hi Folks, hope you can help!<br />
<br />
I have a laptop running vista business and a desktop running vista ultimate.&nbsp; On my desktop I have enabled remote desktop access and can rdp onto the desktop from the laptop when the middle radio button is selected "Allow connections from computers running
 any version of Remote Desktop"... however... I would obviously like to use Network Level Authenication to be more secure as I am accessing the desktop using my laptops wireless connection.<br />
<br />
When I try to do this, I get the usual message saying that "The remote computer requires Network Level Authentication, which my computer does not support".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Interestingly enough, when I try it the other way (from the desktop to the laptop) I do have access!
 How come?&nbsp; I've checked the windows features that are installed and they seem to be the same...

<blockquote>Hello again,<br />
<br />
I have double checked everything and both machines as set up identically (as far as RD is concerned).&nbsp; Both machines now have a user account called RemoteDesktop with a password, both machines are set to 'Warn me' and both machines are on the same workgroup.&nbsp;
 Just seems very odd to me.&nbsp; If one of the pcs didn't support NLA then it shouldn't work at all so it makes no sense that it works&nbsp;one way and not the&nbsp;other.<br />
<br />
That being said, <strong>what are the risks of running a lower level on a home network?&nbsp;</strong> The network is secure (or as secure as it can ever be) so what&nbsp;are the differences between the two settings?</blockquote>
<br />
Over your home LAN I would not be worried about this issue. Its pretty hard to fake an address on the network under your control particularly if your behind a router (with a firewall function) and your wireless network is properly secured. I would however required
 High encryption and always prompt the client for a log in password.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/RemoteDesktop/RDP6ConfigRecommendations.html#host" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/RemoteDesktop/RDP6ConfigRecommendations.html#host</a>
<br />
<br />
FWIW I routinely connect to my wife's XP Pro desktop and a Windows Home Server with Remote Desktop [RDC] from a Vista Ultimate or Win7 RC1 or Ubuntu laptop. Neither of those support NLA in a RDC host/server mode. The Ubuntu laptop does not support NLA in RDC
 client mode.<br />
<br />
With that said is the client that's failing configured like this? I believe this is the default condition.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/RemoteDesktop/RDP6-09.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/RemoteDesktop/RDP6-09.jpg</a>
<br />
<br />
Also, just for information's sake what does the failing client show as far as supporting NLA. The built-in Vista client should indicate it does.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/ea4680d1-6962-463b-b29b-351efa676f9e1033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/ea4680d1-6962-463b-b29b-351efa676f9e1033.mspx</a>
<br />
<br />
I presume your running SP1 or SP2 on the Vista client that is failing and have not tried to download and upgrade the Remote Desktop client.<br />
<br />
There is also this rather long thread that may be of interest. Not exactly your issue but interesting none the less. Bottom line is to make sure the date/time is correct on all machines. There is also a procedure to delete the host/server certificate which
 you might do as a test.<br />

<p>Hi JDemart,</p>
<p>You probably have either a corrupt hibernation file or low disk space and thus a corrupt hibernation file. &nbsp;And I am guessing that you've put it into Hibernation (or it has automatically gone into Hibernation) and now it's coming up with this error.</p>
<p>To completely turn off your laptop, hold down the power button for about twenty seconds. &nbsp;Now turn the laptop on and it should go into Windows.</p>
<p>Now read this article:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907477" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/907477</a></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 issues with ASUS tablet&#47;Memory card reader</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have issues with connecting an ASUS ME102A Tablet. (Android) </p>
<p>Though it should be detected as an MTP device, after plugging in to the USB, nothing happens.</p>
<p>After reading a bunch of posts online and trying to troubleshoot, for one instance i could make it happen, but during the file copy phase, the device had been "dropped".</p>
<p>-I started with troubleshooting startup, with "disable driver signature enforcement"</p>
<p>-I've installed some patches referred as solutions here at MS community for similar problems</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be connected to the other I have, when plugging on my Hama 35 in 1 card reader to copy the contents of my 1GB micro SD card,&nbsp; when I'm starting to copy my files, it becomes incredibly slow, then "access denied - disable write protection"
 message appears, even when I'm the admin, and certainly there's no write protection on my hard drive. (Nor on the card itself)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking about usb driver root cause on both problems, but I need a tech expert to help at this point, as I'm stuck here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Dear Kalpana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clarification: I'm running W10 pro 64-bit on a desktop PC, and trying to connect an android ASUS tablet</p>
<p>
</p><p>What i did since: (only tried with the tablet)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Failed. HW troubleshooter did not find the device.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Failed. Asus provides the driver as a .rar, with .ddls, and .inf files. I've found the device in device manager among the "hidden devices" as inactive. When tried to update the driver, it said that the MTP driver is the latest.
 Then I removed the device, hoping that plugging in after will help the system to start from scratch and find it, but nothing happened.</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:&nbsp;</strong> I had an update a few days before. I can't get the Anniversary Update, because it says it needs 20 GB additional space that I don't have on my system drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to troubleshoot if the tablet connectivity has some (hw) issues, and connect the tablet to an old pc with XP on it, and get back. I'll also try with the memory card reader as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly. </p>

<p><span><span>Check to make sure the fan is running and that the intake and exhaust vents are completely clear - overheating is a common cause of this issue.&nbsp; After that, it's a matter
 of troubleshooting to find the cause and perhaps even the solution at the same time.&nbsp; This is long, but there are many reasons this could be happening and unless you just want to take it into a computer repair shop for service (that's your decision), then
 these are the options to try in the order presented (though you can skip around a bit if you like - I'd just avoid the last several until you've tried the others.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive
 and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shtdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp;
 Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, then it is most likely a hardware problem
 and you need to take the system to a reputable computer repair shop for service.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Casting - Mirror screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to mirror my HP Laptop screen to a Sony BDP-S3700 Blu Ray player (connected to my TV).&nbsp; I'm running Windows 10 (I copy/pasted some system info below, bnot sure it will help) and I've updated all the drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop finds the blu ray player just fine, but when I try to connect, the laptop screen goes blank.&nbsp; The TV screen shows that the connecting is being made, then it too goes blank.&nbsp; That's it.&nbsp; I left it go for 15+ minutes, nothing changes.&nbsp; I have to
 press the power button, or turn off WiFi to get the screen back.&nbsp; Then the TV screen goes back to the blu ray home page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim </p>

</p><p>First of all, I have Windows 10 and the article you sent a link to states: </p>

</p><p>Also, when I swipe to the right there is no Devices tab to select.</p>

<p><span>That could be normal.&nbsp; Have you used this connection before?&nbsp; E.g. that would happen if the second screen was designated primary and the Display properties were Second Screen Only.&nbsp; Otherwise, make sure that the Display properties are Duplicate
 before attempting to Connect.&nbsp; Then it won't matter if the laptop's screen is not primary.&nbsp; Also, it is a good idea to have Narrator running anyway when you are trying to work with things that you can't see.&nbsp; Press Win+Ctrl+Enter to start Narrator.</span></p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>That sounds more like a problem on the TV side.&nbsp; Did the Duplicate cause a screen refresh?&nbsp; In order to get another one you would need to use the Project dialog to make a change (say Win+P CursorDown Enter to switch to Extend).&nbsp; You can even force Second
 Screen Only but be aware that you would be given a Keep this? prompt that you would have to respond to rather quickly; press Tab, Enter to do that without seeing the prompt if you like.&nbsp; Provided Narrator stays working you can keep control and recover with
 more commands which either disconnect the virtual display or do something else to refresh the display. &nbsp; Otherwise try pressing Win+Ctrl+Shift+B&nbsp; (more than once may be necessary with psychic pauses between retries).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have that tool any more.&nbsp; Surface support removed it long ago as part of an update.&nbsp; In any case I doubt that you are using the right tool for W10 FCU.&nbsp; Use Display Properties&nbsp; (right-click on the Desktop or Run... ms-settings:display).&nbsp; Note that
 if your laptop screen is not primary everything will be opening on the other monitor but you can always bring it back to your laptop with Win+Shift+CursorRight.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I imagine so.&nbsp; I have been having a problem with my HDMI connection since the last update such that the only workaround I have found is each time to reinstall the drivers using the Update driver command and pointing to the ones that&nbsp;W10 already knows about.&nbsp;
 I would guess that you could do the same thing with any other drivers that you had installed too.&nbsp; I am almost ready to try the same thing for my case but in my case my MWDA is working OK as a backup.&nbsp; That would be analogous to your BlueRay connection, which
 is another reason why I wonder if you could have a problem on the TV side.</p>
<p>

<h2>            How to factory reboot Toshiba laptop&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Hello, Im trying to do a factory restore of my Toshiba M205-S4806, and it won't work. &nbsp;I'm going to give the laptop to my son thats why I want to start fresh with it. &nbsp;It has been loading very slow from the "Toshiba Leading Innovation" screen. &nbsp;When I try to
 do the "0" from restart to initiate the reboot, it'll take forever to get past that screen, then it'll ask for my pw and continue into windows normally. &nbsp;I have no idea how to do a reset otherwise. &nbsp;I don't have any Windows disks whatsoever. &nbsp; It is current;y
 running Windows Vista

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>See if you can make your own Recovery disks from the Toshiba Recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to create recovery media to be used to reset your computer back to factory settings?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>You can&nbsp;borrow and use a&nbsp;Microsoft Vista DVD (Retail or OEM System Builders License)&nbsp;, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop
 case&nbsp;determines which Edition is installed. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The COA sticker is either on the underside of the Laptop or in the Battery Compartment.</p>
<p>With a Desktop it is either on the side, rear or top of the Computer Case.</p>

</p><p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>

            Hi Audrey
<br />
<br />If that icon is turned on as explained above and yet it does not appear on your Taskbar, this is caused by a known bug in Windows 10, try this fix:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Expand the Batteries section
<br />
<br />For each device in that section:
<br />
<br />Right click and choose Disable
<br />
<br />Then right click and choose Enable
<br />
<br />Close Device Manager

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different possible steps that we can utilize to achieve your objective of removing Skype from the startup menu. An example would be to use the built-in option in the application to prevent automatic startup. For us to resolve your concern, kindly
 follow the steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026268/windows-change-startup-apps-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to change or remove startup applications in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response once you complete the steps.</p>

    <title>USB Microphone Driver Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julianmartin2  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Microphone Driver Error</h2>
                    <p>To preface this all I own a Samson Meteor Mic, nothing too fancy just plugs in with USB and a usb micro into the microphone. I've had this for likely about a year and a half to two years. Always worked great and never had any issues. Got a new job and ended
 up not being able to play games with pals and talk but recently had some time to do just that. Plugged in the microphone but it wasn't showing up in the input devices. Did some digging around and saw it was having an issue when I looked at it in the Device
 Manager. More specifically it was having an error with the drivers. After three days of trying to figure out how to get the drivers to work while also trying to work with Samson but not being able to find anything about the same situation I've given up. I've
 plugged it into my wive's computer and it works fine. Went to Wal-Mart and picked up some lousy BlackWeb USB desktop microphone and lo and behold same issue. Whenever trying to force the drivers even with attempting to force it with the actual drivers intended
 for the device in winsxs. The only thing that I can possibly say is different from my computer from before the hiatus and after is the motherboard and two additional hard drives(the original hard drive is still installed). I had a MSI motherboard (forgot what
 model) but I now have a ASRock Z270 Killer motherboard installed. I've tried to see if it possibly was a BIOS setting as I do have a setting for supporting USB legacy mode but it made no difference. I've attempted many different things such as manipulating
 the driver folder with new drivers from my wife's computer to just basic using the troubleshooter and have had absolutely no progress. When it comes to the error Windows gives me when attempting to download drivers (this error shows no matter what I try to
 do for installing the drivers) it's</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows encountered a problem installing the drivers for your device</p>
<p>Windows found drivers for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>USB Audio Device</p>
<p>One of the installers for this device cannot perform the installation at this time.</p>
<p>If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit their website and check the support section for drivers"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10. I'm just at a loss for what could be causing this issue, and would greatly appreciate some steps in the right direction.</p>

            Last night attempted to do a system restore and kept getting an error code of 0x80070003, did some searching and used the windows update troubleshooter which indeed worked. Windows update did its thing and I went to bed. Woke up this morning attempted
 to log into my user and was getting an error of profile not configured properly or something of the sort. Restarted computer and was able to log on, but windows stayed at a screen that just said configuring profile or windows, can't remember which. Logged
 on and I entered what I could only assume is like a fresh install of Windows. All of my documents are gone but my programs that were installed are still present. Plugged in my microphone and bam it installed right off the bat and is being recognized and is
 functioning. Only question I have left is, is there any way to pull my documents back from wherever they've disappeared to?

<h2>            Xbox Music Playlists on Xbox 360 limited to 100 songs</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using xbox music for a while and have created many playlists. &nbsp;Suddenly I can only access the first 100 songs in any playlist. &nbsp;For example, I created a playlist with 982 songs and was able to play it in its entirety for weeks. &nbsp;Now, even though
 it still says there are 982 songs available, I can only see and play the first 100 &nbsp;I added to that playlist&nbsp;when I select the playlist and choose Show Songs. &nbsp; This goes for all of my playlists over 100 songs. &nbsp;If I create a new playlist, I can add up to
 1000 songs to it, but only the first 100 appear when I choose Show Songs. &nbsp;When I play the playlist, it only plays the first 100 as well.</p>
<p>I have deleted the application data for Xbox music from my Xbox 360 hard drive but this has not solved the problem. &nbsp;Please provide a solution or I will be forced to cancel my xbox music pass.</p>

<p><strong>The "1000" song limit is lame</strong>. &nbsp;On the PC, Media Player-derived playlists do not have that limit. &nbsp;I don't know what the limit is; I have over 1000 in my playlist and it barely scratches 4 days of no-repeat pop music. &nbsp;However I cannot export
 that list to my Windows Phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yesterday a guy at the Windows Store told me how I could create compatible Playlists by using
<em>a completely arbitrary number</em> (and who really programs 2^10 limits anyways?)... I suggest we at least upward adjust to 2^12 which would give us 4X more songs.&nbsp; Frankly I am puzzled why these limits exist in the first place.&nbsp; Who decides 1000 songs
 is all we're worth?&nbsp; If I were King I'd give the People what they want.&nbsp; Let us be free to choose our limits.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you are getting SMART errors on boot then the hard drive, the hard drive controller, or the cabling has a problem. Check with the hard drive maker for test methods.<br />
<br />
Enter the Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) on boot-up (often F2 so watch the screen as you start the computer).<br />
See if you can turn off SMART there - you may need to check with the System/Motherboard Maker's Support, Documentation, and Forums.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

<h2>            Skype for Business - Conversation timestamp format incorrect</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,<br />
<br />
I have an issue with my Skype for Business and we do not know how to solve it.<br />
As you can see on the screenshot I attached, the display of the timestamp is really weird. First time seeing that.<br />
<br />
How can I update this to get the classic hh:mm in the conversation window?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for the help.<br />

            Hi 
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. 
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. 
<br />
<br />As a first troubleshooting I would suggest to reinstall Skype for Business, that usually solves issues such as the one you describe. :-)
<br />
<br />As a additional note : Questions regarding Skype for Business are more likely to be answered faster in the  Skype for Business specific forum.  I would recommend post this question in that forum as well as they have experts who are specialized in that version of Skype :). This way you can get help from experts from both forums :). <a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/skype-for-business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/skype-for-busi...</a>
<br />
<br />Thank you, have a great week! 
<br />Margarida

<p>I'd like to preface this by saying that I have already contacted apple support and gone through some steps to fix this with them to no avail and they're saying to see if it's an issue
 with the app, so here I am.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I have recently gotten an iPad Air 2 and I've noticed a pretty glaring issue which I didn't have with my previous original iPad 2. When
 I'm calling on certain calling apps such as skype and then play a video, the quality of the sound of the video is just awful, however quality of the call itself is still fine. And when I say worse, I mean drastically worse than when not on call. The thing
 is that it's actually fine when I call from google hangouts but I don't want to use that calling app since the quality of the calls isn't up to par with skype. Basically what I want to know is why my 6 year old iPad 2 can handle this sound stuff, but this
 iPad Air 2 cannot on some apps. I've tried with different sets of headphones and I still have the exact same issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Is there by chance any known issue regarding something that sounds like what my issue is?</span>Any tips or pointers in the right direction
 would be greatly appreciated, thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you're engaged in a Skype call and play a video or music, Skype will prioritize the call and the ongoing music can only be heard in the background. It's possible that because of this new feature in Skype the sound on your videos are awful. But to further
 check on this, please follow these steps and let us know if the issue persists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstall Skype.</li><li>Restart your device</li><li>Re-install Skype and make sure there are no other application that is running in the background.</li><li>Sign in to your account and make a test call then try to play a video or music.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your reply.</p>

            i have done this and the issue still persists. i tried it for both skype for iphone and ipad and the same thing happened when testing this. i understand your theory above and i believe it to be the issue.

<p>Windows 8.1 upgraded to 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me, my taskbar has not been fully functionally for the past month and I need a solution. &nbsp;Every time I open store, it just closes without reason. I'm connected to the internet also. Some apps will work like Groove Music, and some downlaoble apps
 I installed before this happened could have any control, so when i click on keys on the keyboard to control what i need to do the whole program goes ballistic of does things I never clicked any key to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>METHODS I TRIED:</p>
<p>sfc/scannow (nothing needed to be fixed or no corrupt files which was weird)</p>
<p>Clean Boot</p>
<p>Advanced Options with Safe Mode</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a problem with the Built in Mic as well When I right click on my speaker icon to recording devices, i see the green bar next the Microphone go up, go down, and stays down. &nbsp;I got a separate mic to use for the laptop with worked but later on stopped
 working. I don't know if its my computer or the Mic itself. &nbsp;Now I have a program called "Tech Genie" de-fragging my whole C: Disk drive and recovery drive. &nbsp;</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are
</span><span>facing issues with windows 10.</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Step: 1 Open the Task manager.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here’s a tip:<span>&nbsp; </span>
Press CTRL+Shift+ESC. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step: 2 Click File &gt; Run New Task </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step: 3 Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step: 4 Type PowerShell </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step: 5 Type the following in the PowerShell prompt:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step: 6 Close the PowerShell window </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step: 7 Reboot</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Run System File Checker scan and check if there are any system files missing or got corrupted.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Summary</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>System file check is a utility built into the Operating System that will check for system file corruption the sfc /scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces
 incorrect, corrupted, changed, or damaged versions with the correct versions where possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>System file check works on Vista, Win 7, Win 8, Win 8.1, and win 10&nbsp;<strong>
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I suggest you to try the&nbsp;steps provided,&nbsp;in the link below in order to run SFC scan on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Method 3</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To resolve this problem, use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then click Search. Type Command
 Prompt in the Search box, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following command, and then press Enter.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running
 Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD, as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead:
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:</span><var><span>C:\RepairSource\Windows</span></var><span> /LimitAccess</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Note</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Replace the
</span><var><span>C:\RepairSource\Windows</span></var><span> placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference
</span></span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Repair a Windows Image</span></span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Close the command prompt, and then run </span>
<strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong><span> again.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed. For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi Ava,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the issue specific to Outlook, Firefox, and File Explorer? Also, were there any recent changes made on the system prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I suggest that you run the troubleshooter for Windows apps to help us detect errors that might be causing the problem. You may run the troubleshooter from
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this article</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, start your PC in safe mode with networking, and then try to replicate the issue. To start your PC in safe mode:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on <strong>Start</strong>, and then <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; security</strong>, and then go to <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>startup</strong>, click on <strong>Restart
</strong><strong>now</strong>.</li><li>After the PC restarts to the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot </strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt; <strong>Startup</strong>
<strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</li><li><span>After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. </span><span>Select
<strong>5</strong> or <strong>F5</strong> for <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Kindly update me on the results.</span></p>
