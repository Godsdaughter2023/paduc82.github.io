=============================================<br />
Just a suggestion.<br />
<br />
Personally, I find the best way for me to create an AutoCollage<br />
is to copy all the photos I wish to use in the Collage into a New <br />
Folder and then access that New Folder from AutoCollage.<br />

            <p>Thanks, I do that to select the photos I want to use and to limit the photos to 50.&nbsp; It also helps when you redo the collage which can result in a different collage.

<p>I can tag each person in the collage only once&nbsp; and I would like to tag the same person each time they appear.&nbsp; For example if I included my and my siblings at different ages I would like to tag each time.</p>

Once the collage is saved as a single photo you could import <br />
it into Paint and add additional text to the face of the photo.<br />

<h2>            Rayman Legends won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t download&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><br />
I installed Rayman Legends on disc about a year ago on my internal drive.<br />
<br />
I got it for free with GWG digitally now. While it was installing on my external drive, I deleted the physical copy on my internal. But somehow, it deleted the external copy instead..
<br />
<br />
And now, when i launch the game, it says...<br />
<br />
Please try again<br />
<br />
Sorry, that didn't work for some reason. (0x80070002)<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP!<br />
<br />
I can't reinstall the game because instead of downloading the game, it just says play which instead just relays me to the error you see above.</p>

</p><p>If you search online for <em>WMC alternative</em> or similar then you will find lots of free applications for this.&nbsp; I tried a few but could not get them working properly [although countless others have done so as you'll discover in your search].</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought and installed <a href="http://www.dvbviewer.com/en/index.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
DVB Viewer</a> to watch &amp; record TV with my external TV tuners.&nbsp; It is easy to get used to and it works very well.&nbsp; I have used it with Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10.&nbsp; I understand that the price has recently increased to €20 and I think it is worth
 every penny.</p>

<p><span>Video Buffering</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<span>﻿If videos you’re watching over the internet are buffering (stopping and starting) that means the video isn't being sent to your computer fast enough. This can be because of a slow internet connection,
 sharing the connection with multiple computers, or if you are also downloading other files at the same time.<br />
<br />
On some sites you can lower the video quality of a video - example: near the bottom right of the YouTube player you can select 240p, 360p, 480p, etc. The lower the number the less likely it is to buffer. If the video still buffers you may need a faster internet
 connection.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
&nbsp; <br />
</p>

<p>
When bandwidth is not the issue, sometimes completely uninstalling Flash player, then reinstalling the newest version of Flash can help:

<h2>            Bitlocker drive is suddenly locked, and the Key is not in my MS Skydrive</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone - &nbsp;About 4 days ago I added Bitlocker to my 3rd drive. &nbsp;There was about 100GB of data already on it, and it's a data only drive. &nbsp;I selected the setting to have it unlock automatically when I boot the PC and the main drives unlock (all three
 drives have Bitlocker and are set to auto-unlock), and also selected to upload the key to Skydrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been fine since then and I've used the drive constantly, but all of a sudden this morning the drive has the gold lock in Explorer and is saying it's locked. &nbsp; When I right click and tell it to Unlock Drive, it asks me to enter the security key - there's
 no prompt for me to enter my password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my Skydrive and the tried the 2 keys stored there but neither match the ID and neither work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never saved the key anywhere else as I assumed that the upload would of work, it should be the same key as the other drives, and anyway I know the password and can fully log on. &nbsp; This issue only occurs on this third drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what's happened here ? &nbsp;and how can I recover ?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks John, I formatted the SSD last night and of course lost everything. &nbsp;While anything critical was backed up, I now have to spend hours and bandwidth re-downloading and reinstalling gigabytes of programs and data. &nbsp;This is heavily frustrating as this
 is NOT due to user error but 2 major but basic issues that really need to be addressed by MS regarding Bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1 - I did backup the key - Bitlocker gave the option of backing up to my MS account, I selected this and it told me it had. &nbsp;Turns out it didn't, even though it gave no error messages or any indication that it did anything except what it was supposed to
 do. &nbsp; Looking at a few forums this is clearly not an isolated event. &nbsp; I trusted MS and Bitlocker to do what it says it's doing, and it failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2 - The reason this happened in the first place is something that took me hours of net trawling to even begin to find out - Edrive SSD Hardware encryption. &nbsp;I'd never even heard of it until yesterday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My OS SSD is not Edrive compatible. &nbsp;My new data SSD is. &nbsp; Bitlocker defaults to Edrive hardware encryption if a drive is capable and does not even give an option or any indication of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if the OS drive is using standard software encryption, then selecting "Auto Unlock This Drive"as the new drives unlock method does NOT work on the Edrive compatible drive, even though the option is there and again there are no error messages to
 tell otherwise. &nbsp; As soon as I forced Bitlocker to use standard software based encryption like my OS drive I could auto-unlock as normal (after I had reformatted of course). &nbsp;Again I trust a company like MS to do what it says, and again it hasn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all I was trying to do was use the built in MS feature of Bitlocker on a new drive - something that until now has been hassle free. &nbsp;Thanks to problem 2, the drive then locked and wouldn't unlock unless I entered my backup key, and thanks to problem 1
 I had no backup key and therefore had to lose everything. &nbsp; &nbsp;This is NOT user error - there were no warnings anywhere or even any indication that either of these occured/would occur.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last frustration - There is almost no documentation anywhere on edrive or compatibility unless you know what you are looking for - I randomly came across the term by accident on some tech-heavy blog reviewing my SSD's capability. &nbsp;Prior to this I'd spent
 hours wiping keys, decrypting and recrypting, re-formatting the new drive and various other "fixes" that did nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the drive's are incompatible - fine, but have some pop up tell me this in advance so that I can take extra steps and at least know what's causing it instead of hours of net trawling. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are going to do something as critical as back up my security keys to my drive, then surely put something in the code that checks this has actually happened - it shouldn't be up to me not trusting you enough that I go and check.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            The Xbox One Has Been A Disappointment So Far</h2>
                    
<p>I purchased a PS4 and then a Wii U and finally a X1 last night.</p>

<p>I have always been a Xbox person, however after having a PS4 for a few months, the Xbox One was like a step backwards.</p>

<p>Firstly, the thing sreaches loudly like a PC CPU does, which is very off putting...</p>

<p>Secondly, it cant download / install multiple games at a time like the PS4 can, which then maxes out my 120 Mb internet connection.</p>

<p>Thirdly, when the Xbox One does download / install, it takes FOREVER.</p>

<p>I downloaded the same fifa demo on PS4 and X1, wired via ethernet, one at a time, and the PS4 did it in under a few mins while the Xbox One took considerably longer.</p>

<p>It seems the roles have been reversed, the PS3 was very slow downloading + installing with the 360 being quicker.</p>

<p>Now the opposite.</p>

<p>Also, everytime you download something, the Xbox One "screen flashes" for a second or two, doesnt seem seamless to me...</p>

<p>Also the dashboard with the tiles is a mess, nothings fluid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The store is very badly designed, it doesn't even have a section for "games with gold" and everything is just grouped together...</p>

<p>The settings menu is very poor to and having to restart the Xbox to change the console name is just silly.</p>

<p>The whole friends menu is also clunky and doesn't take advantage of a large TV, its just in face and a pain to navigate...</p>

<p>All in all, Microsoft have gone backwards with this machine, its slow, clunky, the controller feels very cheap, especially around the Xbox logo and so it wasn't a very good first experience.</p>

<p>Number 1. thing is to address the very slow downloads and install times, and the fact it cant do multiple downloads...</p>

<p>If your console is screeching (from fan noise?) get it replaced before the warranty expires. My downloads have been very speedy, and I often can start playing very quickly while still downloading. For me, there has always been a dedicated tile for GWG on
 the home menu before going into the store. Sorry you are not liking it, may not be for you.</p>

<p>Yeah, first of all, Xbox One does not 'screech'. If yours is screeching, replace it.</p>
<p>Second of all, there is literally no benefit to downloading 3 things at once unless you plan to use all 3 before any one of them actually finishes downloading. Xbox can queue them all up and the total time to download 3 things at once versus 3 in a row is
 almost the same.</p>
<p>Third, it's fairly common for computers of all types to restart after being renamed. I have no idea why you think that's silly.</p>
<p>Also, there is a section for Games with Gold. It's on the homescreen. Right on the bottom right. I get the feeling you have spent more time writing about your disappointment then actually spending time on your Xbox One. Yeah, it's not the 360. We get it.
 Been discussed about a million times.</p>
<p>Get your Xbox replaced, use it for more than a day, and then start a thread about your impressions.</p>

<p>Have had mine a few months and have not had any issues with it at all. All I hear is a quiet hum and the internal hard drive booting. It is alot quieter than my Xbox 360 slim. If yours is making weird sounds I would follow everybody advice here and get it
 replaced. The interface is okay and feels less cluttered but bare at the moment. The only issue I seem to have is it tells me that I have a new message but there isn't one. Installing games is a long process via disc due to the blue ray drives data transfer
 speed, I just disconnect it to the internet, install from disk and leave it too install. This stops the title updates from slowing down the process. Then when ready I let the update install separately. It has its flaws and is far from perfect but it is slowly
 improving and getting better. &nbsp;My only concern is the massive game updates some of the games have. Not everybody can afford massive download plans.

<p>It shouldn't screech. Xbox 1 is suppose to be whisper quiet you shouldn't hear it if you're sitting like 2-4 metres away. Maybe a fault turn it in for warranty (comes with a 12 month warranty).
</p>
<p>I love the controller. Although it may feel cheap in some areas like the RB and LB buttons a bit plasticy, the controller does not feel like a behemoth compared to the wireless controller for my Xbox 360 slim console or to the Xbox 1 console itself. The
 analogue sticks are a joy for me they move very fluid. But the controller does have an over reactive vibration motor(s) built inside it.
</p>
<p>As for download speeds, my house has ADSL Broadband averaging 8MB/s down and 0.9MB/s up (this is normal speeds for standard ADSL Broadband speeds). However from my experience downloading is faster on Xbox 1 than on my Xbox 360 slim 250gb console. Downloading
 a 1.2GB update file for 360's TDU2 I did months ago, took me just over 2 hours to complete. But downloading such files on Xbox 1 doesn't take anywhere that long. Even my ping is high around 200ms only cuz Australia and NZ... are the furtherest countries from
 the US servers. </p>
<p>As for the Dashboard I agree not everyone likes it. But M does release updates to improve it. I've had it since Launch and they've made several improvements. Dashboard is faster to navigate with only the controller since launch, Dolby sound support, external
 HDD support, recent players list added, battery indicator added. And the Kinect is awesome can use it to voice chat, voice commands, video chat, play certain games, and easily read Xbox QR codes. The fact that they've made many changes since launch and policy
 reversals regarding Kinect and 24 hour mandatory online checks, they've even created an official feedback site, means M is listening to feedback. They are not a heartless company who don't care about their members.

<p>I have none of these issue what-so-ever. &nbsp;Might be a bad re seller that sold you a faulty machine, or bad internet or something else.</p>
<p>I run a 150/20 connection and have no issues. &nbsp;My only complaint so far is I wish I could choose what side of the screen I want my snapped apps on.</p>
<p>Xbox One is new, there is another update coming out soon, and I am very looking forward to what Xbox has in store for the future.</p>

<p>Assuming you're not trolling, exchange the console you just bought at your retailer for a replacement. The Xbox One system is virtually silent. If you're hearing screeching, something is wrong.</p>
<p>Once you have a replacement, try again.</p>

                    How do I search for a keyword in a file name? All my file names are in po format and begin with several numbers previous to the actual name. Often I am looking for a picture file for a job who's name I recall, but not their exact PO, and end up having
 to search manually with the scroll bar through a hundred files. Is this something I can change? Is there a way to search for a keyword from the file name, instead of beginning with the first character of the file name? Or is this just not an option for how
 Windows10 was set up? It would help make my life so much easier if it were possible to search keywords through the Cortana search bar, or even more so through the File Explorer search bar.

<h2>            Sharing files&#47;folders with others on the same PC</h2>
                    How do I share files/folder with another user on the same PC?&nbsp; I have tons of photos in Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0 which I transferred over from another PC, but can't seem to find file from a secondary user on the same PC (I can find them from the main
 administrator profile). All the sharing info seems to be oriented to sharing with other computers. I can't figure out how to share on the same PC! As best I know I've set up sharing OK, but again that looks like it refers to sharing with others on a Home network
 and beyond. It looks like the application cannot find the file, which is in another user's portion of the PC. Thanks

</span></span></span><span><span>Click

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>For the user you added permissions for you will need to either add that folder to one of their libraries, or create a shortcut on their desktop
 to that folder. (You’ll have to navigate through Windows Explorer aka what you were in when you clicked Computer earlier)</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>That list looks long and complicated, but once you’ve done it a few times it becomes much quicker.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope that helps, look forward to hearing back from you.</span></span></p>

    <title>USB memory stick corruption - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dietcokeaddict  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB memory stick corruption</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Verbatim USB memory stick that I use to synchronize files between a laptop running Vista Home Premium and a desktop running XP Professional SP3.</p>
<p>By "synchronize" I just mean run a batch file to copy some files.&nbsp; Nothing fancy.</p>
<p>Since upgrading my laptop to Vista, I've started getting file corruption on my USB memory stick.&nbsp; So far, this has happened twice.&nbsp; I first noticed the corruption because (1) the files I copied to the memory stick were missing, and (2) Vista started complaining
 when I would plug in the USB stick and offer to 'scan and fix' it.&nbsp; I ran chkdsk on the USB drive, which found errors.&nbsp; Chkdsk reported that it 'removed trailing folder entries' and 'converted lost chains to files'.&nbsp; Running chkdsk again didn't find any errors.&nbsp;
 I spent a lot of time rebuilding the corrupted data on my USB stick from backups I had made elsewhere, and eventually was up and running again.</p>
<p>Since that first corruption I have been running chkdsk regularly (even time I plug in the memory stick) and been careful to always use "Safely remove hardware" on both machines before unplugging the drive.&nbsp; I've also been careful to not let my laptop fall
 asleep while the USB stick in plugged in, though this shouldn't matter.</p>
<p>This morning, I noticed the corruption had resurfaced.&nbsp; Since I've been running chkdsk often, I'm pretty sure it happened when coping files to the USB stick on the Vista laptop this morning.</p>
<p>What is the likily culprit here?&nbsp; It seems like it's either the USB memory stick hardware or a bug in Windows Vista?&nbsp; An anybody offer advice as how to narrow it down?</p>

<p>DietCokeAddict,<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you have done a good job of narrowing down the problem.&nbsp; I would definitely continue running chkdsk on the USB memory stick and make the safely remove hardware is showing before removing it.&nbsp; There is an update for Vista that is specifically
 for USB devices that might resolve your issue.&nbsp; I have had it fix a number of different issues with USB devices.<br />
<br />
Try this and let us know if it resolves your issue:<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Boot Fail &#43; Loop Question&#58; USB OS load vs. System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gamingws34  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Fail &#43; Loop Question&#58; USB OS load vs. System Reset</h2>
                    PC worked great day one of my upgrade; games were running way better and I was happy with 10. However, last night I put the PC to sleep; when I woke up, I noticed PC on so I powered the monitor and the tool bar on the bottom left (cortana, windows button,
 etc) was not responsive. Upon restart, the PC loops repeatedly in this order: "Preparing Automatic Repair", window pops up and disappears then "Diagnosing your PC", then "Automatic Repair" with the options "Restart" and "Advanced Options". I've launched startup
 repair which fails, my BIOS does not have a DEP selector (Which fixes the issue for many users) in the CPU settings, system finds no restore points, flashes, etc.<br />
<br />
My only options now seem to be a system reset or USB boot; my question is this:<br />
<br />
What is the difference between USB boot and system reset? I don't want to lose anything, especially these huge game downloads that would take forever to re acquire on my now much slower internet. Also, are there any other options? Perhaps wait for a new version
 of Windows 10? Thanks in advance everyone,<br />
<br />
<br />

            <p>I have no desktop access so I can't &nbsp;be 100%; but I do know it's Norton Security Suite updated last from windows 7 64bit to 10 64bit (on the 6th). So the latest, current windows 10 version should be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't been a Comcast member for three years; had Norton close to 5 years. It stayed and worked as intended so I saw no need to replace it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think security suite has been installed, but if so it no longer is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never tried to remove Norton. However, the problems did start occurring shortly after converting to Norton windows 10 - though I'm pretty sure the system survived a few restarts after the update.</p>

"clean boot troubleshooting" mode</a>), you might try uninstalling the Comcast/Norton freebie (followed by a reboot), running the
<strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> (followed by another reboot) and then testing functionality&nbsp;with Windows Defender &amp; Firewall still enabled.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all is well, you might consider doing a clean install of the Comcast/Norton freebie (but I wouldn't IIWY).</p>

 the "Restart" and "Advanced Options" loop again. I even went into the command prompt to change to legacy (bcdedit /set {default} bootmenupolicy legacy) but still I only get to choose which drive to boot from whilst pressing F8 at boot... no classic black and
 white "Safe Mode" screen to be seen...</p>

</p><p>Did you create the "OS...on the USB stick" using the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Yes sir, I used the Windows Media Creation tool to place the OS on the USB memory stick. Would it keep all applications? Or proceed as a system reset, wiping non windows apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use the Rollback feature but I was prompted that there was nothing to roll back to. Unless there is a way to use the creation tool to place and use a rolled back version; that option is unavailable to me. In the windows advanced settings menu,
 I tried everything except for a system reset and nothing worked, not a restore or flash (couldn't find file), nor the repair option (says it can't fix the issue) or even the safe mode restart (system restarts as usual with errors). I do have command prompt
 access, but only found one solution via the prompt and it didn't work.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Max, was your system originally Windows 7 and is now Windows 10?
<br />
<br />If so, please try the following steps . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

    <title>Control Keys NOT working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mm and i  say:</h3>
<h2>            Control Keys NOT working </h2>
                    I have no idea what I did, if anything, but all of a sudden the CTRL keys don't work.<br />
<br />
Where do I go to check the settings? I need very detailed instructions as I'm very far from an expert in using RUN etc.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<p>MM and I,<br />
Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />

You can adjust these settings on the Make the keyboard easier to use page in the Ease of Access Center.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.&nbsp; Open the Make the keyboard easier to use page by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Ease of Access, clicking Ease of Access Center, and then clicking Make the keyboard easier to use.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2.&nbsp; Select the options that you want to use:</p>
<p>• Turn on Mouse Keys. This option sets Mouse Keys to run when you log on to Windows. Instead of using the mouse, you can use the arrow keys on your keyboard or the numeric keypad to move the pointer.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• Turn on Sticky Keys. This option sets Sticky Keys to run when you log on to Windows. Instead of having to press three keys at once (such as when you must press the CTRL, ALT, and DELETE keys together to log on to Windows), you can use one key by turning on
 Sticky Keys and adjusting the settings. This way, you can press a modifier key and have it remain active until another key is pressed.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• Turn on Toggle Keys. This option sets Toggle Keys to run when you log on to Windows. Toggle Keys can play an alert each time you press the CAPS LOCK, NUM LOCK, or SCROLL LOCK keys. These alerts can help prevent the frustration of inadvertently pressing a
 key and not realizing it.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• Turn on Filter Keys. This option sets Filter Keys to run when you log on to Windows. You can set Windows to ignore keystrokes that occur in rapid succession, or keystrokes that are held down for several seconds unintentionally.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
• Underline keyboard shortcuts and access keys. This option makes keyboard access in dialog boxes easier by highlighting access keys for the controls in them.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If that does not work you may need to visit the web site of your computer manufacturer to see if they have some specific software installed on your computer that controls key functions.<br />
<br />
Let us know if we can provide further assistance.<br />
Thank you,</p>

<p>It's happened to me once and like Elite Rampant said, I'd steer well clear if this happened repeatedly. &nbsp;As much as i enjoy the 360, no piece of electrical equipment should have a shelf live of 2 or 3 years before needing fixed or replaced. &nbsp;I've had my
 DVD player for 10 years and only replaced my old Sony CRT 3 years ago (which was still working perfectly after 10 years).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's insane people will fork out 3 or 4 times for the same piece of electrical equipment. Add to that, I've still got a Megadrive, SNES and PS2 that still work to this day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>People are basically rewarding MS for producing an inferior product when they go out and buy umpteen consoles.</p>

<p>A lot of this depends on the how the player is taking care of his systems as well.I have had one red ring incident since the end of 2005.I always give the console breathing room and keep away from direct sunlight.I'm not sure if this matters but i always
 keep mine standing &nbsp;and never laying on it's side.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Yeah it does, standing is worse. Hence the main reason mine is always laid down, the vents at the bottom have more room that way. Plus there is less chance of the console toppling over and scratching disks and its self if it's laid down to.</p>

<h3> arlon rivers  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Print to file&#34; and &#34;print to PDF&#34; print options have disappeared from my PRINT screen. The options have simply vanished.</h2>
                    I used to be able to select the "print to file" box or choose to "print as a&nbsp;PDF". The PDF option would appear next to my standard printers and this one I used frequently use.&nbsp;I would find a document on the web such as a map/direction website, go to print,
 and in the window containing my printers I would see these two options,. Then after updating my Adobe Acrobat to 9, I can no longer print to file or as a PDF. Anyway to restore these options?

            You could try doing a system restore to before the update&nbsp;download.Unless it has changed over night.Adobe doesn't support 64 bit systems yet.If your having trouble printing from a file click start and at the top of the menu should be Internet Explorer.Right
 click on that and run without add-ons and see if that helps

    <title>Do Stats Help or Hurt&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Do Stats Help or Hurt&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Personally, I love the fact that&nbsp;I can review stats but there are a fair amount of players out there that don't share my enthusiasm.&nbsp; I got into a debate with a good friend of mine this past weekend over whether or not stats have a good effect on gamers.&nbsp;
 He was of the opinion that they've caused more problems than anything.&nbsp; His reasoning was sound.&nbsp; He felt that players that play for statistical gain are no longer playing for the love of a game but rather for recognition of some sort.&nbsp; Be it with friends,
 school mates or just in general, getting your name up there on the leaderboards.&nbsp; These people do not play for fun.&nbsp; I disagreed.&nbsp; I find tracking my stats to be informative and that just adds to my experience as a whole.&nbsp; His point, "It makes us too competitive.
 We cease having fun and we engage in the serious behavior of competition.&nbsp; It becomes more about getting better and improving than it is about enjoying the game."&nbsp; My counter, "Improving
<em>is fun</em> to me, how can&nbsp;I improve if&nbsp;I don't know where I'm lacking.&nbsp; He forced me to see an obvious truth and that is... "we all know what we're bad at whether we want to admit it or not."&nbsp; Okay.. point taken but for some of us, it's not as simple as
 that.&nbsp; Some folks, myself included, have a desire to be good at the things they do.&nbsp; Not necessarily gaming but rather... in everything&nbsp;we do.&nbsp;&nbsp;It's called pride.&nbsp; He laughed at me.&nbsp; Taking pride in video games Strunk??&nbsp; Really??&nbsp; Okay...okay...&nbsp;I know it
 sounds strange coming from&nbsp;somebody, let alone a&nbsp;middle aged man but the truth is, "yes" I do take some&nbsp;pride in my performance online.&nbsp; I'm into it.&nbsp; I fail to see how that's not fun though.&nbsp; I enjoy myself whole heartedly.&nbsp; Then he asked me how&nbsp;I felt when
 I lost... was that a fun experience?&nbsp; Naturally, my answer was no.&nbsp; He said, "see...."&nbsp;See what??&nbsp; Nobody likes to lose.&nbsp; Then&nbsp;he asked me if it didn't affect my stats would&nbsp;I feel the same about the loss.&nbsp; My gut instinct was to say, "of course"&nbsp;but&nbsp;I thought
 about it... and&nbsp;I don't know.&nbsp; I don't really care about my stats in the sense that I'm not out to impress anybody but&nbsp;I do care about them as a tool to mark my own improvement.&nbsp; I don't use them to judge others as so many other players do.&nbsp; That's when he
 slapped the table, "See, right there....use them to judge others. How do you think that impacts a younger player??"&nbsp; "Do you think&nbsp;that behavior&nbsp;has the same impact on a young person who's not gaming but rather... just going out for a school sport?"&nbsp; How many
 kids hate gym because they can't run fast or play sports well?&nbsp; You remember those kids in Gym Strunk... the ones that always sat on the bleachers while we played basketball.&nbsp; "Yeah", I said.&nbsp; "That's the mindset being fostered here", he replies.</p>
<p>Now, I have to add that I disagree with him but his logic is sound.&nbsp; I'm not going to type out the entire debate as&nbsp;I can recall it but you get the gist of what we were going on about.&nbsp; He's basically saying that a competitive environment isn't the most
 friendly and really shouldn't be involved in gaming, stats make players care more about the outcome of a match rather than the people we are playing with.&nbsp; My stance is that it's a natural accurance in games&nbsp;that nobody can control.&nbsp; There has to be a winner
 and a loser and that stats don't make players aggressive towards others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny thing is, even though I didn't agree with him, he wasn't wrong,&nbsp;he made some very valid points.&nbsp; A players mindset is influenced by EVERY aspect of the game.&nbsp; Stats are included.&nbsp; So what do you think?&nbsp; Do stats affect the way you play?&nbsp; Do you judge
 others by those little numbers next to their name?&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; Sorry about the wall of text, for some reason i can't seem to make a paragraph to save my life.... I hate these new forums.&nbsp;&nbsp;I really do.</p>

<p>It depends on what you mean by "Stats." Are stats the score? If so, then yeah, they affect us all when we play if we're trying to have the highest score and win. Or are you referring to the secondary stats, like kdr, kdr + a, headshots, "Falcon Driver Kills",
 specific weapon kills, medals, commendations, those things?</p>

<p>No ... I could care less about my stats as long as I get a kill I dont care now if you ask speedy stats mean everything in the world to him......to me I do look at stats and try to improve them just like you strunky... it shows my improvement and I like
 them for that purpose I dont even look at other people stats unless I am helping them improve them I was looking at this one girls stats to see what she needed to play to make her stats better...... but stats dont matter as long as my team mates get at least
 five kills then I dont care</p>

<p>Interesting topic, Strunky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stats are a double edged sword.&nbsp; I think that how someone determines if a game is fun depends more on internal motivating factors, as opposed to external.&nbsp; As to what is important to you, the person.&nbsp; You will have those people that obsess over the minute
 details and compare their value as a person to numbers on the screen.&nbsp; You will also have those people who don't care about the numbers on the screen, rather how much fun they had in the last game.&nbsp; It's not the numbers that are tracked, it's how the person
 uses that information that is available to them.&nbsp; Stats are available to me after every game.&nbsp; I do occasionally check them after a game to see how I did and how much I contributed to my team.&nbsp; I'm not consistent, so if I do well or poorly doesn't really affect
 me much as I know the next game will change.&nbsp; I like to win, but I won't rage if we don't.&nbsp; But that is me.&nbsp; Someone else can have a completely different experience.&nbsp; They can be so focused on obtaining or maintaining &nbsp;a number, that they've altered their
 playstyle to obtain/maintain it.&nbsp; It's these folks that have kinda forgotten the reason they play video games.&nbsp; Because it's fun.&nbsp; I don't know about you all, but I wouldn't be playing video games if it was a chore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We tend to see the extremes of 'statistical worth' on these forums (I do have to say that b.net is the worst for this behaviour).&nbsp;&nbsp; We all can name an experience in which we've read a post of someone who dismissed the opinion of an OP because their k/d ratio
 (or any other random stat).&nbsp; Like, really?&nbsp; It's infantile.&nbsp; I see it a lot with people that are unable to debate with another, thus the insults are thrown.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To answer your questions, stats don't really affect the way I play.&nbsp; My internal motivators are to have fun times with my friends and feel good about the games.&nbsp; I can name several times in games where most of the opposing team quit.&nbsp; Leaving only one poor
 kid to face my team.&nbsp; Do we go off and hunt him/her down never allowing the opportunity for them to take a few steps after they respawn?&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; We don't.&nbsp; That's not how we play.&nbsp; Sometimes, we let the kid win.&nbsp; Heck one of my friends put one of those games
 to music once.&nbsp; <a href="http://youtu.be/PjHdGrEeX8c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I think she did a great job</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/PjHdGrEeX8c?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/PjHdGrEeX8c?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So yeah.&nbsp; Internal motivating factors.&nbsp; Imma gonna go with that. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT:&nbsp; I also hate these forums and their paragraph stealing formats.</p>

<p>I think some people look at stats to much to judge other players... &nbsp;My stats may not match those of some of you, cause I see how stats mean so much to a lot of u... &nbsp;Yeah.. ure K/D is higher than mine ...wow.... &nbsp;first off... there is no way u have time
 to check everyone on ure teams K/D before the match much less both teams... A lot of the time I might be laying on my side, surfing the internet, while playing which leads to a low K/D... let me sit up &amp; play &amp; I can easily destroy most of u... but my stats
 don't reflect that...I don't care about my K/D to bother with camping in the corner and not going for the objectives..</p>
<p>On days where the daily challenge is to get so many assist.... It leads to me dying a lot... yeah, I will eventually get all my assist if I just play all day, but I might want all my assist in 2 or 3 games... Certain daily challenges lead to many deaths
 &amp; I can care less.. I have fun doing my challenges.... In objective games I score the objective.. therefor I die the most... I never have back up cause my team mates are busy playing slayer &amp; trying to keep thier K/D up while I run in all alone..Stats are
 meaningless..</p>

<p>Stats are fun, I use them to see if players are good, they aren't a perfect way to tell, but they're the closest you have without playing with them.</p>

<h2>            Let&#38;&#35;39&#59;s talk about Dolby Digital and DTS</h2>
                    
<p>This is just a informative post so feel free to ask questions and such but please no arguments or insults. So I'm a huge nerd and I've been reading bout how a lot of people are mad bout how the XB1 isn't supporting Dolby Digital at this time, however it
 seems they've finally released the final version of 5.1 and 7.1 uncompressed audio for the HDMI ports but do not state if it is Dolby Digital, anyways I'm pretty sure after doing a few hours of research that DTS is actually better audio quality then Dolby
 Digital due to multiple things but ultimately due to better compression and bitrate, am I wrong? Keep in mind for those of you who say Dolby Digital sounds better that some receivers do not encode DTS therefore on your receiver or with your speakers it may
 sound better then DTS, but on paper DTS seems to be the better sound quality anyways so maybe this is the reason Microsoft didn't go with Dolby Digital, though don't get me wrong but formats have ups and downs.</p>

<p>According to my HDTV, when I connect my Xbox 360 to it via HDMI cable my HDTV says I have Dolby Digital 1080p connection. But when I connect my Xbox 1 to it via HDMI cable my HDTV says I've only got a STEREO 1080p 12BIT connection, and Xbox 360 is last gen.
 I went to my settings on my Xbox 1 and can't use 5.1 or 7.1 because I don't use a home theatre system. But I do have a turtle beach dolby headset which I can connect to both consoles via the optical port. Even if it's "stereo uncompressed" with Xbox 1, the
 word Dolby in Dolby Digital (in 360) seems more intriguing than Stereo. &nbsp;</p>

<p>DD and DTS are both compressed lossy formats. DTS does not sound better. It's just a myth. It is almost always louder than DD. That is why some people think that it sounds better.</p>
<p>For better sound from your xb1, use the 5.1 or 7.1 uncompressed setting. </p>

<p>the options for 5.1 and 7.1 were greyed out when I got x1 at launch but when I changed from auto display settings and selected hdmi only they were usable, my av says 5.1 when that option is selected in the options menu and that's over hdmi</p>

<p>[quote user="VulcanVFX"]anyways I'm pretty sure after doing a few hours of research that DTS is actually better audio quality then Dolby Digital due to multiple things but ultimately due to better compression and bitrate, am I wrong?[/quote]DTS isn't better,
 it's L O U D E R. This is what causes most people to believe it is better than Dolby Digital.&nbsp;Funny how the "superior" format sees no adoption&nbsp;in headset boxes.</p>

<p>Well for me this is the issue...I have to turn hdmi audio off and leave my optical audio on "stereo uncompressed", everytime I change the optical audio to "DTS Digtal Surround" I get a pop/crackle when moving the stick around on the main menu. &nbsp;My philips
 receiver doesn't "pop/crackle" on any of my other devices and i've been using it for atleast 5 years now. &nbsp;I know I need to upgrade my receiver real soon but hey the audio should still work on DTS without this pop/crackle menu switching sound im getting...</p>

            <p>Please answer&nbsp;<em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious]<em>&nbsp;diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Was it a brand-new computer when you got it in 2005 or a used computer?</p>
<p>2. How long has AVG Free (I assume; any version) been installed?</p>
<p>3. Had you Norton and/or PC-cillin subscription already expired by the time you replaced it with another anti-virus application (e.g., AVG)?</p>
<p>4. Did you (a) uninstall the Norton application AND THEN (b) download/run the Norton Removal Tool &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you installed a replacement anti-virus application (e.g., PC-cillin; AVG)?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
<p>6. Open <strong>Add/Remove Programs</strong> &amp; make sure the <strong>Show Updates</strong> box at the top is checked (and leave it checked); then select the
<strong>Name</strong> option in the <strong>Sort by</strong> box on the right. Now scroll down &amp; tell me&nbsp;which, if any,&nbsp;of the following updates&nbsp;<em><u>ARE</u> LISTED?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) KB2723135, KB2705219, KB2712808, KB2731847 &amp; KB2675157 [<em>or&nbsp;KB2647516, KB2618444 or KB2586448</em>];</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) KB2698365, KB2691442, KB2655992 &amp; KB2719985;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) KB2707511, KB2676<u>562</u>, KB2659<u>262</u> &amp; KB2686509</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d) KB2653956; KB2661637, KB2598479, KB2631813 &amp; KB2585542</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) KB2393802 <em>and especially <strong>Update for Windows XP (KB971029)</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Most will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows XP</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>If IE8 is installed,&nbsp;one (1)&nbsp;will be displayed as <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> followed by the KB number in parentheses.</p>
<p>5. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>6a. Is Java Version 7 Update 7 (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING IE (ONLY!) =&gt;
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp</a></p>
<p>6b. Is Adobe Flash Player v11.4.402.265 (or higher installed? TEST HERE USING IE (ONLY!) =&gt;
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/</a></p>

<p>3-I don't believe I had either of them expire before I replaced them, but again, I can't be positive.</p>
<p>4- I'm pretty sure I ,used their "removal tool" both times, but whether or not it was prior to installing a new antivirus I don't recall. If the instructions told me to re-boot, I did,but I can't be sure. I had some spyware that caused me to have to do a
 system restore back in 2006 .I decided to get a different antvirus and I purchased PC-cillin from their website and was sent a disc. I used it for a couple of months but found it too hard and confusing to use and uninstalled it. After that, I used AVG free,
 spybot and adaware until I moved in 2007 and ended up with Comcast. </p>
<p>5-I don't recall what "free trial" antivirus came preinstalled, it could have been norton.</p>
<p>6-Since trying to go thru these in my add/remove list was hard while holding a magnifying glass, I ran my Belarc Advisor. I found it so much easier since the updates are listed in numerical sequence.</p>
<p>I noticed that I have one hotfix that "fails verification(KB963027-IE7, 4/16/2009)</p>
<p>and needs to be reinstalled". Unfortunately my internet connect is up and down and unreliable. It was down yesterday and now its up again.</p>
<p>Following is a list of updates that are in my PC:</p>
<b>
<p>KB2723135, KB2705219, KB2712808, , KB2731847 KB2698365, KB2691442,,KB2655992 , KB2707511, KB2719985KB2707511, KB2676<u>562,

<p>And these are not:</p>
<p>KB2675157 [<i>or KB2647516, KB2618444 or KB2586448</i>];</p>
<p>KB266163, KB2598479, KB2631813 &amp; KB258542</p>
<p>5-I had Firefox for awhile and it wouldn't open up so I uninstalled it. Then I had Chrome and it wouldn't open either, so I uninstalled it as well.</p>
<p>6a- Belarc says, </p></b>Sun Microsystems, Inc. - Java(TM) Platform SE 6 U14 Version 6.0.140.8.I went to the website and got the update and then verified,
<b>You have the recommended Java installed (Version 7 Update 7.</b>
<p>6b- Website says,"You have version 11,1,102,55 installed"Belarc" says,
</p>Adobe® Flash® Player Update Service Version 11,2,202,228 Adobe Systems, Inc. - Shockwave Flash Version 10,0,12,36<br />
Adobe Systems, Inc. - Shockwave Flash Version 11,1,102,55<br />
Adobe Systems, Inc. - Shockwave Flash Version 11,2,202,228<br />
<p>7-I downloaded and ran PC Tuneup one time and had it fix what it found. Then about a month ago. I downloaded and ran cccleaner. I also had purchased Norton System Works back in 2006 and used it for awhile. But, if I recall, I
 started having problems with it and uninstalled it.</p>
<p>8-When I had to do the system recovery mentioned in #4, it was because IE was "broken", "unfixable", according to Sony support. I think I could have paid for assistance probably from MS, but couldn't afford it, or possibly was
 told by MS, that was the only way to fix it. As far as WinXP, no. If I'm not m istaken, You would have to have a recovery disc to do a repair install, correct? I was so PC stupid when I purchased my PC, I never did my recovery disc's. At some point I realized
 that was a huge mistake, and I think that point was when I was dealing with the aforementioned problem.</p>

<p>1.&nbsp;Is Comcast is still your ISP?</p>
<p>2. Have the Comcast freebies Constant Guard Security Suite, Norton Security Suite and/or McAfee Security Center EVER been installed?</p>
<p>3a. Assuming IE7 is installed, is <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 7 (</strong><strong>KB2559049, KB2530548, KB2497640, KB2482017
</strong>or <strong>KB2416400)</strong> listed in Add/Remove Programs?</p>
<p>3b. How about <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 7 (KB963027)</strong>?</p>
<p>5. Has <strong><em>Windows Internet Explorer&nbsp;8</em></strong> EVER been offered to your computer via Windows Update?</p>
<p>6. Since you never made "recovery disks," how did you go about doing the "system recovery" back in 2006?</p>
<p>7. Do you have backups of ALL the changes that PC Tuneup EVER made to your computer? [1]</p>

            <p><strong>omg,</strong></p>
<p>!- No, i don't have Comcast.. I live at the YWCA. The Lutheren church across the street unsucured their network so we could use it.&nbsp; The connection was up and down 3 times yesterday. down when I got uo today, I'm at the library right now using a PC.
<strong><u>And,</u> I forgot my glasses!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2-I've never heard of "Constant freebies...", I haven't had Comcast since 2007.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Norton security and/or McAfee </strong>I'm not sure about.&nbsp; I used to run and make a copy of Belarc periodically. I have a few in my papers that I'll look for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3a- I have IE8, . I'm coming back to the library tomorrow and I'll see what info I can come up with</p>
<p>3b- </p>
<p>5-</p>
<p>6- They talked me thru it, I think we used safe mode. I did end up purchasing recovery discs from Sony.</p>
<p>7- I think so. </p>
<p>If&nbsp; Lutherlink comes back up, ,Is there a way to up[load a copy of my Belarc Profile, if that would help?</p>

            <p>Replace <strong>Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 7 </strong>with <strong>
Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8</strong> in questions #3a &amp; #3b of my previous reply &amp; ignore #5.&nbsp; [My apologies for the mis-numbering.]</p>
<p>PS #1: See if you can locate the recovery discs - I think you're gonna need 'em very soon.</p>
<p>PS #2: No need to post a copy of your Belarc Profile. Just "eyeball" the <strong>
Security Update for Windows Internet Explorer 8 </strong>section of Add/Remove Programs for those updates.</p>
