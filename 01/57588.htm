<h2>            Total identified Windows instalations&#58; 0</h2>
                    <p><span><br />
1. First Start System Recovery Options. To start system recovery options.<br />
</span><span>a) Boot from the disk, Once you get the welcome screen of installation with the option “Install now”</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on Repair your computer</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the next page click on Advanced Options</span></p>
<p><span>d) Now click on Troubleshoot<br />
e</span><span>) Lastly click on Command prompt</span><span>&nbsp;and follow the on screen instructions<br />
<br />
2. At the prompt, type the bootrec command as shown below and then press Enter:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>bootrec /rebuildbcd</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><pre><span>The bootrec command will search for Windows installations not included in the Boot Configuration Data and then ask you if you'd like to add one or more to it.<br />
3. You should see the following message.<br />
</span>Scanning all disks for Windows installations.</pre>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please wait, since this may take a while...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Successfully scanned Windows installations.</span></p>
<p><span>Total identified Windows installations: 0</span></p>
<p><span>The operation completed successfully.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>4. Since the BCD store exists and lists a Windows installation, you'll first have to "remove" it manually and then try to rebuild it again.</p>
<p>At the prompt, execute the bcdedit command as shown and then press&nbsp;<span>Enter</span>:</p>
<pre><span>bcdedit /export c:\bcdbackup</span></pre>
<p>The bcdedit command is used here to export the BCD store as a file:&nbsp;<em>bcdbackup</em>. There's no need to specify a file extension.</p>
<p>The command should return the following on screen:</p>
<pre><code><span>The operation completed successfully.</span></code></pre>
<p>Meaning the BCD export worked as expected.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>5. At this point, you need to adjust several file attributes for the BCD store so you can manipulate it.</p>
<p>At the prompt, execute the attrib command exactly like this:</p>
<pre><span>attrib c:\boot\bcd -h -r -s</span></pre>
<p>&nbsp;After the "attrib c:\boot\bcd -h -r&nbsp; -s"&nbsp;</p>
<p>It gives me an aswer "path not found"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can Ifix this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure about your problem, but I have encountered No OS found when running the Rebuild BCD Command, but there are two other commands that should be run 1st...</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>BOOTREC /FIXMBR </span></p>
<p>BOOTREC /FIXBOOT </p>
<p>BOOTREC /REBUILDBCD</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I have found that if don't boot with the correct media, or select the proper Boot Device this will happen....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to Boot a UEFI machine with Legacy media it will fail, and vice versa...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes you can get around this by booting through Boot Options at the POST screen and selecting the proper boot device...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Instance... "UEFI Optical Drive" or "Optical Drive"...</p>
<p>Another... "UEFI USB Drive" or "USB Drive"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't do the #3 step... it shouldn't be necessary...</p>
<p>It might help if you unhook any other HDDs if there are any...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Access Denied almost seems as though you are not using the Command Prompt as Admin, but that is not something you should need to mess with the method you are using...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, make sure you are booting with the media properly to match the Bios setting or your machine... UEFI or Legacy... The commands will not work if you use the wrong one..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The UEFI setup boots from a EFI partition, and the Legacy does not... If everything is not in sync it won't work...</p>

<p>The message about the command you ran told you it was looking for additional Windows installs, so showing 0 is normal.&nbsp; Not sure why you think you had to delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if there is a bcdedit import command.&nbsp; If you can't get that to work, try running a
<strong>bcdboot C:\Windows</strong> command to replace the BCD store, then rebuild the BCD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The bcdboot command assumes C is you OS partition after booting into repair situation.&nbsp; In some cases, the OS partition is not designated as C but perhaps something else.&nbsp; If you want to check, in the command prompt start
<strong>Diskpart </strong>and do a <strong>lis vol</strong> command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You did export the file to c:\bcdbackup.&nbsp; If you want to work on the current BCD store, just use bcdedit commands.&nbsp; If you mess up you have the back you can import to replace the one you messed up.&nbsp; How you import may effect what is actually imported if
 a BCD store already exists.&nbsp; Get the help file for import by <strong>bcdedit /import /?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You never mention why you needed to go through this...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah sorry I didn't put much info, about week ago I build my first computer.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>gygabyte h111 MB</p>
<p>Intel pentium cpu</p>
<p>8gb memory</p>
<p>1tb hard drive</p>
<p>Aorus gtx 1060 gpu</p>
<p>OS windos 10 home</p>
<p>Saturday night I receive in the mail a 500gb ssd , I read the intructions on the back packaging</p>
<p>I turn off my&nbsp; computer, unplug psu, unplug hard drive, then as a nubie that I am, I didn't realized I need to fromat the ssd drive, I boot up my pc, it fail to start, I turn it off, unplug the power, put the hard drive back, turn it back on, and it did
 not boot</p>
<p>I watched many tutorials on youtube on how to fix this issue and also, been reading on this forum for any&nbsp; solution, have not found one yet.</p>
<p>I spoke with a guy at frys&nbsp; and he said ,&nbsp; acording to what I explain him windows can't repair itself because theres no mirror data to go back to or someting like that.</p>
<p>Thats all I have</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly apreciated.</p>

<p>When you replace a drive like that you might check the Bios to make sure the current one is set as primary in the Bios and the WindowsBootManager is the primary option.&nbsp; You could test by using the boot device menu.&nbsp; If you show the correct option there,
 it should boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all you did was to remove the drive, it should still have what it needs to boot.&nbsp; You did not change any of the Secure Boot options while installing the new drive?&nbsp; Windows will install on a drive which is not formatted, the install will do that.&nbsp; If
 you were trying to use some type of image, that might also work.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of a windows feature called Fast Startup, and the way it works, removing a HDD\SSD from a machine after a shutdown when Fast Startup is turned on, can cause corruption... Especially of the boot files...
</p>
<p>It is not a guaranteed problem, but it happens frequently on my machines when I get in a hurry and forget to turn off Fast Startup before switching drives...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The commands I provided should fix that...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting a unformatted SSD in the machine may have caused changes in your Bios settings... My machine automatically switches from UEFI to Legacy Bios depending on which type of Boot Drive is installed... (GPT for UEFI or MBR for Legacy)...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like you now have two windows 10 installations...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows OS is probably the original, and the Windows OS Vol 4 is probably the new one...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't hurt anything to have two, but it can take up a lot more space on your HDD\SSD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to System Configuration (msconfig) Boot Tab,&nbsp;you can turn off one of the OSs so that you do not need to choose everytime...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to update your graphics drivers if they do not update on their own after awhile...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which OS are you selecting ?</p>

<h2>            MS Java Virtual Machine and Java.</h2>
                    I hope I'm posting in the right place. If not, please let me know.<br />
My desktop is a Dell Dimension. I got it in 2002. It has Windows XP SP3 and IE6.0 SP3 with all updates. MS Java Virtual Machine was a part of XP or IE and is still there because I can find it because it is on the Advanced properties page of IE. I don't have
 any other Java installed (nothing in Control Panel-Programs). I want to go to the Intel driver support site and download their program to detect the Intel drivers on this system and download any, if needed. The site says I need to download the latest version
 of Java. I understand that. Here's the question:<br />
<br />
Is there any thing I should do before downloading and installing the latest Java version? I do have a Java folder in C:\Windows, but nothing in C:\Program Files. There is a JavaSoft key under HK_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software, but there is no value set for the key.
 There is not a JavaSoft key under HK_LOCAL_USER\Software.<br />
<br />
And the reason I haven't upgraded IE, other than the buggy ones reported all over these boards, is because I only use IE to update windows. My default browser is Firefox.<br />
Thanks for any help.

<p><span>Just keep getting this error 0x8007045d when making a system repair disk and windows is ruining my dvd+r disks. Filling them up so
 they cannot be used again. My system handles all cd to dvd formats so that is not the problem and I am not paying Microsoft to fix a problem they have caused in their programming.</span></p>

Hi,</p>
<p>What is the exact error message?<br />
Did you try backing up to the local drive?<br />
Are you able to do system image back up?</p>
<p>I suggest that you try backing up to a local drive.<br />
Temporarily disable the anti-virus and firewall. <br />
<br />
You may also run the Chkdsk.exe program on the harddrive and check.<br />
To do this:<br />
1. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; administrator. If you&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; click Allow<br />
2. Type chkdsk /r, and then press ENTER.<br />
3. You are prompted to schedule Chkdsk to run when the computer restarts.<br />
4. Press Y, and then press ENTER.<br />
5. Restart your computer. During startup, Windows will scan your disk for errors, and Windows will try to recover any files that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are located on damaged areas on the disk.</p>

            <p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may happen if the computer is not fully shutting down due any third party software conflict or incorrect power plan settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and check,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software
 conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> I would suggest you to run the Power troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in search bar and click it </p>
<p>Click <strong>System &amp; Security&nbsp;</strong>and then click <strong>Power</strong>. Follow the instructions</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Run System File Checker tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> and click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></p>
<p>Type the following command and press <strong>Enter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span> Do not close this Command Prompt window until the verification is 100% complete. The scan results will be shown after this process is finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Thank you Niranjan for taking the time to address my query.</p>
<p>I went through the process and found out lots about the new system that I didn't know before.</p>
<p>Sadly it is still not shutting down. I have checked the power settings just in case I had created a conflict myself.</p>
<p>Any other thoughts</p>

<span>Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until
 the Windows logon prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer. Note: On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears, Use the arrow keys to choose Repair
 your Computer in the Advanced Boot Options and then press ENTER. If prompted, select the Windows 10 installation to be repaired, and then click Next

    <title>File History restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim.phillips  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History restart</h2>
                    <p>Although its working fine now, I fear that the external drive I'm using for File History may fail someday.<br />
I've currently been using the same drive for over two years and have 306GB in its FileHistory folder.<br />
<br />
To be cautious, I'd like to restart the File History process on a new physical drive from time to time and place the previous File History drive off-site.<br />
<br />
How do I proceed to stop File History on the older physical drive and start File History on a new physical drive, perhaps on the same logical drive location, e.g., H:/?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>File History has been invaluable to me.&nbsp; Once File History saved a very large project with a three year investment, when I accidentally deleted the contents of my OneDrive on a second laptop.&nbsp; I was able to recover those 56K deleted files using the restore
 feature of File History.</p>

<p>Got this message today so I tried adding a new card and kept getting that it wasn't a valid CC number on both xbox.com and my console. I then got annoyed and just bought a 3 month subscription card and tried entering it on xbox.com...every time I try this
 I get this "An error has occurred during the transaction. Please try again later." I said okay maybe something is just wrong with xbox.com and tried it on my console and I got some stupid error code "80169D3A." I really don't know what to do at this point.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi there.

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Just to make you aware - You cannot pay off an oustanding balance by using a pre-paid xbox LIVE subscription card, it can only be resolved via a valid credit/debit
 card. You could try signing into </span></span></strong><a href="http://www.billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>www.billing.microsoft.com</span></span></strong></a><strong><span><span>
 and see if you can assign a new card through that, if you can then you will also be able to settle your outstanding balance via that website too.
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Good luck.

<h2>            Downloaded files won&#39;t open after they finish downloading</h2>
                    I use Google Chrome as my default browser, when ever i download an image, file or anything, i click on "Open" to open the file, but it won't let me open the file. The only way i have access that file is by going to my download list, search the downloaded
 file, open it from there and done. it takes a while to access the files that i download and don't want to continue doing those steps. is there a solution for it to be fixed? thank you.

    <title>Windows 10 Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frankwiener  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Problems</h2>
                    <p>I notice from this website and several others that many people are enduring&nbsp;nothing but problems with Windows 10 and that I am not alone.&nbsp; Windows 10 has substantially&nbsp;slowed down my pc.&nbsp; For the first time, I am unable to complete certain transactions on
 some websites.&nbsp; Yesterday, I attempted to make an airline reservation and was unable to complete it.&nbsp; I can't get to the top of the page in many instances and can't navigate website pages as I am accustomed to doing--or not at all!&nbsp; &nbsp;Some believe that my problems
 are caused by a bad automatic Microsoft installation.&nbsp; I considered&nbsp;following Microsoft&nbsp;instructions to uninstall and return to previous Windows version, but now I read that others had problems doing even that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the problems related to Windows 10 due to the fact that my old windows version is still occupying space on my computer?&nbsp; If this is the simple answer, why wouldn't Microsoft at least explain this to us?&nbsp; I am very reluctant to uninstall Windows 10 on
 my own.&nbsp; Since Microsoft installed it, can you uninstall it?&nbsp; Too bad that I was having "adobe flash player" issues with the previous windows version because if I return to the previous version, that awful situation will probably return.&nbsp; Perhaps the best
 solution is shelling out the big bucks for Mac, as I probably should have done in the first place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Restore from your latest backup (yes, that is still a recommended thing for computers... *grin*) or rollback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There will always be some percentage that have issues. &nbsp;Almost all of them with issues could avoid most grief if they had made full backups (as has been suggested for decades with computers as a normal maintenance task as well as a definite suggestion if
 you are about to undertake some large change...) to external and currently disconnected media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many could avoid problems with a little pre-install research and such in addition to the almighty backup. &nbsp;Things like, "Each of my hardware component manufacturers or the assembler of the computer as a whole supports the Operating System I am thinking of
 moving to with device drivers and other necessary software updates and I have downloaded those to external media so I can install them immediately after the upgrade." or, "Each of my software packages or applications I run and depend on are supported on top
 of the operating system I am thinking about upgrading to and any patches they have suggested are either already installed or I have them downloaded to external media for easy install immediately after the upgrade."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, certainly, someone will come back with some comment along the lines of, "I am not a computer geek and should not have to be." or, "The scanner thing said I would be fine."; to those people I can only say that learning to properly maintain a complex
 device made up of many different parts (hardware and software) is either something they can choose to do to make their life easier or choose to pay for others to do for them to make their life easier - and we are not talking about 'programming' or becoming
 some geeky hacker here - just learning the basics like backups, which programs are most important to them and where to get support, asking questions before jumping into the unknown, trust but verify: all common sense non-computing stuff they likely already
 do for other things they are not necessarily experts in each day (not everyone is a qualified automechanic, but they know where their manual is, maybe how to check certain things like fluids and tire pressure OR they know the phone number to someone who does
 and can/will call and pay them if necessary.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for you uninstalling "on your own", it's a few clicks to start an automated process that rolls back for you. &nbsp;(Given a few caveats.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.cnet.com/how-to/windows-10-how-to-roll-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cnet.com/how-to/windows-10-how-to-roll-back/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Can the rollback fail? &nbsp;Yep. &nbsp;That's why I link to those particular instructions... They are visual and suggest a backup AS-IS / before starting the process. &nbsp;Of course, you could turn off your computer and it may never come back on... You might drop it,
 spill something on it, lightning, tornado, hurricane, earthquake, flood, car crashing through house, meteor strike, electrical surge, plane crash, theft, or other bad luck incident could happen anytime too: so backups make sense and more so when you are about
 to knowingly do something like, "change the foundation software that allows communications with all your hardware and allows for the running of applications you then use to properly utilize your data that is actually the important part...", eh? *grin*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, a good rule of thumb, "You won't learn how to do something any younger than you are right now..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>You have to consider several things--how old is your computer? Does your manufacturer recommend upgrading and do they support windows 10? Check their support site. Your old windows version has been replaced by windows 10 so it is not actually in working
 order except as a temporary backup in case you want to revert to it. That option is only available for 30 days after you upgrade, so it is important to make a decision soon. Many reviewers have said that reverting to previous windows works well in most cases.
 If you are having too many problems you should rollback windows now. After the 30 days you will be stuck with windows 10. Go to Settings, Update &amp; Security, Recovery to access the rollback option. That is how microsoft uninstalls windows 10 for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before deciding that, you might download a diff browser like Chrome and/or Firefox to use. You can install multiple browsers. Internet Explorer is still available. Just open it from All Apps on the start page. Edge is not a perfect browser yet. It is still
 being updated and can be hard to get used to and has no addons. BTW Adobe Flash is not a microsoft program and you can uninstall it. It has had several updates lately that might solve your previous problems.</p>

            mlg63: Thank you for your response, which was comprehensible and appreciated.&nbsp; My pc is only a year old.&nbsp; I switched my default browser to Firefox, so that seems to make a difference.&nbsp; We'll see how it goes.&nbsp; As to my adobe flash player problem with the
 previous windows version, I was advised that it would "go away" as soon as windows 10 was installed, and that was correct. Thanks again.

</p><p>If you have time to learn to use OS X and all the different applications associated with it, certainly a few minor changes to use the same stuff would be less...</p>

<p>Hey there Jamato! Is this the only DLC you are having trouble purchasing, or do you get that same error on other content? Are you trying to purchase this on the console Marketplace or through an in-game store?<br />
<br />
Additionally, just to rule out any basic billing issues, can you log in to <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Same problem here. I could buy the Dlc's right away no problem at all. But I can't buy the online pass for some Strange reason.. I have MS point already in my account. I tried when all my billing info was correct then I changed it becuse I didn't want my
 adress and everything there when It didn't work anyway..</p>
<p>Why did the DLC work right away with the MS points but not the online pass? I have more then 800 points in my account ready to go...</p>
<p>I would like to resolve this ASAP since now I can't play with my friends..... :)</p>
<p>I wish I could my the pass through this site or something.</p>

<p>I recently replied to the message I received from XBL Official Support Gamertag: "Mister Gwyther", but have not received a response. Please contact me regarding the issue(s) above. This is the only DLC I am having problems with. I have attempted to download
 this using the Xbox 360 console. I have also tried using the PC. I originally used the in-game store, however this did not work due to issues stated above. I have also tried the Xbox Live Market-Place on the Xbox 360 console and my PC. The error code 80070057
 only appears when I use my console. Due to not being able to find the content/online pass anywhere else this code does not show on any other platforms. Kind Regards.</p>

<p>I also have this 80070057 code each time I try to purchase online pass. I can buy any other product I want via XBOX. I have spent literally a day trying to purchase the online pass using various combinations, modifying data on the paypal, microsoft profile,
 etc. This is quite offencing that Microsoft together with EA did nothing during a last year to fix this and asking customers to waste their time just because they want to purchase their products! Do you really want me and all other customers to check digit
 by digit and letter by letter in the address details even if I have Microsoft points acquired on my account? This is really unprofessional and I am extremely dissatisfied.</p>

                    <p>When I'm logged onto my computer after about 5 minutes, my computer requires me to hit Ctrl-Alt-Del.&nbsp;I have tried every setting option I see to increase the amount of time before I have to Ctrl-Alt-Del from 5 minutes to 30 minutes.</p>

<p>I have no idea where in my post I mentioned any error messages.&nbsp; There&nbsp;are none.&nbsp; There are no changes&nbsp;that I'm aware of that I made.&nbsp; My user account for my personal computer is a local account&nbsp;(Microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help. I've been trying for months to get someone from Microsoft to tell me what is the setting that has the setting of five minutes of no activity results in me having to hit Ctrl-Alt-Del to gain access to my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this that difficult and why?&nbsp; I've seen hundreds of blogs on this issue.&nbsp; If there's a registry setting that needs to be changed or added, please tell me how.</p>

<p>When I start my computer I have it so that I have to enter a password, my Microsoft local account which signs me into my OneDrive account automatically, I think.&nbsp; That of course then brings me to my desktop.&nbsp; After about 5 minutes of inactivity I have to
 enter my Microsoft local account password.&nbsp; I want to increase the 5 minutes of inactivity to 30 minutes.&nbsp; That's all I want to do and 6 months later I have not been able to do it.&nbsp; I have tried every power setting I can to no avail.&nbsp; I cannot find the 5 minute
 setting.&nbsp; Windows 10 upgrade from Windows 7.&nbsp; Home network connection.&nbsp; I have not made any hardware changes.&nbsp; Any software changes are due to updates to Windows 10, Adobe&nbsp;and Office 365.&nbsp; This issue based on the blogs I've seen seems to be a problem a lot

<p>I want to add to prior post. I checked my screen saver settings.&nbsp; It had screen saver: none and the wait setting at 5 minutes.&nbsp; The on resume display logon screen was not checked.&nbsp; I selected a screen saver: ribbon and increased the wait time setting to
 30 minutes.&nbsp; Five minutes of no activity later, my screen saver came on.&nbsp; Based on the change, it should have been 30 minutes, not 5 minutes.&nbsp; I hit the enter key which brought me to my desktop without me having to enter my logon password.&nbsp; I've changed the
 screen saver&nbsp;wait time to 30 minutes several times and it resets to 5 minutes every time.&nbsp; I even set it,&nbsp;shut down, and then started.&nbsp;&nbsp;The wait time&nbsp;reset to 5 minutes.&nbsp; Some how the 5 minute screen saver&nbsp;wait time appears to be&nbsp;the problem no matter whether
 or not it is set to use a screen saver or not.&nbsp; And, it appears it does not matter if you change the wait time or not.</p>

My reply above&nbsp;did not work because I hit the enter key a very time, seconds after my display went to screen saver.&nbsp;So, now I'm not sure what the heck is the problem. Can someone please help me with this issue! If there's a registry fix please tell me how to

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Sorry for the delay, was away from the computer yesterday. </p>
<p>I've been researching this on several sites, and checking some settings on my ASUS laptop to check out possibility of this PC behavior being related to Power State Manager software&nbsp;which can put a PC into sleep or hibernate states, BIOS settings which can
 have an effect on these same settings, Windows 10 power management settings, Desktop personalization which can appear to be like Power State changes but are only changing the display status but not the motherboard / processor power states.&nbsp; The more I read
 the more it seems to be Power state managers may be the cause of the problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Have you changed any BIOS settings before these problems occurred? If so check into returning the settings to their respective defaults. Does your computer use UEFI in conjunction with BIOS, this is a source of some problems for my laptop when upgrading
 from 8.0 to &nbsp;8.1&nbsp;and then a year later&nbsp;8.1 Pro, and subsequently to Windows 10 Pro. And the drivers for the original 8.0 had to be upgraded when going to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. My ASUS has some software that will help me manage power states. This is preinstalled at the factory, and in general may be useful.&nbsp; Do you have a similar program or apps installed,&nbsp;or have you reloaded new&nbsp;drivers for these apps which are updated for
 Windows 10.&nbsp; You stated that your upgrade was from Windows 7 to Windows 10.&nbsp; There might be some power management software upgrades which may cause a problem for the default Windows 10 Power Management settings.&nbsp; Check if you have third party add-on software
 for power management.&nbsp; Using Task Manager to check the status of all Startup software and drivers, to check for Power Manager drivers or managers. Some Security Management packages also have similar software functionality to mitigate leaving a computer unattended
 and putting it into a sleep state which requires a password upon waking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The next batch of Windows 10 and Window 7 power management settings are handled by the Control Panel. The&nbsp; net effect of using these features is:</p>
<p>You can power down system components (desktop or laptops) including the display and/or&nbsp;hard drives. Establish low-power alarms for low power status of notebook batteries or UPS batteries. Also enabling sleep or hibernation modes for no activity conditions,
 and (like my notebook) configuring the behavior or the power button. The control panel settings are similar to the screen saver settings. These settings were to some extent available in Win 7 I think, but I have not found any comparison to the Windows 8 or
 Windows 10 settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lastly: &nbsp;I would strongly advise you not to go mucking around in the registry for a cure to the problem.&nbsp; After giving&nbsp;some&nbsp;thought to all the above mentioned potential sources of the symptoms the likelihood of multiple registry settings related putting
 the computer into a sleep or hibernation state is pretty high, and unraveling conflicts regarding which settings may just leave your system in an unusable state.&nbsp; Unless you come across some blog or forum&nbsp;remedy that is specific to the computer you have, along
 with the same power management, and&nbsp;security management, etc. that you have installed. Any prescribed fix down that path is probably not going to end well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So check each of the above potential origins for the problem.&nbsp; Consider what you had set up in Windows 7 which had saved settings for the screen saver and power options. What if any third party software was installed in 7 that might have left settings that
 carried over to Windows 10.&nbsp; Since you stated that you didn't change anything recently&nbsp;the former Win 7 settings may be&nbsp;a possible source of the problem.&nbsp; So dive into Item 3 to look for a culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck. If I come across anything further I will check back to see your results.</p>

            <p>One more investigative step you might want to pursue is to first check the event logs for your computer. Look for errors or other anomalies which are noted. Start by doing a normal login first thing on a new day.&nbsp; Log in and let the PC do its thing unattended
 and go into its dormant mode.&nbsp; Either complete power down, hibernation, or a sleep mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then power up again and when it is in a normal state go to the event logs using an administrator&nbsp;account to access the Event logs looking for errors or other warnings that may have been recorded starting with that days entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run the Event Viewer, and start reviewing the system event message entries. Any number of events can trigger warnings or errors which standout.&nbsp; But normal entries may also give clues to what startup items are in place for system power management.&nbsp; So pay
 attention to both normal as well as abnormal events.</p>

<h2>            New Server 2016 Installation will not open network properties</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very frustrated with this new server I've installed. The O/S is Server 2016. I have installed Hyper V and joined the domain but not done much else to it.&nbsp; &nbsp;I want to set static IPs on the network interfaces but I can't find a way to get the network properties
 to come up so I can change the IPv4 settings. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I right click on Network and Sharing Center and from the Network and Sharing Center, I click the link and it is simply unresponsive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I go into Change Adapter Settings and I see NIC1, right click that and properties and never get the dialog box.&nbsp; There is also a Virtual Switch NIC and I can't get into that one either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have discovered that I can't work in the Hyper-V environment - when I go into local server manager and launch Hyper V Manager, I get the message: Microsoft Management Console: Unable to create new document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This leaves me thinking I have a corrupt installation of Hyper-V. I went to remove Hyper-V and reinstall and the option is greyed out so it will not let me uncheck it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hyper V is definitely there and running:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>You may please follow the below steps to install the&nbsp;driver in compatibility mode and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">a. Right click/tap twice the program setup file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.</span></p>

<h2>            Supreme Commander problems</h2>
                    Supreme Commander will not run under windows 10. &nbsp;I used the compatibility mode with windows 7 (and previous versions of windows) and it works but it will not display the 2nd monitor. &nbsp;Worked flawlessly in Windows 7 before I upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;Why
 won't the second monitor work, the game was designed for 2 monitors.

            <p>All drivers are up to date. &nbsp;The Supreme Commander is an older game and I believe now defunct so any new patches or updates are not going to happen (SOL). &nbsp;The game worked as intended under Windows 7 with both monitors firing off perfectly. &nbsp;The moment I
 switched to Windows 10 just the one monitor displays. &nbsp;The game will start only under compatibility mode (win7 or previous) but the second monitor immediately shuts off. &nbsp;The driver for my video card is up to date and I have not changed any hardware. It seems
 that windows 10 just kills the second monitor when a game is executed. &nbsp;I tried running the game windowed and also reducing the resolution but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the game is running if I go to the task bar (check out the pic below) it has what appears to be 2 windows open; one with the game and another that is open but with no graphics. &nbsp;It seems that the game uses both monitors but Windows 10 has just shut
 out the possibility of a second display. &nbsp;Why is Windows 10 being such a jerk?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if this is related but...if I drag a window to the second monitor it gets "stuck" at the edge of the screen when I go slow...but if I go fast I can successfully move the window to the second monitor. &nbsp;I did not observe this behavior with Windows
 7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new rig so all drivers are up to date. &nbsp;My specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro 64-bit (All updates current)</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 4790K</p>
<p>16 GB Ram</p>
<p>MoBo: GigaByte Z97X-Gaming 7&nbsp;(All drivers up to date)</p>

            <p>This exactly describes the situation with myself and many other users. There might be some issue with how Windows 10 handles multiple screens and how Supreme Commander expects it to, and so it may be unfixable. Both windows go black as the game loads, which
 is normal. Window 1 will display the game at a very low resolution. Window 2 will show the desktop instead of game content. The game's video settings will show both monitors at 1920x1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When choosing to display the game on only one monitor, it works perfectly.</p>

            <p>Same issue with Supreme Commander Forged Aliance no dual Screen.&nbsp; This is a old game but 10'000's still play it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen reports of dual screen function running fine on Pre-lease versions of Windows 10 so its likely driver related.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Second screen flickers then the game drops out, going back in looks like the games defaults to safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly I need to launch the game as Administrator to get it to run properly at all, but that's a minor&nbsp;issue.</p>

<h2>            Your mailbox is over the high water mark.</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows Live Mail in Windows 7.&nbsp; When receiving any email with an attachment, I keep getting the message:</p>
<p><em>Your mailbox is over the high water mark.</em><br />
<em>Please delete some messages from your mailbox!</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some emails&nbsp;with attachments (even under 10 mb) get bounced back to the sender with a message that the In Box is full.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>A message was sent to you that was returned to the sender(bounced)</em><br />

<em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Total Quota: 10240000</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently have only 17 messages in the In-Box of this account, none heavy with attachments.&nbsp; What is going on and how do I fix this?</p>

                    <p>My laptop is on its last legs and needs replacing. But it has a good SSD with Windows 10 and lots of data on it which I want to keep.&nbsp; Can I buy a new laptop with no HDD or OS and transfer my existing SSD complete with OS straight into it? Am I allowed to
 transfer my existing Windows 10 licence ro a new computer bought without an OS?</p>

            Hi Geoff
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . ..

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Activation depends on what type of license you have of Windows 7/8/10. 
<br />
<br />If Windows 7/8/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license. 
<br />
<br />However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps: 
<br />
<br />Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Update and security&gt;Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.
<br />
<br />Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.
<br />
<br />Alternatively, if that does not help, you would have to call Microsoft Support.
<br />Contact Microsoft using the phone numbers below or use the chat support link(weekdays only)

<h2>            WHY WOULD CRYSTAL DYNAMICS ANNOUNCE TODAY THAT RISE OF THE TOMB RAIDER IS COMING TO PS4&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Phil. &nbsp;I'm trying real hard here to rant and rave about Xbox One and how great it is. &nbsp;Which of course I do believe but this is the first gen since Xbox that I am having a hard time converting my friends. &nbsp;Every game Xb1 gets either goes to pc or ps4. &nbsp;WHY
 IN THE WORLD DID CRYSTAL DYNAMICS announce that the ps4 is getting Rise of the Tomb Raider &nbsp;a year after Xbox One
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>TODAY</strong></span>?????... &nbsp;That just gave away whatever sales you may have gotten from this game. &nbsp;PS4 has Uncharted 4 around the time of RofTR so now any PS4 gamers who may have wanted Tomb Raider can say
 "well we got Uncharted so I'll just wait a year".....</p>

<p>What was the point of that? Come on man.... &nbsp;You said you were going to make up for SFV being exclusives to PS4, well then what are we getting for it?? I believe in you and MS had a great E3 but we need a marque' exclusive that Sony gamers could only wish
 they could get. yes we got Halo, Gears, Forza, Fable but those are all games everyone knows already. &nbsp;PLEASE, PLEASE keep Scalebound and Quantum Break xbox exclusive. &nbsp;How about an Alan Wake 2 exclusives to Xbox One???? &nbsp;Remedy should be 1st party!!! &nbsp;Come
 on Phil!! &nbsp;You want to win this thing or what?</p>

<p>Originally, XBox was to only have a holiday limited exclusive, but now it's a year. And that might as well be fully exclusive. Sure, it will be on PS, but do you really think that after a year, people will still be interested in it? By then, all the talk
 will be Halo 6, FarCry 5, Fallout 5, maybe the newest Dragon Age or ME Andromeda 2... newer and shinier, in other words.</p>

<p>Although exclusives do help sell consoles, it's always annoying when you can't get a game you want because of some exclusivity deal. I think a year exclusivity is fair.</p>

<h2>            Cant open &#39;setup.exe&#39;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>when I try to run 'setup.exe' I see this error: </p>
<p>"windows cannot find 'D:\w10\setup.exe' make sure you typed the name correctly and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched too much for this. But there is NOTHONG to solve! Microsoft&nbsp; believe its come from virus effects and that is for *.exe type;</p>
<p>BUT its wrong!!!</p>
<p>I has "AVG TuneUp utility" and after I disabled it (clean boot), when I tried to start 'setup.exe' I seen a message that "Do you want to run Tuneup?" I said no! and uninstalled TU. after that, I seen thin error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thing AVG team make a condition in registry for running any 'setup.exe'. When user d-clicked, don't run it! run our application (TU) and TU run setup.exe!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm make sure because of I rename 'setup.exe' to 'bsetup.exe' and its work! setup file ran normally!</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOW, how to solve this? How to make/remove this type of conditions in registry?</p>
<p>oh, good to say; I cant reset my windows 10!!! it doesn't work completely!</p>
<p>sorry for week English.</p>

            Hi  krishna1310 
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Try resetting your BIOS defaults:

<br />
<br />If that does not work and you have a desktop computer...
<br />
<br />Power down 
<br />Unplug it
<br />Open the system unit
<br />
<br />Remove the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in, start the machine, wait 10 seconds
<br />
<br />Power down, unplug it, reinstall the CMOS CR-2032 chip
<br />Plug it in again, power up

            Hi Krishna, 
<br />
<br />I'm Stefano an Independent Advisor, here to help.
<br />I suggest you to perform a scan and repair of filesystem: 
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Type "sfc /scannow" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />Then : 
<br />
<br />1. Type "cmd" in windows search bar 
<br />2. Right click on "Command Prompt" 
<br />3. Select "Run as Administrator" 
<br />4. Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />5. Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />6. Type "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth" without quote and press ENTER 
<br />
<br />You can perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-za/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />At this point perform a disk clean up:
<br />
<br />1. Open "File Explorer"
<br />2. Click on "This PC"
<br />3. Right click on "C:"
<br />4. Click on "Proprieties"
<br />5. Click on "Clean-up disk"
<br />6. Click on "Clean up system files"
<br />7. Select every option in the list, but not "Download"
<br />8. Click on "OK"
<br />
<br />Tell me if that solves your issue.       
        </p>
