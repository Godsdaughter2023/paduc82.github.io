<h2>            Clash in the Clouds - Blue Ribbon Challenges</h2>
                    
<p>There are a number of excellent guides for the challenges themselves, such as <a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/a178305/blue-ribbon-champ-achievement.htm?showguides=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one at True Achievements.</a> This is tough achievement to get, so expect to put in a few hours and get to know the maps well by the end of it.<br />
<br />
This post is just a primer for anyone who hasn't tried to tackle the achievement for this and wants to.<br />
<br />
</p>

<ol>
<li>First and foremost, <em>do not</em> concern yourself with the challenges the first time you try to clear each of the four arenas. You do not have to complete the challenge to complete one of the 15 waves in an arena. For every wave, minus the final wave,
 that you clear you will receive either an Infusion or a piece of Gear. Some of the challenges will all but demand that you have all of the Infusions and some of the Gear from the four arenas in order to complete it. The better equipped you are, the better
 your chance of succeeding the challenge. </li><li>If you fail a wave, you will have the choice of forfeiting your score and continuing, restarting from wave 1, or going back to the challenge hub. Don't be afraid to forfeit your score and continue,
<em>especially until you have all the Infusions</em>. You are rewarded with the Infusions and Gear for completing the wave, not completing the challenge, and it doesn't matter if you continue in the middle of the wave. So long as you complete the wave, you
 will get your upgrade. </li><li>You will also have the option to purchase a single resurrection prior to the start of the wave or during the wave if you make your way to "Booker Office Door" on the map. You can essentially have two of these in a wave, however, if you purchase one prior
 to the wave and then purchasing it again mid-wave if you happen to die and thus use your first one. Resurrections will save both your score and your challenge progress, so on the particularly hard challenges, it is worth it to purchase them. However,
<em>you can only purchase three total resurrections</em> throughout the course of any 15-wave go, so do not purchase them until the wave you expect to use them. If you are trying to get the ribbon for wave 13 of 15, don't purchase a resurrection until wave
 13. Just forfeit your scores on waves 1-12 if you happen to die before wave 13. </li><li>I recommend upgrading Shield and Salts before Health. Some challenges will be Vigor-dependent, so it helps to have as much Salt as possible. But be sure to take a few Shield upgrades first, as this will definitely help you survive the wave so you can get
 the Infusions and Gears. </li><li>When you have enough Silver Eagles, upgrade all of your Vigors and Founder Weapons before upgrading Vox Weapons. No challenge is going to call for a Vox Weapon. I haven't verified if the Vox counterpart to a Founder weapon will count for a challenge, such
 as the Heater for a Shotgun, but unless you prefer the Vox Weapons, I would say save them to last. You will eventually have enough Silver Eagles in the DLC to upgrade
<em>everything</em>. </li><li>Some challenges will ask you to defeat an enemy using a certain Vigor or Weapon, and others will ask you to defeat an enemy using only a certain Vigor or Weapon. The key difference is this: if it has the word "only" in it, you cannot damage or kill an enemy
 using <em>anything</em> else. An example might be "Defeat all enemies using only the Sniper Rifle." For that challenge, you cannot use damage from anything except the Sniper Rifle. This would mean not using support from Tears, using Possession, or splash damage
 from enemy rpgs or volley guns. Be very careful, as I had a few I had to repeat because I accidentally shot a rpg out of the air and killed the rpg gunner with the splash damage from the explosion, thus negating my shotgun challenge, for example.
<em>However</em>, if the word "only" doesn't appear, you are allowed to use other means to damage to the enemy, but you must kill the enemy using the challenge requirement. An example of that could be "Defeat each enemy using a different Vigor or Weapon." So
 long as the killing damage is from a Vigor or Weapon that has not killed an enemy on that wave, it doesn't matter how you whittled them down.
</li><li>If you have not already learned to use it, master the use of the Return to Sender Vigor, especially its quick shield use. Some challenges are going to be very tricky, such as "Kill Two Enemies Using a Fireman's Suicide Attack." Having something to negate
 the damage while you're setting up the enemies for this is very, very helpful. Using it to collect ammo can also be a life-saver, but it will drain your Salt quickly and you will need to be careful using it in this manner for any challenge that would prevent
 you from damaging or killing an enemy with it. </li><li>Some challenges will be timed. While everyone has their own style, I found it helpful to have a fully upgraded Sniper Rifle, RPG, and Undertow for these. RPGs are good for taking out several enemies at once, Sniper Rifle for quick kills at a distance, and
 Undertow for knocking enemies off Columbia. Possession is also helpful if you use it early.
</li><li>Gear can be critical, both as a benefit or a detriment. Swap out your gear as needed, and remember to do this. Anything that increases Vigor or splash damage can completely negate a challenge on accident if you didn't intend to damage or kill an additional
 enemy, so use things like the Storm hat carefully. </li></ol>

<br />
In order to get the achievements for clearing each of the four arenas, you must complete all 15 waves in one setting. Using the "Forfeit Score &amp; Continue" option and Resurrections do not affect the achievements, so you should use them to clear the arenas. This
 will get you both the achievements for the arenas, plus the Infusions and Gear you'd get for clearing all the waves.<br />
<br />
The game tracks which ribbons you have earned, however, so you don't have to get all fifteen in a single setting.
<br />
<br />
<em>However, there is no way to return to an arena and select which wave to play</em>. So, let's say the only ribbon you're missing in the Ops Zeal arena is the one for Wave 15, you will have to play waves 1-14 just for the chance to do the challenge in Wave
 15. But you can can clear those as quickly as possible without doing any of the ribbon challenges just to get Wave 15 quickly, and it will not affect the Wave 15 challenge at all.</p>

            <p>Yep, some of these are a right pain...and I'm still only on the Zeal level! Like you though, I found it's better to just focus on beating the level, and grinding out for money/infusions. I have been using the money on upgrading the sniper (costs a lot), and the RPG. I find many levels are easy to beat with these. It would be SOOOOOO much better if they included wave "jumps" (being able to select a specific wave). Missing out on the last blue ribbon makes it a pain to get back to. I'll keep trying on this one, it will take some time. I appreciate all the tips :).</p>

<p><strong>OPS ZEAL</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1 - Defeat the wave using Sky-Line strikes only.</span>
Challenge Level 1.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2 - Defeat the wave while only taking shield damage</span>. Challenge Level 1.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 - Defeat the wave using only the Sky-Hook attacks and Shotgun</span>. Challenge Level 1.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4 - Defeat the wave using only machine guns or the crank gun</span> Challenge Level 2. There is no crank gun in this level, so unless you're holding onto one from a prior attempt, it's machine gun only. The only real
 challenge is the volley gunner. Be careful of splash damage from the volley gun hitting other enemies, and be very careful not to shoot the volley itself as it leaves the launcher.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">5 - Defeat the wave using only the pistol and hand cannon</span>. Challenge Level 2. The only enemy is a Handyman. Keep a level head and aim for the heart. You can get one free shot at it if you hide in the spawn area
 and aim around the door while the Handyman is still.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">6 - Defeat the wave without picking up weapons or looting corpses.</span> Challenge Level 1.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">7 - Defeat all enemies using only zoomable weapons while they are zoomed.</span> Challenge Level 2. Use the Sniper Rifle and the RPG or Hand Cannon and just stay on the skylines. Don't forget to zoom after reloading.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8 - Defeat all enemies using only Tears; Possession Traps; and Return to Sender traps</span>. Challenge Level 2. Lots of Tears in this level that can damage enemies. You can probably do this by possessing the volley
 gunners and chasing the crows around the Tesla coil.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">9 - Defeat all enemies without ever hitting anyone in the head or the heart.</span> Challenge Level 2. The Handyman is the only one you have to worry about heartshots. Just be very careful not to headshot soldiers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">10 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Defeat the Siren before she performs a resurrection</span>. Challenge Level 3. Many people recommend using Undertow to push the corpses off the ledge before she can
 resurrect them, and then begin your attack. I've had instances where she always already starting the process and this negated the Undertow. You can probably succeed using the upgraded Charge/Shotgun method and just bullrush her as well, which is what I did.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">11 - Defeat the wave without using Sky-Lines or Hook-points.</span> Challenge Level 1. Possession and the RPG are your friends.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">12 - Defeat the wave within 1:15.</span> Challenge Level 2. Honestly, this is not as difficult as it sounds. Bring the RPG and either a shotgun or a handcannon. As soon as the wave starts, shoot the RPG 3-4 times at
 the two Fireman on the far platform. By the 3rd or 4th shot, the crows will appear at your location. Use Bucking Bronco to send them airborne. If you have an available RPG shot ready, use it on the crows. Otherwise, finish them off with your alt weapons. If
 one of the Fireman survived the initial RPG assault, finish it off after the crows are dead.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">13 - Defeat the wave using only weapons fired from a Sky-Line or Sky-Line strikes.</span> Challenge Level 2. Just be patient. The only real problem you'll face is when the Handyman electrocutes the Skyline. Just don't
 fire while you're on the ground waiting for the line to be clear.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">14 - Defeat the wave using only Shock Jockey and Headshots</span>. Challenge Level 3. The only reason this is rated 3 and not 2 is because one errant shot and the challenge is ruined. Aim your shots carefully, especially
 on the crows.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">15 - Defeat each enemy with a different Vigor type.</span> Challenge Level 4. This is first real hurdle. You will face two Handymen and one Patriot. Remember, you can whittle down each enemy however you like, but you
 have to defeat each one using a unique Vigor. Most players recommend using Devil's Kiss on one Handymen, Charge on the second, and then Return to Sender for the Patriot. I recommend using Murder of Crows and weapons to whittle down the Handymen first. Make
 sure you buy a resurrection before starting the level. </p>

</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1 - Defeat all enemies with the shotgun.</span>
Challenge Level 2. You can whittle down the RPG gunners with other weapons if you need to, but you can only kill enemies with the shotgun. Be careful not to Skyline strike anyone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2 - Defeat two enemies with a possessed Patriot
</span>. Challenge Level 2. Be patient and keep Possessing the Patriot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 - Force 3 Firemen to self destruct while airborne from Bucking Bronco or Undertow
</span>. Challenge Level 2. Much easier than it sounds. Launch them into the air with Bucking Bronco and use the RPG while they are airborne. Rinse and repeat. Helps to do this in the covered walkway on the ground near the spawn point.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4 - Damage 5 enemies with Vigor Traps.</span> Challenge Level 3. Harder than it sounds. You have to damage and
<em>not kill</em> 5 different enemies. I did this by spreading Shock Jockey traps across the map, but be careful. You have to have each enemy trip the Shock Jockey. Cascading effects such as Storm or the upgraded Jockey damage doesn't seem to count. You might
 have better luck with Murder of Crows.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">5 - Complete the wave in under 0:45 </span>
. Challenge Level 3. Move fast. Sniper Rifle is very helpful. Shoot the first sniper. Shoot the second sniper if you can. Kill the skyline enemies with the RPG or shotgun, or if you can, push them off the skyline with Undertow (be careful, it sometimes takes
 a few seconds for them to fall off the map), then shoot any remaining snipers.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">6 - Defeat the Handyman while he's electrocuting a Sky-Line .</span> Challenge Level 2. Not difficult. Just be patient and whittle his health down. Ride the skylines and wait for him to electrocute it. Make sure the
 kill shot comes while he is grabbing the line.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">7 - Defeat five enemies with Undertow .</span> Challenge Level 1. A whole ship of enemies will fly to your position. Push them off. If you miss fail to get it on the first ship, a second ship will arrive soon after.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8 - Defeat 2 enemies with a Possessed rocket turret
</span>. Challenge Level 3. The rocket turret is one of the larger versions under a floating ship. Keep moving around the map. Enemies will be following you, so routinely Possess the turret and eventually it will end up killing 2 of the enemies. Be patient.
 This can take time. And I don't recommend running around the initial spawn area.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">9 - Defeat every enemy with a different weapon or Vigor .</span> Challenge Level 4. it's not difficult, but you have to be very careful not to kill any enemy with the same source of damage. Be careful of things with
 splash damage like RPGs and Devil's Kiss. Remember, you can only take two weapons into the fight with you, so scavenge weapons such as a Patriot's crank gun during the fight to give yourself an extra source of damage. Switch Vigors often.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">10 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Complete the wave using only Charge, Return to Sender, and Shotguns .</span> Challenge Level 3. Keep a level head you'll be fine. If you ride the Skylines, be careful
 to not Skyline Strike anyone.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">11 - Defeat the Patriot with a possessed enemy .</span> Challenge Level 4. You have to whittle down the Patriot while not killing off the remaining enemies. Be careful of the Patriot dying while you're lowering its
 health, or it having too much health and killing your Possessed allies. This one leans towards a 5 because of little details, not because it's outright hard.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">12 -Defeat all enemies with Vigor traps .</span> Challenge Level 2. Return to Sender every enemy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">13 - Defeat 5 enemies with a single Devil's Kiss blast .</span> Challenge Level 5. Expect to repeat this one several times. You have to use Undertow to collect the enemies from the gazebo, use Murder of Crows to keep
 them in place, repeat this at least once for additional enemies still on the gazebo, and then launch a Devil's Kiss into the middle of them. My original post contains a walkthrough with videos of this. Some people claim to have tossed a Devil's Kiss on top
 of the gazebo as soon as the level started and did this. I have yet to see it happen that way, but it is apparently possible.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">14 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Defeat the Handyman with a Tesla Coil.</span> Challenge Level 3. Same as before. Whittle the Handyman down, and then have him chase you around the Tesla coil. Be
 very patient, as the coil doesn't damage him too much and the final blow can take a while.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">15 - Complete the wave in under 1:30 .</span> Challenge Level 4. Make your way into the Zeppelin as quick as possible and finish it quickly. Get off the zeppelin and finish any remaining enemies on the smaller ships.</p>

<p><strong>RAVEN'S DOME<br />
</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1 - Defeat the wave using Sky-Hook melee.</span>
Challenge Level 1. Just don't execute anyone and you're fine.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2 - Defeat all enemies using the Pistol</span>. Challenge Level 1.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 - Defeat all enemies using Undertow.</span>. Challenge Level 2. Not actually that difficult, but you can potentially run out of Salt.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4 - Defeat all enemies using Vigor Traps.</span> Challenge Level 3. Return to Sender is still your friend on these types of challenges. Watch your Salts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">5 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Defeat the Handyman before any other enemy.</span> Challenge Level 4. This sounds easy, but there are all kinds of random things that can blow the challenge, like
 an enemy falling off of Columbia without any assistance from you. As always, watch the splash damage and do not Possess any enemy to help you take down the Handyman.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">6 - Defeat five enemies using Friendly Fire.</span> Challenge Level 2. Use Possession and Tears, and just be patient.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">7 - Defeat all the volley gunner and the Zealot before damaging any sniper.</span> Challenge Level 3. Again, watch splash damage. If possible, use Undertow to push the volley gunner and the crow off Columbia, just
 don't accidentally push a sniper off with them.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8 - Defeat all enemies using turrets or environmental hazards.</span> Challenge Level 3. The high dome platform has both a turret and a Tesla Coil, if I recall correctly.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">9 - Defeat all enemies in 60 seconds using Vigors only.</span> Challenge Level 5. Do not slow down. Stay in motion going from enemy to enemy. You may to do this level a few times to recognize where most of them will
 spawn. The enemies are spaced about the map and some of them are not going to come to you. Use Undertow to grab enemies or Charge to go right to them. Even then, this one is very tricky. Buy a resurrection just in case.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">10 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Take no damage for 30 seconds.</span> Challenge Level 1. You will spawn behind cover. Duck and remain behind cover for 30 seconds until the ribbon pops.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">11 - Defeat all enemies using the Shotgun.</span> Challenge Level 3. Probably a Level 2 challenge, but you can get overwhelmed if you aren't careful.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">12 - Defeat the wave without picking up a weapon or looting a corpse.</span> Challenge Level 1. Same as before. The only real danger here is looting a corpse out of habit.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">13 - Defeat the all enemies when they are distracted by a Booker Decoy Tear.</span> Challenge Level 5. Snipers and Patriots. You can whittle them down as much as you like, but the kill shot
<em>must</em> come while they are distracted by the Decoy. It's not enough for the Tear to be open, the enemy must be focused on it when you kill it.
<em>DO NOT HESITATE</em>. If they kill the Booker decoy before your killshot hits it will invalid the challenge.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">14 - Defeat each enemy using the same weapon-type it wields</span>. Challenge Level 4. There are weapons available through Tears placed on the map to help you out with this. Start the wave with some combination of
 Shotgun, RPG, and Machine Gun, and you can find whichever you don't bring in with you using the Tears. The best advice I can give you is use the shield version of Return to Sender (not the ammo collector) to protect yourself and wait for an enemy to shoot
 at you so you know if it has a shotgun or a machine gun. Until they shoot, it can sometimes be difficult to tell which they are using.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">15 - Defeat each enemy with a different&nbsp; Weapon.</span> Challenge Level 5. You've got a Handyman and Firemen here. RPG and Handcannon are both good to start with, and you'll need to pick up another weapon as you go.
 Definitely one worthy of a Resurrection. Sometimes you'll get lucky and one or more enemies will fall off Columbia. This should not count against you so long as you did nothing to push them off.

<ol>
<li>Easy. Can do without prep. </li><li>Moderately difficult. Can wing it. </li><li>Hard. Expect to repeat it at least once. </li><li>Challenging. It is recommended to finish all the waves prior to putting serious effort into it.

<p><strong>EMPORIA<br />
</strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">1 - Defeat enemy affected by Bucking Bronco using a Possessed Patriot.</span>
Challenge Level 5. Yes, you read this correctly. Given that enemies do not stay airborne long and Patriots do not stay Possessed long, you can imagine what a small window of opportunity you have here. If at all possible, try to weaken the enemy
 you're going to Bronco ahead of time so the Patriot doesn't have to do much damage.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2 - Defeat Two Enemies Riding Skylines Using Vigor Traps</span>. Challenge Level 4.&nbsp; There are a number of ways to do this. Some people recommend putting Devil's Kiss under the Skylines so it will kill them as they
 hop off. That never worked for me. I tend to agree with the True Achievement advice. Head to the top of the map where the RPG gunners are and take them out. There are, I believe, two additional enemies that will not get on the Skylines up there as well. Whatever
 you do, do not take out the Skyline Riders while you do this. Once you are clear, you're going to have to ride the Skylines to get them to chase you. On the top of the map, the Skyline will arc over the platform. If you stand there, you can see the approach
 of any Skyline rider coming up the line toward you. Use Render to Sender to collect the ammo as they shoot at you and them throw it back while they ride the lines.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 - Defeat the wave using hazards or support brought in through Tears</span>. Challenge Level 4. I'm honestly not sure if weapons you pick up from Tears count for the challenge. All I know is that the only thing that
 seems to be valid for this challenge is the Tesla Coil, and you will have to kite enemies to it. Especially the Hailfire gunners. Do not use Undertow to push enemies into the Tesla Coil.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">4 - Defeat the wave using a different Vigor or Weapon on every enemy.</span> Challenge Level 3. We've done this dance before. Remember to switch Vigors and to watch splash damage if you use RPGs or Volley Guns.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">5 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Defeat both Handymen while they are electrocuting the skyline.</span> Challenge Level 4. Just like the one in Duke &amp; Dimwit, except there are two Handymen. You don't
 have to kill them both at once.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">6 - Defeat all enemies using the shotgun.</span> Challenge Level 4. Be very, very careful of the snipers. They will have clear lines of sight to you and you will not have the Skylines to close the distance quickly.
 Use the Return to Sender shield to protect yourself.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">7 - Defeat two enemies using the Fireman's suicide attack.</span> Challenge Level 5. This is exactly as hard as it sounds. The enemies will need to be weakened so that the suicide attack will finish them. You're either
 going to have to be near the enemy when the Fireman blows, have the Fireman and the enemy both airborne with Bucking Bronco, or use Undertow to set everything up. There are, I believe, three Firemen in this round and you don't have to kill two enemies at once
 with a suicide, but there aren't that many regular enemies and they have a very nasty habit of dying from Fireman splash damage. Buy a Resurrection.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">8 - Defeat the wave in 1:20.</span> Challenge Level 5. Everyone has their own strategy for this. I used Possession on anything that wasn't a Patriot, and RPGs on the Patriot, and Sniped everything else. This may or
 may not work for you. A lot of people recommend using Charge to zoom from enemy to enemy.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">9 - Defeat the Siren before destroying the Zeppelin.</span> Challenge Level 3. You are under no time pressure to destroy the Zeppelin. It may be annoying if you have to chase the Siren off the Zeppelin through the
 Emporia map, but you're not penalized for this. Just make sure she is dead before you destroy the Zeppelin.<br />
<br />
 you may run out of ammunition unless you fire from the hip well with the Sniper Rifle. Elizabeth may provide you ammo once, but I've never seen it happen twice. Buy a Resurrection. Sometimes, it it is worth it to use that Resurrection to refill your ammo.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">11 - </span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Defeat the all enemies when they are distracted by a Booker Decoy Tear</span>.</span> Challenge Level 5. The enemies are two
 Handymen. Handymen are not easily distracted by Decoys, and when they are, they kill them VERY VERY quickly. Since you have to whittle the Handyman down so your kill shot can take place in that tiny window of time where the Handyman is distracted and the Decoy
 is still alive...yeah. This one is much harder than the one in Raven's Dome. And don't use anything with splash damage for your kill shots. They can take out the Decoy. Buy a Resurrection.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">12 - Defeat all soldiers and Zealots&nbsp; using Bucking Bronco followed by a Charge.</span> Challenge Level 4. Keep your head and make sure you do Bronco then Charge. Don't mix them up. And watch your Salts.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">13 - Defeat <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
each enemy using the same weapon-type it wields</span>.</span> Challenge Level 5. Start the wave with a pistol and a shotgun. as that will be what your first enemies will be carrying. Later enemies will have machine guns and handcannons. There is a single handcannon
 and machine gun leaning against the inside rail of the first ship that flies up to the spawn point. Do not go for those until you have killed the pistol and shotgun enemies. Be careful - there are some shotgun enemies who will arrive in the wave of second
 enemies carrying handcannons and machine guns. Use of Return to Sender is critical to keep yourself alive. There is a Salt Tear in the spawn area that can help you recharge. Buy a Resurrection.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">14 - Defeat the Handyman using the Motorized Patriot Tear.</span> Challenge Level 3. Weaken the Handyman then summon the Patriot. Just remember that if the Patriot gets killed before the Handyman dies to open another
 Tear elsewhere so the Patriot Tear will respawn.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">15 - Knock Four Corpses Off Columbia Before the Siren Resurrects Them.</span> Challenge Level 4. If you're quick, you can do this right at the start of the level. Have Undertow ready. A ship will fly onto the map to
 dump corpses at the feet of the Siren. Push them off quickly. If you miss the initial chance, you'll have others, but it won't be easy since you'll be under attack. Some reports of the ship missing the Siren and the corpses falling off the map by themselves
 and the challenge being awarded, but you can't count on that. You might have a happy accident, though.</p>

<h2>            XBOX ONE X - Call of Duty Black Ops 4 - Continuous Errors</h2>
                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I would really like to understand if I'm experiencing issues related to my console Xbox One X or if all my issues are related with the latest game Call of Duty Black Ops 4.</p>
<p>Said that I purchased the physical disk not to download the content and on the first day I had to download anyway 50GB and after 2-3 days I had to patch/update with about 10GB... thus please... start making games and publishing games when they are ready
 and not still in Beta or Alfa...</p>
<p>Said that... from the first day of installation of this game till now my console started to give issues every day.</p>
<p>- I experienced an E105 error: I had to reset to default.</p>
<p>- I experienced an E200 error: I had to reset...</p>
<p>- My installations keep stopping and resuming (even if I do not start any game and/or I do not touch anything!): case still open on MS support.</p>
<p>- I had to delete my saved games at least 3-4 times because of an error message (the usual message about the fact that local games are not synched with cloud...)</p>
<p>- Call of Duty crashed in game at least 3-4 times (the first one with "Zed 453 Kinect Devil Error").</p>
<p>- I received at least 3 times the message to try later because the Live service is down... but online Microsoft states that everything is up and running...</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the 12th of October till now I've not been able to play without experiencing issues: every time at least I had to restart the console a couple of times.</p>
<p>In less than 10 days I had to contact MS support 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this the same situation of someone else? Is this the standard level of quality / gaming experience that I should expect on Xbox?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ciao,</p>
<p>HeavySide75</p>

<p>Thank Saeleth,</p>
<p>I already contacted MS support and they were very efficient in supporting me to solve the problem. My issue is that every day I experience a new different issue of some kind. One day is E105... and I solve it contacting support... the day after is E200...and
 I solve it contacting support...then again there is a problem with the saved games... then the Live service in down... then again some other crashes...&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that the console is unstable: every 1hr of run you experience some kind of issue.</p>
<p>This is happening only now with COD... before installing COD&nbsp; (from day one of Xbox One X) I never contacted the support and never experienced this kind of issues...</p>
<p>Thus... it's a problem related with COD or it's an update of the console that made it unstable?</p>

<p>Hey Alberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be happy to provide some input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you believe the issues are caused due to the new call of duty game, then I would suggest to un-install the game from your Xbox and then perform a complete
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a>. If the Xbox no longer experiences the issues, then it may have been caused due to a corrupted game installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Xbox continues to experience&nbsp;issues, based on the description you gave, I would agree with the ambassador that the Xbox may need to be repaired or exchanged. I recommend to contact
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Support
</a>again to go over warranty details and service options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope the issue can get resolved soon.</p>

                    <p>I have a game (Disney magic kingdom) that I cot &nbsp; from the Microsoft&nbsp; Store , I ws up to level 52 or 53&nbsp; when something happened with the game and it reset to the beginning. I contacted Gameloft abut it and they said&nbsp; togo back to who I got the game from&nbsp;
 and re-install the came and it will start back from where I was at before the game tanked&nbsp; but that did not happen. they said you would have saved the procress on&nbsp; the Cloud ervce but that did not happen so my question is , Do &nbsp; you have such a service and
 why do { have to tart thi game fpom the beginning again? Please give me an answer. Gameloft gave me that option if&nbsp; had gotten the game through Facebook. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi Marva,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We can imagine how upsetting it could be when game resets to beginning level. We would suggest follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Launch game app.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Go to Options (the top right corner) &gt; Connect.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You should be able to find two options to restore your game progress as shown in the picture below.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba8f3cbc-4bd8-492f-a469-2dab8cd48088?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ba8f3cbc-4bd8-492f-a469-2dab8cd48088?upload=true" /></a></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>You can try and connect to either of the options and check if you are able to access your game progress.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>However, as the issue is with in-game progress being reset and irrecoverable saved game data, if the issue still persists, we
 would suggest you to post your query in <span><a href="https://forum.gameloft.com/index.php?f=2116&amp;sid=&amp;curpage=flist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Gameloft support Forums</span></a></span> for better assistance.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows Vista wont load. Stuck at a blank screen without a cursor after the Microsoft Corporation loading bar __</h2>
                    
<div>Hey everybody. A little while ago, I updated my Dell XPS M1530 laptop NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS graphics card and the next day, the display was all blue with horizontal lines going through it. There was sound, but that's all
 what I was seeing. I turned it on and off again and again but to no avail. I left it on for a while and then suddenly the display cleared up and the Start up repair screen was on and it stayed that way for 12 hours so I turned it off and then on again( bear
 with me here lol). The BIOS screen appeared so did the OS loading screen later but that was about it. The screen was black. Safe mode wont work, it always stops at<br />
<strong>:\Windows\system32\drivers\crcdisk.sys</strong><br />
<br />
System restore wont work also, it just freezes, Startup repair apparently freezes too, it keeps loading for 12 hours with no change. Im reallly confused and I don't know what to do. Im trying to avoid using the Factory Image Restore since I have so many important
 files that I dont want to delete. I really appreaciate any help over here guys. Thanks =)</div>

<p><span>Hi Vrael,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>How
 did you perform startup repair and system restore on the computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Was
 it using Windows DVD or the advanced boot options menu? Was it using Windows DVD or the advanced boot options menu?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It looks like that updated drivers for the graphics card on the computer caused the issue or it may not be compatible.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest that you try to boot into "Enable low-resolution video (640×480)" startup option and later uninstall the graphics
 card using the device manager and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong> button, click the arrow next to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Shut Down</strong>, and then click
<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Restart</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 one of the following:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You must press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, try again by waiting until the Windows logon prompt appears, and then
 shutting down and restarting your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>On
 the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> screen, use the arrow keys to highlight<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enable low-resolution video (640×480)</strong>, and then press Enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Log
 on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode)</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Open device manager to uninstall the graphics card driver</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open
 Device Manager by clicking the<strong>Start</strong> button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click<strong>Control
 Panel</strong>, click <strong>System and Security</strong>, and then, under<strong>System</strong>, click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></span><span><span><span>‌</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;If
 you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Locate
 the entry for the graphics card right click and click on uninstall</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now restart the computer and check if it works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

    <title>usb external drives not recognized in xp pro 64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chippert  say:</h3>
<h2>            usb external drives not recognized in xp pro 64</h2>
                    <p>I bought an authentic version of and loaded <u>XP Pro 64</u> on my computer because Win 7 was freezing with nVidia graphics drivers.</p>
<p>When I plug in a recently bought Seagate Goflex or any of the new Western Digital external hard drives, they are not recognized.</p>
<p>They do not show on My Computer, or Disk manager at all.</p>
<p>They do show in device manager with a big yellow question mark under "other devices".</p>
<p>I right click on the hard drive in device manager to update driver, and it always fails.</p>
<p>Before you ask, these&nbsp;USB hard drives do work on my other XP Home 32 system perfectly. Cables are good.</p>
<p>I've tried different ports, front and back... no good.</p>
<p>My XP Prp 64 system is up to date w/Windows update and chip software for the motherboard.</p>
<p>Strangely I have a one-year-old WD Passport USB 500 Gb hard drive that works fine on the XP 64 system.</p>
<p>WD techs say I am the only one with this problem. PlugNPlay needs no drivers they say.</p>
<p>I also have IDE/SATA to USB cables w/power cable, I use to connect my old internal drives.</p>
<p>Works fine on the XP Home 32, but I get a <u>"USB to ATA/ATAPI Bridge"</u> error in device manager with the 64 bit system.</p>
<p>Yes these devices are all "enabled".</p>
<p>Something is missing on the XP 64 system.</p>
<p>Help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>Been searching for a solution for a week now.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows Vista might be the best option though here<br />
are&nbsp;a few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer as&nbsp;2nd drive (best)&nbsp;or an External<br />
USB drive case and then backing them up to removable media such as CD, DVD, or other USB drives.&nbsp;<br />
Of course a real computer shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer</span></a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.</p>
<p>A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<p>Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your<br />
system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get there.</p>

<p>You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it<br />
only has to be bootable).</p>

<p>These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.</p>

<p>If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.</p>
<p>You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data) or a repair installation<br />
(hopefully saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.</p>
<p>You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own<br />

<p>If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.</p>

<p>Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD)</p>
<p>c:</p>
<p>cd\</p>
<p>cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (there is a space between cd and C: )</p>

<h2>            BitLocker won&#39;t enable on Windows 10 after update on Aug 9</h2>
                    <p>Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On WIndows 10 Pro, I am trying to enable BitLocker and it fails with the message "Bit Locker Encryption Error, Wizard initialization has failed, The system cannot find the file specified". &nbsp;Does any one know a solution to this problem??</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8858e288-8fd2-4283-9978-2d09d8c2021d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8858e288-8fd2-4283-9978-2d09d8c2021d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried running&nbsp;bfsvc.exe %windir\boot /v &nbsp;and it also show some missing files.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e11fc4f-2c72-4220-9a10-a0c14b68a7f5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6e11fc4f-2c72-4220-9a10-a0c14b68a7f5" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This stated with the update on Aug 9.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More history on my problem. On Tuesday Aug 9 an automatic windows update was installed on my computer. This update included boot security updates. When I rebooted the BitLocker screen did not display. I only saw a blank screen but if I entered the pin, my
 machine would boot. I tried suspending BitLocker and running bfsvc.exe %windir\boot /v which did not help the blank screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I talked with MS and they backed out the updates which did not help. Next another MS technican also made some changes to the bitlocker manual/automatic settings and tried to reboot. Because of the changes my machine would not boot and MS then said they
 could not help me anymore I needed to call the manufacturer. After figuring out I needed to enter esc and the encryption key I got my computer to boot again. Then tried to disable BitLocker and it complained about group setting. Ran bfsvc again and this has
 led me to where I am. MS Tech support will not help me and keeps referring me to the manufacturer and hanging up on me if I get insist the help.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Brenda,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would be happy to assist you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Before I assist you I would like to know the information below,</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do you have a Windows 10 copy of the operating system?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you check whether the Bit locker is ON or OFF using the steps below.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Can you verify if BitLocker is enabled or disabled on your device? You can Enable/disable BitLocker by going to Desktop and follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Swipe Right to Left to bring up the Charm.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Choose <strong>Settings.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Choose <strong>Control Panel.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Select <strong>BitLocker Drive Encryption</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Verify whether <strong>BitLocker is on or off</strong> on each device.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>Also I suggest you to enable the WinRE so that you can enter the bit locker key and proceed.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When <strong>WinRE</strong> is disabled, you cannot enable BitLocker, and you receive an error message that resembles the following.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>This PC doesn't support entering a BitLocker recovery password during startup. Ask your administrator to configure Windows Recovery Environment so that you can use BitLocker</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The solution would be to manually enable the windows recovery environment:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Copying the winre.wim file from <strong>c:\windows\system32\recovery\</strong> to a folder on a recovery partition. (The partition need to have a drive letter at this point.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Set the RE Image path. Example: reagentc /setreimage /path r:\recovery\windowsre</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Enable RE with command: reagentc /enable</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>(You may remove the drive letter for the recovery partition after you have done this.)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Bit locker will be enabled.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists, suggest you to post your query on the below link.</span></span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot, this helped me to re-enable BitLocker after replacing hdd. I used samsung data migration utility to move everything to a new ssd (this includes windows partition which I unlocked before the transfer + system partition + recovery partition).
 Then everything seemed to work fine, except that I couldn't re-enable BitLocker - it complained on some wrong bcd paths. I fixed them to point to corred harddiskvolumes, then BitLocker presented me this "cannot find the file specified" error. I found your
 answer, checked the RE status and it turned out to be disabled (though winre.wim was present in the copied partition). After re-enabling it per your instructions, BitLocker finally worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Windows Movie Maker - Can you split up one video into multiple - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr19th  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Movie Maker - Can you split up one video into multiple videos&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I uploaded 2 hours from an 8mm video tape and want to split it up into different videos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can do them one by one with Movie Maker, but is there a way to go through the whole 2 hour video, splitting each separate video, individually and then save them all as separate videos where they're split?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do them one by one will take all day. If Movie Maker does not offer a feature to do this, does anyone know of another video program that does? I have 30 8mm tapes that have about 40-50 different videos in each and I want to save the clips individually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You</p>

<p>Also, it&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

<p>Auggy, the last mini dump file was on 10/8 at 8:43 pm. Its the only file one in the folder.</p>
<p>I think the problem might have been resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last thing I did was to turn over the swap file sizing to control of windows from the 4,xxx size that was specified at an earlier time?</p>
<p>I haven't experienced a screen freeze since Sunday.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If something new happens I'll let you know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again. It's great to know if you dig deep enough you'll find an answer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype calls not connecting</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 10 with the latest version of Skype as of the 13/12/2017.<br />
<br />
When I try call any number, including numbers I have called in the past, it will not connect. It instantly disconnects and says 'Missed Call from Number _______________".&nbsp; I can still call Skype accounts but not phone numbers. I do have credit, $4.54 to be
 exact.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>lease provide us below information to isolate the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Are you getting an error message as Skype calls not connecting?</p>
<p>2. Does this happen to one contact or multiple contacts in Skype?</p>
<p>3. Is it just one specific number you can’t call?</p>
<p>4. Is your Internet connection strong enough?</p>
<p>5. Have you dialed a valid number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you! I look forward to your response.</p>

<p>I think I have the same problem. I paid my monthly fee, and can connect locally, but when I put in a mobile # for a UK friend. It rings twice and hangs up, even though I've paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I selected UK in appropriate box, and then used his phone number within England.</p>

            I'm on Windows 10- but I don't think this is my issue. The system "rings" twice, and then hangs up. BTW, I am running with a fairly new Surface Pro computer, but I doubt if the HW has anything to do with my issue.

<p>1. No Error message. Just calls disconnects and it says 'Missed Call'.<br />
2. Multiple Contacts</p>
<p>3. No it's multiple phone numbers, including phone numbers I have called in the past.</p>
<p>4. Yes my internet is strong enough.</p>

<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
&nbsp;I have forgotten my password for my Skype account and my hotmail address is attached to my skype account. I have gone through the whole procedure so as to send my the new password in my hotmail account but it appears that I am facing some serious problems
 with receiving emails from the Skype team. I have made sure to put the *** Email address is removed for privacy *** sender in the safe ones, but I still can't receive any email from them. As a result I can't access my Skype account and it's high likely that I'll loose all my contacts.
 I can't ask for help from the skype's customer service because it is necessary to sign in so as to send them an email with the problem and therefore I couldn't see any other alternative but to contact your team in order to explain why I cannot receive the
 necessary message I need from them in order to have access again in my account. Please help me find a solution to this problem. Thank you in advance for your help!

<h2>            Mail&#58; Account already exists</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a new windows 10 PC with the AU installed. The user account is not linked to a Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided this morning to try the Mail app instead of using OWA. (N.B. I have office 365 apps installed on the PC as well, including Outlook that is setup to use the same account, though I had been hoping to get rid of that if Mail works).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I opened up the Mail app from the windows menu which showed a blue screen and "Accounts. First things first. Let's add your accounts" with a "+ Add account" button. nothing else (i.e. no settings menus or anything else at all).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I click the button and choose the ListItem marked "Exchange. Exchange, Office 365" and enter in my 365 email address when prompted. the click "Next". Whereupon a box shows that informs me that "Account already exists. There's already an account setup
 to use *** Email address is removed for privacy *** (company name)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly uninformative as how would one attempt to sign into an account that
<em><strong>doesn't</strong></em>&nbsp;already exist?!</p>
<p>How can I correctly add my account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Note: I have seen a couple of related questions that recommend running a Powershell command with administrator rights. None of them however explained what the command actually does so I have been reluctant to apply it.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, T</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Type 'email account' in Windows search or the Settings app search box to find 'Add, remove or manage Email accounts'.&nbsp;When you click&nbsp;an account a Manage button comes up. Your Email account has probably already been setup there but not yet set to Sync (Email

<p>los logros se guardan en el servidor de xbox para siempre</p>
<p>lo que este amigo quiere y no se puede es volver a jugar los juego y sacar los logros otra vez y no es posible lo que ustedes le dicen solo resetea la consola y al querer volver a jugar el juego NO TE VA A DAR EL LOGRO ya que esta registrado previamente</p>

<p>Concuerdo con SMX Matrixnez lo que el amigo Drako quiere hacer no es posible, lo único que puedes hacer amigo es crear otro perfil y jugar de nuevo tus juegos para obtener los logros en ese nuevo perfil y los DLC y contenido extra los podrás utilizar en
 ese nuevo perfil sin problemas.</p>

<p>No &nbsp;se puede y ya ! </p>
<p>pero no se guíen por los logros </p>
<p>si quieren volver a jugar un juego jueguenlo porque quieren </p>
<p>no para que tengan la motivación de que van a sacar otra vez los logros </p>
<p>a fin de cuentas los logros no sirven para nada.</p>

<h2>            The Evil Within&#58; The Consequence &#40;DLC&#41; Achievements not Uploaded</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! So, the second DLC for The Evil Within - The Consequence - was released today. But, I cannot play it, yet, as the achievements for the Xbox One ver. have still not been uploaded to the Xbox servers. It seems they have been uploaded to the Xbox 360 version,
 and both the Xbox 360 and Xbox One Japanese versions, but the normal Xbox One version has not had the achievements uploaded. Please, can this be fixed as soon as posible. I NEED TO PLAY THIS DLC! ^_^</p>
<p><br />
Thanks.</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>This does occasionally happen with new DLC, where the DLC is released before the update. The update is needed, as it updates the core game with the achievements, allowing you to play and unlock them.</p>
<p>I imagine it won't be long, usually the release the update within a few hours of the DLC :)
</p>
<p>Let me know if you need anything further</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p><strong>Original Title: <span>Security rigged too tight!</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Re:&nbsp; When we try to download a PDF file we get the warning box and can't get past it - unable to download even though we have lowered the security level on just about everything coming from the internet.&nbsp; I need to be able to download attachments

<p>Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programs you are having problems with </li><li>Error messages </li><li>Recent changes you made to your computer </li><li>What you have already tried to fix the problem </li></ul>

<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<strong>we get the warning box and can't get past it <br />
<br />
</strong>How about telling what the warning box said ?<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<strong> I need to be able to download attachments etc from E mails<br />
<br />
</strong>By<strong> " download ",</strong> do you mean <strong>OPEN</strong> to view, or<strong>SAVE</strong>to your hard disk ?<br />
<br />
If you meant " cannot<strong> open</strong> pdf attachment ", you need to have Adobe Reader to open pdf files.<br />
Here is the link to install Adobe Reader. It is a free program :<br />
<a href="http://get.adobe.com/reader/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://get.adobe.com/reader/</a><br />
<br />
If you already have Adobe Reader, and still unable to open the pdf attachment from e-mail, then follow this tutorial: (<strong>Assuming you are using Windows mail or Windows Live mail</strong> )<br />
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/236/1/Unable-to-open-PDF-attachments-from-Windows-Mail.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/236/1/Unable-to-open-PDF-attachments-from-Windows-Mail.html</a><br />
<br />
If you meant unable to Save the pdf attachment, what method did you use ?<br />
Did you RIGHT click on the " paper clip " &gt;&nbsp;click Save Attachments ?</p>

<p><span>Hi Thomas,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Are
 you trying to download files using webmail in Internet Explorer or using email client?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 the problem isolated to PDF files only?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the complete warning message that you get?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 the computer on a domain?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you make any hardware/software changes or installed new updates after which the issue started?</span></p>
<p><span>Try the steps below if you are using Internet Explorer and check if it helps. If you are using email client then let us know which email client you
 are using.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Run Internet Explorer in No Add-Ons mode and try downloading the PDF files to determine whether the issue is caused by an add-on.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer- Method 3: Run Internet Explorer
 in "No Add-Ons" mode </span></span></strong></a></p>
<p><span>If the issue doesn’t persist in No Add-Ons mode then, use the Manage Add-ons tool in Internet Explorer to individually disable each add-on to determine
 which add-on is causing errors. See “Option 2: Use the Manage Add-ons tool to determine which add-on is causing the issue”.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Open Internet Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click Tools and then click on Internet Options.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click the Security tab.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Select Internet and then click on custom level.</span></p>
<p><span>5. In the security settings, make sure that File Download is enabled.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Check if you are able to download the file.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Disable antivirus software temporarily and then try to download the files and check if the issue persists. Do not forget to re-enable the Kaspersky
 Internet Security 2010 after troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span>Warning:<br />
</span></em></strong><em><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus
 software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></em></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>

<h2>            inherit std&#58;&#58;vector using constructors</h2>
                    <p>This question must have been asked more than once, but I cannot find a working answer anywhere.&nbsp; The goal is to create a class based on the std::vector class and use the range checking in addition. The code,&nbsp;literally taken from a book by Stroustrup (sp?),&nbsp;is
 below. I can't get it to work, it won't compile on VS2013.&nbsp; It is the&nbsp;statetement
<strong>'using vector&lt;T&gt;::vector</strong>;' that is the culprit.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue could be caused either due to a permission issue or due to some corrupted system files for that user account.
</p>
<p>Try the following methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to run check disk on the hard drive to see if there are any corruptions.</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li><strong>Command Prompt</strong>, type the following command, and then press <strong>
ENTER</strong>:&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p><strong>chkdsk /f</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on a bad sector might be lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once Check Disk completes, boot the computer and then check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Perform System File Checker (SFC) scan. </p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. SFC scan will scan for corrupt system files on the computer and repair them.
</p>
<p>Follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin).</strong></li><li>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>:
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong> DISM Commands.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fix Windows corruption errors by using the DISM.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer to the below link on how to perform DISM commands.</p>

            XP cannot burn an .iso natively. You will need third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a> ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data.<br />
