<p><span><strong>Hi Parsamsim,<br />
<br />
</strong>1. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
2. Were there any changes made prior to this issue?<br />
3. What is the format type of the file you are trying to publish?<br />
3. Does the issue occur with a particular file or with all files?<br />
<br />
Try the below steps: <br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
<br />
</span><span><span><strong>Step 1:<br />
<br />
</strong>Before starting with the troubleshooting, I would suggest you to create a restore point so that we can undo the changes if something goes wrong.<br />
</span></span><strong><br />
<span>How do I create a restore point manually?</span></strong><span><br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions</span></a><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
<br />
Once you’ve created a restore point, try executing the following steps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and use F8 key. Under Windows Advanced boot options select Safe mode and hit Enter.<br />
</span><span><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode):<br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a. Once you login to Windows in Safe mode, Press Windows + R which open the Run box.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b. Type<strong>moviemk /safemode</strong> in the search box and hit Enter. This should open Movie Maker in Safe mode.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c. Click on Tools and then click on Options. Under the General Tab, you’ll find the location of the temp folder like<strong>C:\users\administrator\appdata\local\temp.</strong>
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d. Now copy this location. Click on Start; in the start search paste the location and hit Enter.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e. Create a new folder and name it as temp1.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f. Now re-open Windows Movie maker; Under the General Tab, change temp to temp1. In other words, it should look like<strong>C:\users\administrator\appdata\local\temp
</strong>to <strong>C:\users\administrator\appdata\local\temp1</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>g. Restart your computer back to the normal mode and then check. You should be able to open Windows Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
Also refer to the below link:</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Error message when you try to publish a movie to a DVD by using Windows DVD Maker in Windows Vista: "Unspecified error":<br />
</span></span></strong><span><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949281" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949281</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong><span><br />
<br />
<span>If the issue still persists, check Event Viewer entries to find the faulty module that could be causing an unspecified error.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a. Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, clicking Administrative Tools,
 and then double-clicking Event Viewer.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b. Click an event log in the left pane.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c. Double-click an event to view the details of the event and let us know the faulty module that is causing the issue.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Access the below links to know more about Event Viewer:<br />

<p>Hi AjiBade,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may be due to recent changes made on your Surface and it sounds like you had previously created a
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4027579/windows-10-create-a-password-reset-disk-for-a-local-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Password Reset Disk</a>. Do you have this USB disk available to use to reset the password?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, if you're on Fall Creators update, you can try to reset your PIN from the Lock screen. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>In the Lock screen, click the <strong>I forgot my PIN</strong> link. (If you have multiple accounts, make sure to select the correct account first.)</li><li>Type your Microsoft account password.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select the recovery email address from the drop-down menu.</li><li>Complete the hidden part of the email challenge.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>On your phone or using another computer, using the recovery email account check for the Microsoft account code and enter it to verify your identity.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Continue</strong>.</li><li>Set up your new PIN.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Once you've completed the steps, you'll be back on the sign-in screen, where you can use the new PIN to unlock your device. If the password reset option isn't available on the Lock screen, it's likely because you're not running the Fall Creators Update yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find additional steps at&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4028457" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset your Windows 10 local account password</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you weren't able to reset the PIN and still can't login, we recommend that you contact our
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Answer Desk</a> for assistance. Let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>

                    I have a NexStar CX 3.5" drive enclosure that I am trying to use with my Windows 7 laptop. It's been a few years since I've used this device . . . it worked fine last with my Windows XP pc.&nbsp; It spins up when the power is on but the laptop doesn't load
 drivers or even recognize that it is connected.&nbsp; Disk Management doesn't show an external drive.&nbsp; I cannot find a Windows 7 driver online or from the manufacturer, Vantec.&nbsp; Any suggestions?<br />

            <p>Hello John,</p>
<p>The problem isn't your drive or the lack of a driver. Windows 7 sometimes has trouble recognizing external drives, regardless of type. First, a troubleshooter to recommend to you:&nbsp;
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Windows_USB_diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Windows_USB_diagnostics</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, a freeware application to recommend:&nbsp; <a href="http://download.cnet.com/AOMEI-Partition-Assistant-Standard-Edition/3000-18512_4-75118871.html?tag=mncol;1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://download.cnet.com/AOMEI-Partition-Assistant-Standard-Edition/3000-18512_4-75118871.html?tag=mncol;1</a>&nbsp;- use the Direct Download Link only.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The point of installing the program is not to format or partition your drive, but rather to use it to recognize your drive in Windows 7. To achieve this, make sure your external drive is hooked up to the USB port, install the app, and then select the external
 drive and choose Properties. That's all you need to do. Once recognized, Windows will be able to recognize it on its own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            Windows will not detect my monitor through HDMI</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original Title: HDMI No Signal</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to connect my laptop to an external monitor, however the monitor is not detected by Windows. Apparently lots of other people have had this problem, but I have been unable to find a solution.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am running A Dell Inspiron 15 7000 Series with Windows 8.1 Pro with an Intel HD 4400 and an Nvidia GT 750m.<br />
I am attempting to connect to an Asus monitor via an HDMI cable</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already attempted updating, uninstalling and reinstalling both graphics drivers and loading on the Dell recommended drivers, to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The monitor works fine with any other device I have. The HDMI cable is undamaged and works with any other device.</p>
<p>I can connect to the monitor when I boot my computer into Ubuntu Linux. </p>

<p>It the keyboard was an exact replacement and you didn't even need to install drivers, then let's go back to before the keyboard was installed to see if we can correct whatever the installation did.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p>It's possible the new keyboard affected the video driver (or he may have loosened the connections with the Video card and you may need to go back in an check them and make sure they are all properly&nbsp;attached).&nbsp;<span>Go
 to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (<strong>and you should update the driver, firmware, and/or software for your video card at least</strong>), do so from the computer vendor
 or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

                    I have Windows 10 and run Kaspersky Total Security.&nbsp; I have several issues now that I have Windows 10.&nbsp; A pop up window on the lower right tells me occasionally&nbsp; that Kaspersky and Windows Defender are turned off, I have turned off Windows Defender to
 prevent conflicts, another window says that the computer cannot connect to the Kaspersky portal, finally, if I click on the Kaspersky icon a window pops up saying loading the app.&nbsp;

            You need to reinstall the KTS.<br />
<br />
Proceed as follows:<br />
1) Make sure there is an activation code for KIS | CAV | KTS, nominally delete it:<br />
<a href="http://support.kaspersky.ru/12188" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to remove Kaspersky Total Security 2016</a><br />
<br />
2) After rebooting normally remove any "leftovers" from the anti-virus utility:<br />
Uninstall utility Kaspersky Lab's products (kavremover) - http://support.kaspersky.ru/common/service<br />
<br />
3) Download the latest version of antivirus and install it using your activation code.<br />
<a href="http://goo.gl/oFVXN4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KC 2016 - 16.0.0.614</a><br />
Update the database and restart the computer.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Disk IO 100&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zs21kzen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Disk IO 100&#37;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<br />
<p>I'm finding that Windows 10 is spending a huge amount of time and resources doing disk IO.</p>
<p>TaskMgr will show disk IO pegged at 100% for extended periods of time - stopping the machine from doing anything useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got it to improve ever so slightly by stopping the qos filter driver using fltmc.</p>
<p>Windows 10 doesn't let me turn off Defender, so I've added my root folder as an exclusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the new FileCrypt driver is slowing things down, but that can't be disabled. I don't know much about FileCrypt - is Win10 forcing disk encryption without a way to turn it off! If so, wow, that's a dangerous policy, as so many apps perform
 really badly with disk encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it stands, the Windows 10 file system just isn't fast enough to be used in any sort of production environment (my environment is software development).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question to the Microsoft community is:</p>
<p>Have others seen this persistently slow disk IO behaviour, and is there any realistic way to get Win10 disk performance to that of Win7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You,</p>
<p>Peter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment: Windows 10 Pro</p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>Thanks for your quick reply. It's encouraging to know Microsoft Support staff are around to help.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, um, the Windows Troubleshooter doesn't really give any useful solution, but thank you for your information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, for those experiencing this issue, I have found the solution:</p>
<p>Turn off Windows Defender.</p>
<p>From the front-end controls, Windows Defender can't be disabled - at least not for longer than 15minutes (not sure what the point of that is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it can be done in gpedit.msc. Of course, you will need permissions to modify this.</p>
<p>Here's a link that shows where to make the change:</p>
<p>http://www.tenforums.com/antivirus-firewalls-system-security/5879-permanently-disable-windows-defender.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be stressed that if your Windows 10 machine is connected to the internet at any time, you should have other security provisions in place before turning off Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this solution helps others.</p>
<p />

<p>Disk IO stays close to 100% - Windows slow disk IO / bottlenecking performance on disk IO behavior really has to be addressed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this problem&nbsp;is stemming Microsoft's antimalware approach, while it's needed, is far too clumsy and heavy handed - IOW fix the antimalware disk IO bottleneck , possibly this way :</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- quick checksums for KNOWN good signed apps , like Google Chrome - STOP fighting not built here mentality and provide free certification to alternate vendors you know make quality software..</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Is cooperative multi-tasking in the OS finally dead ? IOW are vendors like Google Chrome actually disk IO hogs ? If so then push back on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Excuses do NOT feed the bulldog - OWN this problem Microsoft !</p>

<br />
<br />Had that same problem here on a couple of computers as that update and other updates were installed yet showing either as not installed or requiring restarts that did not help. 
<br />
<br />So I did a Repair Installation specifying to Install Updates and all is fine on those systems now. This is actually pretty easy to do. 
<br />
<br />A Repair Installation which allows you to keep the programs and data though redundant backups are always a good idea.

                    <p>Hey Microsoft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this issue for a long time, pretty damn sure other Modern Combat 5 players do too. Every time I change my kill sign in MC5, and then I close the game. And open the game, my kill sign would have reset to the previous kill sign that I had. Its really
 annoying, especially, since I worked really hard to get that kill sign, and now I can't even equip it. I am really pissed off. Please fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Love this game, although its becoming a little bit laggy, and I feel like if Gameloft, are spending more time in mobile version of the game than in the PC version. (OR is that just me?!)</p>

    <title>Need Windows 7 compatible TWAIN drivers for HP scanning application, - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barryng  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Windows 7 compatible TWAIN drivers for HP scanning application, PrecisionScan Pro 3.02. W7 Drivers not available from HP</h2>
                    The scanner (HP Scanjet 7450C) appears normally in the Device Manager. It works properly using both a third party scanning application (VueScan) and the native scanning application in Nuance's Paperport. Niether uses a TWAIN interface. However, whenever
 PrecisionScan Pro starts, an error message is displayed stating "Sorry, the scanner could not be initialized (Scanner not found)".<br />
<br />
Running PrecisionScan Pro in XP or Vista compatibility mode does not help. I have downloaded the Vista 64 bit driver from HP but it will not install. The install dialog states that the existing driver is a better driver.<br />
<br />
I&nbsp; believe this is a Windows 7 compatibility problem with the TWAIN drivers provided by HP.<strong><br />
</strong><br />
It is important to for PrecisionScan Pro to work properly because it is used by Paperport and provides much functionality that is not available from the Paperport native scanning application.<br />
<br />
HP stated they will not provide Windows 7 support or drivers for this scanner because it is not a current product. This is frustrating as there is nothing wrong with this scanner and an equivalent replacement is over $700.<br />
<br />
Any help would certainly be appreciated.<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            ArnoldGuy, I eventually did find a workaround solution and it includes running virtual XP.<br />
<br />
It is important for us to use PrecisionScan Pro because it allows much greater productivity and scan adjustments than does the minimal Paperport native scanning function. As a result, this problem has caused a significant disruption over the past two weeks.<br />
<br />
The Vitual XP solution works but unfortunately forces a number of undesirable compromises. First, I could only get PrecisionScan Pro to play nice with the scanner under the 32 bit version of W7. I had to do a second clean install in less than two weeks and
 now am limited to 2 GB of memory (wasting the 4 GB memory I just bought). Both Paperport 11 and 12 are unstable under Virtual XP when working with documents on a real (not a virtual) drive. They both crash if I only click on a thumbnail of a document that
 resides on a real drive. Strangely, if I load a document residing on the virtual drive into the viewer immediately after starting Paperport, it becomes mostly stable. Paperport is annoyingly sluggish under Virtual XP, sometimes almost to the point of being
 unusable (especially after scanning 20+ two sided pages). It also has some strange behavior like frequently not showing desktop thumbnails correctly. In other words, we found a workaround but it is a pain to use and requires us to run the 32 bit version of
 W7. Although I do not frequently scan documents directly into Microsoft Word, Word will also not see the scanner and I get the same error message that PrecisionScan Pro gives.<br />
<br />
My wife and I are both extremely offended by HPs behavior over this problem. To say I am angry would be an understatement. I certainly do not expect HP to provide free support for a six year old scanner. However, since this scanner works as good now as the
 day we purchased it and still suits our needs very well, I tried to initiate a pay per incident support call.&nbsp; HP responded by bluntly telling me they would not provide any support, paid or otherwise. The supervisor then went on to say we needed to buy a new
 scanner. We have a small real estate business and simply cannot afford to trash perfectly good equipment. The problem is almost certainly a TWAIN driver issue because the scanner properly installs as shown by the Device Manager. Therefore, I cannot understand
 why it would be difficult to resolve. Actually I do understand and that is what upsets me. It has everything to do with forced product obsolescence. I look around this room and see four other HP products including a Laserjet printer, a fax/printer/scanner,
 and two other color printers and I feel betrayed by a company that has had many years of loyalty from us. This does not include the HP color printer and fax/printer/scanner we were forced to replace last year when we purchased a Vista computer and found no
 Vista drivers were available.<br />
<br />
Sorry for ranting but this is going to eventually drive us to buy a new scanner and an equivalent replacement is over $600.00.&nbsp; Good customer support is every bit as important as the quality of the product. I think HP makes an excellent product and that is
 exactly why we have always purchased HP products over the years. However, their customer support, by what I believe to be intentional design, simply sucks.

<div><br />
</div>
<div>Whenever I play a full screen game, the game doesn't display properly. Have a look at the 1st picture and you'll see what I mean. The game in the pic (Euro Truck Sim 2) is running a t 1152 x 720 resolution, but it displays the same at any resolution. With
 my other games, they display in gray &amp; white in full screen, but display normally in windowed view. My graphics card driver is up-to-date. I've tried messing round with the game setting&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650 graphics card, and I'm running Windows 8.1 64-bit.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Check if the same issue occurs while playing the game.
</font></font></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>Again, as per the compatibility of the game with Windows 8.1, it is voted as compatible. Refer to the link to get the details:</font></font></font></p>

<div>Hi Pinaki,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your response. I have found out that Windows update didn’t install the latest update available. I have downloaded the latest driver from Nvidia and now all my games are working again. I thought Windows update would have
 the latest driver, I should have know. Only at Microsoft!</div>

<h3> irock99  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Boot Camp Activation</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a new MacBook Pro because a reoccurring problem wasn't able to be solved.&nbsp; I didn't deactivate Windows 10 on my boot camp setup before giving them the old laptop.&nbsp; Now when I try to activate Windows 10 in boot camp on my new laptop it says
 the product key is already in use.&nbsp; Is there anything I can do or do I have to purchase a new product key?&nbsp; I tried to activate by phone but that failed as well and the "support" person I talked to kept telling me to contact my reseller after trying to explain
 the problem multiple times.</p>

            Hi iRock, 
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, I don’t think this will be easily remedied. That particular key was never deactivated, and even though it’s probably not even on that box anymore, it’s still being used. 
<br />
<br />I’d continue to call back MS support and see if they’ll play ball. I know you probably have the number already, but I’ll give them anyways.
<br />
<br />I have 2 links below - MS support numbers, and the Microsoft Support Virtual Agent
<br />

<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us</a>
<br />
<br />If no dice, you may have to purchase a new key. I know this isn’t what you wanted to hear, but I hope it sheds some light on it.

<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete Cloud Saves</h2>
                    I tried the settings to storage and there is no place to go any further to delete my cloud saves. I can delete saves but not working on one game. Playing Sniper 3 and all the cache boxes are open. The site said to delete save then delete cloud save on
 xbox live. Cannot delete cloud save from my xbox. Any suggestions welcome. Thank you.

<h2>            &#34;System&#34; General tab varifies 2GB Memory, but My Computer Information - General in &#34;Help and Support&#34; states only Capacity&#58;512MB</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently i repaired and upgraded my old&nbsp;'puter only to be told by Windows XP Professional that there were too many new devices and that i had to check whether my software was genuine and where i was then&nbsp;led to check this&nbsp;automatically online.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Notwithstanding that MS tried to tell me&nbsp;that my software was not authentic at first, while&nbsp;all the while they were&nbsp;trying to sell me some horse pucky OS,&nbsp;it took&nbsp;a bit of persistence to&nbsp;get over that hill with my old donkey cart..&nbsp;Eventually i got the MF
 MS online system to&nbsp;agree&nbsp;that my software&nbsp;was compliant. Now i'm left with a bit of a delema thought, because&nbsp;although after trying everything&nbsp;i've found to do with the problem on the Internet&nbsp;and&nbsp;even used the following line in my multi OS boot.ini file
 to no avail:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="DualCore Microsoft Windows XP Professional" /noexecute=optin /kernel=ntkrnlmp.exe /hal=halmacpi.dll /fastdetect /PAE /forceresetreg /maxmem=2047 /numproc=1 /pcilock /debug</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... i have at least however&nbsp;got my processor which was never&nbsp;previously a dual core 3GHz, but is now a 3.2Ghz to register&nbsp;a second processor for the first time in&nbsp;7 years&nbsp;in the "Control Panel" /&nbsp;"System" General tab. As far as i know the processor only
 supports hyperthreading technology and is not a dual core. The tab there also very correctly varifies my&nbsp;expensive&nbsp;2GB Memory upgrade, but the damned&nbsp;"My Computer Information - General" in "Help and Support Center / Use Tools to view your computer information
 and diagnose problems / &gt;View general system information about this computer" states that i only have a "Capacity:512MB" under "Memory (Ram)" .&nbsp;This supposedly after a "Please wait while information is being collected..." along with a nice&nbsp;progress bar and
 % progress statement and all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now i've even gone so far as&nbsp;using "Rundll32.exe syssetup,SetupOobeBnk" for both&nbsp;a telephonic as well as an online re-Activation twice already to no avail, in order to try and get my memory to register it's full 2GB and not just 512MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could somebody please tell me what gives? Has my&nbsp;"XP Professional" system (maximum 4GB memory) been downgraded to an "XP Home" edition&nbsp;(maximum 512MB memory) system now? If so, how in&nbsp;tarnation do i sort this one out then, other than having to go to court
 or something?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fortunately i got by without having to do a reinstallation of software, but i still have the EXACT SAMEWINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL OEM CD TO INSTALL&nbsp;WITH SP1 that i bought with my system 7 years ago. Of course the software was subsequently upgraded to SP2 and
 then i integrated the disc with an SP3 and made another installation disc which i installed the current install from &nbsp;whenever it was that SP3 became available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The motherboard, case and power supply is all that is still the same computer though. My hard drive was upgraded 2 years ago and&nbsp;ram&nbsp;was upgraded a year ago. Also i got a 21" LCD screen for Christmas and a MS Natural Ergonomic Keyboard for a birthday present
 last year and they all plugged in&nbsp;without any problems. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So all that was really upgraded now was the&nbsp;processor and heatsink and fan, (only because no-one stocks the plastic clutch motherboard pins for the Intel&nbsp;Smartfan anymore)&nbsp;the graphics card&nbsp;, a faulty mouse and a new M@DISC, DVD ROM. Now don't get me started
 on the problem with DVD ROMs and&nbsp;the the big cash cow that they've become&nbsp;next to OS's and processor fans, but those are all the facts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thankyou for any help to find my 'puter's full&nbsp;memory capacity in advance. My own memory is shot to bits so i might forget to thank anyone later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boxy</p>

            <p>Oh just out of&nbsp;interest sake and in addition to the above, my Phoenix - Award Bios Cmos Setup Utility (P4M80-7A)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reports:</p>
<p>Base Memory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;640K</p>
<p>Extended Memory 2095104K</p>
<p>Total Memory&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2096128K</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i have 2x 1GB cards and both motherboard slots are now therefore maxed out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BUT, (and that's a big but) while searching around for an explanation i found a memory scanning utility here...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.crucial.com/systemscanner/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>...and&nbsp;this i subsequently ran. Crucial then offered me a $59 memory upgrade based on the following online report:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<font>
<p>Memory:DDR PC2700, DDR PC3200</p>
<p>Memory Type: DDR PC2700, DDR PC3200, DDR (non-ECC)</p>
<p>Maximum Memory: 2GB </p>
<p>Currently Installed Memory: 512MB</p>
<p>Total Memory Slots: 2</p>
<p>Available Memory Slots: 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together witn nice little&nbsp;diagramatic sketches showing my existing memory to be configured as one memory bay highlighted with 512MB and the Other EMPTY
</p>
<p>of DDR PC3200 Memory</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just to add to that, i took full note of a response to a former&nbsp;post here&nbsp;and installed and ran the "Genuine Advantage Tool" and got the following message:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have successfully completed the KB892130 Setup Wizard</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does that mean anything? Nope didn't think so when everyone is still trying to punt horse pucky!</p>

<p>Hey Andrew E</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP home or pro, both share the same hardware configurations,memory included....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, my good golly gosh old fellow you're right, and that means that things were looking much more grave than i had ever thought before. Sorry, what i should have said was that it looks as though My "XP Pofessional (which Includes Service Pack 2 2002 © 2004
 )" has been downgraded all the way to an "XP Starter Edition" in so far as the functionality of the 2 Gigs of memory that i have installed is concerned...

<p>...and that just made me a whole lot madder than what i ever was before! Thankyou for your response, but really, i'm sure i could have done without it. As for the rest of your response, i've no idea what you're trying to imply? Actually, i've never heard
 so much poppycock about memory and button batteries in my entire life before. Certainly it's been of no help whatsoever with the problem that i explained in great detail. This is by either running "Msinfo32.exe" from Start/Run/Open or by selecting it from

<p>Page File C:\pagefile.sys</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>As one can see something must be wrong because the "Total Physical Memory" should be registering 2.05 GB and not 512.00MB and the "Available Memory" should be registering the remainder of the difference between whatever is currently being utilised by the
 sytem and 2.05 GB. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further to that there was not a single conflict exclamation icon in "My Computer"/ "Control Panel" / "System"/ "Hardware" / "Device Manager". Then in "Help and Support" Centre / "Pick A Task" "-&gt; Use Tools to view your computer information and diagnose problems"
 / "My Computer Information" / "-&gt; View General system information about this computer" (with the disco lights progress bar and % update, suggesting that information was being polled, re-evaluated and varyfied before being presented) it was also telling me
 that under the nice big blue highlighted heading for "Memory (RAM)" i had on had Capacity: 512MB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My memory cards are 2X Patriot PSD1G400 PC 3200 400 MHz CL3, bought together at exactly the same time about 8 months ago from the same distributor in packages that i still have. They could resell as brand new and no-one would even stoop so low as to think
 otherwise, because i extracted the cards from the flexi cases without tearing the wrap around sticker that seals the packages. Haven't had a problem putting them back in the packages and taking them out again when i did memory swaps either. Apart from the
 Patriots, i also have 2X Hynix PC3200U - 30330 1GB DDR 400MHZ CL3 along with their empty flexi cases. Unfortunately those cases are not sealed. They are from my sons PC which he left to me before emigrating to Australia. His motherboard packed up well before
 he left and he decided to rather buy a laptop than spend anything on a repair. Buying a replacement motherboard would have entailed having to buy new memory as well as a graphics card. He definitely did not want to share any memory with video memory and would
 therefore want to dissable the onboard graphics and fit it with a dedicated video graphics card.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it seems that if he had repaired it, he would be sitting with the same dilema that i was. Since both PC manuals which i now own are still in brand new condition and state that the maximum memory per slot is 1Gig, we would look bloody stupid trying
 to mess around with 2G cards on our motherboards, wouldn't we?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Point of fact is that all that i was looking for on my system is the 2Gig of memory which i'd installed and which was most definitely in good working condition and ready to be utilised by the system. My hardware and the 4 other OSs (Operating Systems) that
 i have installed agree that i have got 2Gigs of working memory. XP itself agrees in most instances that i have 2 Gigs of memory, but as i have already explained, even although it said that i've got the memory installed, it was refusing to make use of it. Without
 a shadow of a doubt it was memory that is in very good working order and the only reason i could find in my poaranoia for it not having been made available, was that MS must be denying me the benefits of the memory upgrade because of too many changes to my
 hardware. Why, even DX Diagnostics told me that i had 2Gigs of memory, so whatever you're drinking or what ever it is you're on about, sounds like a bunch of "Gobbledigook" to me Andrew E.</p>

<p>Just so's you know, in 1985 i built my first PC XT 8 MHz with 10 MB hard drive and EGA graphics card with DOS 2.0 on 360Kb floppies which i still have in a box somewhere. i've built all my own PC's ever since. Do you even remember the "new millenium" fiasco
 and world wide conspiracy theories that evolved from it? Well i took a job as a techy sorting out PC's and we got past all that BS with a little tweak program or a system card in 386's and older 486 PC's and P1's that couldn't handle the rollover. Some systems
 were done with BIOS rewrites. There was no such thing as BIOS flashing. Most of the BIOSs were still on EPROM and i still have an EPROM Erasor that can hold about 50 EPROMs for erasing under ultraviolet light which i used to come home and fill up practically
 every night before taking them into the office next morning where there was an EEPROM writer. So yes dude, i've probably checked more PC's than you've had breakfast and i should have known or guessed it, but 1999 was quite a while ago now and&nbsp;a time i'd rather
 forget...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>... and if i ever feel the need to reminisce about those times again i'd prolly join that forum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So now i'm at the point where i've had enough of chasing after technology and since i've sorted this problem out now i'll probably be happy with the system i've got till the end of my days, unless a&nbsp;system comes along that can print me a new "Cyborg Bette"...</p>

<p>...every other month when i'm in the dog box and it has a genuine 3D holgraphic screen...

</font>&nbsp;</font>
<p>... otherwise i'm quite happy with the productivity i can get out of my current system thankyou. So now i've got a lot of begging for forgiveness and kissing and making up to do, because in the meantime i chased the dog out of the house, kicked the cat off
 the bed and when my wife asked me how she looked, i asked her if she used a fork lift to get into her skinny jeans. So i'm in quite deep here and sleeping in the dog box, so&nbsp;i whish they'd hurry up and make those Cyborg Bette printers so that i can maybe get
 some, because i don't think i'll be getting any for at least the next two weeks now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, my sons PC parts are what i used to upgrade my system and the only difference to be found on the Hynix memory cards from that system is in the font of the printing for the part numbers on the stickers. The one print font is bold and narrow and the
 other is lighter and broader. My son did his upgrade with single 1G cards which were purchased within a couple of months of each other, but they were also purchased from the same outlet. The one card seems to have a batch number 0802 while the other is 0827.
 Apart from the font difference, the part numbers and the bar codes for them are exactly the same on both cards and there is absolutely no physical difference between any of the double sided chips or other components on the cards or in the PC board layout to
 be seen even with a Hensoldt 90mm 4X magnifying glass. They are therefore an as matched pair as one is ever likely to find from the keenest and best of the two bit Junk Mail component sellers anywhere in the whole Country, including yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, not only did the memory cards continually register the correct amount of memory in the BIOS without fail, even when the cards were mixed with 256MB and 512MB cards, (which i also still have several matched pairs of) but they tested with 0 faults
 with a boot CD application you might want to try sometime before you spew another bunch of unfathomable "Gobbledigook"...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My R1 coin sized 3V lithium "KTS Made in Japan" button battery measures 3.218 Volts DC on my Fluke Digital Multimeter. The battery has sweet Fanny Adams to do with the OS anyway! It's only there to maintain the BIOS and date and time clock settings on the
 motherboard. BIOSs today are almost all auto seeking plug and play and the date and time clock for OSs can be set online by atomic clocks if one so desires. It's hardly even a necessity to maintain the BIOS settings anymore because the processors are so fast
 today that they could "Auto" poll and check every interupt, port IRQ and DMA and parse the information to a file in memory and rewrite itself everytime the system starts up, before you can say Jack Sh... Robinson.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unplug your system from the mains and take out the battery in your own system for an hour and leave it out. After an hour use the jumper JP1 on the motherboard to short the BIOS to ground just to make doubly sure that the BIOS is left with only it's default
 settings and that your clock is not still set at the current date and time. Plug back the AC and restart your PC and then break into the BIOS and restore your settings. In order to check this, just make sure that you also reset your date and time from the
 default. Mine's default was somewhere in the year 2005 or something and i did that several times with different combinations to no avail, long before i came looking here for an answer. Use whatever keyboard key it tells you to, to continue the boot cycle after
 the different startup screen than one gets when they leave the Memtest86 CD in the DVD ROM tray. Select the CD ROM as your first boot device when you restore your BIOS settings. Then boot to your OS after booting up with the Memtest86 CD and see for yourself
 if leaving out the battery has had any affect or makes any difference to the workings of your OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, you may turn off your 'puter for a short while without replacing the motherboard battery and your BIOS settings will still be retained in the CMOS memory, ("Nonvolatile BIOS memory") because whatever chipset it's stored in will have drawn the power
 it requires to maintain the memory from the capacitors in the AC power supply as well as from what's left in the capacitors on the motherboard. So there's something for you to go and check out probably for the first time yourself, before you sit and spew another
 bunch of gobbledygook about what i should go and check. Don't forget to replace your button battery back on the motherboard before you close up the case again, because now that i've got you riled up a bit, you just might forget to.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's what i did umpteen times with still no effect or change to&nbsp;ony 512MB that Windows was seeing. Then it struck me! Let's see if there's an updated BIOS, i thought to myself? So i went along to my motherboard manufacturer's website and sure enough
 there was. A BIOS update that was made only 2 years after the BIOS that came standard with the motherboard. They had three different ways to flash the BIOS too, but i opted to do it right from Windows. Of course i backed up the old BIOS information first before
 doing so, but now....</p>

<p>Thankyou Microsoft for not having downgraded my system and forgive me for ever thinking that you did. Hope you learned something too Andrew E. No hard feelings man. It's just my nature. You need to see the smile on my dial when i'm saying stuff, because
 i don't give a sh.. hoot about diplomacy and i tell it exactly as i see it. That makes me a very tactless person, and often wrong, but i mean no harm. My nose wasn't always like this, my mouth got it that way!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it's to sort out the HAL.DLL i forced into my startup and seeing if i can restore just a single processor. However, so far it's not given me any problems and it sure looks good having two prcessors, so i wonder if i should even bother? What if one day
 i suddenly suffer from amnesia, or develope alzheimer's? Hmmmm, decisions, decisions, decisions...</p>

<h2>            Control key is automatically pressed in DELL 5520 Inspiron in WINDOWS 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a help regarding the issue. The problem is so irritating that I am not able to continue my regular works in my laptop. The control key is automatically pressed whenever I start up the system. Pressing control key again makes the problem away for sometime
 but it appears again after sometime or if the system is idle for long. I used the virtual keyboard to see if it helps or not. But that is too irritating. I am using windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me to get rid of this issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

            <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Santanu for your reply. But I tried it much before you said and it is not working at all. Still I have the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem has been found by lots of user. Please find the link below for further reference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-hardware/control-key-is-being-pressed-automaticallyand-not/4621b2c7-c7e5-4e95-a68e-4d8ef3749ae9</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found an alternative solution which is not good at all. After logging into the system I presse "Ctrl +" to disable the automatically pressed ctrl key. I also activate "On-Screen Keyborad" from Control Panel &gt;&gt; Ease of Access Center navigation to check
 whether the Ctrl key is pressed. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem arises again in the midst of work. The biggest frustration is that then the aforesaid temporary solution doesn't work at all. For example I am writing on Microsoft Word and suddenly it starts acting as if Ctrl key is pressed. I have to restart
 the system which is the only option. &nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really frustrating. This issue is causing a havoc in my work. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I strongly believe this is noting to do with Dell Hardware. Rather this is driver issue. I wish Microsoft could find a solution for this issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Rakesh</p>

<h2>            hotspot with android smartphone</h2>
                    
<p>salve, da due giorni non riesco più ad accedere ad internet con la mia console xbox. è da più di due mesi che sfrutto la funzione hotspot del mio smartphone android (Mediacom smartpad mini mobile), non disponendo ne di un router ne di un pc. A volte facendo
 la verifica della connessione mi da un problema tra internet ed xbox live, altre volte passa la verifica ma mi dice che ho il NAT di tipo ristretto. facendo da hotspot con un altro smartphone la console si connette ad internet. facendo da hotspot con il mio
 smartphone ad un'altra console, non si connette... Non può essere un problema del telefono in quanto l'altro smartphone si connette all' hotspot... esigo una soluzione tempestiva in quanto, come altri utenti il servizio live gold è stato pagato.&nbsp;</p>
