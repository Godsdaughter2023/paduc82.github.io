<h2>            Windows Vista - Codec Pack Update Checker</h2>
                    <p>I've had the Windows Vista - Codec Pack Update Checker pop up at system start for the past month and it will not disable after answering Yes to the prompt "Do you wish to disable future update checks?".</p>
<p>So I decided to click yes, to hopefully stop it, Norton&nbsp; identified it as vicious malware.</p>
<p>How do I get rid of this?</p>

            <p>I made a mistake we have vista, but I tried the solutions anyways.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Had a couple of problems trying these solutions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>1.&nbsp; When I tried to uninstall the Codec that you have installed and then try installing the Codec from this link:
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=507&nbsp;&nbsp;
</a></p>
<p>I got this error:&nbsp; This version of media player codecs can be installed only on Windows 2000, XP, and Windows Server 2003.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>and the link to Windows Installer Clean Up no longer works.</p>

<h2>            D3DX error</h2>
                    <p>When I run a game that according to the developer is in DirectX 11, I get the following error: X: XD3D_InitPerDX: CanÂ´t create D3DX content ! Error: D3DXERR_CAPSNOTSUPPORTED</p>
<p>Can there be a problem with my graphics card that it would not support this interface? I have AMD Radeon 520. When I played this game on an older laptop with Windows 7 and an integrated graphics card, it worked.</p>

            Hey Koko,
<br />
<br />I would recommend a reinstallation of Windows Defender, which can be found here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure to click "Windows Defender Antivirus for Windows 10 and Windows 8.1" and then 32 bit or 64 bit, whichever is appropriate for your system.
<br />
<br />If you have any other questions, feel free to ask :)
<br />
<br />Regards,
<br />Carson

            The Error code means the update is not applicable, possibly due to a 3rd party AV being currently installed. Is this the case?

            Hey Koko.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.   If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.  
<br />
<br />Then if necessary Update Windows Defender manuallly following this guide:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/update-windows-defender-manually-windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/update-windows-de...</a>
<br />
<br />Latest Definition Updates are here:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/definitions</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>i encountered a problem last time wherein my computer slows down, i did clean and optimize my computer and updated my windows yet twas still slow. When I downloaded anoher antivirus, I had a lot of viruses that never showed up on my windows defender.&nbsp;</p>
<p>it already updated earlier before I read your messages. but i will still try to uninstall my third party antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I'm only using Malwarebytes.</p>

            Hi Koko -
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Locked Folders - Documents and Settings</h2>
                    
<p>My "Documents and Settings" folder on my C: drive is locked - it has a padlock on the folder. Nothing I do changes this. I am the administrator, logged in as such. I can't look at the folder, change it's security settings - I an't do anything with it. I
 have other folders witht he same thing, including my profile folder under "Users".<br />
<br />
This is a a Vista upgrade, but it was a basic vista setup, just one user (me) and nothing else installed as it was a new hard drive.
<br />
<br />
Why on earth are my folders, on my computer, locked to me?</p>

"Documents and Setiings" is a Junction point, not a folder. All it was there for was to facilitate legacy programs operating in Vista.<br />
There is nothing in it anyway.<br />

<p><span><strong>Thank you for your assistance.&nbsp; Neither of the fixes you suggested worked. The scan did not find any errors.&nbsp; (</strong></span><strong><span>Windows Resource Protection
 did not find any integrity violations.)</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I tried disabling the drive and then enabling it a couple of times, but that did not work either.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I'm still getting the "Save As" box&nbsp;on boot or wake-up. The&nbsp;filename is always the same: "NsPdf.PDF". I tried saving the file, but that
 didn't do anything.</span></strong></p>

            <p>No I tried both of these and neither worked. &nbsp;This problem only started about 2 months ago, quite a few months after I installed windows 10 (from windows 7) &nbsp;And, &nbsp;the error message includes more than one of my removable drives. Further more, when I looked
 up drives, &nbsp;windows showed them but referred to them as 'portable drives'. &nbsp; Three of the drives for which windows shows the error message, are for camera memory card slots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more problem with windows 10 which microsoft seems unable to fix, but a particularly irritating one.</p>

    <title>Problem with Ethernet connection&#33;&#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> savemebarry  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Ethernet connection&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My Internet has been down for the past two days because my Ethernet connection comes up as "Unidentified Network". :(<br />
<br />
I use a Sky Broadband router connected to a Netgear Ethernet switch. The cable runs through the walls, so I'm hesitant to get a professional on board to fix it, especially not if it's nothing to do with the cable itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried unplugging everything and rebooting the network as well as updating my drivers, but nothing has panned out so far... That said, I'm not good with computers so I might have done it wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be much appreciated. :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Unidentified network</strong> sometimes happen because of an unconfigured IP address. In that case, assign a static IP address to your
<strong>PC.</strong> Before doing it, kindly check the IP address your router has. To do so, kindly follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>On the <strong>Search box</strong>, type <strong>CMD</strong> and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>ipconfig /all</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>From the results, note IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and preferred and alternate DNS server addresses.</li><li>Close the <strong>Command Prompt.</strong> Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>
to open <strong>Run</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now you've taken note of the important details, try these troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows + R </strong>to open <strong>Run</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>ncpa.cpl</strong> and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your <strong>Ethernet connection </strong>and go to <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCIP/IPv4)</strong> and select <strong>
Properties</strong>.</li><li>In the available fields of the box that opens next, type the same addresses in their corresponding fields as you noted from the command line, except for the IP address. The IP address should be incremented by one (for simplicity). For example, if the IP
 address for the wireless NIC is 192.168.0.5, assign 192.168.0.6 as the static IP address of the wired NIC.</li><li>Click <strong>Ok</strong>, close all opened box, and check if your issue has been fixed.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how things goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Windows10 &#34;Main PC&#34; can access File Sharing of two PC&#39;s, but they cannot access Main</h2>
                    <p>As the title suggests, we have three computers in a small office, all on the same Workgroup. file sharing rarely works.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At first we couldn't see (The two secondary PC's) the Main PC, but the Main PC could see our computers in the Network and could access our files.</p>
<p>Yesterday I've been looking for some solutions and came across the Installing SMB 1.0 client, I also started some services that were on manual and weren't running such as Function Discovery Resource Publication and UPnP Device Host.<br />
<br />
After I started those services I could see the Main PC, and even accessed it, but day after I couldn't access it.<br />
Now I can just see it in the Network and ping is fine, but get message "The remote computer isnât responding to connections on port 445, possibly due to firewall or security policy settings, or because it might be temporarily unavailable. Windows couldnât find
 any problems with the firewall on your computer. "</p>
<p>
</p><p>however I did netstat -a -n and all computers are listening on port 445. I even turned off firewall on all computers but then I get "The device or resource (BESTIJA) is not set up to accept connections on port "The File and printer sharing (SMB)".<br />
<br />
I have read this thread and it's a similar issue, but no solution is made:&nbsp;<br />

Please help, if you need files from the windows diagnostic tool, I'll provide it.<br />

<h3> bryanqin  say:</h3>
<h2>            16 bit application support with Win7 32bit on Lenovo T460s laptop</h2>
                    <p>I need run some 16 bit applications on my Lenovo T460s laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I knew there are some limitation, &nbsp;16 bit application only can run on 32 bit system. &nbsp;64bit , Win8 and later can't support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I'm installed Win7 32bit Pro on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But i meet very&nbsp;strange problem. When 16 bit application load, just stop with a line cursor blink in DOS window and no any output. Check the taskmgr, found the NTVDM.exe used 25% CPU resource, but didn't report any error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we use one old laptop(Intel Broadwell CPU) installed same OS, the 16bit application will work as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, suppose these is not a software problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any Hardware dependency for 16 bit application in 32bit Win7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any limitation in CPU to support 16 bit application since the Lenovo T460s used Intel Skylake CPU( i5-6200U)?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Bryan, seems you are not alone here.</p>
<p>I bought a HP ProBook 440 G3 - with the same i5-6200U CPU and because of some corporate app a office 97 component has to be installed. The setup fails with the same problem - ntvdm.exe taking 25% CPU time (one core on high load).</p>
<p>So far I found out that it must be some CPU detection/ntvdm compatibility&nbsp;issue as the ntvdm.exe stack ends with HalInitializeProcessor.</p>

<p>Enclose your setup.exe with START......./B (Don't ask why - it works in my case)</p>
<p>For instance:</p>
<p>START "%~dp0..\SRC\x86\disk1\setup.exe /s /f1%_TEMP%\setup.iss /SMS" /B</p>
<p>Please try and confirm.&nbsp;If needed (does not work)&nbsp;try also the switch&nbsp;/SEPARATE</p>
<p>Amazingly, the same setup runs fine&nbsp;under Windows 7 64bits, although the setup is in fact a 16 bits apps made with InstallShield</p>

            <p>Hi<br />
I've a similar problem, but not on Lenovo.<br />
But all symptoms are totally the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Hardware is <br />
Motherboard: Asus H110I-PLUS-D3<br />
CPU: Intel i5 3.20 GHz 6MB LGA1151 Skylake<br />
RAM: 4 GB DDR3, 1600Mhz CL9 Kingston 240 pins<br />
Disk: Samsung SSD 500GB 540MB/520MB 850 EV</p>
<p>
</p><p>OS: Windows 7 Professional 32 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been told from the PC vendor it is because the Skylake processors new Chipset supporting Skylake does support 16 bit applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But regarding to reply's on Expert-Exchange this is not true, so really do not know what to believe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I manage to solve it by using a VM ware Workstation virtual machine with Win 7 Pro 32 bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted&nbsp;the following&nbsp;question on Expert-Exchange.com for this, and got the following answers:</p>
<p>

</p><p>Qvotes from Expert-Exchane:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;"Have you tried the following?</p>
<p>&nbsp;Optimize How Windows 7 Runs 16-Bit ...<br />
&nbsp;Tip:Optimize How Windows 7 Runs 16-Bit and MS-DOS-Based </p>
<p>&nbsp;Most existing 16-bit and MS-DOS-based programs were originally written for Windows 3.0 or Windows 3.1. Windows 7 runs these older programs using a virtual machine that mimics the 386-enhanced mode used by Windows 3.0 and Windows 3.1. Unlike on other recent
 releases of Windows, on Windows 7 each 16-bit and MS-DOS-based application runs as a thread within a single virtual machine. This means that if you run multiple 16-bit and MS-DOS-based applications, they all share a common memory space. Unfortunately, if one
 of these applications hangs or crashes, it usually means the others will as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;You can help prevent one 16-bit or MS-DOS-based application from causing others to hang or crash by running it in a separate memory space. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;1. Right-click the programâs shortcut icon and then click Properties. (If the program doesnât have a shortcut, create one, and then open the shortcutâs Properties dialog box.)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;2. On the Shortcut tab, click the Advanced button. This displays the Advanced Properties dialog box.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;3. Select the Run In Separate Memory Space check box. </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;4. Click OK twice to close all open dialog boxes and save the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;NOTE: Running a program in a separate memory space uses additional memory. However, youâll usually find that the program is more responsive. Another added benefit is that you are able to run multiple instances of the programâas long as all the instances
 are running in separate memory spaces.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The CPU itself should be fine with old DOS applications. 16 bit apps will not, however work on a 64 bit OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Another problem is that a few old applications use CPU timing loops, and fail if a CPU is too fast"</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is related to how BIOS handles the CPU and the memory. <br />

<p><span><span>As such the hardware manufacturer is responsible for providing the drivers for their devices.<br />
If the driver is provided for your device and the device is compatible to be used with Windows 7 then you may also get the drivers through windows update. You may also check with the manufacturer for the same.</span></span></p>

            Hi Meghmala,<br />
<br />
I am using the Sweex Irda converter and I want to buy an Uwatec Irda Dongle for the dive computer.<br />
Both the manufacturers don't have an Irda-driver for Windows 7 (yet).<br />
Because we are leaving for a diving holiday within a few months and want tot take our netbook with us (with Windows 7 on it), it would be nice to have any Irda-driver available.<br />
<br />
Thanks for&nbsp; your help.

            Hello Meghmala,<br />
<br />
Thank you for the answer.<br />
I downloaded the IRExpress USB&nbsp; Irda controller from the Sweex website and installed it on my netbook.<br />
After that I tried to get it working by using the compatibility mode on the two .exe KC Technology files. I put them to XP service pack 2 and because it didn't work to SP2.<br />
Both didn't work at all. So it seems this will not work. I still get code 28 "no driver installed".<br />
<br />
I also tried to put both drivers mentioned on my XP machine in the Windows/system32/drivers directory of my netbook, but this also didn't work. On my XP machine it is working quite well and I tried to take these setting to the Windows 7 machine.<br />
<br />
It is strange that Microsoft will not support infra-red devices any more by offering an universal infra-red driver, or not??<br />
<br />
However still thank you for your help. I will stay with XP on my home computer for some years, till my diving computer will brake down and I have to buy a new one :-)<br />
<br />
Edzo

<p>To be honest I don't think MS will be supporting some hardware, it's up to the manufacturers to provide drivers. I recently bought a Belkin USB Irda device and it doesn't work because the drivers won't work. It's close to impossible to even contact Belkin,
 I seriously doubt that they'll create a driver that works under Windows 7. That's still not a Microsoft problem though, Belkin support isn't one of the best I have experienced.</p>
<p>The <span><span>compatibility mode option never worked for me on Windows 7, not with Irda, my older HP printer or scanner. The one good thing about sticking with older versions of Windows
 is that you don't have to replace older hardware that still works fine. I'm gonna figure out and see if I can get a refund for Windows 7 and reinstall the XP version I had on here. A shame really because I do like Windows 7, but it's useless tome if it won't
 let me use (some of) my existing hardware. </span></span></p>

            I don't think I made it quite clear. The game requires a restart once installed, so I actually haven't played it or tried to yet. It is then after the required restart has been done that it goes into that repair procedure mode.

            That did not work, it does exactly the same thing.
<div><br />
<div>However! By doing some more investigating of my own, I found that it is a problem with drivers that are installed by the Starforce Protection, which is used to ensure that the game is genuine. These drivers I found are incompatible with windows 7 if below
 version 5.5. I found on the Starforce website a driver updater however it seems that it does not fully update all the drivers.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I uploaded an image here showing which drivers need to be digitally signed and updated. Also the version of the drivers in the bottom right.</div>
<div><br />
<div><span><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/854/driverz.png/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/854/driverz.png/</a></span></div>
<div><br />
<div>It is the StarForce Protection Environment driver that does not get updated.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So after running the driver updater provided by the driver producer, the laptop will restart. Once it has restarted my laptop will pop up with a notice saying that, that driver is disabled due to&nbsp;incompatibility&nbsp;issues. Also I find that the driver version
 shown in the bottom right of the image does not change. Then when I try to run the launcher, the StarForce Protection program thinks that the game still has only just been installed and there has been no restart.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So! That is as far as I got, and I do not get the repair procedure on startup if I update the drivers using the program. Any further ideas?</div>

I will try it when I have some time because I had to resort to downloading

    <title>Start Menu&#58; Show more than 3-medium-size-wide Columns. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> seanballhorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start Menu&#58;  Show more than 3-medium-size-wide Columns.</h2>
                    <p>If Microsoft is going to include tiles that can take two Medium spaces (Wide and Large), then IMO it is absolutely moronic to make the columns only 3 Medium tiles wide.&nbsp; That forces you to either have massive spaces between Column groups that force you to
 scroll more, or Wide/Large Tiles so small you can't read them or are cut off.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
EXAMPLES: https://imgur.com/a/LCpjx<br />
<br />
This just seems like common sense.&nbsp; The Start menu should have the option to Scroll
<strong>either</strong> vertically or horizontally. &nbsp; It should behave exactly like 8.1 with regards to the columns, meaning
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">what tiles are <strong>in</strong> the column/group decides the column width</span> (or length if scrolling vertically). Lastly 3rd party programs like Oblytile should be re-allowed to create custom tiles/shortcuts. &nbsp;
 The 8.1 Start Menu was a completely customizable full screen version of the task bar.&nbsp; (i.e. what programs you run most often in a completely individually defined space.) - We shouldn't have lost that in 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you agree with me, here's a LINK where you can vote to have this changed:&nbsp;&nbsp; https://windows.uservoice.com/forums/265757-windows-feature-suggestions/suggestions/8897650-let-us-customize-the-tile-groups-width-to-4-medium , but I don't have any confidence
 that the insider pages are even being looked at any more.</p>

            Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After you wake the computer from sleep, the DHCP Client service (Dhcpcsvc.dll) is responsible for informing the IP stack about the routing information. The routing information is stored in the network store interface. This problem occurs when the network
 store interface already has the routing information that the DHCP Client service wants to store. When the storage operation fails, all routing information in NSI is lost. Therefore, the computer loses all the routing information. This includes the default
 gateway.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Follow the steps mentioned below:<br />
a. Click Start, right click Computer and choose Properties. <br />
b. Click Device Manager.<br />
c. Navigate to your network adapter, right click it and choose Properties. <br />
d. Choose Power Management tab. <br />
e. Uncheck âAllow the computer to turn off this device to save power.â<br />
f. Restart the computer and test this issue again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong> You may try updating the latest Network adapter drivers

            This error normally has to do a corrupt file.
<br />A few things to try.
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />If none of that works follow the suggestions in the link provided.

<p>Xbox and Microsoft provide the Xbox.com Community Forums (or âForumsâ for the purpose of this document) as a centralized community site for all Xbox fans to connect and discuss all manner of Xbox-related information, including sharing both content and experiences
 offered across various Xbox products. The Forums are here for the benefit and enjoyment of all members, and are accessible to anyone who agrees to the following guidelines for access and participation to the Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By participating in the Forums you agree to the Usage Guidelines (outlined below), the Xbox LIVE Terms of Use and Code of Conduct, and the Xbox.com Terms of Use and Notices; all of which can be found via the following links:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Xbox LIVE Terms of Use: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/Legal/LiveTOU</a></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Xbox LIVE Code of Conduct: &nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/Legal/CodeOfConduct?xr=footnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/Legal/CodeOfConduct</a></strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Xbox.com Terms of Use:</strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/xboxComTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>http://www.xbox.com/legal/xboxComTOU</b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please adhere to the following Usage Guidelines:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BE APPROPRIATE</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When communicating on the Forums, itâs important to stay on topic. These Forums have been created to provide a channel of communication across the entire spectrum of Xbox and Xbox LIVEâs fan base, specifically for the discussion of Xbox related topics. Please
 refrain from discussing personal matters, verbally abusing any company (including creating negative posts towards Microsoft), product or individual, or from posting content which may be deemed inappropriate or irrelevant for an Xbox community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Posts created to âbumpâ existing discussions, posts created to bypass or workaround the word filter or posts created to duplicate existing discussions are expressly prohibited. Posts created to inform or discuss how to violate the policies found within the
 Xbox.com Terms of Use and Notices and Xbox LIVE and Games for Windows LIVE Terms of Use and Code of Conduct are also prohibited. This includes âmoddingâ your console or otherwise altering the way it was intended to operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BE COURTEOUS</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Forums are an extension of the Xbox LIVE service, and are intended to provide a positive experience for all members. Please make sure that you are not detracting from the community experience for any user. Your opinions are welcome, but refrain from
 personal attacks and harassment of other members, and from posting content which could be viewed as unlawful, threatening, pornographic, harmful, indecent, lewd, abusive and inflammatory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All content posted on the Forums should maintain a helpful and courteous tone, and not be intended to provoke or flame other community members, moderators, or Xbox staff. Polite queries will elicit polite and helpful responses. Ranting or insult-heavy posts
 are more likely to elicit commensurate responses from the community. Also remember - Moderators, MVPs, and most community members are unpaid volunteers who dedicate hours of their time to provide assistance and information without recompense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You should not post your or anyone elseâs personal information on these Forums including but not limited to name, physical or email address, age, phone number, credit card or sensitive log-in information. Furthermore, if any user asks you for personal information,
 such as the information detailed above, do not provide it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BE SPAM-FREE</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the Forums are not to be used for the promotion of third-party services, products, websites and/or organizations. Please refrain from posting content that could be considered advertising, junk mail, spam, chain letters, or any other form of
 unauthorized solicitation. Also refrain from posting âSign petitionâ or âpollâ threads, and instead use a post to start a discussion. This is a much more meaningful way to engage the Xbox community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When coming to the forums for help, try to first use the tools at your disposal to find good content that may have already been posted. Search, pinned posts (labeled âStickyâ and âAnnouncementâ), and posts to the right of the forum view are great places
 to start. If you are unable to find relevant content, create a new post, and be very descriptive about your post in the subject or title. This will help others find what they want to read, and will help you get an answer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Remember that any advice or recommendations offered on the Forums are those of the individual members, and they are not specifically endorsed by Xbox or Microsoft. It is each individual forum membersâ responsibility to follow or not follow any advice or
 recommendation given by another user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BEWARE</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the Forums may be reviewed by a moderator staff, the content therein is not guaranteed to be moderated or endorsed by Xbox or Microsoft. Neither Xbox or Microsoft are responsible for any failure or delay in removing objectionable content or any content
 that is in violation of the aforementioned guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the moderator staff does not generally edit conversations posted by members, they do retain the right to use judgment to determine if any conversations violate these Usage Guidelines, the Xbox.com Terms of Use and Notices or the Xbox LIVE and Games
 for Windows LIVE Terms of Use. If conversations are deemed to be in violation of the aforementioned guidelines, the moderator staff can edit the content of the Forums in whatever way they see fit to protect the integrity of the Forums. It is your personal
 responsibility to be in possession of your account at all times, and the account owner is solely responsible for all Forums content and Xbox LIVE conduct.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, the responsible party for such violations can be temporarily suspended from posting or permanently banned (their Forums privileges permanently revoked), once the moderator staff has reviewed the conversations suspected to be in violation of
 the guidelines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>BE A LEADER</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of your participation requires adherence to the guidelines as outlined above, but also requires that all users perform in an exemplary and commendable manner. Please make full use of the Report Abuse functionality of the Forums, which notifies moderators
 to objectionable content or any conversations which appear to be in violation of guidelines as outlined above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From time to time, the moderator staff may designate certain members with leadership roles. This designation does not imply that Xbox or Microsoft endorse this personâs posts or comments. The designation only allows the community to know when a member has
 performed in an exemplary and commendable fashion, and may, on occasion, assist with monitoring the Forums to ensure its integrity is maintained.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>UNSOLICITED IDEA SUBMISSION POLICY</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft or any of its employees do not accept or consider unsolicited ideas, including ideas for new advertising campaigns, new promotions, new products or technologies, processes, materials, marketing plans or new product names. Please do not send any
 original creative artwork, samples, demos, or other works. The sole purpose of this policy is to avoid potential misunderstandings or disputes when Microsoftâs products or marketing strategies might seem similar to ideas submitted to Microsoft. So, please
 do not send your unsolicited ideas to Microsoft or anyone at Microsoft. If, despite our request that you not send us your ideas and materials, you still send them, please understand the Microsoft makes no assurances that your ideas and materials will be treated
 as confidential or proprietary. Any feedback about the LIVE service or Xbox hardware and games can be left via our Xbox LIVE Wishlist/Feedback forum, here:

<h3> patriotdragunov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One green screen startup animation for 10&#43; minutes followed by plain black screen</h2>
                    
<p>I got my X1 home after a trip to a friend's and I tried to boot up the console and all I got was a green load screen with the animations for about 13 minutes followed by a plain black screen with no error codes.&nbsp;I am aware that this issue is usually associated
 with a system update gone wrong and that the official fix for that is the Offline System Update Diagnostic tool. I have NOT done a system update any time in the recent past, and furthermore the console was not even connected to the internet preceding this
 problem for some time.</p>
<p>My question then is whether or not I should attempt the Offline System Update Diagnostic Tool? If so, which file should I use? I have read the article on how to use the Tool and could not find an answer to this question. All files were&nbsp;either marked for
 if you have just unboxed the console or had a problem with a system update. None address a problem coming out of the blue without any internet connection.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention in this matter.</p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Xbox One green screen startup animation for 10+ minutes followed by plain black screen - this issue is know if the console is not updated correctly.</p>
<p>The best thing that I'd do with this is to do an How to use the Offline System Update Diagnostic Tool on Xbox One and I've chosen the Restore Factory Defaults File, my system went back, however I will need to download all my games again, but don't worry
 all the saved games on your console will be able to sync again since you're using an Xbox One Console/</p>

                    <p><em>Original Title: second monitor in Windows 8.1</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a MacbookPro latest version running on Windows 8.1. I want to use a LG Flatron W2234S as a second monitor. In 'screen resolution' the LG is recognized as monitor 2 with the recommended resolution (1680 x 1050). In NVIDIA Control Panel the LG is also
 recognized as monitor 2 with the good resolution. I use a dongel VGA - &gt; HDMI. Problem: monitor doesn't get any video input and goes into power saving mode. I've updated the driver for the LG-monitor. What can I do to make this work?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hello Bart, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>As per the issue description, I understand that youâre experiencing issue with projecting computer screen on TV with VGA-HDMI dongle.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Are you using VGA-HDMI adapter first time to connect to this TV?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you get any signal or any error message or code when you connect the TV to your computer?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the make and model of the VGA-HDMI Adapter? Do you see the adapter listed in Device Manager?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you checked if the TV connects to any other computer with the VGA-HDMI adapter?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If you get no signal on computer or TV when you connect your TV to your computer through a VGA-HDMI adapter, possibly the adapter is not communicating with the two devices.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I would suggest you to check your VGA connections first. Make sure there aren't any bent pins or loose contact point on any of the connections. When you plug in an external device into your computer interface, most computers recognize
 the device and alerts you. If your laptop doesn't make any sound when plugging it in or a window doesn't come up, then make sure your laptop and device are compatible. Windows 8.1 may not recognize your device if it is an older device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(7, 15, 20, 1)">I would suggest you to get a hardware diagnosis performed on the adapter to find out its compatibility and usability.

<h2>            Help connecting Kinect camera. Divers will not install.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: XBox NUI Motor</p>
<p>Kinect camera driver software not successfully installed, Xbox NUI Motor: Device Unplugged, what can I do?</p>
<p>All other device driver components were okay. </p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
