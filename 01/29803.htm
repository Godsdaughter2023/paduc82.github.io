<h2>            How can I remove NoScript add-on from my PC &#40;Windows 8.1 in UK&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I was advised to install NoScript but find it quite unacceptable. How can I remove it completely please? I am using Mozilla firefox.

            <p>This is probably best asked on a Mozilla Firefox forum, but see if '2.3' in this link helps -
<a href="https://noscript.net/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://noscript.net/faq</a>&nbsp;hopefully it'll give some pointers at least.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But as NoScript is an add-on to Mozilla Firefox, you may be better off asking on their forum -

<h2>            1722 error hfs&#43; Please help</h2>
                    I have scan the internet looking for a fix to this problem. I am trying to install the driver hfs+.exe for my external&nbsp;hard-drive.&nbsp;Every time&nbsp;I try I get a 1722 error. I have run the driver as an&nbsp;administrator. Yes it is windows 8&nbsp;compatible. I have tried
 to install it under a&nbsp;different&nbsp;user, installing a kb928080 fix, unreg and rereg windows installer, clean my registry, disable virus scan, disable all programs I have installed on the computer, and I have looked on the forums for seagate and there isn't an
 answer there. This driver works on my other computers. This is a new computer, sony vaio. every other driver works or has installed correctly. &nbsp;I have all of my school data on this hard-drive and I would like to access it again directly.&nbsp;

<p>Try using safe mode with Networking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One possible explanation could&nbsp;be getting interference from a security program, so doing that may prevent it from running.&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that disabling a security interferer is often not sufficient because its hooks are still
 present in the OS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it may be necessary to uninstall it instead.&nbsp;&nbsp; You could get more clues by running ProcMon to supplement and help correlate all the other diagnostics that you already have.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 update icon</h2>
                    I have KB 3035583 installed on my computer in April.&nbsp; I am running windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; As of today I have not received the update icon on my windows 7 Computer.&nbsp; I have received it on my other two Windows 8.1 computers.&nbsp; I thought that the update
 Kb 3035583 would automatically get you the update Icon so you could reserve a copy of Windows 10.&nbsp; My computer is set to receive updates but I review them before installing.&nbsp; I did install the update KB 3035583 because when I checked it said that it was already
 installed.&nbsp; What should I do to get the icon to reserve my copy of Windows 10

<p>Hi Marshall,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are times when after an update is installed devices gets turned off by the system. We recommend checking that the devices is properly installed and configured after the update. Here is
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/005a1acb-776e-4320-b9f2-3a2302a320da/open-device-manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">how you access the Device Manager in Windows 10</a></strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While at it, we also suggest checking Broadcom's website for any updates on their drivers. More often than not when Windows release an update they too would release newer drivers to work with the latest patch for the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of any feedback or should you need more help.</p>

Thank you for your response Jess. This question has so many tricky options that when I check the Device Manager I do see a Broadcom NetLink (TM) Gigabit Ethernet&nbsp;but not any wireless adapters available. So I wanted suggestions on how to install or at least
 detect a wireless network adapter that my laptop came equipped with. Apparently I need to request a driver update with a right click from the installed wireless adapter, is this a true statement?&nbsp;Patiently Marshall.

<p>Yes, Marshall. You can right click and click the Update driver option and allow Windows to search the web for any updated drivers. You can also download the drivers from their website and do a manual installation of the driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are instances however where hardware manufacturers may take time before they make the drivers available, so we recommend checking on this and installing it manually.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I cannot get it to work. I think I found the correct Broadcom 802.11n driver as a zip file but I am fearful that the "lite" Zip opener in the Microsoft store may have some virus. I am resigned to drop my laptop at a local computer repair shop. My fear is
 because the "lite" zip opener has a link to the pro version for only $7.99. I will probably end up paying ten times that amount for repair, but I truly am resigned to get local assistance. Thanks so much Jeff!

<p>
</p><p>My original question to verify I have a wireless network adapter shall remain unanswered. I guess I have no working wireless adapter. Thanks anyway Jeff.</p>

            Hi McBride.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a Navigation Pane with sub-choices to Open Folders, Show Libraries, etc. and a Preview Pane and Details Pane.  Which Folder pane are you referencing in the Explorer View ribbon?  
<br />
<br />Reset Explorer by Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that's not enough go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Should be the same.
<br />
<br />You're referring to Navigation Pane which is also there to select along with sub-features on the View tab.  You can tick the box for Navigation Pane to choose it and also to Show Folders.

Since you re-install Windows 7 and that did not help you need to contact HP Support,&nbsp; check their on-line<br />
documentation and drivers, and ask in the HP forums for known issues.<br />

                    <p>I have the latest Windows 10 just before the April Update 2018, on a Surface Book 2.</p>
<p>Sometimes, typically after leaving the computer to sleep,</p>
<p>windows fail to switch to other applications when edge is on focus. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For example pressing "Windows Logo + E" opens explorer but in the background, and clicking on it at the taskbar doesn't bring it to focus (switch to it)</p>
<p>while edge is on focus, until you minimize edge.&nbsp; As such this renders any mouse or keyboard shortcuts to switch apps while working any useful.</p>
<p>And its super annoying to keep having to minimize edge manually. Especially when you are busy looking for an app you just opened only to realise minutes later that it was open but hiding behind edge</p>

    <title>CRITICAL SUGGESTION FOR FAILED NEW WIN10 PCs. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> taffy087  say:</h3>
<h2>            CRITICAL SUGGESTION FOR FAILED NEW WIN10 PCs.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>1. How many new Win10 Home PCs are now screwed-up, caused mainly by Windows Updates and/or as former Insiders have been saying on other forums, by Microsoft releasing version 1511 before they'd ironed out known problems at least six months ago?<br />
[If I'm wrong on this last point, I challenge someone to tell me so.] </p>
<p>
</p><p>2. And what's the cost to Microsoft? The direct costs of having all the Moderators, MVPs and Insiders spending time&nbsp;dealing with our queries, complaints and to be honest abuse? How many Support Engineers and behind-the-scene staff does MS employ to handle
 this debacle?&nbsp;And the indirect costs - those people could and should be put to more productive use helping Microsoft develop improved/new products.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How many customers/prospective customers will have been lost to Apple and others by this 14 months-old debacle.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. How will MS's balance sheet look once the <del>'Dumb down PCs </del><del>so that Win10 will work on smartphones, wearable devices etc"
</del>sorry, the 'one Platform fits all' has failed as it will inevitable do, and the butterfly** Execs have moved on to other companies? (** flitting from job to job, leaving behind them a trail of disasters?</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. And what about the effect on Microsoft's share Price when that happens? Remember, when they launched Win10 at a Press Conference 13 or so months ago, they told the world that Win10 would "restore confidence in MS after WIn8/8/1, &nbsp;<strong>that the Start
 Menu problems had been resolved</strong>. (sic!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a genuine, serious&nbsp;and 'outside the box' solution: To Upgrade from Win10 Home to Win10 Pro costs about $100. Let's assume a mark-up of 60% so that's around $60 'cost price'&nbsp; - probably much less, I imagine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, Microsoft - give&nbsp;a free upgrade to Win10 Pro and we'll all be&nbsp;your friends
<strong>(and customers)</strong> for life. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To whom should they give the free upgrade? To everyone who 'likes' this!</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get your 'Like' finger working now, please!!</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi Jim. I respect you and what you do for us but I disagree!! (as you would expect).</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) My comments about Microsoft's financial performance are clearly (I thought) looking ahead, not to now. But you've ignored my comments about how much this is costing to deal with so many posts here and the hidden costs of more productive work that could
 be done instead generating more income.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Please me what I have done to 'bring the problems on myself' in respect of my brand-new PC. What could/should I have done to 'prepare'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost my Start Menu, files and photos&nbsp;due to a screwed-up WU - and subsequent WUs have also caused collateral damage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding my screwed-up&nbsp;Upgraded PC, Microsoft lied to me. Their email said my PC had been checked and was capable of upgrading, that I could download the upgrade and install it at a later date - just one click. So I did and the lying *&amp;^"!!*s upgraded my
 PC here and then. NO mention about uninstalling Norton and Third Party software. I won't post links to the very many articles in the financial and technical press that supports this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please tell me Jim - and I know we'll not fall out - exactly what should the populace have done to 'prepare for the upgrade'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I totally agree with you that many users have brought problems upon themselves by not having a firewall/internet security or not updating it. It's a well-known fact across the world - so well-known as to be in the public domain - meaning that MS had
 a legal obligation to look after the&nbsp; - what did one of the POTUS candidate refer to them as? The 'less educated'?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also totally agree with you that we the unloved have no need for the Pro version, that we wouldn't know what to do with them So let me ask you this, Jim:
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Why does the Pro Version work and the Home version doesn't?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Was it because it was developed with the help of the Pros there?</p>

&nbsp;IF</strong> Win Pro would fix the problem, I &nbsp;think it should be done. &nbsp;IF Win 10 Pro DOES solve the problem and MS won't

            <p>You're thinking of the Enterprise version with the options to not auto update</p>
<p>Although pro you can use group policy I believe it's not very effective</p>
<p>yep 108.us with tax to upgrade to pro and yes that is a silly price but is the only way to make 10 half way bearable
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Too early to say if 10 will flop but it did pass up windows x-p users which isn't saying much but not too bad 7 months after release</p>
<p>Although M$ does not say how many people have rolled back to the previous os's</p>
<p>Only referring to downloads </p>
<p>Windows update will auto download which a whole other story with all of the high cpu usage mainly because of the windows update system is trashed by other win-7.. updates being installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So either way the update system is hosed.</p>
<p>Many are very close to using this leap year and just pretend it's 2020 and turn Off the update system.</p>

<p>Darn! &nbsp;I thought the Win 10 PRO was the answer! &nbsp;As for doing a "clean installation of Windows 10",<strong> IF</strong> I have to do that, I might as well take this Laptop BACK. &nbsp;I haven't taken it back because I didn't want to HAVE to start over. &nbsp;I would
 take it back rather than just do a "Clean Install" because that would solve my question whether it's this laptop or not. &nbsp;It's sad that if that IS the only answer.</p>

            If your laptop came with Windows 10 preinstalled, the manufacturer is responsible for OS support, not Microsoft.&nbsp; That's the deal that MS has with computer OEMs.&nbsp; As far as OEM installations are concerned, one of the main problems with them is the bloatware
 installed by the manufacturer.&nbsp; Get rid of all of it as soon as possible.&nbsp; Again, the best solution is a clean installation of the OS.&nbsp;

<p>Doing a clean install on a oem computer only complicates matters drivers wise</p>
<p>With the oem install at least you have the manufacture you can deal with</p>

</p><p>If you go outside the reservation with a clean install then you're on your own they will disown you like a stepchild :p</p>

<h2>            Remote Access Error &#40;Cant find the specified file&#41;&#33; Not able to use datacard on my laptop...</h2>
                    <div><br />
</div>
<div>Hi everybody :) ,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had a small problem with my laptop a few days back ,but it was fixed when <b>
I removed and inserted the battery. But the F drive was renamed to D drive automatically</b>. I think this was the cause of the following errors, which i noticed when
<b>I tried to use my Reliance Netconnect+ datacard and Error 711 (Cannot load the Remote Access Connection Manager Service) showed u</b>p.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried system restore but i noticed it was disabled and so there were no restore points.</div>
<div>A little research showed that Now I have the following errors:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>I cannot start Remote Access Connection Manager (Error 2:Cannot find the specified&nbsp;</b></div>
<div><b>file) and cant start Remote Access Auto Connection Manager (Error 1068: The dependency or group failed to start). Both services are set to manual.</b></div>
<div><b>(Target file is svchost.exe -k netsvcs).</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>System File Scanner showed no error.</div>
<div>Now I change my D drive back to F drive but it doesnt help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>So someone please help me to start these services and fix the netsvcs if its corrupted, so that I can use my datacard in peace!</b>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you guys.</div>

<p>You would have to call support for help cancelling it. Microsoft does have a no refund policy so there is no guarantee they will give you a refund, but phone support would be the only ones who could do that.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a refund on a monthly subscription, then you may be not get it with phone support. Occasionally you may get a customer support agent who has the option to refund you for a monthly gold subscription as a courtesy, but most do not. If
 you're lucky enough to get someone who can/will, I would highly recommend if you call to be as kind as you can, since a monthly refund is not something they all offer, and if they do it would be a courtesy refund which doesn't normally apply with your situation.
 &nbsp;You get more flies with honey! Just a friendly heads up :)</p>

<p>I was dealing with the same thing just now. I was canceling a 12 month gold membership though. I used the chat support on the support page for xbox. The guy said that because I've been a loyal customer--I've basically had xbox live since I was 14 and I'm
 21 now-- he would give me a courtesy refund. However, he also said it is rare that they do that because of the no refund thing they have going on at xbox. Sooo, I guess it just depends on how long you've been getting xbox live for. But, since you payed for
 a monthly, I don't know how lucky you'll get with the refund. It's definitely worth a try though. Good luck!

    <title>Windows 10 Users and Group Names - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonbarkr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Users and Group Names</h2>
                    <p>I was deleting files on an external drive and ran into some issues with main windows-related files which was understandable.&nbsp; I then went to my main drive and looked at the security of one of my file and noticed something odd.&nbsp; My system/account name is
 jb.&nbsp; The system is showing an administrator name as being jb(DESKTOP-TIMV3VG\Administrators) and the user account as being jb(DESKTOP-TIMV3VG\jb).&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My confusion is that in the past I've never seen&nbsp;user/group names&nbsp;resembling this.&nbsp; Has Microsoft come up with a new naming convention?</p>

            <p>The naming convention adopted by Microsoft of ComputerName\UserName (or DomainName\UserName) has been in place since the advent of Windows. The full naming convention was only required when eliminating ambiguity. In a workgroup there could be two users with
 the same name but not on the same computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Users with Admin level privileges appear in two different Groups (Users and Administrators) The 1st example the user jb is getting the rights because he is a member of the Administrators Group and in the second because he is logging on as a User.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes it is essentially garbage because it is the result of a random number generator on the basis that the likelihood of two computers on the same network getting the same name is virtually nil. The name is generated before network connectivity is on
 so cannot be verified as exclusive.</p>

    <title>How do I access hidden admin account Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keb_1965  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I access hidden admin account Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have many Win 7&nbsp;Enterprise workstations deployed and I&nbsp;have used the registry key
<strong>HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts </strong>
to hide the administrator account so the user can only see&nbsp;one login. In Windows XP&nbsp;I could use ctrl + alt + del to get to a login screen where I would enter the admin username and password. Apparently this no longer works the same as it did in XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to be able to gain access to this account at the same time hiding it from view of users.<br />
<br />
I thought this would be a simple thing to setup .. it was in Win XP.<br />
<br />
Please help!<br />

            <p>The workstations are not on a&nbsp;domain .. why on earth did Microsoft decide to disable the option to use ctrl alt del to access the hidden accounts? It certainly isn't user friendly .. seriously, how do you log into a hidden account if you can't enter the
 username and password?<br />
<br />
I must admit though, this is the only major problem I have found with Win 7, it seems to work well in our environment .. but Microsoft really screwed up on this.</p>

            The first question was rhetorical, but I suspect you already knew that ;-)<br />
<br />
I was afraid&nbsp;that a local policy was the only option and then it would apply to all users ... again, not the way I need it to be.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I can still hold out hope for some sort of registry tweak or workaround, even if it will probably never materialize.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/54149df3-3fbf-4690-aa22-21693681f104" title="JA4ta5d">

</p><p>If you are using Skype for Windows 10 UWP, I am afraid to say that there is no option to change the font on this version. You can only zoom in or zoom out on this version. I will take this as a feedback and let our developers know about this. Let's hope
 that this issue will be addressed in the next Skype updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There might be sub folders that are saved on those 2 folders that's why it does not allow you to delete them. A workaround on this is by starting to delete the files / sub folders on that folder on the way up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated on the status of the issue. We will be glad to assist you.</p>
