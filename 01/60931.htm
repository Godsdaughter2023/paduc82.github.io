            <p>You write : <span>Please be informed that Lexmark X8350 is not compatible with Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10.&nbsp; That is not necessarily a correct statement. I have used this model printer with W7 for many years. I was however not successful using it with W10. I
 actually reverted back to W7 after suffering a number of disappointments with W10. The revert crashed and I needed to reinstall a Lexmark driver cjs8300 after a fresh install of W7 and the X8350 continues to work flawlessly. This driver is supposedly good
 for W8 but does not appear to work with W10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>W10 changed too many settings I had set up and I needed to do a slew of research to figure out how to get functionality back. I had the same issue with my SP3.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This was my only time upgrading Windows that I had issues. All other upgrades went well for me. A true disappointment. I guess I ran out of luck.</span></p>

            <p>You're statement is true that Lexmark x8350 working flawlessly for Windows 7. I am actually able to print on Win 10, well at least sometimes. I have the original Install disk for the printer and I have reinstalled it on Win 10. So, like I said , it prints
 sometimes. Unfortunately when I do get it to print, it stops part of the way through. So I try to cancel the print, it acts likes it is canceled but it will not remove it from the queue unless I restart the "print spooler". Then if I want to print again I
 will have to restart my computer or wait some period of time before attempting to print again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im am beginning to like WIn 10 but I just cant figure this out.</p>

            <p>I was able to get the x8350 to work with 64-bit Windows 10 !!<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;## EDIT: (Windows 10, 64-bit install, using Vista 64-bit driver)#</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Instructions assume you have tried to install previously &amp; haven’t removed the driver folder:&nbsp; c:\drivers\printer\8300</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>- remove usb cable from x8350 and uninstall Lexmark software from programs and reboot.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- go into device manager and select "view hidden devices".<br />
- remove any Lexmark device.&nbsp; Make sure, if you have any unknown devices listed under "other", remove them as well, then reboot.<br />
- open C:\drivers\printer\8300 (assuming you've already tried to install, this is the folder where the driver files would've extracted to)
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- </span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>IF</span></span></span></strong><span> you haven't already tried to install
</span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>VISTA</span></span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>64-bit
</span></span><span>driver, download from here:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>- highlight "setup.exe" and select properties<br />
- click compatibility and select Vista. select checkbox to run in compatibility and checkbox for "run as administrator"&nbsp; If you have multiple users, I'd suggest changing that setting for all users!<br />
- use the same procedure to change the .exe files in all subfolders of C:\drivers\printer\8300 with the exception of any x86 folders. &nbsp;There are 5 total, including the uninstall executable.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; ## EDIT:&nbsp; Disregard exception comment.&nbsp; Thanks Tom for pointing out my mistake.&nbsp; I was so happy to get it to work, I missed some detail there. ##</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>- All .exe files in subdirectories of &nbsp;C:\drivers\printer\8300 should have their permissions/compatibility permanently changed to run as admin in Vista compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- Follow the same procedure for </span><strong><span>all</span></strong><span> executables in subdirectories of C:\drivers\printer\8300.&nbsp;
<br />
</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>- once those .exe files are all changed to run in Vista compatibility, now it's time to install</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- 1st, run the setup file in C:\drivers\printer\8300 making sure to keep usb cable disconnected until it's asked for<br />
- next, go to C:\drivers\printer\8300\install\x64 and run setup and instgui.&nbsp; Make sure to run both as administrator<br />
- look in your sys tray and that familiar Lexmark All In One icon with your apps should be there and working<br />
- Caveats, you must select type of scan, open advanced scan settings and DESELECT the ocr box,
</span><strong><span>unless</span></strong><span> you have the original install disk to install the ocr software originally included.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>- install the ocr software from the original install disk from ocr folder (Abbyy Fine Reader Sprint 6.0)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I was able to scan to Word, Powerpoint, Photoshop, Acrobat, Paint and the Lexmark Photo Editor software.&nbsp; I would think, these instructions would probably apply to Windows 8 or 8.1 as well.&nbsp; Good luck!</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>More good news, when sharing this device with other Windows&nbsp;10 and Windows&nbsp;7 devices on your home LAN, the driver install is flawless, once the above is completed.&nbsp; Wired or wireless works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hit me back and let me know how this worked for you. :) &nbsp;</span></span></p>

            This worked! Thank you for posting this. I don't understand why one shouldn't change the exe files in the x86 folder. The install got hung up when the GUI came up &amp; I clicked "Scan" for the 1st time &amp; it started looking for applications. I did change the
 files in the x86 folder when this process failed. Clicked "Scan" again &amp; was able to scan.&nbsp; I hope the app is still there after the next reboot.<br />

            I am having the same problem that your having. I might get it to print 1 page and the whole thing just freezes and won't print. So I go and cancel what is left to print and it just sits in the print spooler. So I have to restart the computer and printer
 to get rid of the unprinted item. I just totally gave up on Windows 10... My printer works just fine with Windows 7....

            <p>Hi Randy P - I tried your above procedure 3 times on my new HP Laptop and could get the driver to install. Each time the Lexmark x8350 install program would get to the step where I plug in my USB cable (new and works on other computers) and stall after I
 plug my USB cable into any USB port. The Continue box stayed dim. So, for some reason, the install program will not recognize that my powered on printer exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your instructions are confusing after I change all the ,exe, files to run in Vista compatibility and as administrator. After I run the first setup file in the 8300 folder, I cannot proceed past the plug in the USB cable step as described above. Then, when
 try to run setup again from 8300/install/x64 folder I, of course, get the message that the installer is still running because I did not cancel the first stalled install yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I reboot and then run setup from the 8300/install/x64 folder, the install again stalls at the plug in USB cable step because the install program will not recognize that my printer exists. If I cancel the install and then run the instgui exe, then
 nothing is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me the exact steps to do to complete the 3 setup file installs and how to get my printer recognized when I plug the USB cable during the installations,</p>
        </p>

            <p>Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just gave up and mothballed the 8350 and bought a more up to date replacement. These devices are too cheap to keep wasting my time trying to get it to work. Is this an example of planned obsolescence? An MFP that worked flawlessly for years and was still
 working great retired before its time. I guess no one expected these devices to last this long.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Taking myself off of the notification. My latest problem with W10 is now front and center. Edge browser keeps losing my favorites, causing me to switch to Chrome and begin to like it. Another mystery a small number of W10 users are facing.</p>

<h2>            Esc key on desktop keyboard does not react on desktop computer running Windows 7 Pro 64x</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Esc key on desktop keyboard does not react on desktop computer running Windows 7 Pro 64x</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now this is an annoying one, which several other users have reported under different threads. Since I couldn't find a post with similar enough symptoms I made my own topic.<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 7 Professional 64x on a one year old <em>(Intel Quad-Core, 4GB RAM, 524GB HDD - In case, for reasons unknown to me, someone needs to know this...)</em> , Dell<strong>XPS</strong> system. Not more than a few weeks ago my keyboards Escape
 key stopped responding on that system.</p>
<p>I haven't done a whole lot of troubleshooting, but these steps have been done:<br />
* Tested keyboard on other system, Escape key WORKS on other system<br />
* Reinstalled keyboard and USB drivers on the XPS system, <em><strong>Escape key does NOT WORK on the XPS system</strong></em><br />
* Connected the keyboard to a never-before-used USB port, <em><strong>Escape key does NOT WORK on the XPS system</strong></em><br />
* Opened and cleaned the keyboard, tested, Escape key WORKS, <em><strong>does NOT WORK on the XPS system</strong></em><br />
* Tested in various applications: Desktop (Esc would close the Start menu), Photoshop, Vegas, Notepad, Full-screen OpenGL games,<em><strong>Escape key does NOT WORK on the XPS system<br />
</strong></em>* Googled for possible solutions, none found...</p>
<p>Note: Highlights show where the Escape button does not respond; on the XPS system I am troubled with.</p>
<p>In case you missed it from my list of troubleshooting steps, the Escape key does work on a different Windows 7 computer system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have yet to garble my self through the registry in hopes that someone might have an idea of steps to follow before I waste a day looking at things I honestly know squat about. Please help if you can; what could be the issue/common application that unbinds
 this key Windows-globally and how could I resolve this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For reference,<br />
No major changes have been made since keyboard stopped responding with the sole exception of:<br />
FireFox updates (Including add-ons Ad-Block Plus, NoScript, both of which were also updated).<br />
Windows Update<br />
A 10.x MB World of Warcraft patch/update about a week AFTER keyboard stopped responding<br />
<br />
Previously installed StarCraft II and World of Warcraft patches, none of which affected my keyboard to my knowledge. I've finished nearly all of StarCraft II and had no issues...</p>

            I know this is a bit old but I was experiencing the issue myself.&nbsp; Thought I had found the problem and had it fixed but then it happened again.&nbsp; Came to find out (by closing a program and testing the ESC key again) that it's because of Photoshop.<br />
<br />
You mention using Photoshop, so that would match up with the cause.&nbsp; Not only that but I did a search ("ESC key" not working Photoshop) and came across a few answers/workarounds for it.&nbsp; One being to use SHIFT+ESC when ESC isn't working.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone.&nbsp; I came across this using my original search ("Windows 7" esb keyboard "ESC key" not working) and know others are likely to see it.&nbsp; If you didn't already learn the cause, in the year+ since your original message, then here you go.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please check whether you face the same issue while logging in the safe mode. It is a possibility that one of the non-Microsoft application or a driver is causing this issue. Let us boot into the safe mode and check. If you are able to use the ESC key in
 safe mode we can perform a clean boot to find the root cause.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step A.</strong><br />
a. Restart your computer.<br />
b. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information gently tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows&nbsp;7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
c. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
d. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows&nbsp;7 Safe Mode.<br />
e. When Windows starts you will be at a typical logon screen. Logon to your computer and Windows&nbsp;7 will enter Safe mode.<br />
f. Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;<br />
Step B.</strong><br />
If it works fine in safe mode try performing a clean boot to find the root cause.<br />
Refer to the article below for steps about how to start your computer in clean boot state.<br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow the step 7 in the above article.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.<br />

<h2>            C&#58;&#92;Documents and Settings is not Accessible </h2>
                    Hi There <br />
Has anyone got the answer to this question?<br />
Why is it that my default user that I created when I first set up my MS Vista SP1 is not allowed access to the folder C:\Document and Settings. The user is set up as an administrator, so surely this user can go anywhere.
<br />
I have created other users as administrators and they can access this folder. It is just my first user that I created has this problem, why is that?<br />
<br />
Anyone who has suggestions I would be pleased to hear<br />
<br />
Thanks Martin&nbsp;

            The Cocuments and settings folder is intentionally blocked even from Administrators because it is now a junction point.
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968829(VS.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb968829(VS.85).aspx</a>.&nbsp; It is not the real location of those files - it's just there for backwards-compatability with programs prior to Vista.&nbsp;
 The real data is in Users (to which you do have some access though there are some folders there that are also junction points).&nbsp; It is blocked by granting the everyone user deny access to the folder (which effectively blocks even administrators from getting
 in).&nbsp; And it's important not to change <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">anything</span> in these folders or your programs may cease functioning properly - that's why they are blocked.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck!

No error messages. If yes, can it do all that winrar does(even compress files)?

            Hi  Erica,
<br />
<br />Since you can get into the Recovery Environment .. . etc. have you tried System Restore, to see if you have a restore point to go back to?
<br />
<br />If not, once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally

            Hi Erica, 
<br />
<br />Yes from Safe Mode, it is best to backup your data, just in case you have to re-install Windows 10
<br />
<br />Yes, just create a folder on your external drive and drag all your files and folder into that . . .

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Final option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.

<br />I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

    <title>The Grumble indie supplement&#58; new year - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hobblejp  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Grumble indie supplement&#58; new year</h2>
                    
<p>Hello and welcome to the first of the new years selection of indie games reviews this is the post Xmas rubbish release version so hopefully all the Xmas thinting will have falled of those terrible Xmas release games. Though considering this review is late
 because my point about indie games changing graphics settings breaking 360s was finally proved true as 5 months after its horrible wired mess of life support gave in and oddly around 5 months since I started these reviews my 360 RRODed. This time it was permanent
 so I’ve given up on the old 5 year old version and now own a nice new slim lined whisper quiet one which means I can now hear the terrible indie game audio.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The next reason this is late is severely reduced internet due to some Kosovans’ stealing the internet cable (and street light power cables) in the local area for the 5th time this year (they’re in jail now its all good). Oh and finally don’t expect me to
 go light on the indie games this issue, I’ve had another message from my ex using another email account made to attack me as she once again blamed me for our relationship break down, world hunger , the Eurozone crisis and basically all the world’s problems
 so on with the least professional most anger filled indie games review ever made.</p>
<p>Note: all reviews unless otherwise stated are based entirely upon the games trial period<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Red Tie Miner</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ok has someone made a mining game template and put it on XNA ? Seriously theres more mining games out than ever all seemingly based on dig dug now. Now having played the game I can see that intro is quite harsh as Red Tie Miner is actually
 a damn fun enjoyable game. It has some kind of plot line a graphics change that isn’t graphics card killing as it doesn’t force the card to behave strangely and an array of mining tools and other items with its own strange take on mining. Game :“Here use this
 Rocket Launcher to min stuff”</p>
<p>Me: “sure why not”</p>
<p>The aim of the game as far as I can tell is to collect money and use said money to buy things to help you escape the mine. One of my particular favourite items being the grapple gun thing that has some real uses and allows you to swing like spiderman with
 some practice.</p>
<p>My only real complaint is that while mostly the graphics are well presented and work on an SD TV the character you play as does seem maybe a little too small, though this issue seems to vanish after a small time playing the game as you pretty much accept
 this is how the game is and learn to enjoy it</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> This games take my favourite part of minecraft – Mining and removes the parts I like less – trying to build something that doesn’t look terrible and having to deal with all the other morons online to do it and still be able to use shops etc.</p>
<p>This game though its novelty will wear off I’m sure in longer play is well worth the 80 MSP asking price</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Temple of Dongorlak</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Dongalor and evil character played by Matt Lucas the series Krod Mandoon and the flaming sword of fire, you might wonder if I’m rambling again but I bought this up for a point and not due to being drunk and confused for one. The character
 has one thing in common with this game, and that’s its love of the ladies. From my best guess this game will play out like a modernised text adventure game, giving you various options and letting you save at various points. It’s a nice idea having a text adventure
 with graphics too but how well it plays out I can’t say as the damn game cuts you off barely into the trial so I have no idea if it’s really worth the 240 MSP asking price or is alot of it is just False *** appeal by having scantily clad characters.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Its 240 MSP for 3 adventures apparently. So if you’re a big text adventure fan you might want to invest in this title however if you’re not and just looking for a small dabble in text adventure land then try Epiphany in space instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Perkuna’s Dragon episode one</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well I went into this review a bit puzzled and not knowing quite what I was about to find only for the game to initially wow me special effects and a narrated story as well as a few jokes such as the difficulty level, This game was almost
 designed to butter me up for and gain a great review, then I started playing it and it immediately felt like the game was out to annoy me as the game as it turns out is a scrolling shoot-em up as a dragon now I generally despise all shoot em ups bar a few
 like “Super turbo space galaxy saver bish bashi special universe Heroes” and “super probotector” (I’m from the UK that’s what we got instead of the popular contra game deal with it). However back to the game, you play as a dragon, a cool concept but the game
 ruins any illusion of cool ness immediately by putting you against the most pathetic enemies ever, no not screaming villagers you have to fight Starlings, you know Starlings those little for the most part harmless birds who can some how harm you a dragon and
 they do a damn good job at it too. You have to fight them using fireballs initially until you unlock your first magic powers in an RPG style twist however the game has one huge flaw, your upgrades are based on your kills so as the games progressed unless you’re
 willing to play the same levels over and over to power up then you can easily fall more and more behind the games advancements. Even the special moves annoyed me as you do a dragon version of the last star fighters death blossom.</p>
<p>After wave after wave on seemingly un ending copy paste enemies I finally reached the first boss, some kind of magic portal that shot blue birds at me, at first having been told it was a portal I tried to go in only to be slapped for stupidity by it taking
 a large chunk of my health so I carried on fighting and after x minutes the portal was still there only no longer spitting blue birds but some kind of black good trying to pull me in. Now having lost a nice chunk of health from before and taking this to be
 another attack so I avoided it, and avoided it and avoided it till I realised nothing was happening then I decided to fly into the thing and it let me progress.</p>
<p>Having done the first level I was treated to a new cutscene only this time it was a much more poorly done scene with no voice over at all (and this was only the end of the first level) something about a dragon trying to get to the kind and the starlings
 having been pests attacking and eating the guys grapes off the wine or something equally bizarre.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 240MSP is just a touch too much for this game which tries to be so much but fails and ends up combining the worst parts of the genres into one by having repeating enemies that you have to fight multiple times to level up to progress and a
 system that seems counter intuitive as having been harmed by something only a moron like me would fly right at the portal a second time, and it’s this kind of logic that kills the game. If this had been 80 points I’d have said it was worth a try as its 240
 stay well clear of it</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Canyon Viaduct</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Ah zombie defence games it seems almost like these things are as common as the XNA massager trend of a couple years back so I went into this with lo expectations and this game proceeded to break them by going lower. The game opens with
 a blue screen, this is the loading screen, a blue screen that makes it look like your 360 has died of a blue screen of death, so you reach the press start screen and do as it says and..... another blue screen of death loading moment, so yeh finally start up
 the game and get told the most terrible plot line since Sonichu was written in a font style that even I could barely read. The plot such that it is, is as follows. You are the chief in charge of a project to build a bridge across and canyon from the human
 occupied side to the side of the canyon occupied for the most part with flesh eating zombies. Now to ask the questions the plot really doesn’t want me to ask.</p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p>No Seriously why would you want to build this bridge, are you working for some kind of evil terrorist organisation trying to destroy the world by letting the flesh eating zombies into the safe zone ?</p>
<p>So as I’ve taken this much time avoiding it you will surely know what my next complaints are and they are all gameplay related.</p>
<p>First the AI in the game, the AI seems to have been taken from the XNA indie game Zombie sniper so the zombies have no AI other than walk blindly towards the target all at the same speed.</p>
<p>The next bit is the target you are defending, supposedly it’s the workers building the bridge however they are less intelligent than the zombies as they stand in one spot done attempt to run back across the construction bridge over the canyon and simply
 stand there yelling help while you in your helicopter gun *** have to shoot aad kill the zombies.</p>
<p>The Final main issue is the game feels broken should a human die the game seems to respawn the next one right next to the first so while the game has a huge area of play for a zombie game you will be concentrated into a minute area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Another Zombie game another I say don’t buy and go get Dead pixels to as its again the same price at 80 MSP but a far superior game in every aspect compared to these near template terrible games.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Itza</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Having installed and downloaded a new patch update for this game I went in with high hopes for a very average puzzle games at best. Only to find the new HD patch means the games is unplayable on my SD TV not only could I not read the rules
 or any other information except on the main screen where leaves kept blocking parts of the text anyway, in the main game I couldn’t understand the instructions as these were blocked by a giant border round the game so I had to play on guess work, and from
 what I can guess this is a more boring version of bejewelled where you have to actively select to join stuff for it to explode.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Avoid like the Avian flu until all the game is released in a working state. Seriously how did this games get through peer review and how did the patch also get through. I know some people might be cheating the review system / giving feedback
 without looking at the game, but for a game to be this inherently broken I can’t believe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Oozi Earth adventures part 2</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Normally I make a point of only playing platformers that bring something I see as great to the table and In this game I have to say it was nothing great it was for the most part a run of the mill platformer. The games begins fine enough
 but then you start up the game I was faced with a loading screen advert that lasted a full minute before letting me continue though on the plus side it did explain the story of the previous game as I haven’t played that one. The game claims to boast 6 full
 story levels in the advert which I’d like to first debate as the first level is for the most part a tutorial so those coming into the game off the back of the first will be 1 level down on what’s actually of any point to them. The controls are some of the
 best platformer controls I’ve ever used they are a special mix of tight and loose that lets you do the job without it feeling slippery or overly rigid so that’s a major plus point shame the health system doesn’t feel right as the health / life system is based
 on points which are gained by collecting stars and as a death is like most other games you’ve been hit once here’s some temporary damage immunity you need lives as there’s no escaping a bad situation with death.</p>
<p>Finally the game fixes one major issue with platformers in that you can look up and down, however the game often requires you to do this or do a platformer staple leap of faith and this is a problem as the although it lets you look it does in some cases
 actively require you to look or take a leap this can be awkward and breaks the flow of the game.</p>
<p>Speaking of breaking the flow of the game, no less than twice in the trail run while playing I had the games advert pop up on me and actively had to close the advert to be allowed to continue the game so that’s put me in a bad mood</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> 80 MSP for 5 levels and at a guess a boss fight in a very average platformer game thats a sequal to another and feels like a bigger game chopped into parts. Avoid theres far better platformers out there, if memory serves me there’s even a
 super Mario galaxy clone available for 80 MSP</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Cro-Mag Racing</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Welcome to the indie games world of kart racing where the true fun of kart games appears to be missed by most developers. This is exactly the case with Cro-Mag racing, the game is amazing the power ups work there are multiple characters
 and karts and all very imaginative tracks etc but one thing missing, and that’s multiplayer at 240 points I’d have been fine with only 2 player offline but for a single player only kart game, 240 is asking a lot. If it had full online multiplayer i’d be on
 the roof top yelling to buy this now even if it were 400 MSP, but alas it’s not.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A Kart racer only for the true hardcore loner kart game fan, there are better indie kart games out there some with multiplayer, buy them instead of this game as we’re not stuck in the stone age anymore and people do play multiplayer</p>

<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> OMG this game looks good OMG it looks so good OMG why isn’t this a retail...... oh wait it plays like I have both feet in casts and a very badly cricked neck. EFRD is a beautiful game with third person shooter aspirations however it suffers
 from the worst controls ever. In most TPS games when you get hit you feel justified in being hit in this game it feels like the game is *** you over, you can’t strafe and move so slow by the time an enemy has fired it’s too late. This issue is further compounded
 by the fact your battery power is your health and also what you use to attack so every single attack drains your health and as you have to be face on to the enemy and can’t strafe you lose health too for being shot</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If you love graphics over gameplay chances are you wouldn’t be after an indie game in the first place and if this game played even ¼ as well as it looks I’d be saying buy now. But even at 80 points a game this broken control wise should be
 left for robots to finish off and hopefully if it says “I’ll be back” next time it will be in a half decent state with working gameplay.</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> Silver Dollar, once again I’m confronted with a Silver Dollar game Oh how you test me. I know you can make good games, Try not to far worked and headshot wasn’t dire Nor was Sins of the Flesh though considering the near 26 other games
 you’ve made your record isn’t great game wise and will either produce a decent to great game or one of the most horrible pieces of waste ever made. So what is this one ? I hear no one cry. Well I have no idea, none at all, you know why ? Because the trial
 cuts out after the first level that’s 30 second long without letting you even see the upgrades store or anything else, so I have no idea if this is a gritty sim game or just a cheap one trick pony.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> You want to help the homeless give to a charity and *** this game and trying to get an understanding of being homeless maybe volunteer the time you would spend playing this game in a soup kitchen each week.</p>

<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well here I was expecting a game to replace my love of the trailer park king series, unfortunately just like my ex the love was fleeting and the action waning in this side scrolling beat em up which doesn’t quite get the concept of how
 side scrolling beat em ups work. While I can praise it for a variety of enemies each with their own characteristics I get annoyed at the fact the game tells you a load of special moves at the start and these make your regular moves redundant as your normal
 attacks are useless against enemies and the only way to win is to use the special attacks. Unlike most fighting games you aren’t penalised for using the special moves as in this one its a requirement to use them, however one move the dragon uppercut annoying
 starts with a combo punch &nbsp;move which knocks most enemies out the way doing little to no damage then the dragon punch itself misses and you get kick in the balls by the enemy for good measure.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> No wonder the banks collapsed if all the bankers were off starring in terrible games that probably won’t and shouldn’t even make back their production costs.</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well having spent my first every review series having someone frantically defend this game and said person presumable being either the developer or a friend of their or maybe some relation of Frankie Cococococo [drug reference removed]
 who believed this was the digital version of the bible and as I was a accused of making things up and being unprofessional in the last review i thought I’d live totally up to that rather than bother to give this game a fair review at all because chances are
 I’ll be accused of the same though at least this time it will have some truth and make said person look like less of a moron.</p>
<p>Nothing has changed part 2 might as well have the same review as part one the only difference is ramping the level of sexist tips up and ending with the hint the next one might somehow help you in the bedroom, this is a truly awful game in a truly awful
 series that should have all its digital existence world wise put onto one giant hard drive and fired from Nasa’s next shuttle launch into the sun to make sure it never has a chance to propagate in this world</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> &nbsp;Avoid it like your psychotic ex who has caught the plague.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Trailer Park King episode 2 [full version review]</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Now anyone who has read any of my other review batches will know my almost school girl ish glee at this game series and will probably already be sharpening blades to cut off my sensitive areas&nbsp; for my fanboy puke esc review of this game
 that makes it look like a solid gold toilet seat. Well sorry to disappoint as while this game is enjoyable I can’t gush fan boy esc about it like I normally would and this is because to me it didn’t feel complete it felt like an episode designed to keep you
 hooked and while I did enjoy it and appreciate the more involving game elements by which I of course me a shooting gallery and a very well programmed norts and crosses AI (No seriously in one day I’ve played all 362880 possible games of norts and crosses and
 even I was caught by it into never getting a win) &nbsp;but these feel like they were added at the expense of actual gameplay time. While trailer Park King episode 1 felt like a complete story almost this game feels like you’re getting ½ of a full story and with
 no sign as yet of episode 3 I have to question releasing this game now when having waited and released 2 and 3 you could have put a full story out.</p>
<p>For those who did play the first game the humour has been refined and perfected much in the same way American Pie didn’t with some jokes that I’m still scratching my head at how they got away with though for a game series who actively mocked Major Nelson
 it’s this kind of humour that won my heart and proved that indie games can get away with more without upsetting people and causing up roar especially the line about a small furry animal with a unique tail.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> This point and click game (I refuse to call it an interactive story as those should only exist on the Kindle 5X or whatever its being called that is trying to make books more interactive) is a disappointment in the series and I can’t recommend
 you buy this episode now.</p>
<p>When episode 3 is released I recommend buying the two for 160MSP together or going and buying episode 1 now instead if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Rainbow Rapture</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well another games based on the drop accelerate fly and speed up mechanic how origina..........................snore......................snore. Yes this is another game trying to imitate the success of baby maker extreme and its sequel
 though luckily unlike the absolutely terrible flying pig game this one almost has some appeal. You play as god or a rainbow cloud crapping cloud that guards the earth....... hey by the time got to this&nbsp; I was through about 8 pints worth of booze so my brains
 a little fuzzy on what the game was like from playing it the other day but I think cloud god fed up of the corruption and despair humanity have caused themselves decide *** it I’ll just kill them all and start again. The game differs from the flying pig one
 in that this one has working power ups and a challenge list (which I completed in the trial period.... oops).</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If you must have another of these drop and boost games and already have baby maker extreme and its sequel then this is worth you wasting your points on. If however you have no desire to play those kind of games or only want one this game
 isn’t your one, personally I’d say just go play robot unicorn attack.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />

</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Zombie, Zombie everywhere</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> This game almost made the wall of shame but I felt even that was too good for it so why is this game getting a review ? Because it’s not only a bad game its barely a game, zombies advance toward you and you aim at them and fire, headshots
 are nearly always lethal unless the game decide they aren’t for whatever reason, after 40 seconds the trial blacks your screen out and stops you playing and lets you wait to die asking you to buy it the whole time, worse than that despite setting my TV safe
 zone seemingly perfectly the game then ignored it and zombies were attacking me off the side of the screen. Finally the game claims the trial is it, that’s right unless this game sells X copies you’re getting nothing more and what are they trying to give as
 bribes to promote this game to friends and for people to buy this. If X people buy it they will add online high scores, X more and you can get health items X more and they will add more than 1 weapon and so on.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Do not buy this game if no one buys it maybe this money hungry developer will learn to make at least somewhat of a game and that XBLIG is not an alpha development support system as a game this dire even on PC would not sell even at this price
 and I seriously think MS should stop this guy now as while some games like fortress craft present you with a product and promise to add presenting you with a 2 button game and promising if it sells you’ll make a game for them is unacceptable.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> volChaos</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> This is one of them competitive platform games I reckon yep , now round dese parts of the indie games section not many of dem around cause dey need demselves a community of hardcore masochistic fans to constantly keep it going by trying
 to beat others scores and times. The problem is with indie games they tend for the most part to not get sufficient audience for this plan to work so end up stuck in mediocrity</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Just like my terrible written accent there’s far better out there so do like Indiana Jones and hide in a lead lined fridge from this game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Ninja recapture</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 240</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Now I played the previous version of this game and this game which I guess you could call a sequel to the original seems like the developers may have read my review about the issues and so have instead made a fairly deep engrossing RPG
 hack and slash action game which works and does make you feel suitably like a super ninja maybe doing slightly to well as it does seem to feel a bit too easy to fight enemies to begin with but dealing with the constantly spawning enemies who will end up attacking
 from both sides does soon become something I could see being tougher later on.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> From the previous games sneaking round in the shadows to this game being up on stage, it may not be the star of the show but it’s no longer the under study, though can I recommend this game for 240 MSP ? Not particularly as there are better
 uses for your MSP out there but this is solid enough to get me to suggest you try the trial yourself and decide on your own if you think its worth the points.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name: ぬさっ娘</span>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well having put the name through a translator I got Daughter greeted lac and the confusion that title will bring sums up this game very nicely. You play as magic flying girt as you must protect what I am going to call a monastery from
 attacking monster GM crop, the game takes place in a 2D overlay screen with behind it a 3D building that you seemingly fly round as you move. To defend the building you have to use the girls power to creating binding lines which extend from here and can connect
 to objects or enemies. By far the most effective trick is to pick the worry balls up from the bottom of the screen and throw them at the enemies which is done by grabbing the balls moving the controller towards where they want to go then before the binds fully
 extend releasing them, this is a fine art all to itself with practice you can pick up probably 4 at once, the bindings also attack and damage enemies letting you throw enemies at one another, thou which your bindings are attached you move considerably slower.
 If you get hit by an enemy the screen changes shape and you are given a chance to save yourself, though how ones does this I’m still not sure. From what I played a very much enjoyed at and I did make it to level two having fought the first level boss a giant
 floating combination of a phallic symbol a candle and a cupcake.</p>
<p>Author’s note: this review was written and the game played entirely sober and clean and the game really is like this and it’s not a result of me playing the game whilst very drunk.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> If ever you wanted originality and character this game has it in buckets and though I have no idea what’s going on here I will highly recommend this game to anyone just after a laugh.</p>

<p>No me neither but I’m pretty sure it’s not avatars and a linear board, that said this 4 player offline game is very enjoyable for its range of questions most of which probably won’t age too badly meaning in 5 years you will still be able to play this game.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Very, very enjoyable and should be considered for those after a party game as this beats those terrible XBLIG mini games board games hands down and will probably provide as much fun as a real board game.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Game Name</span>:</b> Christmas Rocks!</p>
<p><b>Cost:</b> 80</p>
<p><b>Review bit:</b> Well this game slipped out before Christmas hoping no one would really notice or people would end up drunk buying it by mistake. Either way Christmas rocks is a shameless attempt to sell something rather poor by having Santa play a rock
 guitar to the crowds so thats trying to sell thanks to Christmas, Santa and playing a guitar there. The problem being its missed its spot by absolute miles here as this is no longer the time of the guitar game, for the most part they have died at this point
 bar the odd few ones that sneak out hoping try desperately to get the genre to breath again by promising new ideas. This game even in the height of music game madness would have had a hard time selling as the music is bland and the gameplay probably doesn’t
 even work to well with a guitar controller which unlike most people thing doesn’t have the buttons default mapped to the same colours as the controller, add to that the distinct lack of needed to strum in any way and this game then loses its big draw of playing
 the guitar and becomes like one giant 5 minute long quick time even that doesn’t even look cool</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> A Lump of coal is preferable to this festering pile of Christmas left over. Spend the points on a rockband 3 song or something instead.<br />

<p><b>Review bit:</b> So as this game has decided to try and make an adventure game out of an internet meme let me if I can write this review that way. Aquesta revisió no és això és només una sèrie d'escrits de parlar amb vostè, si vostè la persona trista prou
 com per passar el temps traduint això a provar i veure si hi ha realment una broma oculta aquí. Així que no hi ha classe llevat que el fet que estic trucant a desgrat trist escriure això i traduir. Ok thats quite enough of that for the time being this game
 is a very dumbed down platform runner and the game forces you to move and you have to time your jumps to get over obstacles and collect items this is made more annoying by being forced forward, a seemingly very far away view point making everything lie almost
 moving specks on the screen and annoying platforming where the platforms then jumps are so close together to make you more easily miss them</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> As Fun as being forced to watch Nyan Cat for 3 hours and half as entertaining. Avoid it like your extremely violent and easily jealous friends drunken ex girlfriend 2 days after she got diagnosed as a nymphomaniac.</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> so this is what comes out of brainstorming parties between people wo don’t get the idea of logic a penguin based strategy game this game sees to try to force your opponents birds into a situation where they can’t move and so you can gather
 most fish, the game seems competent enough but feels so dull to play and even seems to realise this as when you’re about 2/3rds through a match it will then auto complete it for you to show you if everyone played perfectly what the outcome would be.</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> With few different shaped arenas being the only variation other than more or less players this is one strategy game for whom the frozen wasteland refers solely to the users brain having played this thing. 80 MSP would have been passable just
 but 240 MSP for a game with less complexity the draughts when there video wars available for 80 MSP this games having a laugh. Avoid it yellow snow.</p>

<p><b>Review bit:</b> Made by non profit games this dire attempt to make profit is just pong with changing backgrounds and glitched physic problems, oh and space pictures. In my first every match the computer accelerated the ball to a speed where it became
 a blurr and though I missed every shot it didn’t drop one and to make matters worse there was no way to move my paddled quick enough to stop the slaughter anyway. The game does offer 2 other modes which are again other variations on pong</p>
<p><b>Verdict:</b> Its Pong but with worse physics and Michael bay yelling for more explosions. Avoid it like you would retro clothing like seer suckers.</p>

<p>For those who haven’t heard Notch the lead guy on the Mojang team who are behind the indie smash hit minecraft has stepped down to take a break from development and “do some soul searching” there have been many rumours about the reasons behind this, some
 suggesting he is secretly going to work on other projects, others suggesting he is disappointed at the delay for the 360 version, others still suggesting its a fall out from the Yogscast incident. Well my 2p on the matter is that he’s off to enjoy his honeymoon
 with his wife and catch up on some quality time, see what happens why you leave minecraft alone you get laid, remember that for the future........</p>

<p>Well there’s a new dashboard out and it makes it harder to get to the main indie games section at around 8 menus to go through as oppose to the old 3 or 4.</p>
<p>This has no doubt angered many indie developers.</p>
<p>The CEO of digital DNA games makers of Castle Miner, Castle Miner Z, Avatar Connection, Avatar paintball, Avatar Laser wars, and a few other games I won’t mention for various reasons has had this to say on the subject</p>
<p>“We have 6 game on Top Downloads right now. If the traffic is reduced as much as last time we will be done with”</p>
<p>Additionally later saying</p>
<p>“Can I have the 2009 Xbox dashboard back? Please....”</p>
<p>“This will most likely flatten sales, and make it not work doing anything except flashlight apps.”</p>
<p>“It isn't just that the Dash is bad for Indie games though, it is just bad period.”</p>
<p>“Us too, with that dash, we realized we needed to hold multiple TDL positions simultanously to remain profitable.”</p>
<p>“Fans are ranting at ME for the new Xbox dashboard this morning.”</p>
<p>“ok... How do I uninstall the new Xbox dash again?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>While Sean Doherty of freelance games has had this to say</p>
<p>“They are killing the service. The only people who will survive is the dude looking to make $100 to cover the
<a href="https://twitter.com/#%21/search?q=%23XBLIG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>#</span><b>XBLIG</b></a> membership.”</p>

<p>“I'm going to call it right now! Hope I'm wrong! XBLIG is official dead to anyone looking to make a living.”</p>
<p>“Bing Works - Awesome! Search for Trailer Park King and selected it from list - show everything but... lol”</p>
<p>“I think they have actually forgotten that their Customer are actually all the people who purchase Xbox Live (not the advertisers).”</p>
<p>“Not understanding how MS can put all these ads on a service that charges $50.00+ per Year?”</p>
<p>“Don't the ads normally go away when you pay for a service?”</p>
<p>“Microsoft is the Company that gave us Windows Me, Windows Vista, and now we have the 2011 Xbox Dashboard”</p>

<p>Hi. I pre-ordered the WWE 2K15 deluxe digital edition for Xbox One. It was supposed to come with Sting DLC and Hogan DLC. I received the Sting DLC, but not the Hogan DLC. Please help.</p>

                </div>

            <p>What I'm specifically looking for is what day it says on the transaction history on our Commerce site I linked to above. If you pre-ordered, but didn't redeem it until the day it launched, that game wouldn't count as a digital pre-order. Only games that were purchased or pre-loaded before the launch day for this title are considered pre-orders and received the full DLC that came with the pre-order.</p>
<p>Once we check out what our Commerce site says, we'll be able to figure out exactly what is going on. :D</p>

                    <p>I have a Lexmark 5470 all in one, that was a gift from my husband.&nbsp; It is older but works perfectly.</p>
<p>Both Windows 10 and Lexmark say "too bad - go buy&nbsp;a printer"&nbsp; Pretty wasteful!&nbsp; Any solutions on how to install this and get around printer 3.0 (I think that's what it is)? Really annoyed!!</p>

            Your kidding? Right?
<div>Of course the screen did not say "Too Bad - go buy a printer"&nbsp; I spent 2 - 3 hours trying every alternative that I knew to set up my printer and I kept getting responses that printer was not supported by Window 10.
<div>Then I went to Lexmark site and screen said that every attempt was made to anticipate what would be in Windows 10 but so sorry my printer is not supported and they even had a link to shop Lexmark.
<div>It is a very sorry business practice that Microsoft changes its software and so I have to go spend $200-$300 to replace my printer, plus eat the cost of ink cartridges that I already have.&nbsp; I suppose if I had tons of $$$$ this would not bother me.
<div>And No I do not think your answer was helpful.&nbsp; I think I got a key phrase response from a computer.
<div>ChristineinClarence </div>
<div>Meanwhile I still cannot print, so will have to e mail everything to my work or my husband.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this printer installed when you upgraded to Win 10 ?</p>
<p>The reason I ask is because that makes a difference in how to try to get it to work...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lexmark X5340 that I was able to get to work... everything except the little widow that pops up when you print with the pages printing and ink level...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This actually works if I upgrade from Win 7, but not with a clean install of Win 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For starters, use the original installation CD, but don't RUN it...</p>
<p>OPEN the CD, right click on SETUP and select Properties..</p>
<p>At the top you will see Compatibility tab... select it..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check the box for Compatibility Mode and select XP SP3....</p>
<p>If that doesn't work try XP SP2 or earlier...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your printer doesn't install, reply with the error or what doesn't work...&nbsp;</p>

            <p>slance310 had a very good answer but I was not able to get it to work.</p>
<p>I ended up buying a new printer and I was not happy about this.</p>
<p>Really is a shame and a waste.&nbsp; You would think there would be some industry standard for generic low level printer set up.&nbsp; Some people struggle to stay linked in and can't always be spending more money.&nbsp; Some people are not tech savvy and cutting edge.&nbsp;
 Just want to print their kids pictures.</p>

            Sorry to be late to the party but I came across this post while having a similar issue. The reason Sayan_Ghosh posted that is because you didn't post any typical error message and actually put yours in quotes meaning that you were supposedly quoting the
 error message. Maybe if you put in the actual error message or anything helpful to the problem in the initial query Sayan could have been more helpful. Your fault for giving the incorrect error message, Sayan was just trying to get a grip on the error so they
 could help.

<h2>            Black ops 1 and 2 remastered&#63;</h2>
                    I was just looking through YouTube and I came across a video where someone remastered the map town for bo2 zombies and I thought this would be a interesting topic... what if Activision made black ops 1 and 2 remastered? They could do some touch ups to
 the graphics while keeping the same maps and gameplay. Let me know what you think.

<p>Just because a game is BC doesn't mean it can't get a remaster.&nbsp; Or a remaster available doesn't mean the original not becoming BC.&nbsp; Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare eventually became to BC, even though there was a remastered version on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it would have been great if the BC Cod titles had been enhanced to run in 4K on the Xbox One X. Sadly they haven't been enhanced.&nbsp; But in case you were wondering what the original Black Ops would look like in 4K, check this screenshot below.</p>

            I don't think that's a good reason for it not being remastered at all! COD 4 is BC and was still remastered. Not only that, but it's only BC on Xbox. Activision have deals with Sony, so that could be a reason to remaster them so PS4 players could play
 it.

<p>To make sure boot.ini is not a hidden file or has a read only attribute, go to a Run window (Windows key+R), type attrib -s -h -r c:\boot.ini (note the four spaces) and press Enter.</p>

    <title>AutoLogon is disabled after feature pack install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnotero1  say:</h3>
<h2>            AutoLogon is disabled after feature pack install</h2>
                    <p>After windows 10 feature pack 1709 is applied, AutoLogon is disabled. This is happening going from 1607 to 1709 on all machines using Autologon. Is this a function of all feature packs? Is there a way of re-enabling without manually touching all our machines?&nbsp;
 We can manually re-enable it using the same Autologon file that's still on the machine. We use the Sysinternals Autologon.</p>

<p>Hello Artem Kharchenko_83,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The email address or phone number that you can see during password reset is what we call Security information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Security info </strong>is an alternate email address or phone number that you add to your account. If you forget your password, or if someone else is trying to take over your account, we send a security code to that alternate email or phone number.
 When you give the code back to us, we know that you’re really you and we can get you back into your Microsoft account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you no longer have access to your account's security information &amp; can no longer reset&nbsp;your password&nbsp;, you may answer this
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Automated Recovery Form.</a>&nbsp;You will get an update within 24 hours regarding the information you submitted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi Kartik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Windows 10. Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.</span></p>
<p><span>The issue could if you&nbsp;made any&nbsp;changes to the Computer after upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In order to help you better, please provide the information:</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the Computer prior to the issue? Have you created&nbsp;a new user account after upgrading to Windows 10?</p>
<p>2. How did you upgrade to Windows&nbsp;10 from Windows 7?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. When you say that "If I use the media creation tool from Microsoft to install win 10 even If I still have win 10", are you referring to? Are you trying install Windows 10 on another drive in the Computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;would suggest you to refer to the below Microsoft Help Article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the section: Go back to your previous version of Windows.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: If you are trying to perform a free&nbsp;upgrade to Windows 10&nbsp;through media creation tool on the Computer, then we need Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 installed on the Computer to perform a free upgrade.
</p>
<p>But if you are trying to install Windows 10 using a media installation disk&nbsp;created through media creation tool, then&nbsp;it will be a clean install of Windows 10. It&nbsp;will ask&nbsp;to enter a new product key to activate&nbsp;Windows 10.</p>

<p>- What is the exact message that you receive regarding the update?</p>
<p>- Have you checked Windows update to see if there are any Bluetooth driver updates available?</p>
<p>- Are the Bluetooth devices able to connect to HP pavilion dv7?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install all the Windows updates offered to you and also check if there is a Bluetooth driver update. If yes, please update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Run the hardware troubleshooter and check if it reports an error with the Bluetooth device.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Go to Device Manager and check if the Bluetooth driver is updated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Type Device Manager in the Start search box.</p>
<p>- Browse Bluetooth and right click on the driver and select Update Driver software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            any sound played on the computer produces a fuzzy, grainy audio playback. Sound is accompanied by buzzes.</h2>
                    hi i used to have both windows xp and vista before installing windows 7 but never had this problem before. any sound that my computer makes (music, beeps, msn alerts etc are grainy. even though they are audible they are disconcerting to say the least as
 i can hear interruptions and fluctuations with every sound. what is the cause and how can i solve this? any help appreciated.

<blockquote>Hi, i have tried that. I also tried updating my BIOS and re-installed the Realtek Sound Manager + driver, but it still makes the buzz noise when any sound is played on the computer. Interesting thing is, when i uninstall the driver i have sub-par
 audio quality but the buzzing noise disappears!<br />
<br />
Thanks</blockquote>
<br />
Realtech has released a few new drivers lately.

<h2>            Xbox Gold</h2>
                    
<p>When I bought a $25 dollar prepaid card in the US and I entered it on my account I tried to buy gold because I accidentally picked it up and not a 3 month. But it wouldn't let me use the money on my Microsoft account to buy gold. Is there anyway that I can
 use my account's money to buy gold?</p>

<h2>            XBOX One X - HDMI Splitter into Input</h2>
                    <p>So i purchased an HDMI switch and plugged it into the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
input</span> of the XB One X, and it says no video found. &nbsp;Trying to have a Apple TV, Verizon FIOS, Steam Box, and PS3 all use the XBOX input and switch between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know its not the switch because i plug it directly into my projector and it display's video just fine from any of the inputs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any setting in the XBOX One X that would prevent the video/audio from the switch from displaying? &nbsp;Or did Microsoft configure the X to not accept splitters somehow?</p>

<p>Switch your X to 1080 then use the Switch. Most HDMI switches can not do 4k.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had a similar issue with an switch that said 4k capable - but the other devices were not - I have left it at 1080p to not have issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 4k I believe is a direct connection at least in my case - went to the 4k TV details and it let me know what was the issues and I have a laundry list.&nbsp; The main was my display supports 4k but not as 60hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did you you get on the errors?</p>

            The one I had was that the switch defaulted to whatever was the lowest resolution. Even know it was a 4k switch it picked to go with the 1080p capture card set up.&nbsp;

<p>Yeah, I have it going to an Elgato CaptureHD and that only lets me do 1080p.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the other cable set up that is 4k it has some sort of degradation because it said I can do 4k at 50hz but not 60hz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I don't stream I do a direct connect.</p>

            Your 60hz issue might also be the same issue OP has. Depending where he lives and the TV he owns it could be freaking out the Switcher. Nice catch.&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface dock USB ports stop working daily</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro that is connected to a Surface Dock (LAN, 2 displays, Microsoft Sculpt Comfort Keyboard, Logitech 1080p webcam).&nbsp; On almost a daily basis the USB ports stop working, which makes my keyboard and webcam unusable for a period.&nbsp; An error
 message comes up saying that the last USB device was not recognized and then after 5 minutes it all kicks back into gear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have downloaded the surface dock updater and have the latest firmware.&nbsp; Same goes for the Surface Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I missing?&nbsp; This is a work computer and is extremely disruptive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all</p>
<p>Nathan</p>
