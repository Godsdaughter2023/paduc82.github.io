<h2>            Can i make my touch keyboard on screen which is transparency adjustable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft Surface Team, </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I love Microsoft Surface much, however i face a problem, in fact i am just a bit frustrated that the touch keyboard displayed on screen seems like can not be adjusted for it's transparency.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I voice up this issue since it always hide what i type for example on the browser when then typing space is beneath the browser, which means i can not scroll down the page already for a view on what i type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I hope that this issue can be solved for the relevant driver which can be amended by Microsoft or if there is, which i hadn't known for that can promote a better user-friendly features.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look forward for your due consideration and kind support.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Henry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting the community regarding your issue with the on screen keyboard.<br />
I would like to ask you a few clarification questions though to make sure I am understanding you correctly.<br />
Are you experiencing this issue when you are on the internet? Have you tried other apps to see if it happens as well?<br />
If it happens&nbsp;on the internet, what browser are you using (Bing, Google Chrome, Firefox, etc.)?<br />
Also, that will help to take a screenshot of what you are seeing. To do so, press the home button and volume down button at the same time.</p>

            <span>Hi, Shiho_P,</span>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks so much for the reply. After i read through your mail, i have tried several method to check if the keyboard, after taking the space (without transparency)for half of the screen, would it really cause me the problem of reading
 what i type at the back of keyboard?......<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I discovered when i try to compose my hotmail using Mozilla firefox, the problem actually happen, which is as what i have described in my previous email. The print screen is attached as well here for reference.
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, when i use the win 8 'mail' application to compose the mail, it appeared to be no problem at all, as the composed page and sentence will retracted (automatically scroll down) to let me see what i am typing the moment.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you for your reply, i think may be it is better for me to use the win 8 apps when i want to type or key in something. But, i just curios if i can change the keyboard a bit transparent only, just thinking of it would be helpful,
 even i have not experienced what will it feel and look like.... &nbsp;. I also&nbsp;browse through the net and some users have the same request for that keyboard matter as well.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>Yours sincerely,&nbsp;</div>

            <p>Hi Henry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your description.<br />
</p>
<p>So the on screen keyboard gets "stuck" and won't move down even when you are typing something long, and it's preventing you from seeing&nbsp;what you've typed, on Firefox, correct?<br />
Does it happen on Internet Explorer or Google Chrome or other browsers?<br />
If not, it is more than likely be by design - meaning that it is built this way.<br />
What you can do, when it happens, is to manually minimize the on screen keyboard first (tap the minimize icon right next to the exit "X" icon), then scroll the screen up, then reactivate the keyboard (tap on the keyboard icon at the bottom right corner) to
 start typing again.<br />
You could try contacting Firefox <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/get-community-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I try to do an image or file recovery from backup the Repair disk freezes when prompting for Next to select the options.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
When I try the same using the Repair with the original Win7 installation disk, it reports to me I do not have the original version of Windows 7. When I use F8 to get to the built in Repair menu, it freezes.

A few weeks ago this all used to work...</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to get Windows Install disk to the Mode to allow access to the backup I get the message that the OS installed is not compatible. Other times it was freezing solid.&nbsp; I found if I do multiple boots to the CD it will eventually take it.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I have a more serious problem now.&nbsp; When I want to use Windows shortcuts such as Ctrl - Alt - B or anything else it takes a very long time. During that time, if I put the mouse near to the task bar I get the warning the Windows Explorer has shut down. I can
 wait for the restart of Windows Explorer after about one or a bit more minutes.&nbsp; If I double click an icon or call in by its name and click on them they should work okay.
<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I do not have an old enough backup. All my backups contain this error problem. I would rather fix this than have to reinstall the OS. I am presently putting back a more up to date backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When this backup is created, I am going to see if I an make myself under a new profile. If this works, I have thought about copying over all my data files and then later removing my old profile if this is possible. In this case I hope this is profile related.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole thing started after I tried out the Acronis backup software.&nbsp; I did not have the chance to call them yet. I am sure they will send me back to MS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Prior to this i uninstalled unused apps while in Windows 8.1, but the error was there even when i had Windows 8.1, then i upgraded hoping it would be fixed but seems the error is still there</p>

            sadly it didn't work, though my system now takes ages on the log in screen, i think microsoft need to work on that with windows 10 after an update, there is an extreme lag when loading log in screen, fyi: its an updated version of windows 10 from windows
 8.1 not a fresh install<br />

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This system/motherboard seems to still be in warranty and if so you should definitely work with their support. Especially since you have done a clean install which points toward hardware causes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
1. Try removing ALL power then reseating all cards, memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug.&nbsp; Reduce the system down to as simple as possible including minimum memory. Ensure there is adequate cooling.<br />
<br />
Check with Gigabyte Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers (see driver update methods below).<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = F5<br />
BiosReleaseDate =<strong> 04/07/2017</strong><br />
SystemManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
SystemProductName = Z270X-Gaming K7<br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = Gigabyte Technology Co., Ltd.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = Z270X-Gaming K7<br />
</p><p><br />
<strong>2.</strong> fffff801`8c48892dUnable to load image \SystemRoot\System32\drivers\<strong>e2xw10x64.sys</strong>, Win32 error 0n2<br />
*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>e2xw10x64.sys</strong><br />

<br />
<strong>e2xw10x64.sys </strong>dated 9/14/2016 Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. Killer e2400 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller.<br />
<br />
Update that driver at Gigagbyte.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Eset could be the cause or helping to mask it so fully uninstall it and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 8/8.1 &amp; 10 is a full antivirus.<br />

<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Run the memory&nbsp;tests (see methods below).<br />
<br />
<strong>5. </strong>As needed use ALL the methods in the&nbsp;troubleshooters below.<br />
<br />
<strong>6. </strong>After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to&nbsp;see if it can indicate a<br />
CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).<br />

<strong>BCCode: C2&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000C2 <br />
<br />
</strong>This error is usually a driver issue and display adapter (video) driver is the most suspect though it&nbsp;could be others. Antivirus/antispyware/security programs, hardware (heat) and major software&nbsp;issues&nbsp;can also cause the error.&nbsp;Memory&nbsp;issues are&nbsp;another
 possibility after drivers. <br />
<br />
Have you added hardware recently or updated drivers? Be sure to look in Control Panel - Windows&nbsp;Updates to see if any drivers were updated there. Other lessor possibilities include antivirus/anti-spyware/security programs.

This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. (Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created
 the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.&nbsp;Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model&nbsp;of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version
 info. Now click&nbsp;UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right&nbsp;Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers&nbsp;particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure
 it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>You need to backup and you should do so every day. You can use Windows' own File History to backup or a third-party application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dropbox and OneDrive are two examples of cloud storage. Think of cloud storage as a hard drive that exists on the internet. Use either one or both or neither - up to you. One advantage of storing files in the cloud (i.e., on the internet) is that you can
 access them from any computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Being a computer novice is a great thing because you don't have any bad habits to unlearn. By contrast, bad habits were the only habits I had. The best advice I can give you: Before you make any changes to your settings, do your research on the internet
 to make sure you're doing the right thing and for the right reason. Have a discerning eye when considering advice you'll read on the internet - does the source seem credible?</p>

<p>OneDrive and Dropbox are excellent for storing copies of important files. You can also back them up on a flash drive or external hard drive.</p>
<p>Personally I keep all my favorites, photos, movies, and music backed up on an external hard drive (though I might copy some to OneDrive temporarily until I have time to move them to my external hard drive).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if you make changes to a local file (a word document or some such) you want to make sure you save a copy of the CHANGED version to your storage area (replacing the original).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really a matter of personal preference how much and how often you want to keep safe in case your device breaks down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like the Restore Function. You can leave it on (which will negatively effect your device's performance in some ways) as a safeguard in case a new update or program causes problems and you want to quickly revert back to before you installed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can shut it off and stream videos more smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep mine shut off but, again, it's mostly what suits YOU best.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community and showing interest in windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to try the below methods and check if it helps in resolving your issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To create a partition for windows installation I would suggest you to follow the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>First, make sure your USB drive is plugged in</span></li><li><span>Search and open Command Prompt as an administrator</span></li><li><span>Next, you’ll have to open the disk management utility using CMD (Command Prompt) – to do that, type in&nbsp;<em>disk part</em> and hit enter</span></li><li><span>After that, you will have to display the connected disks that are available – to do that, type in&nbsp;<em>list disk&nbsp;</em>and hit enter</span></li><li><span>Then, you’ll need to select your USB drive – to do that, type&nbsp;<em>select disk #</em> and hit enter – you’ll have to replace the
<em>#</em>&nbsp;with your disk number</span></li><li><span>Next, you’ll have to clean the USB drive – to do that, type&nbsp;<em>clean&nbsp;</em>and hit enter</span></li><li><span>Then you’ll need to create a bootable partition – type in&nbsp;<em>create partition primary</em> and hit enter</span></li><li><span>You will now need to select the partition that you just created. To do that, type in&nbsp;<em>select partition 1.&nbsp;</em></span></li><li><span>After that, type&nbsp;<em>active&nbsp;</em>and hit enter</span></li><li><span>Next, you’ll need to format the USB drive – just type in&nbsp;<em>format fs=fat32&nbsp;</em>and hit enter</span></li><li><span>You’ll now need to assign your USB drive a letter, to do that, just type in&nbsp;<em>assign</em></span></li><li><span>Lastly, copy all the Windows 10 files and paste it inside the USB drive. (You can copy the files by extracting an ISO or copy it from a Windows 10 disk).</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists I would suggest you to refer this link and check if it helps.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, I suggest you to update Hard Drivers or SSD Drivers and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please follow below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Copy your Hard Drive drivers to a disk. (Floppy, CD, USB)<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: Keep this disk in a safe place, as it will be need to use in the Recovery Console.<br />
&nbsp;System Image Recovery - Restore Image on Computer in Windows 8</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Load Drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click Cancel.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click Browse.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Choose your Controller. Click OK<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: For this example, I am using JMB363.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Click OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. Click Unhide.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Choose your Controller. Click Next.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. Continue with setup.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would also suggest you to try these steps and check.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>1) Check if you have an SD Card in the system. If you do, you remove it and run setup again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2) Once the setup fails to find the partition, just close the setup window (the top-right-hand side red X does the job).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>From that point, you should be brought back at the initial setup screen. Choose "Repair" then go to the advanced tools and start the command line.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Start DISKPART.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type LIST DISK and identify your SSD disk number (from 0 to n disks).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type SELECT DISK &lt;n&gt; where &lt;n&gt; is your SSD disk number.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type CLEAN</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type CREATE PARTITION PRIMARY</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type ACTIVE</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type FORMAT FS=NTFS QUICK</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type ASSIGN</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type EXIT twice (one to get out of DiskPart, the other to exit the command line tool)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Error 0x80830003</h2>
                    
<p>Hopefully this is the correct area for this question. Anyways...</p>
<p>I have been playing Fallout 4 for a while now and it has become completely unplayable. Whenever I try to save or overwrite a file, I get this message, "We can't save more data for this game or app." &nbsp;It then tells me to make room. At the end of the message
 there is this string of text in parentheses, "(0x80830003)."&nbsp;</p>
<p>This message appears every single time I try to save or overwrite a file. I have deleted a large number of save files in order to "make room," but it doesn't help. I only have two save files left for my only character (level 65 or so), and I cut down the
 number of saves on my sister's account as well. Combined we have less than 400-500MBs worth of saves. I also deleted a few games that we weren't playing (FarCry 4, a few Assassin Creed games, The Crew, etc.) but that didn't change anything either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have concluded that this has absolutely nothing to do with actual save space. It is possible that there is a lack of save space in the Cloud, but I get this message even while playing offline (unless it reconnected to the internet without my knowledge).
 I have also started to receive this message while playing Dark Souls 3 as well. The thing is, it will try to save a few times and give me this message, but after a few attempts the message stops appearing and the game actually saves (Mainly because Dark Souls
 3 is absolutely obsessed with saving... There are very few things that can stop it. Fallout 4 is nothing like that though).</p>
<p>Anyways, I would really love to actually be able to play Fallout 4 Nuka World... But the game is just simply unplayable. 100% unplayable. So until I figure out how to actually save my progress, I am just stuck. Anyone know how to fix this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any helpful, instructive comments.</p>

            <p>Hey there Dazora.</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the save trouble. It sounds like the issue you're running into is lack of save space within the cloud. Have you tried clearing up some space from games other than Fallout 4?? Also, while you may only have 2 main saves for Fallout 4, it's possible your quicksaves are taking up extra space. Generally your storage capacity for games increases the more games you own. </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>As I said, I already deleted several entire games. Just now I went through the remaining games that I haven't played in a while (Lords of the Fallen, Black OPS 3, Assassin's Creed Unity, etc.) and deleted all my save data on them. At this point, I only have
 the minimum saves left on the two or so games that I have been playing recently.</p>
<p>Also, I have no quick saves on Fallout 4 anymore. I read somewhere that they were maybe this issue worse for some people, so they were the first ones I deleted. I just have two normal saves.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get more Cloud storage, or to manually check what is in the Cloud? It seems kind of ridiculous that I have to go through my games and constantly delete saves or entire games just so that I can play others. I have never had to do this
 before. I feel like I should be able to save my games for as long as I have space on my Xbox. Maybe I could disconnect for the Cloud entirely and just use my Xbox storage? Would getting an external hard drive do anything at all? I don't think it would if it
 is the Cloud that is messing everything up.</p>
<p>Honestly, I am not sure what to do. I just want to play a single one of my games. I have plenty of storage on my Xbox, yet I can't. I won't be playing the Xbox at all for a while now that college has started up again, but still. Do you have any further advice
 maybe? I'd like to have this issue resolved sooner than later.</p>
<p>Oh, and thanks for replying before.</p>

            <p>Hey there Dazora.</p>
<p>Just a thought, if you disconnect your Xbox One from Xbox Live and attempt a save while offline, do you get any change or do you still get the same error?</p>
<p>Generally when you save while connected, you are saving to the cloud, deleting content from your Xbox One does not actually free space from the cloud. As this <a href="http://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/cloud-game-saves-faq#1afef78389084eeea2741c03e29692d2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cloud Save Troubleshooter</a> mentions, each game is given a set amount of cloud storage, which means that as you purchase additional games your cloud storage is increased. When you deleted the saves did you make sure to delete from everywhere or did you only delete from the console?</p>

<p>I went offline and tried it just now, I was able to save about twice (presumably due to the fact that I had deleted things from other games), but then the message came up again. I am fairly sure I was disconnected from Xbox Live this whole time.
</p>
<p>I never checked where I was deleting my saves. I just deleted them from the game menu itself for the most part (for the fallout 4 saves at least).</p>

<p>Apologies for the delay in response. As you mentioned, it sounds like you may have reached the limit for storage. In order to expand that, additional digital titles will need to be owned on your account. I definitely understand the frustrations. </p>

            <p>i can vouch for the same issue this person is having, with fallout 4 i mean. first time it happened, my primary hard drive was indeed full so i moved about 50 gigs or so worth of stuff to my external usb hard drive to make room but now it keeps giving me the same message every single time it tries to autosave which is pretty annoying. no i dont need to make space, no i have tons of room for save files on the storage device, etc. please don't suggest things that you know aren't the solution because its pretty obvious that its not that simple. this is the second time ive had a major issue with fallout 4 and personally im getting fed up. ms customer service is also a joke, they keep telling me to come to these forums to look for help but you guys seem to know less than they do. im at a loss. dont bother making a post in response to this unless you have a solution.&nbsp;i had to solve the&nbsp;previous problem that&nbsp;i had with this game last time on my own so im pretty sure im not the idiot her

            <p>I get the same issue, there's lots of space on my XBox One Hard Drive,&nbsp;I&nbsp;get about one game save per game between Fallout 4, The Witcher 3, &amp; Skyrim SE (Including quicksaves &amp;&nbsp;autosaves, they've become a constant pain as it keeps prompting me every time the game does attempt an auto-save)&nbsp;regards&nbsp;digital titles, I&nbsp;don't buy many (if any) digital titles, nor do I&nbsp;have Gold&nbsp;but that shouldn't matter,&nbsp;there should be a way for games to save onto the console regardless, or certainly there should be a way to see what's saved in the cloud,&nbsp;this is some basic stuff that should happen automatically surely?</p>

            <p>Hello rukia8492! The easiest thing to do is to change the password for your Microsoft account if your gamertag has been recovered on multiple consoles. This will render all recoveries useless as they will need to know the password to sign in and use them. Go here to learn how.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1&#58; Stuck at &#34;Welcome&#34; screen, no black screen &#43; input works --- How to fix&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Fixed! &nbsp;Kind of.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>You will need to do this every time you reboot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the free "upgrade", Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press F8 at the blinking cursor between your bios flash screen or POST complete and the start of Windows loading (you probably only have a second, so be fast).&nbsp; Sometimes this doesn't work the first try, so reboot and keep trying if nothing happens.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
2. Boot into safe mode with networking.&nbsp; (I don't know for sure that networking is required, but that's what I used, so I'm playing it safe).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
3. Press "Windows Key + R", type netplwiz, and click "OK".<br />
<br />
4. Make sure the box labeled "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" IS checked.&nbsp; Click "Apply" and then "OK" (old superstition: I always do both).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
5. Reboot, and enter your credentials.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>6. If this doesn't work, then see the answer marked below. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: Something is wrong with the way that Windows 8.1 stores or loads user credentials.&nbsp; I use my Microsoft login for Windows 8.1, but since I haven't tried to reproduce this with a normal login, I don't know if it's unique to that.&nbsp; I *did* change
 my password online just before upgrading to 8.1, and I *have* updated my password locally.&nbsp; I suspect that 8.1 is still trying to use the old password from before it was changed, just before the upgrade.&nbsp; I hope that this helps Microsoft to fix this problem.</p>

</p><p>You'll find here a list of resources on how to downgrade your PC from Windows 8.1 to Windows 8:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://howto.cnet.com/8301-11310_39-57610729-285/how-to-uninstall-windows-8.1/</p>
<p>http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2013/11/10/windows-8-laptop-recovery/3476743/</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it'll bring nothing or doesn't make your system back to normal state, you may use 'Automatic Recovery Feature' and use restore point to make everything normal. If the above fails, start tapping 'Shift + F8' just after starting your PC and choose to 'Repair
 your computer' from Windows setup window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope to hear from you soon!!</p>

    <title>Surface Dock with 24&#34; Apple Cinema display - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonbaldini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Dock with 24&#34; Apple Cinema display</h2>
                    <p>I'm posting a solution for the 24 inch Apple Cinema Display, there's another thread and it's locked and provided no solution, zero, I have a solution, not a great one but this is a 15 year old monitor and I think my solution is great considering it's the
 only way to get the monitor to work on a Surface Book while using the Surface Dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 24 inch is pre thunderbolt so we are only speaking in terms on mini displayport and for whatever reason, even using adapters, the Apple Cinema Display 24in (mini displayport [only way it comes]) does not work in those ports on the dock but does work
 on the Laptop port next to the power.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People think they can't use it in the laptop because the dock power adapter does not leave room to plug in it but guess what, the plastic shielding isn't low profile on the male mini displayport receptacle coming from the monitor, meaning, shave down the
 plastic and yes you can safely go far enough without making contact.&nbsp; I'll even explain how, btw I'm writing this on that monitor plugged in the laptop port with a fully functional dock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously you only have to shave down the side that borders the power plug and you have to do it slowly with a dremel or other low horsepower (capable) rotary device using a sander while being aware of heat, but you can go very low RPMs to achieve this with
 little heat and finish in mins and it looks fine after, and if you're as OCD as myself knock yourself out, do the other side so it's even, why not, I didn't myself because it is not noticeable while in use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it's a one way commitment but it's a 15 year old monitor so really what do you have to lose, this works, and I found nothing else on Google to tell me this, I just tried it myself because I know these plugs have extra plastic shielding than they need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm disappointed that no one else tried this by now and if they had it has not been published.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to know how much, you do a little at a time until it just fits, still touching the dock power adapter but not creating any opposing force to it, I wouldn't try to leave space though, then you might go to far on the sanding, and it's much easier
 than I'm making it sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's the only solution I found and I'm happy with it, I don't consider it a work around because it's plugged in a mini displayport and working as it should so the bug lies in the dock somewhere, drivers will not help because the computer doesn't see the
 monitor it's a hardware problem/prevention from the dock so cannot be fixed with a software solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe if you had a powered mini displayport hub (have they ever existed) with female in and male out,, then "maybe" Windows 10 would see the monitor but I believe this to me much cleaner than that, no adapter, straight connect and given the circumstances
 with such an antiquated monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know how anyone could have a question, the question goes to you, do you want it to work on not or just be a 15 year old monitor doing nothing, i was not going to stop using the dock just to use the monitor.&nbsp; And if you do have a question I'm happy
 to help but I turned off notifications because most comments will be Youtube/Twitter ish, people throwing shade on a solution they didn't think to try.&nbsp; I don't have time for shade, I offer solutions not controversy</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're most welcome!&nbsp; And yes probably works fine with the 30 inch, but didn't have an extra one to test with.</p>

            <p>Hi Jill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many convertible laptops (laptops that can be configured both as a conventional laptop or tablet) have mechanisms to detect when they are in a laptop configuration and automatically engage rotation lock.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your surface II, if you are seeing rotation lock unexpectedly engage (or be disabled), put your surface in a tablet configuration either by removing the keyboard or by folding it behind the screen.&nbsp; This should give you the ability to turn rotation lock
 on or off.&nbsp; If it doesn't then try reattaching the keyboard, but if this still doesn't work, then try a "hard" power down by holding the power button for 20+ seconds (make sure you save any work before you do this).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to hear if my suggestions worked for you.</p>

            <p>I was finally able to disengage the lock rotation by going into Control Panel, Appearance and Personalization, Display, Screen Resolution.&nbsp; There is a checkbox for Allow the screen to auto-rotate, which was unchecked.&nbsp; I checked it, and then the screen would
 auto-rotate.&nbsp; Oddly, after this, I went back into Settings from the Start menu, System, Display, and the Lock rotation of this display was still disabled and set to On.&nbsp; I'm not sure how that feature could ever be enabled, but it doesn't matter because I was
 able to enable it from Control Panel.</p>

            <p>Thanks Sandy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>the "hard" reset worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My guess is that I was using my Surface Pro 2 in the car and had to use the keyboard.&nbsp; In limited space I flipped the keyboard back away from the screen and that's when the problem occurred.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A day later back at home I tried, as you suggested, reattaching the keyboard and removing it, but no help - the screen still didn't automatically rotate.&nbsp; So, I tried the hard reset and that seemed to do the trick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again,</p>

    <title>Many services fail to start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cape sailor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Many services fail to start</h2>
                    After updating my sound driver from the Dell website my sound stopped working.<br />
After some research I went to the Vista services console to check for a problem.<br />
While I haven't been able to get the sound working yet I did notice that 81 services "failed to read description".<br />
When I try to open any one of them I get the message "the handle is invalid". I have to click this message 3 times to exit the error message.<br />
Several of the event log errors read<br />
1. (source:service control mgr) The UPnP Device Host service depends on the SSDP Discovery service which failed to start because of the following error:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.<br />
2. The Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service service depends on the UPnP Device Host service which failed to start because of the following error:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dependency service or group failed to start.<br />
3. The Windows Modules Installer service entered the stopped state.<br />
4. (source: volmgr) Crash dump initialization failed!<br />
<br />
I am using a Dell XPS M1530<br />

            Hello Cape,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting your question.<br />
<br />
Let's do a system restore which will restore your computer to a point in time before the problem began.<br />
<br />
To restore the operating system to an earlier point in time, follow these steps:<br />
<br />
Click Start, type system restore in the Start Search box, and then click System Restore in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue.<br />
In the System Restore dialog box, click Choose a different restore point, and then click Next.<br />
In the list of restore points, click a restore point that was created before you began to experience the issue, and then click Next.<br />
Click Finish.<br />
<br />
The computer restarts, and the system files and settings are returned to the state that they were in at the time that the restore point was created.<br />
<br />
In case System Restore does not fix the problem try running a system file checker. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.<br />
<br />
To run a System file checker, follow the instructions below:<br />
<br />
1. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and select Run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
2. Click Continue or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.<br />
<br />
3. In the Command Prompt window type the following, and press Enter:<br />
<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
4. You should see the following on-screen messages:<br />
<br />
Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.<br />
<br />
Beginning verification phase of system scan.<br />
<br />
Verification % complete.<br />
<br />
5. Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:<br />
<br />
…found no integrity violations<br />
<br />
…found corruption but repaired it<br />
<br />
…found corruption that it could not repair<br />
<br />
6. Please reply with the completion message that you received.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
In addition For the Sound problem you can try to Rollback the drivers you updated from the Dell website. To<br />
<br />
Rollback drivers follow instructions below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Click on Windows Start button, then right click on “Computer” and select “Manage” on the right click context menu. If there is any UAC security prompt, click on “Continue”.<br />
<br />
2. Open Device Manager by clicking on “Device Manager”.<br />
<br />
3. Expand the hardware component category that placing device with corrupted driver by clicking on the small plus sign next to it. Inside the category, look for the device entry that you want to rollback its driver to previous version.<br />
<br />
4. Right click on the device, and select “Properties”.<br />
<br />
5. Select “Driver” tab.<br />
<br />
6. Click on the “Roll Back Driver” button, and confirm when prompted with dialog box asking if really want to proceed to get old driver installed again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Let me know how everything is going.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Regards,<br />

<p>I'm using Windows 10 on my tablet PC. And I like and use the full-size onscreen keyboard.</p>

<p>Please turn my national language onscreen keyboard back!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>(I use a Russian language - for information).</p>
<p>Kind Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Erica.</p>
<p>Thank you for your answer.</p>
<p>But question was "where is <strong>full-size&nbsp;</strong>onscreen <strong>russian</strong> keyboard?" - Don't you see difference between 2 my pictures, which I have posted? I don't mean different national symbols, but:
<strong>numerical keys "1,2,3,...,9,0", "ESC", "DEL", "TAB", "ALT", ... </strong>
</p>
<p>They are present at English full-screen keyboard layout, but it is not even full-size layout, when I change language to Russian!</p>
<p>

 and holding the upper-left edge of the on-screen keyboard and drag diagonally.</p>

<p>What do you talking about? I need all 67 keys! Not that 40 key, which I have on each Android phone. Will row with digits appear, if I resize on-screen keyboard?</p>
<p>As workaround, I will call this Microsoft update as "F*** Creators Update"</p>

    <title>desktop background won&#39;t stay changed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            desktop background won&#39;t stay changed</h2>
                    <p>Here's my issue. </p>
<p>I've been trying to change to a different desktop image. First to a picture or screen shot that I have taken myself, After I save changes, if my computer gets powered down, it goes back to the background that I originally had. I'll go under the personalization
 tab and notice that it has come back as an "unsaved theme" so after changing it again, this time selecting one of windows 7 premade themes, I delete the "unsaved theme" and save changes.&nbsp; This theme will stay for a few log offs, but eventually goes back to
 the original background that I don't want anymore, coming back again as an unsaved theme. No matter what I've tried it keeps coming back.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts? help? thankyou</p>
