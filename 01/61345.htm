    <title>Some constructive feedback&#47;suggestions for Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Some constructive feedback&#47;suggestions for Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there. Just dropping in and putting in my two cents on a couple of suggestions for the Xbox One, as suggested to do so by the Xbox Support twitter account (https://twitter.com/XboxSupport1/status/406155740831703040)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Firstly</strong> - as we currently have no way to play music off a USB&nbsp;stick or drive, it would be great if it were possible to have some way to play music in the background whilst playing games. At the moment, all I've managed to find is that we
 can snap Xbox Music, but this means we lose a chunk of screen real estate and the games run in a letterbox. I was amazed at the catalogue of music on the Xbox Music app (it appears to have a LOT of the obscure artists I listen to that a lot of other streaming
 services don't, so well done there), but to be honest, gameplay is probably the only time I'm going to use it - so without being able to minimize it to the background I honestly can't warrant the subscription, and I imagine that a lot of other people would
 be in a similar boat. This is of course all a moot point if you are intending on allowing us to play music in the background from USB devices once USB&nbsp;support is added, but even still, for people who like streaming music and so on, it seems like it would be
 a good idea to implement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong> - similar suggestion, but this time surrounding the Upload Studio app. From what I can tell, clips stop uploading if you don't have the app snapped (mine certainly have failed to successfully upload when I've not had the app either
 open fullscreen, or snapped to the side). Again - it's great that we can do this in the first place, but I have a pretty bad upload speed (about 1.0 mbit/sec at the most), and mine is actually a LOT better than most of my friends here (Australia), so clips
 can take sometimes up to an hour to upload! At this stage, I basically walk away from my Xbox One and go use my pc... same deal - it would be a great improvement, in my opinion, if we could minimize and upload in the background whilst playing. Obviously it
 could cause issues with multiplayer gaming, but given that people can still do it in a snapped mode, I assume this has either been deemed acceptable or dealt with (I've not actually tried to play multiplayer whilst uploading).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Third</strong> - Give us a way to switch off in-game voice commands, without disabling the system ones. I ---LOVE--- being able to say Xbox go to Skype, Xbox Snap Friends, etc. But so far, of the four games I have played, three have voice commands,
 and two of them (Dead Rising 3 and Need for Speed: Rivals) are VERY touchy. In DR3, the game interprets anything from me laughing to random conversation as me saying "Over Here", and Need for Speed is, quite frankly, awfully incorrect. I think DR3 has a voice
 commands off option, but so far I have not been able to find one in Need for Speed. I often talk to friends via party chat, and now Skype, whilst playing... and it's incredibly annoying to have the commands go off when I say "windows live" in conversation,
 and the game interprets it as me saying "leave" instead of live, quitting the race I am in. Even if we just had to say "game" or something before the command, much like the requisite of "Xbox" before system commands, that would fix it a lot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fourth</strong> - More control over notifications!!! I want to know when my friends come online. Xbox 360 had this, so why doesn't the Xbox One? I want to know when people talk to me on Skype - but I don't need a notification for every single message
 they send - ideally I would just get one for the first message, and none for any subsequent messages until after I read the first one. Even if we could just disable skype notifications, whilst keeping the others, or just have it tell us when our friends come
 online on skype, but not message notifications, that would be good. Or even an option to make the notification smaller, or change the location. Any of these options would be great. As it is, the notification system is a little annoying - I often stop playing
 a game to see 99+ notifications, and I only have a small group of Xbox Live and Skype friends... so I can't even imagine what it would be like for people with larger groups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Finally</strong> - A way to get the game clips off our Xbox without uploading, then downloading. The Game DVR feature is spectacular. I run a gaming website (http://shoddypixels.com for anyone interested) and I am already starting to use clips for
 some video reviews and so on. The footage is spectacular and it all works great. But it's very irritating that, in orderto access it, I need to save the footage, then upload it to SkyDrive, then download it on my PC, then edit it and upload it again. Again
 - this might all change once we have access to USB drives, but even if there were a way to upload it to our pc's via our home networks or whatever, it would be amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, overall, the console is amazing. Loving it so far, and it's a huge leap from the last generation of consoles. I was not expecting the voice commands to be such a big deal, but they are truly something special. Hopefully some, or all, of these suggestions
 were already on their way to being done, but if not... please give me free games to say thankyou XD</p>

<p>^^ China called, they want their wall back. lol, just kidding.<br />
<br />
There are some things I would like back, but they need to move "report" and "delete" away from each other under your messages. I was deleting messages from regular people and twice I hit report accidentally. Or if you do hit report, it should then give you
 an option to make sure that is what you want to do.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, I would prefer an option to eject the disc with the controller.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fix everything.</p>
<p>Almost every game i have played that had multiplayer has had to be fixed. </p>
<p>Every game that comes out requires 1000000 patches to fix</p>
<p>Every game now has DLC where you have to fork out extra money for stuff that probably should have been in the original copy</p>
<p>Games where you can just buy better guns or tanks or equipment such as the HALO 5 req system only allows rich people to get the upper hand. What about the guy that just saves enough for a console and a game then gets smashed by everyone that just buys the
 best gear. Its quite obvious no one cares about people who love the game just the people who throw cash around and its quite obvious with the DLC that comes with every game.</p>
<p>The charge cord on the controller is flimsy and prone to bending and is slightly difficult to attach. My 2nd charge cord i have bought had the light stop working but it still charges.</p>
<p>The whole menu is horrendous with almost every thing i click on and high light lags and not instant. Voice controls a just ok but so many times menu comes up because xbox though i said a command.</p>
<p>Worse console to date. More problems than 360 and if this continues how bad will the next console be?</p>

<p>This thread is like 3 years old, you cant really use halo as an example because even though you can by req packs you can only use them in 1 game mode and only if you reach the required level in that particular game, my play and charge lead is working fine
 had it for 2 and a half years now( take more care with it perhaps).</p>
<p>The menu runs fine for me no lag what so ever, the only time i get lag is when my isp is playing up.</p>

    <title>Xbox Game Pass not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajstubbs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Game Pass not working&#63;</h2>
                    I'm currently unable to access any of the Xbox Game Pass games that I've already paid for. I was charged on my credit card on July 13th and I was still able to play games like Sea of Thieves (an Xbox Game Pass title) as of yesterday, but for some reason
 today I keep getting a message saying that I'm not an Xbox Game Pass subscriber. If I were to try and renew game pass on the Xbox Store it would just give me an error code, and I really don't want to have to do this anyway since I already paid for it about
 a week ago. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

    <title>Surface RT connected to 32&#34; Vizio 720p TV - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ikissfutebol  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT connected to 32&#34; Vizio 720p TV</h2>
                    <p>I recently got a micro-HDMI to HDMI cable to essentially connect so I can watch TV shows not available on Hulu, Netflix, or Amazon, but are from the station/channels website. When I first connected everything, it&nbsp;worked just fine. No issue at all- I could&nbsp;duplicate
 or set it to TV only for the display. I actually took a picture and posted it on Facebook because I was so happy with how easy it worked (both Windows apps and launching the Desktop). Between then and when I tried it next, I dropped my internet speed down
 too low in an effort to cut the cable bill. I tried streaming&nbsp;a show via desktop IE and it wouldn't work, although it displayed everything. I chalked it up to the connection speed. I have since increased our internet speed. Using the same exact set up, I no
 longer get the TV to register that it is connected or that it is a supported device. I will get the occasional black screen with a few horizontal lines on the very top of the TV. I understand that Surface doesn't do native 720p, but it has worked for me before
 so why won't it work anymore? One thing I will say has always been an issue- with the chassis of Surface having the angle, I find that the tiny micro-HDMI connection is quite loose. I'd be perfectly find shaving part of the cord down to have it more contoured
 if I knew it would fix the problem.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Any solutions? I have tried setting the resolution on Surface to 1280x720, but it still either doesn't recognize it, gives me the couple of normally white horizontal lines on the top, or says Not Support on the TV. What IS different is that when I set it
 to duplicate, the Surface's screen stays black until I unplug the cord. Previously, it only did that when set to TV only. I have tried different combinations duplicate, TV only, and extended.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I understand the idea behind not supporting 720p on a computer monitor. The issue is that the vast majority of televisions under about 32" are 720p that you can buy today. Perhaps I am in the minority of people that would love to be able to show pictures
 from the SD card in my digital camera on my TV via my Surface or use it for content my Xbox and Roku cannot access. The only reason for getting the cable was to avoid moving my wife's laptop with it's HDMI to connect to the TV for those shows on (in our case)
 CBS that offer full episodes on their website only.</p>

            <p>Hi Ikissfutebol,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your experience connecting your TV to the Surface RT. Can you verify that the HDMI cable you bought is a standard adapter or the one specific for the Surface device? The reason I ask is because you mentioned the cable not fitting properly
 because of the Surface angle. Microsoft has an adapter specifically designed to work with the Surface products that aligns with the curve of the Surface. You can find that adapter
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Surface-HD-Digital-AV-Adapter/productID.256145000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you do have a standard HDMI cable, this could be part of the problem you are experiencing with the display. I would suggest trying the adapter designed for the Surface to see if you get a better experience connecting to your TV.

            Hi Joey,
<br />
<br />Was that an update from the MSI support website or was that update from Windows?
<br />
<br />Download any USB device drivers you find on the MSI website for your device and re-installing those, should get you up and running again
<br />
<br />If not, boot into Safe Mode, and try updating those drivers:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode       
        </p>

            Hi Joey. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Without keyboard and mouse you may need to create bootable media which boots using different drivers, to access Repair Mode to System Restore to before the Update, Reset or do the Clean install:
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore.  If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.  
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   
<br />
<br />Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Blank or black windows dialog boxes after updating to 8.1 from windows 8</h2>
                    After updating to 8.1 yesterday, all windows related dialog boxes are blank or black. If you scroll over them with the mouse, some words appear but not enough to &nbsp;allow you to figure out what is in them. Internet (via Mozilla/Firefox) works fine as well
 as HP dialog boxes. I can't update java or try other fixes without the dialog boxes. Any suggestions would be much appreciated!

<h2>            Skype close to system tray</h2>
                    <p>Hey there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a quick question about the latest skype on W10:</p>
<p>Is there any way to make skype close to system tray? It's highly annoying that I am currently forced to keep it in my taskbar. If there is, of course the follow-up question would be: How?</p>
<p>If it's not possible: Please get that option back! I've been googling and there is a lot of demand for this option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael Hoogeveen</p>

<h2>            Transferring Photos from Computer To An SD Card</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I know 'how' to transfer photos from the Computer to an SD Card but why aren't the photos that were transferred on the SD Card displayed in the order that they were transferred?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I transferred the photos to the SD Card in a specific order but they were 'scrambled up' when I viewed them on the Digital Camera, not in order that I transferred them nor alphabetically by file name on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos on the computer are displayed alphabetically, regardless of when each photo was transferred to the computer, but how are photos displayed on an SD Card?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Kodak Easyshare Camera and Windows XP, if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, someone knows what I am talking about.</p>

            <p>Windows can't really control it.&nbsp; It sounds like your camera is ignoring the file name alphabetical sort, and possibly using some other sorting system (maybe by the date-modified timestamp on the file?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But unfortunately, the solution will lie entirely with the camera itself.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are different types of password used on computers running Windows 10 such as the
<strong>BIOS (basic input/output system) password</strong>, and <strong>Windows administrator password</strong>. Other computer models have the
<strong>Supervisor password</strong> feature. To verify, may we know what is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>BIOS password</strong> is used to protect your computer from unauthorized use. The
<strong>Supervisor password</strong> is the second security option for your computer. The
<strong>Windows administrator password</strong> is the password used to any Windows account that has administrator level access. If you are referring to the
<strong>BIOS supervisor password</strong>, we suggest that you contact your manufacturer (<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14148/computer-manufacturers-contact-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">OEM</a></strong>) for better
 assistance. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Don’t hesitate to reach out to us for further assistance needed.</p>

            Thank you. I cannot get into the BIOS nor do I have any administrator access. The only password I set was administrator. I do not ever recall being asked for a supervisor password. The computer is a Toshiba Satellite, L55-C5272, Ser #PSKWNU-06801R. It
 came with Windows 10 on it. Any help would be appreciated, even if it means purchasing software to accomplish this. Keep in mind though, that I cannot install or make any changes as a user. I have been thinking of trying to wipe the computer clean and do a
 clean installation, however, computers don't come with reinstallation disks anymore. I would have to be able to download all of the software and make an installation disk. I used to be very computer literate, but I am much older now and a lot has changed.
 I do still know my way around the computer.

<p>Thanks for the follow up. If you cannot get into the <strong>BIOS</strong> and a password is required, it's best to contact your manufacturer for further help. Some computer manufacturers locked out this area to prevent making changes on the machine that
 may cause potential damages. They'll be able to assist you on how to change or remove the password, or you may need to go to their
<strong>Authorized Service Provider</strong> for assistance.</p>

            Ok. But this still doesn't help me. I need to change my admin password right now. I don't have a need to get into the BIOS. Can I change my admin password in the BIOS? If I can, I will get that one. If not, I will still be at square one!

<p><span>If the drivers are not compatible with Windows 10, you may try to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps. Right click on the downloaded driver package file and click on<strong>
 Troubleshoot compatibility </strong>and follow the on-screen instructions.<br />

            <p>Late, but I'm still running a GTX460 v2 with Windows 10 and basically all new drivers from MS or NVidia will eventually crash if I do any gaming. From full on system freezes to frozen screens that you can ctrl-alt-del to reset only to have it freeze in a
 few seconds. Desktop work is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way I can have stable gaming is using NVidia's 347.88 drivers. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go to Command Prompt and type 'devmgmt.msc'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When you are on device manager,&nbsp; and click 'Network Adapters'</p>
<p>&nbsp;two times</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.Right click your adapters and then it should say "Uninstall, Disable, Update Driver Software"</p>
<p>click on Unistall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.Repeat to all other adapters, (adapters only)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.On the top bar, click the 'Action' button and you will be given choices; now click "Scan for hardware changes."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Look at your taskbar, and Voila!</p>

<h2>            POWERPOINT 2010 and WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>I am spending so much time trying to see if things work in <strong><em>Windows 10: Audacity</em></strong> etc. and now I want to use my
<strong><em>PowerPoint 2010</em></strong> or update it to the last version [<strong><em>2013</em></strong>] before
<strong>CC</strong> [my term for <strong>Cloud C$r@p</strong>] or <strong><em>PowerPoint 2016</em></strong>. I bought this new computer and it came with
<strong><em>Windows 10 Home</em></strong> on it...I am getting to the point where my 7.1 disk is really looking good! Just deleting the horrid
<strong>Photo App</strong> is a dive into <strong>PowerShell</strong>. Finally downloaded and am using the
<strong>Windows Photo Viewer</strong> for a quick peek before I open an image in my photo editing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><strong>Question:</strong> Can I reasonably expect to be able to install my
<strong><em>PowerPoint 10</em></strong> from disc and have it work? Is there any place where I can update to just<em><strong>PowerPoint 2013</strong></em>. I expect to pay, so that is not an issue. I have downloaded the updates shown on this forum for the viewer,
 but before I waste my time, I would like some input.</p>

<p>Hello, I have a feature&nbsp;called IP Flood Detection that I see from time to time on my Motorola Cable&nbsp;gateway's configuration page. While I like to keep internet security at high priority, by default my Modem's firewall is set to low. However there is a check

<p>Can I safely turn&nbsp;on IP Flood Detection <strong>without</strong> causing issues with Xbox live, to help prevent DOS attacks?</p>

                    I tried to run my Spysweeper program and found it is not there, so I re downloaded and I couldn't install because there was one already on my computer.&nbsp; I went to control panel to remove and received the message:<br />

            Hi gsrow,<br />
<br />
Here you go!<br />
<br />
Cannot find the Rundll32.exe file when you open Control Panel: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/812340</a><br />
<br />
Alternately, copy the Rundll32.exe file from C:\Windows\System32\DllCache folder to the System32 folder.

<p>Hello Kamel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For defective third party devices, we suggest that you reach out to the manufacturer support for further assistance. They can discuss terms on how you can either have your microphone diagnosed for physical defects, or have it replaced or repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else.</p>
