<h2>            Unable to complete order for Left For Dead 2</h2>
                    
<p>For 2 days I have been trying to purchase LFD2 for the price of €9,99 but every time I click on pay (with PayPal) it shows me the same message.</p>
<p>"Sorry</p>
<div>

<div>
<div>Your purchase can not be completed at this time. Please try &nbsp;again." (translated from Dutch, might not be the exact message).</div>
</div>

<div>I have tried different times (over 2 days), different browsers, even via the xbox and changed the payment option. Funny thing is that this payment method worked perfectly with charging €29,99 instead of €9,99 for Far Cry 3...</div>
</div>

<div>I hope this can be fixed and that promotions are extended. I want to spend my money on some of the games, but if these issues stay I don't think MS deserves it.</div>

<p>Hey Esad,<br />
<br />
There was a pricing issue with L4D2. We were able to resolve that and extended the sale. The sale on that item is closed now but were you able to pick it up while it was on sale?<br />
<br />
Let us know!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Alpha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To diagnose the issue, I suggest you to follow below troubleshooting steps: </p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: Disable Anti-virus software </p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click the <strong>Start</strong> button &gt; <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;<strong>Security and Maintenance&gt;</strong>
<strong>Review your computer's status</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Click the arrow button next to <strong>Security</strong> to expand the section.</p>
<p>3. If Windows can detect your antivirus software, it's listed under <strong>Virus protection</strong>.<br />
4. If the software is on, check the Help that came with the software for information on disabling it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows doesn't detect all antivirus software, and some antivirus software doesn't report its status to Windows. If your antivirus software isn't displayed and you're not sure how to find it, try any of the following:</p>
<p>1. Type the name of the software or the publisher in the search box on the Start menu.</p>
<p>2. Look for your antivirus program's icon in the notification area of the taskbar.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>IMPORTANT: </p>
</strong>
<p>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
<strong>re-enable</strong> it as soon as you're done with the troubleshooting. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>If issue still persist, proceed with method 2. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 2: Reset TCP/IP</strong><br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow the steps provided in below article:<br />
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/299357</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> The link applies to Windows 8 but the steps provided can be used for Windows 10 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            I need help also. I get an error message after i load my video. It shows for a moment &amp; then an ! inside a triangle appears. I have used WMV for several years and never had any problem. I downloaded windows 7 &nbsp;&amp; windows essentials and trouble started.
 How can this be fixed?

<p>
</p><p>yes I have this issue as well today on all our laptops in the household.&nbsp; This is an http 404 error on the Microsoft Metadata web page.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened last September when the&nbsp;URL stopped working and from memory it took over a week for it to be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more of us that contact Microsoft and inform them of the error the faster it will get fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rest assured however, you are not alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards&nbsp;</p>

<p>You are correct this was a Microsoft issue in September 2014 and&nbsp;there was &nbsp;a relevant post on the Windows Eight Forum:&nbsp; We did find a temporary fix.&nbsp; One of the members was successful in contacting Microsoft in Redmond and he managed to get them to repair
 the link.&nbsp; We therefore all reverted our registry keys back to the correct url:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this&nbsp;error raised its head once again on 6th May at approximately 9.30 am UK time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have escalated this issue to Microsoft but so far it has not been fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will find all the reports since 6th May in the link to the Windows Forum here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this clarifies the situation:&nbsp; In a nutshell the forwarding url on their system is once again corrupt in some way.&nbsp; The fixes in the forum are work a rounds and merely temporary fixes.</p>

<p>I agree with you but updates to your operating system are not responsible for generating this issue, I assure you it is not update related it is definitely a broken url on the Microsoft server.&nbsp; Quite a few members have reported this to Microsoft and fingers
 crossed we will eventually get a resolve.</p>

            I am currently in regular contact with a Level 3 engineer at Microsoft who is assisting me with this issue.&nbsp; He has taken screen shots from my system together with recordings to use for analysis.&nbsp; He has now launched an internal investigation into the
 issue and has promised to keep me up to date.&nbsp; When I receive a response I will post the information you.&nbsp; At present he has confirmed there is an issue with the forwarding url in the registry.

            It is now May 22, 2015 &amp; apparently MS has not fixed this metadata staging error problem yet. I first started receiving this error on May 6th also @ 9:42:59 A:M. If anyone has any latest news concerning this please post it. These previous posts have been
 very helpful &amp; a reminder to me not to jump at the first "expert" who has a so-called solution to a problem without first thoroughly doing your research.

<h2>            PC CRASHES AND REQUIRES RESTORE REPEATEDLY. KMODE_EXCEPTION ERROR</h2>
                    <p>Original title: NEW HP PC THREE WEEKS OLD .....................PC CRASHES AND REQUIRES RESTORE REPEATEDLY Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart ,WE WILL RESTART IT FOR YOU , KMODE_EXCEPTION ERROR</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8.1 keeps showing this message: Your PC ran into a problem and needs to restart etc. KMODE_EXCEPTION_ error and others,HAPPENED DURING INSTALLATION OF ANTIVIRUS AND DURING UNINSTALLATIONS especially when using WINDOWS LIVE MOVIE Maker</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;THE ONLY RESOURCE WAS TO GO TO A PREVIOUS RESTORE POINT WHICH MEANT UNINSTALL KASPERSKY AND REINSTALL &nbsp;MCAFEE, AND THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS LOOP WHICH COULD ALLOW VIRUSES IN .... i'M AFRAID TO USE MY NEW PC NOW THAT IT'S WORKING AFTER A HARROWING 48 HOURS
 AND ONLINE REMOTE ASSISTANCE FROM THE TECH SUPPORT WHICH I GOT WITH THE PURCHASE OF MY PC FROM QVC,,,HERE ARE MOST OF THE DETAILS AS SHARED WITH KASPERSKY AND QVC...&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>II'm afraid to shut down my PC NOW !</p>
<p>because I was force to do a restore which removed my security/antivirus and reinstalled the old one THREE TIMES ....</p>
<p>I'm getting the same problem report that restarts the PC repeatedly...it happened after this event :</p>
<div>I have a serious sensitive issue,that I would rather not put online.I don't want to sound like it's a complaint about Kaspersky because their competitor Mcafee may use it against them... I got Kaspersky today because Mcafee crashed my new PC. kaspersky
 has been my choice of security for 5 years,but this pc came with Mcafee,so I tried it.Mcafee was basically spamming my PC with pop ups saying that it was an emergency and that I had to call them immediately,this happened constantly at first,then I got &nbsp;"adult
 content " blocker software,and it slowed down the pop ups,but each time it said to call Mcafee. this was today's message:these messages keep spontaneously opening internet explorer and I cannot close the browser window</div>
<div>Message from webpage</div>
<div>VIRUSES DETECTED</div>
<div>W32.Bundler/Adware may have infected your computer.Call Technical support +1-866-831-5294 (Toll Free) and Give this code 'W91318X' to the Agent to fix This.</div>
<div>I got on chat with them and they pretty much admitted that they are behind the pop ups and said I would have to call them every time it happens ! so after I purchased Kaspersky and your software suggested I uninstall Mcafee it crashed my PC before It could
 finish the download. after dozens of attempts,It could not restart and said the pc had a problem and they would restart it ,over and over again. safe mode didn't work and restore didn't work because it said the antivirus was running,but I could not log on
 to shut off the antivirus,which was not completely installed, so finally after alot of attempts,I got a restore point in safe mode,it restored Mcafee and removed the Kaspersky that I purchased today,so I put an old Kaspersky disc in to install it and used
 the activation code from today's purchase.so I did not download the new software which I purchased today. Is that going to affect it's functioning ?</div>
<div>
<p>and lastly,how do I kill Mcafee. I've partially disabled it for now.it came installed on the PC which I purchased from QVC.it shipped to me direct from &nbsp;China.</p>
<p>So,I had to do the restore twice and I'm afraid to shut down or restart now.</p>
<p>KMODE_EXCEPTION error and other errors.I can send you my event report. i tried to uninstall mcafee and it crashed my pc again ...</p>

                    <p>Saludos a todos, tengo un problema desde hace más de una semana, el juego horizon 4 no se ejecuta con mi perfil en mi xbox one s, cuando llega la primera pantalla de animación, donde da la bienvenida al perfil, el juego se para y vuelve a la pantalla de
 inicio de xbox, esto me sucedio el dia 9 de abril, estaba en una partida clasificatoria por equipos, tuve un problema con la conexión a internet (se fue la conexión) ya está más que solventado el problema de conexión, el juego esta completo con todos los dlc,
 expansion,pase coches... más de 100 euros gastado, está actualizado con la última de este mes la 8ª la de más de 6 gb, he reiniciado, he apagado y desconectado de la corriente durante horas, he reinstalado solo el juego sin borrar la partida y el perfil, he
 cambiado de formato he pasado de disco a digital, la única manera que he encontrado que funcione es con otro perfil que no es el mio, mi perfil no está baneado ni tengo amonestación ni nada parecido, tampoco me da ningun mensaje de error, les pregunto a ustedes
 porque ya no se donde mas preguntar, he abierto unos cuantos reportes en ayuda forza, pero ni contestan, me gustaria seguir disfrutando de este gran juego que no es barato, y los pases caducan, soy fan de esta saga, tengo todos los horizon (los 4) y varios
 forzamotorsport, y es la primera vez que tengo un problema grave y para rematar de momento nadie de los sitios oficiales de forza se ha dignado a ofrecer una solución para un problema grave reportado como ellos piden, ahora entiendo la cantidad de tramposos
 que hay en el juego(velocidades de cohete espacial,eventos hechos en 15 segundos,saltos imposibles...), ¿será porque nadie hace nada?</p>
<p>¿Serian tan amables de darme una solucion sin tener que perder las cientos de horas,progreso,historias,estrellas... y tener que empezar de 0?</p>

 my xbox one s, when the first animation screen arrives, where it welcomes the profile, the game stops and go back to the start screen of xbox, this happened to me on April 9, I was in a team qualifying game, I had a problem with the internet connection (the
 connection was gone) it is more than solved the connection problem, the game is complete with all the dlc, expansion, pass cars ... more than 100 euros spent, is updated with the last of this month the 8th the over 6 gb, I have restarted, I have turned off
 and disconnected from the current for hours , I have only reinstalled the game without deleting the game and the profile, I have changed format I have gone from disk to digital, the only way I have found it to work is with another profile that is not mine,
 my profile is not banned or I have a warning or anything like that, neither does it give me No error message, I ask you because I do not know where else to ask, I have opened a few reports in help forza, but they do not answer, I would like to continue enjoying
 this great game that is not cheap, and the passes expire, I am a fan of this saga, I have all the horizon (the 4) and several for motorsport, and this is the first time I have a serious problem and to top it off no one from the official sites of force has
 deigned to offer a solution to a serious problem reported as they ask, now I understand the amount of cheats in the game (rocket speeds, events in 15 seconds, impossible jumps ...), will it be because nobody does anything?</strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming to the Xbox forums for assistance. I'd be happy tp help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your description of the issue and with the troubleshooting that you have already done with no success, I believe your&nbsp;saved data could potentially have become corrupted when you were disconnected due to the network issues. If you are currently connected
 to Xbox Live, I recommend clearing the local saved games cache and re-sync your game data from the cloud. Sign in to the profile that cannot play and then go to Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;Clear local saved games and then restart your Xbox when prompted to do
 so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this helps!</p>

<p>Hey El Brujo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I see you have gone through extensive troubleshooting but are still unable to access your FH4 without it crashing. You mentioned having used a different profile with no problems which could indicate an issue with the saved data
 associated with your account. If you haven't already done so, try clearing the saves currently stored in your console by going to Settings&gt;System&gt;Storage&gt;Clear Local Saved Games. You also have the option to completely delete your saved data as explained in
 our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/cloud-game-saves-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Cloud Save FAQ</a>. For this option, we strongly recommend you <a href="https://www.forzamotorsport.net/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contact the developer</a> of the game to see how it will affect your purchases as it may vary title by title. Hope this helps! :D</p>

<div>Hello, I already tried to communicate with support forza, by mail and by reports, I tried to upload post, but by writing in Spanish they have not uploaded it.</div>
<div>To start the mail do not answer, and the reports, when I got that they answer me they do it wrong, they try to give me a solution for windows after many days of waiting, when I specify that it was xbox one, you have been the only ones that have answered
 Quickly and meaningfully, thank you very much for that.</div>
<div>Now I do not know what to do, it is regrettable the service that gives support forza</div>
<div>Thanks to this great community for the support and solutions that you have given me, if you know otherwise to communicate with Forza I will thank you</div>
<div>Thanks and regards</div>

<div>Hello Brad.</div>
<div>I tried this morning after 9 o'clock in the morning, I tried to upload another post this time in English, now they are close to nine o'clock at night and they have not yet moderated it, for help Forza took almost a week to give me a Solution, yesterday
 he contacted me (a single message in 5 days) but as if I had not done so, because I specified that it was xbox one s, I try to give solution for windows.</div>
<div>This great community is the only one that has been concerned and has tried to give me solutions that I thank for it.</div>
<div>What remains to be done is to erase my profile of the game and lose my evolution of all forza and motorsport since 2011</div>
<div>It's frustrating, I do not know what else to do, I do not want to lose everything, fh4 at 86% level 1 star and almost 150, more than 300 cars, many stories completed, treasure island finished or almost only missing some drift, complete radars, more than
 26 million in cr, no traps, properties only lack castle, barn cars, doing many hours, motorsport 7 think 95%, and like fh4, designs, good garage etc.</div>
<div>Forgive my English as a translator</div>
<div>Thanks greetings</div>

<div>hello to all, for those who follow the thread, I continue with the same problem for more than a month, several reports opened in Forza official help more than a month ago, some closed and all without response.</div>
<div>Open report in microsoft help on April 18, modified the report on April 20, with all the checks requested by microsoft support, one of them included a test in another console, it took me a handful of hours to do it, between downloads ( approx 5h), trip
 (approx 1h + expenses), they gave me several time periods, which obviously have not been fulfilled, the last communication, it was me who got in touch, like all the other times once I met the deadlines, It was on May 6, I had to reconfirm that I made this
 test, and here I am waiting for a solution, so as not to lose hundreds of hours, making me think of losing all Forza's progress since 2011</div>
<div>regards</div>

    <title>No Audio Output Device is Installed - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erickamrgn1  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Audio Output Device is Installed - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I completed a Windows update back in October of 2018 and noticed the red x over my volume icon.&nbsp; I had an error message that there was no audio output drivers installed on my machine.&nbsp; After trying the fixes listed, I ended up installing a driver from intel's
 website directly that gave me some volume back but it wasn't nearly as loud.&nbsp; I just completed more Windows updates and again the red x is back.&nbsp; I was looking to see if Microsoft released some type of fix since this is happening after an update from them.&nbsp;
 If I have missed it my apologies.&nbsp; It seems that several people have experienced this issue.&nbsp; Any help to get my volume back the way that it was before the October updates would be so much appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            Hi Ericka.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it's a laptop then it may have modified the sound controller driver so it and all other drivers need to come first from the maker's Support Downloads web page.  All other steps here:
<br />
<br />
<br />1) For sound problems first try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Update the sound driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Compatibility problems in Windows 8</h2>
                    Hey guys was thinking why there is so much problem in windows 8 compatibility to drivers and software's compared to windows 7? is it because the windows 8 is much higher version for it to be compatible ? there are many problems related to windows 8.1 especially.
 I myself had the rebooting problem in 8.1 but solved it after a day . are there problems in graphic card drivers and mother board drivers compatibility in windows 8.1 ? &nbsp;

            <p><span><span>Hi Suraj,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Compatibility could be due to problems with software or hardware. It depends on the device manufacturer to release new/updated drivers for Windows 8.1. However, nowadays
 almost all computer manufacturers have Windows 8 default OS. In order for a given hardware device—a printer, graphics card, or whatever—to work correctly with Windows 8, it needs a working driver.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>In many cases, drivers designed for older versions of Windows will actually work just fine in Windows 8.1. However, depending on the class (or type) of device, many
 hardware devices need a new Windows 8.1 specific driver to function properly on Microsoft's latest operating system.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We also have workaround to this issue, you can install the old drivers in Compatibility mode. See:

            <p>This isn't a snippy comment or me trying to be rude. Windows makes the OS and the driver API to make the drivers based on Windows driver foundation. The drivers you install are most likely function drivers and those are made by the vendor and are maintained
 by the vendor. Sometimes they don't update or the don't test fully. Then they cause issues. Including interfering with other vendors drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Driver made for windows 7 and older work well because Microsoft did a good job at keeping them functioning. Drivers made for 8 may have issues because the vendors were assuming it would all work. They were both wrong and lazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, it isn't just the driver. The firmware on devices was updated by their vendors and chipset drivers by their vendors. So any one can cause a issue with a function driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the issues are actually 3rd party virus software. They messed up big time. They are also slow to keep up with security updates and are still breaking once a month. Windows used to do everything to accommodate every vendor but now they want more security
 because the internet has become to popular and malware writer very advanced. One malware can download even more and they can steal all your info as well as be used to control a users PC to infect or assist in infecting businesses.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Defender is free and very good. Microsoft makes it and updates it often. It is set to load first in the kernel which is a huge advantage to protect a PC. If you have or are planning on having issues :) who want to plan on having a computer problem...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to a web site that monitors current issues and adds fixes regularly
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.vindamedia.com/windows-8-general-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vindamedia.com/windows-8-general-errors</a> that is the basic fix all but there are more specific
</p>
<p>fixes too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>One more piece of info. If your PC is breaking often and possibly with increasing frequency, the drive could be failing.

            Go into Windows Explorer (right click on My Computer then Open. Navigate to an mp3 file you want to edit. Left click on the file ONCE. At the bottom of your window you can edit the data. Remember to click save each time you modify something.
<div><br />
<div>A much easier way is to use a programme like mp3Tag v2.50 with which you can also add/change album art. &nbsp;There are many more tags you can add with this software than with Windows Explorer.</div>

<h2>            Need to reset my original skype password - but there is more to it</h2>
                    <p>Okay this is crazy.&nbsp; I just need to reset the password of my original skype account.&nbsp; Get this. . I can sign into my origina skype account on the desktop version of Skype.&nbsp; However, if I sign out of the desktop version of skype, I won't be able to login
 because I forgot the password.&nbsp; So what try to do a password reset and it takes me to the microsoft password reset site and tells me to put in either my "email, Phone or Skype" so I put in my original skype username .. it asks for a password but I don't know
 my password anymore..&nbsp; So it says this - "We can help you reset your password and security info. First, enter your Microsoft account and follow the instructions below."&nbsp;&nbsp; What? um my original skype user name is not affiliated with microsoft . I made the skype
 account many years ago.. way before microsoft even was involved with skype.&nbsp; Anyway, put in my original skype username and click next.&nbsp; Then it has to verify my identity by sending me a security code to my cell phone as a text.&nbsp; Problem is that phone number
 is no longer in use.&nbsp; Now this is where the weirdness starts. So I select "I don't have any of those", then I click NEXT. So now it asks, What Microsoft account are you trying to get back into? My answer?&nbsp; Well my original skype name is not affiliated with
 microsoft. Now the good thing is I still have access to the email address that is affiliated with the original skype account.&nbsp; I just need to change my phone number so I can reset my password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember.. I am currently logged into the original skype account on my desktop, but I dare not log out because I won't be able to login due to not knowing the password.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is anyone else having an issue like me? I hope so</p>
<p>
Thank you all in advance</p>

            Hi Jimmy
<br />
<br />When you are resetting your Skype password, you are actually resetting your Microsoft Account password, because Skype is a connected Microsoft service.
<br />
<br />The only credentials you should be entering to reset the password is your email and any other information required for verification, such as your phone number or email address.
<br />
<br />Normally during the verification process you are asked for the last 4 digits of your 10 digit number.       
        </p>

<p>Exactly.&nbsp; .problem is the last 4 digits of my phone number is no longer valid ..&nbsp; So the the last four will not work because I no longer have access to that phone number. I have a new phone number. . All I need to do is change the phone number on my original
 skype account.&nbsp; Here is a screen shot of my original skype account whichi I am at this very moment logged into on the desktop version of the skype program installed on my computer. Problem is when I do a skype password reset, they ask me to put in old passwords
 and put in the zipcode of when I first made the skype account.&nbsp; Truth is the account is so old, I don't even remember what the zipcode was . Somewhere here in Florida.&nbsp; but I have lived so many places.&nbsp; Look I am simple guy who works in IT.&nbsp; You'd think a
 Systems Admin like myself would be able to fix this.&nbsp; nope..&nbsp; no can do.&nbsp; So if I can just have microsoft or the skype gods change my old cell phone number on my "JSMCGUIRT" skype account.. then that would be great.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update! I just received an email from microsoft stating - "</p>

<p>Well at least as long as I don't logout of my desktop version of skype. I can still use my original skype account.&nbsp; But I can never use skype on my smart phone or another computer.. all because I don't have access to the phone number on my skype account.&nbsp;
 So sad.&nbsp; I can't even skype with my son because I don't have a webcam.&nbsp; I'll just have to by a new webcam.&nbsp;&nbsp; anyway..&nbsp; this can all be fixed if microsoft would just change my old phone number to my new phone&nbsp; number so I can do a password reset and move on.&nbsp;
 Simple.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

 wants me to&nbsp; enter an email address that's different from the one you're trying to recover... hmm okay seems easy enough... done!..
<br />
<p>Oh look they want me enter new characters.. okay let's go ahead and do that. . DONE!. . Hmm I wonder what is next?&nbsp; Let's find out shall we...So I have to check the contact email for a microsft security code.&nbsp; DONE! I have the special
 4 digit code.. oooh exciting... So now I will enter the 4 digit code into... the little box. . then I click next.&nbsp; GASP!.&nbsp; GASP Again. it takes me to a familiar screen I have freakin been to countless times. "Breathe.&nbsp; calm down..&nbsp; it's okay. I know you want
 to skype with your son and your exwife is getting frustrated... "&nbsp; Oh sorry. I got off topic. . okay so...
</p>
<p>now I a series of questions on the site - </p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If possible, answer these questions from a device and location that you've used before with this account.</p>
<p>On the following pages, answer as many questions as you can. If you don't know an answer, just try your best guess. But here is a screen shot of what I am seeing: Notice it says&nbsp; Account recovery for JSMCGUIRT? yeah that is me. Okay so First Name and last
 name is easy. DOB . . easy. Country? USA .. But the zipcode of where i originally made the account has long been forgotten. but I will put in my zipcode of about 20 years ago and hope that works....&nbsp; stay tuned.. Well I got this from microsoft -
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So it appears they use an "</span><span><span><span>automated system" to determine
 who I am for account ownership?&nbsp; HOLY FREAKING HELL. I am the damn account owner. Enough of this damn skynet ****!&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Look I am sorry everyone.. but I am just frustrated.. I know overall it is my fault for not changing my phone number
 when i got a new number. I know it is my fault for not changing my password and remembering it.&nbsp; So forgive me for being angry.&nbsp; I'll contact microsoft by phone and hopefully get this taken care of</span></span></span></p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and update the video card drivers on the computer and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>To uninstall drivers from the device manager follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Start.</b></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “Device Manager” in the search bar.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on
<b>Device Manager</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select the device you wish to uninstall in the Device Manager window and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>You can also uninstall by right clicking on the device and selecting
<b><span>Uninstall</span></b> from the context menu. A dialog box will open asking you if you really wish to uninstall the driver. Click
<b>Yes</b>, then <b>OK</b> in the next window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Install the video card drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>:</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try to do a system restore from safe mode and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>What is safe mode?</strong></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved try to do a system restore from WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment) and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>To&nbsp;enter WinRE you need to insert the installation disc.</span></p>

<h2>            Sandisk Micro SD not being found.</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought an official Sandisk Micro SD Card from a local Samsung store.</p>
<p>It works on every other device, but it seems my laptop can never seem to read any SD card.</p>
<p>I've updated drivers.</p>
<p>I've restarted the computer.</p>
<p>I've updated Windows.</p>
<p>If I click Disk Drivers in Device Manager, I can see that the SD Card has been inserted.</p>
<p>But if I click This PC, I can only see Windows(C:) and Recover(D:).</p>
<p>Help, I've been wanting to transfer videos for the past 3 months.</p>

            Hello Cyanapse,
<br />
<br />I have a workaround but not necessarily a full-blown solution, it's useful until you can find an actual solution, or you can choose to do this every time, whatever works for you.. If your phone, tablet, or other device takes a microSD card, make sure it's in and plug your device into your computer. Go to This PC, and you'll see your device with the microSD card in there. Click that, and your microSD card should appear.
<br />
<br />Best of luck in finding a feasible solution, and good luck. I'd be happy to address any lingering concerns or questions you may have.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Firstly, I would see if the troubleshooter fixes the issue. Click Start and type ""troubleshoot"" then select the first result. Scroll down and choose Hardware and Devices. This may automatically fix the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135...</a>
<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>
<br />
<br />You could also try the steps in this article:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/memory-card-not-show-up-detected-in-mobile-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Note: Non-Microsoft websites are linked. The pages appear to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />If all else fails, you may need to contact your manufacturer to see if they can diagnose a hardware issue.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if you need more help. Thanks!

<h2>            Audio hiccups&#47;stuttering in Windows 7 x64 with various sound cards.</h2>
                    I have audio hiccup occurring one time for every audio/video file I play (at various intervals) on EVERY audio interface (I have Sound Blaster X-Fi and M-Audio ProFire 610) regardless of media player I try (Winamp, WMP, VLC). Both cards have latest drivers,
 my PC is pretty high end (i7-930, 6 Gb of RAM). I suspected hard drive, but it happens when I play file from other physical drives as well. I suspect an issue in general Windows Audio Engine. Any suggestions other than reinstalling Windows?

<h2>            &#34;Control Panel &#62; Networking and Internet &#62; HomeGroup - Share libraries and printers&#34; checked items are not saved</h2>
                    Upon opening this item I am given the check list of Pictures, Music et al. The only selected item is "Printers". When I select one or all of the others and click "save changes" the dialog returns to the previous screen. When I reenter that screen none
 of those selections has persisted. Additionally I cannot change the icon of the configured network. I suspect there to be some bad DADC/SADC mojo afoot, but I am igorant of the vagries of windows permissioning at this great depth. (god I wish there was a way
 to relabel all to defaults.)

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>In order for the HomeGroup networking feature to be working, there are certain Windows services that need to be enabled and running. If you used a program to disable services
 or manually disabled them, it may be causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The services that need to be turned on are listed below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>•DNS Client
</span></p>
<p><span>•Function Discovery Provider Host
</span></p>
<p><span>•Function Discovery Resource Publication
</span></p>
<p><span>•Peer Networking Grouping
</span></p>
<p><span>•HomeGroup Provider
</span></p>
<p><span>•HomeGroup Listener
</span></p>
<p><span>•SSDP Discovery
</span></p>
<p><span>•UPnP Device Host
</span></p>
<p><span>You can turn on the services by clicking on Start and typing in “services” and then clicking on Services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the Services dialog, double-click on the service and make sure the Startup type is set to Automatic and click Start to turn on the service.</span></p>
<p><span>Please try the steps above and let us know if they worked.</span></p>
<p><span>Regards</span></p>

            Word and WordPad are different programs.<br />
Word is part of Office, WordPad is a stand alone app.

    <title>IPv4 Missing - Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrider85  say:</h3>
<h2>            IPv4 Missing - Windows XP</h2>
                    
<p>I currently am trying to setup a gigabit card, after hours of troubleshooting I realized that all I have is IPv6. I need IPv4 in order to connect.</p>
<p>I attempted several ways to try and resolve this issue here are the steps I have taken.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 - go to cmd and try netsh interface ipv4 install - ipv4 not found</p>
<p>2 - Reinstall components in appwiz.cpl</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am pretty much lost after this. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Make sure that you have the latest drivers for the card.</p>
<p>Delete the Card's entry in the Device Manager.</p>
<p>Switch off the computer. Disable in the BIOS if it is an onboard card, or take out a PCI card, and boot one time without the Giga NIC.</p>
<p>Switch Off boot again and install the drivers.</p>

<p>Thank you Jack for the reply.</p>
<p>I have gone through these steps and have been unsuccessful. IPv4 is missing with the on-board LAN and the PCI LAN. This makes me believe now that it is Windows XP that is issue</p>
<p>On-board LAN is Realtek RTL819/810x Family</p>
<p>PCI card is Netgear GA311</p>
<p>What I have found is strange is when I try to install a protocol on either the on-board card or the PCI card it tells me that it is unable to find the drivers. Even after I reinstall drivers or confirm where they are. But If I uninstall a protocol and then
 go back to reinstall it, it lets me reinstall. It's as if IPv4 is completely removed.</p>

<p>I just did some cleanup of this computer, along with some digging to try and find the issue. After several hours I have found that the registry key tcpip4 is missing (I dont know if it is missing because it is not installed).</p>
<p>This is a computer that I am working on, and yes it had a virus. It has be quarantined and is no longer on the machine.&nbsp; Now I am left with trying to find how to get the ipv4 protocol back. BTW, they did not have a restore point or any backup of any kind.</p>

            Hi. Sorry to hear that you're having problems. Unfortunately this is a known issue and currently no one can play Sea of Thieves with the Game Pass. Microsoft announced this here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a>
<br />
<br />They are currently working to resolve the issue. Please let me know if I can be of any further assistance.
