    <title>Windows Vista has no sound - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Vista has no sound</h2>
                    
<p>Please read this carefully before responding.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have a Windows Vista HP m8330f in which the windows portion of the sound does not work.&nbsp; A little more detail.&nbsp; The audio device is a realtek HD audio integrated into the board.&nbsp; The audio device shows up in the device manager.&nbsp; All of the levels in the mixer
 are on and NOT muted.&nbsp; The correct "default" audio settings via the control panel have been selected and verified.&nbsp; The interesting part is I hear sound through media player, media center, and iTunes.&nbsp; This leads me to believe that the hardware and the audio
 driver is correct.&nbsp; So, just for good measure I uninstalled the audio drivers, restarted, reinstalled them, still no love.&nbsp; Then I went to realtek's website and downloaded the codecs, restarted, still no new results.&nbsp; I went a step and ran K-lite codec repair
 utility and still no Windows sounds.&nbsp; When I say windows, I mean the default windows little annoying sounds and internet explorer.&nbsp; Yes, internet explorer has the correct flash player and shockwave and other neccessary items.&nbsp; Anyone with useful optinions
 are welcome.&nbsp;</p>

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />
<br />
Did this problem start right after any updates or changes to any software, or any installation of any new hardware?<br />
<br />
To make sure I understand the current situation, you can hear sound when you are using Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center, and iTunes, but not when you are using Internet Explorer, or any non music, non internet applications?<br />
<br />
Have you tried doing a system restore back to a point before the sound problem started?<br />
<br />
Try running the system file checker to verify the integrity of all the Windows system files:<br />
<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: <br />
Click Start, and then type cmd in the Start Search box.<br />
Right-click cmd in the Programs list, and then click Run as administrator. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click Continue<br />
At the command prompt, type the following line, and then press ENTER:<br />
sfc /scannow<br />
When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved.<br />
<br />
If you have installed any third party CD or DVD burning software such as Nero or Roxio, they can cause driver conflicts, try uninstalling them to see if that solves this issue.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 stuck in Welcome Screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carynagdeman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 stuck in Welcome Screen</h2>
                    <p>I have a Lenovo G50 A8 AMD computer that was running fine with a Win 10 upgrade, until last week. For some reason a file must have gotten corrupted. The computer starts fine goes to the Microsoft login in screen with my name and logo. After I put my password
 in it cycles and says welcome to Windows. Within 3-5 seconds it goes back to initial start screen. It will do this endlessly and will not allow access to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the only user of this computer and I am unable to access the desktop to do anything. After multiple attempts even with a Microsoft Tech I was unable to gain access. To be sure it wasn't a virus I removed the hard drive and scanned it as a slave with
 Bitdefender Total Security 2016 on another computer. No Viruses were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased this computer with Win8.1 and did the upgrade. I do not have my product ID code. Is there anyway Microsoft can supply me with another boot disk or file that I can use to repair my computer? I do not want to format the hard drive and have to purchase
 another Win 10 program. I already paid for it once with my computer.</p>

<p>Hello cary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to check if you are able to start Windows in Recovery Environment.<br />

Refer to the section <em>Entry points into WinRE</em></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Once you are able to access the Recovery Environment, perform a System Restore.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Troubleshoot &gt; </strong><strong>Advanced options &gt; </strong><strong>System Restore</strong></li><li>If prompted, click/tap on an administrator account you want to provide credentials for.</li><li>If this is your first time doing a System Restore, click/tap on <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>If you had previously done a System Restore, select (dot) <strong>Choose a different restore point</strong>, and click/tap on
<strong>Next</strong>.</li><li>Select a restore point that you would like to restore Windows back to.</li><li>Review what will be affected by using the selected restore point. When finished, click/tap on
<strong>Close.</strong></li><li>When you are ready to do a System Restore with a selected restore point, click/tap on
<strong>Next.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Further on, review the below Microsoft help link which can help you to resolve the issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you just want to test it out and check, either open a TIFF format picture if you have one, or create one in Paint. Open PAINT, draw anything you like, click 'file', 'save as', 'other formats' in the 'save as type' field choose TIFF and save it on your
 desktop and finally click it to open it and see.&nbsp; IF that is the viewer you want then see the above article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, is that it appears Microsoft <em>may</em> be removing the old viewer completely in a future update, so even if it worked it may be short lived.</p>

<p>You could also try this method which appears to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>right-click your desktop, click 'New' then 'shortcut' in the text location field enter:</p>
<p><strong>%SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Photo Viewer\PhotoViewer.dll", ImageView_Fullscreen &lt;Full Path To Your Pictures Folder&gt;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So if your pictures are in C:\Users\Chris\Pictures, yours would be:</p>
<p><strong>%SystemRoot%\System32\rundll32.exe "%ProgramFiles%\Windows Photo Viewer\PhotoViewer.dll", ImageView_Fullscreen
</strong><strong>C:\Users\Chris\Pictures</strong></p>
<p>Click 'Next' and enter 'Windows Photo Viewer' or 'WPV' or whatever you want it called, and press [Finish].</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should now have a shortcut on your desktop, click it and WPV should open in your designated pictures folder. But sadly how long it will last is up to Microsoft.</p>

    <title>On Screen Keyboard Mic not showing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dannywoods2  say:</h3>
<h2>            On Screen Keyboard Mic not showing</h2>
                    <p>I recently, yesterday, 'reset' my pc. Windows 10 speak for doing a clean install of Windows 10. I did this to fix a host of worsening problems, glitches and broken features.<br />
<br />
Now, my on screen keyboard no longer displays the mic icon to do dictation. No, I won't use the full Windows speech recognition app, because I've used that for years and it wasn't what I wanted. What I wanted was a mic option for the keyboard, like phones have.&nbsp;<br />
I got it, and now it's gone.<br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Regards</p>
<p>Danny</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS; Also, using my mouse scroll wheel in the setting menus for Windows 10 no longer works. The bar moves on the side but the screen stays the same. Only if I use the mouse cursor to click and drag does it move.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi there<br />
No, unfortunately it didn't help for the on-screen keyboard, but scrolling through the settings menu now works properly after the DISM commands. Thanks!<br />
<br />
I remember being able to open the on-screen keyboard straight from the notifications panel at the bottom right of the screen. But now I can't as it isn't even there.<br />

<p>So there are <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2 on screen keyboards</span> in Windows 10 by the looks of it. There's the one you get through the settings menu. And then there's this one here. This is the one which has the speech to text Button.</p>
<p>I hope this helps anyone having the same problem that I am!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also thank you everyone for your help in getting some of my other problems sorted. And for always being cordial</p>

            You will need an Android Emulator, which would run on a PC, bit a Windows tablet probably would not be strong enough
<br />
<br />BlueStacks is the best Android Emulator out there and it is Free:
<br />
<br />Read about BlueStacks:<a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bluestacks.com/</a>

            Android Emulators can be a good option but I have another suggestion for you.
<br />If your PC supports Miracast, you can project your Phone screen to your PC:
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/269093/how-to-cast-your-windows-or-android-display-to-a-windows-10-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/269093/how-to-cast-yo...</a>
<br />This means you would play your games on your phone, but the display would be on phone.

            the HDMI connection carries video and sound, not network traffic, so it will not connect your tv to the internet.
<br />smart TVs have either a wireless or an ethernet connection to your router, for internet access.
<br />
<br />however you can extend your desktop and display your browser on the tv,
<br />plug in the HDMI cable 
<br />select the correct HDMI input on the tv
<br />press windows key + P
<br />choose extend from the flyout
<br />open you preferred browser and drag it to the tv

<p>I eventually had to turn my pc off for the night so it did update itself and I have turned the pc on afterwards and nothing strange has happened. What do you think? I have such limited comprehension of these types of things?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Muchly thanks</p>

            <p>Same problem for me with Windows 8.1. I don't know what triggered this. When I started my PC this morning, the&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Trigger External Graphics Family update message appeared. It asked no permissions,
 just "restart now or later?" First I said later. When I tried to open Excel 2013, I saw a message saying there was a problem and Excel could not be opened. So I restarted my PC. Now Excel, Word and Power Point won't work. Oddly, Outlook 2013 is working fine.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After some searching online I saw a couple of references to a StarTech external display adapter. I have been using one of those for more than a year with no problems up to today. I'm
 not much of a techie so much of what is being discussed is way over my head. There are no issues with my displays, only with the Office programs. I tried unplugging the USB for this device and restarted my PC but that didn't help.</span></p>

<p>If you get the update message, go ahead and reboot and then immediately go and uninstall it.</p>

<h2>            Trying to delete a system partition on an HDD after reinstalling Windows 10 on an SSD</h2>
                    <p>I can't delete this wretched OEM system partition on my HDD which originally had Windows 8.1 preinstalled on it. After upgrading to Windows 10 I've since bought an SSD and installed Windows 10 onto it seperately and was using dual boot for a while so I could
 choose between my HDD OS and my SSD OS. I then transfered everything I needed from my original 1TB HDD to my 1TB SSD and my new 4TB HDD and I've deleted all but one partition from the original HDD, which I still want to use and simply wipe clean before I do.
 It's an OEM system partition though and won't delete using an administrator command prompt and diskpart, even with the override command:</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>To delete a partition containing system files, you have to delete it in Windows PE mode. You can complete deleting with some bootable media, bootable USB drive or bootable CD.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if you don't have any bootable devices, you can try <a href="http://www.disk-partition.com/help/wipe-data.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wipe disk</a> with AOMEI Partition Assistant. The standard version is free for W10. It offers you up to 10 times to erase your disk. If it detects the partition contains system files, it will complete wiping under restart mode automatically. In a word, no user-interaction
 needed.&nbsp;</p>

"Setup was unable to create a new system partition or locate an existing system partition. see the Setup log files for more information"<br />

            I&nbsp;think you need to provide some motherboard SATA&nbsp;drivers for the&nbsp;installation to proceed. These will be available on your motherboard manufacturer's site.<br />
<br />
When installing Windows 7 (and Vista) you do not need to format the hard disk. Just identify the space on which you want to install and let the installer do the&nbsp;rest.

<p><span>Hi melrockz,</span></p>
<p><span>Try these steps to rename entries in the boot menu:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Start your computer and choose either entry from the boot menu. After startup completes, make a note of which installation is running.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Click the
<span><strong>Start</strong></span> button </span><span>, type
<span><strong>cmd</strong></span> in the Search box, and press CTRL+SHIFT+ENTER. Click
<span><strong>Continue</strong></span> in the User Account Control box to open an elevated Command Prompt window.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type the following command:
<span><strong>bcdedit /set description "Menu description goes here"</strong></span> (substitute your own description for the placeholder text, and be sure to include the quotation marks). Press ENTER.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Restart your computer and note that the menu description you just entered now appears on the menu. Select the other menu option.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Repeat steps 2 and 3, again adding a menu description to replace the generic text and distinguish this installation from the other one.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 now will not auto-lock or turn off the monitor</h2>
                    <p>My Win 8.1 machine has been working perfectly where it will automatically lock after 10 minutes and turn off the monitor after 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, seemingly for no reason, it will not do either.&nbsp; I have checked the settings under screen saver and it's set the same it always is:&nbsp; "Wait 10 minutes, on resume display logon screen."&nbsp; Screen saver is set to None so it just locks instead of doing a
 saver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have checked under "Change Power Settings" and still confirm that "Choose when to turn off the display" is set to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything is the same as it always is, except it won't go into lock and it will not turn off the monitor any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>

Here</a> . This "mod" doesnt really change the settings for the speed but it does allow you to tweak some other stuff for the bubbles screensaver. Just have a mess with some of the settings and see how things go from there. Sorry if this sounds vague but its
 all i can think up of right now - better than nothing i guess. M$ really does need to fix this, theyve nothing for ages now :(</p>

                    <p>I'm stuck and I'm very, very frustrated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change my privacy/online safety settings so that I can access clubs, but for some reason I'm locked out of that option because apparently there's a parent/adult account blocking that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only one other account on my xbox one, but that isn't the parent account. I have tried the GT i created on this laptop's email (it's my grandparents) but that isn't it either. So I have no idea who's account it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible account that I think could be causing this is one called **********, except that I don't know the email/password for it nor is it on my computer or xbox. Can anyone help me?<br />

            I got this error when I ran Windows Update for the second time on a Dell PC running Vista after reverting it to factory settings then performing an offline installation of Vista SP2. &nbsp;The first time, Windows Update closed; then when I ran it again, the
 error appeared. &nbsp;On performing a restart, there was a brief 'Configuring updates'; Windows Update then ran successfully. &nbsp;So, most likely Windows Update had updated itself and needed a restart before it could be run again.

<h2>            Unintentional screenshots on Surface Pro 3 with no PRNT SCR button</h2>
                    My Surface Pro 3 occasionally takes random screenshots and if I am initiating this somehow, I have no idea how. I am not accidentally holding down the Windows key and hitting the volume-down button. There is no print screen key on my keyboard. The images
 end up in a OneDrive folder and I delete them. If I TRY to take a screenshot by holding down the Windows key and hitting the volume-down button, the screenshot goes somewhere that I haven't tracked down yet. So I know how to take a screenshot when I want one,
 but not how or why the Surface is taking them by itself.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have Windows 8 using SATA AHCI 2TB drive.</p>
<p>I just added 64GB mSSD and now would like to get it to cache my HDD using Intel Rapid Storage Technology.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;prefer not&nbsp;to re install Win8.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To my understanding I have to do something with Win 8 registry to support RAID and then in BIOS change from AHCI to raid and reboot.</p>
<p>I found Fix It 50470 to do this for Win7 but does not run on Win8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone help me?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Gary</p>

<p>I spent a few hours hunting for this same information.&nbsp; Then I finally found this KB that seems to answer the question.&nbsp; I have not yet tried it myself, so I cannot say for sure that it works.&nbsp; But it sounds like a reasonable approach -- basically just let
 the OS know it will need to boot in safe mode before changing the SATA mode in BIOS.</p>

<h2>            Black Ops 4 won&#39;t launch. Smh. Typical of your trash MS OS</h2>
                    So, I have yet ANOTHER issue, as always, with your god awful operating system. BO4 won't launch no matter what I do to fix it. First Forza&nbsp;horizon 4, now this. Like, really? Windows you need to be sued for everything you have. You're an absolute trash
 company that shouldn't exist. As if paying 220$ for this sorry excuse of a platform wasn't bad enough, every single time I try to install a new game or some kind of software, there's ALWAYS something due to YOUR end. Like do you even do any real testing before
 you just throw out whatever updates? Like "eh, well if it screws everything up well try to fix it a few months from now". I'm so sick of this. You people need to just make your&nbsp;OS an open source. You clearly have no idea what you're doing. Let the community
 fix what you obviously can't. Stop charging people for this crap! I've spent the last day endlessly trying fix after fix and all I've come up with is that anyone who has updated their system to this trash 1809 build, we're basically beat until you guys get
 off your asses and actually do some work. Thanks, again, for destroying everything you touch. Smh. Worthless.<br />
<br />
*Edit - And before you try to tell me to do a clean installation of Windows 10, NO. I'm not. I refuse to keep having to REINSTALL my OS, along with over 15TBs of games, software, audio plugins, etc. You guys need to come up with an actual solution because I'm
 sick of wasting countless time &amp; internet bandwidth trying to download &amp; reinstall everything just because you guys can't seem to do ANYTHING right. So, before your autoresponse bots come in, or worthless tech that has the same exact answers "Update your drivers,
 do some completely unrelated steps that have absolutely nothing to do with the problem, then when all else fails, do a completely clean installation of windows." NO. I'm not. So come up with a better response. You act like we haven't already&nbsp;tried all of that!
 I'm tired of being nice to you people. It's problem after problem, all stemming from YOUR OS. Fix the issue. People have had this problem for months and yet, nothing has been done about it. I didn't just waste all that money, AGAIN, on a game that I can't
 even play because I just so happened to upgrade my system to your latest jacked up build. Smh.&nbsp;

<p>First... You are ranting up the wrong tree. Nobody here has anything&nbsp; to do with Windows development or the MS Store,
</p>
<p>and only a couple of people are actually employed by MS.</p>
<p>Also - Black Ops 4 is not a Microsoft game. Baring a few actual MS exclusives such as Forza and GOW4, both of which
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">are</span></em> horribly bugged apparently, the MS Store is just another online game retailer, with an apparently very buggy client software
</p>
<p>(just going on these forums. I've never used the MS Store). Best option here is... Don't use the MS Store.</p>
<p>Win10 is no better, no worse than Win7 for gaming. The MS Store is another story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- That out of the way... You need to post details about what is, or is not happening. We can't begin to start making suggestions
</p>
<p>without details. Include your system specifications. Graphics brand and model in particular.</p>
<p>Any information you think may be <em>helpful</em> in troubleshooting your problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I certainly won't be suggesting a clean Win10 install. My Win10 v1809 build is based on an upgrade from Win7 installed in Jan2010, and cloned to two new machines since (with new licenses). So no, I'm not hung up on 'clean' in any way.</p>
<p>Why would anyone ? MS does massive 'updates' twice a year, so Windows has a chance of either getting 'cleaned' up, or totally borked
</p>
<p>every six months or so.</p>
<p>- I haven't had any issues with the version updates, but still don't take any chances (Murphy's Law syndrome), so I clone my</p>
Windows just prior to downloading the update assistant when version update time rolls around.
<p>- I did do a clean install on another SSD to compare, and found no real world, or benchmarking tool improvement, so I'm back</p>
<p>with old trusty because I can't be bothered spending who knows how many hours sorting out all my stuff for nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- However, I would suggest reinstalling the MS Store client if you are having issues with games from that source.</p>
<p>Even Steam needs their client reinstalled now and then. Far less frequently than say, ten years ago though
</p>
<p>(I had to reinstall Steam after1607 update, I think it was). </p>

<p>Well, after an entire day of research, the common denominator&nbsp;seems to be that everyone who has upgraded to the 1809&nbsp;build hasn't been able to get the game to launch. You're right. I'm just mad that this is an ongoing issue with literally everything I try
 to do. Every single game I buy ends up having issues due to MS. And the only thing I'm ever told is literally like they copy/paste the same response to everyone for every issue. Basically just telling us to update our drivers and do some weird things like
 disabling features or something that should have no relevance to the issue, and usually, don't. Then when all else fails they always resort to telling me to do a clean installation of windows. Which it's only been like 3 months since my last "clean" installation.
 So I'm getting sick of doing it just because MS can't seem to solve any problems other than telling everyone to reinstall windows. Which inevitably never solves the issue just straps a band-aid on it. I have a completely brand new system, that's 4 months old.
 It happened with forza, they update windows and the game fails terribly. Then they wait forever to push out a fix or obligate forza to do it for them. I'm just getting so sick of spending so much money on games just for them to never work. As if spending 220$
 on windows 10 pro wasn't bad enough. I spend 100$ on&nbsp;forza horizon 4 to have endless issues. Sure, maybe not entirely all due to MS, but they play a huge part to the point forza&nbsp;told everyone to roll back their windows updates as a fix. Which I can't do. Now
 back to BO4. I literally just bought it yesterday through blizzard, and no matter what I do, it fails to launch. Well, it launches, but then freezes on the intro and crashes. I've reinstalled my GPU drivers, GeForce experience, I've even updated to a beta
 version cause someone said that helped them. Nothing worked. I've reinstalled the game twice now, eating up 85GBs of bandwidth each time. The only recommendation I've found online is that you literally disable every driver that isn't related to windows to
 have it run. Which is absolutely insane. And I've closed every program I have running, like realtemp, openhardware&nbsp;monitor, CPU-Z. Turned off overlays in Nvidia GeForce&nbsp;experience. Restarted the PC. Cleaned out my PC with C-cleaner. Closed out any unnecessary&nbsp;software
 through task manager. Nothing works. It still crashes at the same point, and every time I try to run it again, the window pops up about running it in safe mode and no matter what I choose, it still crashes. I can't even try to run the game in windowed mode
 because it crashes before I can even have a chance to. Idk what else to do. I'm reading over all these forums that have people with the same issue that have been happening since the game's launch. And it's been 2 months, now. Since early October. There should
 have been a fix for this far before this point in time. I'm sorry to sound rude but I've literally had it with MS' windows 10 always having issues. It was like this for my old PC, and now I built an entirely new one thinking maybe it was a hardware issue,
 and now it's doing the SAME things. So it's def got something to do with windows. And they don't ever seem to wanna do anything about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sorry, but I also have difficult reading walls of text, so I may have missed some things. I wasn't aware of a BO4 - Blizzard connection.</p>
<p>So not a problem with the MS Store then. <br />
</p>
<p>- We have similar systems. Mine is a bit earlier though - Maximus VII w/ i7 4970 &amp; GTX980 &amp; PG279Q monitor.</p>
<p>Corsair AIR 540. A two year old machine when I bought it at a sweet price (w/ 1TB SSD too) from a young bloke who</p>
<p>works at a PC parts dealer. </p>
<p>64GB RAM ? How much of this gets used ? I just manage to top out 8 of my 16GB on one or two games. I don't mulit-task though.</p>
<p>Been on 1809 since it was fixed up and re-released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK - Not in any way an MS fan boy, but...</p>
<p>I <em>very</em> much doubt Win10 is the source of your ills. Assuming the install is not corrupted. Win10 is not inherently buggy.</p>
<p>As you may be aware, if you visit the Nvidia or AMD forums you will find heaps of people blaming every new driver release
</p>
<p>for then end of mankind. New drivers are rarely the real source of peoples ills.</p>
<p>Similarly, Win10 updates obviously do cause many issues, but the greater number of people with issues are using what is honestly</p>
<p>too old hardware for Win10 (MS won't admit this though). That and yes, the version updates are inherently dangerous.</p>
<p>How can a 4+GB uncompressed version download not be a big risk when overwriting large chunks of Windows ?</p>
<p>And they talk like 'rolling back' if you don't like it is not at least as big a risk as the update. Yeah! Right.</p>
<p>It's hard to say if MS will be able to continue with this business model much longer. Even a once a year major update would be</p>
<p>too tedious for millions of Windows users, but it may lessen the anti-Win10 backlash if they did so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My game collection is only in the 200+ range, but I have not had any issues running games (beyond the 'normal' trials games offer),
</p>
<p>and have only two or three old games that no longer run on Win10, or don't run properly (Crimson Skies runs well on my machine
</p>
<p>with AMD graphics, but the textures are stuffed on Nvidia and Intel HD graphics).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Back to the issue at hand. I can't offer much by way of additional troubleshooting, but...</p>
<p><em>"I'm reading over all these forums that have people with the same issue that have been happening since the game's launch."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Sounds like the game is the source of the problem then. Much like the Forza series and GOW4 have been buggy for a couple of years now.</p>
<p>Reminds me of Batman: Arkham Knight, which was so bad Warner Bros pulled it and spent months repairing it. If I remember</p>
<p>correctly they gave refunds as well. </p>
<p>Fortunately I'm an ancient relic who doesn't do online gaming so I generally don't buy games until they are about a year old, so I</p>
<p>am able to avoid these disasters. I'll probably give Arkham Knight a go some time soon. It's fixed (I hope) and cheap as chips these days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- While you seem to have done everything regarding conflicts from various programs, you may still have missed something</p>
<p>that does not cause a problem for everyone.</p>
<p>You mentioned turning off various monitors, but do you have any 'optimising/tweaking' software running ? Tried disabling your Anti-virus ?</p>
<p>Skype, or similar com programs ?&nbsp; A BattleNet conflict ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- Have you <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">updated your BIOS and other mobo drivers</span> since building the new machine ?</p>
<p>Are the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> BIOS settings for cpu and RAM at default ?</span> No cpu OC or dialling up RAM speed in BIOS ?</p>
<p>- <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Do you have Hyper-threading enabled ?
</span>Some games hate Hyper-threading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"I've even updated to a beta version cause someone said that helped them."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen this suggested many times over the years, but never understood how BETA would be the better option. PC's are like that.</p>
<p>Gotta go for long shots some times.</p>
<p>I recently installed the only Nvidia driver I've ever had a serious problem with - 417.01 - It whacked out my system bad, particularly</p>
<p>when exiting FC5, so I reinstalled 416.16, which is faultless. Yeah! I know I said drivers are only rarely faulty. This was my one exception</p>
<p>in 14 years. I'll probably move forward again with the next release of the new year though.</p>
<p>I don't use the GF Experience as it has been know to cause issues in the past, and Nvidia Control Panel has everything I need.</p>

</p><p>This is the error code that just started popping up. I looked it up but haven't found anything about this specific code. And I've reinstalled the blizzard app, the game twice, and I tried the "fix" for some people, that was disabling every service in MSconfig
 other than microsoft&nbsp;services. I wrote to Activision&nbsp;asking them for assistance. Idk what else to do. I've tried everything. I guess I'm beat for the money I spent on this dang game. It's nothing but a desktop icon at the moment. This is so jacked up. I mean,
 even forza&nbsp;didn't have this severe&nbsp;of an issue. So, I suppose I'm just never going to be able to play it. At least until either microsoft&nbsp;comes up with a fix or figures out what's causing it to happen, or activision/blizzard releases some kinda fix/update.
 Smh. They should have just stuck with Steam. Never had issues with any of my COD games on steam... Of course, though... People have a working system and always have to go changing stuff and breaking everything. Or windows just breaks everything with every
 update they have. I can't even install the older 1803 update cause it says "there's a newer version available please download that". Smh. Soooooo coooool. -_- And like I said, I'm not going to completely reinstall windows, just for the dang game to probably
 still not even work, and then have to reinstall over 15tb's worth of software &amp; games just for this one game. Like, why can't anything just ever work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looks like our posts have crossed. Yours was half way though my ten minutes of edits

<p>I can't add anything regarding the error code that you would probably have already found.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Mate! We're PC gaming. Nothing is supposed to be easy. That's console gamer country.</p>
<p>Yeah! Maybe set the game aside for a while and see what comes up when you visit the Activision, or even the Steam forums again</p>
<p>in a few days/weeks.</p>

            Well, tbh I just literally updated my bios to the latest a little less than a week ago. I don't run anti-virus software, cause it's usually useless anyway lol... I have malwarebytes&nbsp;but I don't actually ever have it open until I wanna run a scan. I don't
 have any tweaking software, other than ai suite from asus, but that doesn't really do much... mostly just my fan xpert&nbsp;controls. I do have an overclock to 5ghz on my 8700k and my ram is running at it's intended XMP @ 3466mhz. I don't use skype, I uninstalled
 that forever ago lol... And I just reinstalled the blizzard app. I doubt it's that, though because destiny and WOW load up and play just fine. BO4 is the only game atm having issues. PUBG, Forza Horizon 4. All the games I play seem to be fine. I reinstalled
 all my GPU drivers. I've done just about everything I could find online. Like I said, though... I read on reddit&nbsp;and a few other sites that it seems that people who upgraded windows 10 to the latest october/november&nbsp;1

</p><p>This is where it usually freezes. Sometimes, I'll get a picture of the intro where the gun shows up but then crashes in the same amount of time. I've already tried resetting&nbsp;my mobo's default settings. It does nothing. I there's crash logs that I can't read
 because WinDbg won't open them. Keeps giving me an error. And the few that will open are in RAR form, and it said one problem was my intel rapid storage software, so I uninstalled that, and it didn't fix it. I tried creating a new local account, that failed
 as well. Same with trying to run it in safe mode. So it's safe to assume, that it's def a microsoft&nbsp;issue. Yet, no one has replied. Probably because the last time I tried to ask for help for forza. I made have been a bit rude but tbh like I said, I'm done
 kissing ass to these people. They're literally useless. It's sad when the community can find better fixes for things that they can. MS is literally redundant. With their repeat responses. Idk I guess I'm going to hit up Activision&nbsp;for a refund. It's been 2
 days and a whole night trying to fix this with no luck. I swear, I'm never upgrading my windows build ever again. I hope microsoft&nbsp;crumbles and their stocks fail and they have to give up their entire business. It's good for nothing.&nbsp;</p>

            Well, I just ran DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller), instead of doing it manually, and that did nothing. So it's NOT a driver issue. I guess MS is going to ignore me. Smh. I don't even care at this point. I'm so over this.

    <title>Installation problem with &#34;The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installation problem with &#34;The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle - Earth&#34;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>This is kind of a weird question, but anyway...</p>
<p>I have a PC Game called "The Lord of the Rings, The Battle for Middle - Earth", bought, at around, 2 years ago and I wanted to install it again. The problem is that, then, I had Windows XP Home Edition and now I have Windows 7 Home Premium. Anyway, I remember
 that during the installation, an error occured at around 63% and the computer poped up a message, exactly, like this:</p>
<p>"A problem occured when trying to transfer the file 'D:\Support\sv\lasmig.txt' from the media. Do you want to retry the copy the file or cancel the installation?"</p>
<p>---Retry &nbsp; ---Cancel</p>
<p>(Retrying, keeps up poping this message up and Cancellation brings the progress back to 0%)</p>
<p>I, also, remember that I had called the company I bought it from, here, in Greece and they helped me solve the problem. They told me I needed to change the language of the system from Greek to English (UK) or something. I did it and restarted, then, the
 computer and this worked! Yesterday, when I tried to install the game again, this annoying message reappeared... But, now, I have Windows 7 and the Control Panel is a lot different than the XP. I do not know how to change the language or even if this is the
 problem or something else... I googled this all day, yesterday, but I found nothing. And the company doesn't reply.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me, please? I would be grateful! Thank you.</p>
<p>P.S.: If the game is uncompatible with Windows 7 Home Premium, tell me so, in order not to try anything more.</p>
<p>I hope a solution can be found.</p>

<p>From another board: "Try and copy the dvd to your hdd and install from there. Or try and rename the text file, if it's any in it." That solved the same problem in another case.</p>

    <title>Camera sign-in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> melanielapointe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Camera sign-in</h2>
                    I picked the facial recognition as sign-in on my Surface Go.&nbsp; I've had it only 1 month and 10x it has not let me sign-in, stating it can't turn on the camera!!&nbsp; That is extremely annoying because the other sign-in options are also obsolete because it won't
 pop-up a keyboard to sign-in with password, and the small PIN pad for numbers only (to sign-in with pin) does not have an enter button!!&nbsp; What is that!&nbsp; I guess the Go needs use of a keyboard....&nbsp; I thought it was meant to be light! so I do not want a keyboard!!&nbsp;
 For it to work I need to restart it.&nbsp; Waste of time....&nbsp; I need it for work so pressed for time and I thought the idea was to quickly sign-in!&nbsp; Anyhow any ideas on how to fix this?&nbsp; Maybe I forgot something at set-up?&nbsp; Thank you

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>Thank you for bringing this up.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To better isolate this issue, we would like you to answer some question:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>&nbsp;</strong>What operating system did you use?</li><li>Are you able to sign in using other options?</li><li>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</li></ul>
<p>To answer your question above, have you ever tried to sign -in using school email. If so, and still doesn't work, use your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
<span><span>
</span></span></p><p>I believe it has something to do with the update for the driver. Here are some&nbsp;recommendations on what you are going to do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Go into Settings from the Start menu and do a search for Device Manager</p>
<p>2. Open Device Manager and scroll down to System Devices</p>
<p>3. Expand the System Devices options and scroll to Surface Camera Windows Hello</p>
<p>4. Right click on Surface Camera Windows Hello and select Properties</p>
<p>5. Click on the Driver tab and then choose roll-back driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span><span>In the meantime, we also suggest you to go to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023510/surface-troubleshoot-problems-with-windows-hello-on-surface?os=windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Hi,
<p>Check with the printer maker&nbsp;for updated drivers and their Support for known issues.</p>
<p>Check chan vu's message here - the very top one.<br />
<br />
fixed spooler subsystem app stopped working<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistaprinting/thread/460f297a-dd66-4476-a176-542e1519ca3e" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/itprovistaprinting/thread/460f297a-dd66-4476-a176-542e1519ca3e</span></a><br />
<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Go to whoever made the printer and get the latest drivers - Download - SAVE - do not install yet. When<br />
ready to install - Right Click on the driver - Run As Admin.<br />
<br />
Use this method to clear the spooler then uninstall and reinstall your printer (check with the maker for<br />
the latest driver).<br />
<br />
Check the Mr Fixits here and if you have to use the other methods go back and try them again afterwards.<br />

    <title>My display is too big for my screen and I can&#39;t fix it - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lipgloss_veins  say:</h3>
<h2>            My display is too big for my screen and I can&#39;t fix it</h2>
                    For some reason, my display now is far too big for my screen. I can no longer see the top(File, edit, minimize, close) or bottom (the Start button, the clock) at the same time without having to move my mouse to those sections. But it's not just when I
 use the internet. It's all the time. When I try to change the resolution, it only changes what I see on my screen and not how much I see of it. Restarting doesn't do any good either. I have an Eee PC Netbook, model 1005HA. It's brand new. Can anyone think
 of anything that I can try? Thank you!

            Actually, I figured out what it was. Apparently my screen was switched into a different mode causing it to do that. How it got that way I'm not sure, but it's fixed now. Thank you!<br />
