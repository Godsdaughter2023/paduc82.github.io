<br />Navigate to User Configuration/ Administrative Templates / System.
<br />In the work area, double click on "Prevent Access to registry editing tools".
<br />In the popup window, encircle Disabled and click on OK.

            <p><span>Hi Louis,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your queries in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern and will assist you to resolve these issues.&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The black screen issue could be related to display drivers and might get resolved by updating the display drivers.</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Without the correct driver, the hardware or device that you want to use won't work properly.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Unplug all external devices connected to the system and restart the system once to check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you can see a mouse cursor:</span></p>
<p><span>While at the black screen, try using <strong>CTRL+SHIFT+ESC </strong>to start Task Manager.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it becomes visible, try finding LockAppHost.exe on the Details tab and ending the task.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Further you may also update the display drivers from Device Manager to see the status.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As you have black screen, I also suggest you to refer the following article for help and check if the issues persists.

    <title>Windows 8.1 wireless driver problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> show foongjap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 wireless driver problem.</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire 4743 laptop that comes with Windows 7 home premium 64 bit. Recently I upgraded it to Windows 8.1. I cannot connect to the wifi. I tried to download the driver from
<a href="http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> . <br />
<br />
However, when I am installing the driver, I get the error "The installer cannot run on this platform. Please select package for your operating system". For your information, I downloaded the driver for Windows 8 64-bit. Is it because the driver for Windows
 8 does not work on Windows 8.1? <br />
<br />
I appreciate any help.<br />

<h2>            I am still having the same Issue as before.. I can not get any drive to boot in my computer.</h2>
                    It came preinstalled with windows 10. when I was trying to do a system recovery it failed halfway through after it had deleted everything but before It had installed anything. I have been at it for days now trying to figure out how to save the computer
 but unfortunately I have tried probably dozens of different ways to format the drive and this and that so on. I have been completely unsuccessful. The computer just keeps saying that it doesn't recogniaze any bootable disk to please insert a bootable drive..
 So... much to my dismay I am going to once more attempt to create a bootable windows 10 drive to try and rescue this PC. I will be cleaning the drive, setting up the partition, &nbsp;and the format all via CMD before I even try to but the windows 10 iso onto the
 disk. My question to you is specifically once I clean the disk, what kind of partition should I create on it, and then how should I format it?

<p>Unplug all other drives than the one you want to install Windows upon.&nbsp; Later when you plug them back in, if they previously had WIndows on them then you should move the data off, delete all partitions and reformat in Disk management as a data drive.&nbsp; You
 cannot leave old WIndows partitions on a data drive!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could
 buy:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To create bootable Windows 10 Installation Media (on another PC if necessary) install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions in the middle of the download page here:&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/en-hk/software-download/windows10?d2784474-fdb0-4e9d-9e47-5e88c0e053ec=True</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key for your PC maker given in this chart: https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, select the Unallocated Space, click
 Next to let it create and format the needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a step to rescue your files first using the booted media if you don't have them backed up:&nbsp; http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.&nbsp; It's a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works
 best and how to apply it with your own hands.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi, I have a surface book 2. I am trying to connect the unit to a large screen tv to show presentations. Is there an accessory cable that connects from the USB C port to a HDMI socket? I can't see any other way of doing this? Thanks, Mark.</p>

<h2>            xbox one built in pvr </h2>
                    
<p>xbox should add an option to continue the recording.</p>
<p>meaning when &nbsp;i start the recording after 5 minutes the clip ends and it should automatically start recording another 5 minutes again. as i cant keep snapping and going through my apps to hit endclip when im in the middle of a game.</p>
<p>so basically when we hit start record on the xbox one. it should keep recording 5 minutes clips and saving them automatically. so after the game is finished, we can go to upload studio and put the 5 minute clips togeather so its recorded a full game.</p>
<p>it bloody sucks anyway. why the hell would they even bother letting you record if there only gonna give you 5mins. wtf can i do with 5minutes.my ps4 records for 15mintues and is always constantly recording in the background . but i play mlg on xbox one so
 thats why im asking for it to be improived on this 2nd class console that i should never of bought.&nbsp;</p>

 for a bit, and even streamed my Xbox One to my pc for @#$%'s and giggles. I came back later that day at about 9:20ish P.M., and it seemed to load properly, and I didn't have any problems while in the login screen. About 20 seconds after I logged in, it starts
 doing this *</span><strong>awesome</strong><span>* thing where the screen flashes between the desktop and a black screen, for about 30 seconds. And then it stops for another 20, and goes back to flashing for 30, and back to another 20 seconds of actually functioning.
 You get the point.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Anyways, while it's flashing, I cant open any menus, there's&nbsp;</span><span><strong>NOTHING</strong></span><span>&nbsp;on the Taskbar, the Start Menu wont open, and nothing else seems to be functioning. I'm really stuck and confused, and this is on a $1,900

            Hi, I have the same problem. Just loaded Windows 10 (had Windows 8) and when the computer starts up, after I put my password in, I get a blue flashing blank desktop screen, that flashes to black continually. LockAppHost.exe does not seem to be running.
 I've checked. What can I do??? I've tried logging off and on, but just get the same problem. Can't use my computer at all!!&nbsp;

            None of it worked for me either, then I found this solution that worked perfectly! It was difficult to type in the command while the screen was flashing, but it is possible after a few attempts. System has been perfect since. Here is a link to the solution.
 It seems to be an error with the operating systems error reporting actions.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/forum/windows-29/flashing-screen-after-windows-10-upgrade-4538547/#postToForum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/</a>&nbsp;Hope
 this works for you too.

            <p>I believe that God gave me the solution to my flashing, blank, black screen. I asked his help as I do for everything. I couldn't find his help through other people on the Internet, but it occurred to me as a result that I should write down the path to the
 folder that the blank screen says it's in. It took me several tries because the screen flashes so briefly. My path was
</p>
<p>"This PC&gt;OS&gt;Users&gt;BL [my initials}&gt;AppData&gt;Local&gt;Arcade______ [I can't remember the blank]." Anyway, I looked into the Arcade_______ folder, and one of the programs was "remove.exe". I felt that&nbsp;God wanted me to click on that program to remove the Arcade_______.&nbsp;The
 answer to my prayers was that Windows 10 has no more flashing&nbsp;screens and runs smoothly now. This solution may not be good for gamers, but I don't use my computer for playing games. Instead, I'm a writer and promoter of Christian books.&nbsp;I pray that my experience
 may help someone.&nbsp;Bruce Leiter the Writer (<a href="http://www.bruceleiterthewriter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">bruceleiterthewriter.com</a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Sporadic sound distortion on different sound cards. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thx-ioii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sporadic sound distortion on different sound cards.</h2>
                    
<p>I've just started experiencing a rather random problem that seems to be affecting audio only.</p>
<p>I have both an M-audio firewire 410 external audio interface and an Audigy 2 ZS PCI card which I use for separate applications.</p>
<p>Recently, I've noticed that I'll be watching a film or listening to music and the audio output suddenly becomes extremely distorted, if I switch to use the other sound card, the problem apparently goes away... until it hits again. Doesn't seem to matter
 which interface is in use (i've even tried disabling the PCI card using the device manager) the problem always comes back. Sometimes I have to reboot the machine in order to restore sound quality. Happens about once or twice a day.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of doing is reinstalling windows... which I really don't want to have to do...</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

<p><span>Hi Vors,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>First I would suggest you to run the Audio Troubleshooter built in Windows 7 and check if it is able to find any
 issues and fix it. Access the link below and follow the steps to run Audio troubleshooter.
</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Playing-Audio-troubleshooter</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also make sure that the default sound device is set correctly for the sound device that you are using. To set the default device, follow
 these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click and type Sound in the Start Search box.</span>
</li><li><span>Click Sound in the search results at the top of the Start menu.</span>
</li><li><span>Click the Playback tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is Speakers. Make sure
 that your audio settings are configured as expected. Follow these steps:</span> </li></ol>
<p><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Properties, click the Advanced tab, and make sure that the Default Format is set to the value that you expect. When you finish, close this window to return to the previous window.
</span></p>
<p><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Configure, and then make sure the configurations are set correctly.
</span></p>
<p><span>If the sound settings are set correctly, you are using speakers as the sound device, and your speakers are already set as the default
 device, go to method 5 now. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click Set Default.
</span></li><li><span>Click OK to save your settings and to close the Sound dialog box.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if you have any distorted sound again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may also occur if
</span><span>enhancements are enabled on your computer. You may try to disable all the enhancements and verify if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps below to disable enhancements:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Access Control Panel</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Sound</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Playback tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Speakers/Headphones entry</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Enhancements Tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Disable all enhancements</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Restart the computer and verify if it works fine.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below to know more about fixing some audio problems on your computer. Refer the section under
</span><span>“<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Tips-for-fixing-common-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Sound from my speakers

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may try to access device manager on your computer and try to update the drivers and check if it helps.
</span><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to update drivers.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the troubleshooting steps... Unfortunately, they didn't work.</p>
<p>There was no problem for months, on either of my sound cards, now both of the suddenly distort randomly, can work for days then suddenly distort whilst listening to music/movies etc. If i switch to the other sound card as default, then try again without
 rebooting the sound returns to normal, then later on it will screw up again, switching back to the other sound card sometimes works again, other times results in no sound at all.</p>
<p>Currently just using my M-Audio 410 then rebooting when there is a problem, also sometimes get clicks, and reboot helps... As I say this is a sporadic problem with both sound cards...</p>
<p>Hmm...</p>
<p>I've been using Windows for a *long* time, I know it (and linux) inside and out, this is a very strange problem... reinstall?</p>

            <p>The obvious problem you are having is that Computer 1 does not authenticate connections from your other computers.&nbsp; Important information missing from your post is 1) Whether Computer 1 is XP Home or XP Pro (you state the
<em>other</em> machines are XP Pro) and 2)&nbsp;Whether Simple file sharing is enabled (or not) on Computer 1.</p>
<p>"How to disable Simple File Sharing and how to set permissions on a Shared Folder in Windows XP"</p>
<p>&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307874/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307874/en-us</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Computer 1 is XP Pro and Simple File Sharing is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
disabled</span>, then IIRC,&nbsp;the authentication sequence is approximately as listed below:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the user name on the connecting machine matches an existing username on [Computer 1] and the passwords of this user on both machines match, then access is immediately granted.</li><li>If user names match but passwords don't, then access is immediately denied.</li><li>If user names don't match, then an attempt is made to authenticate as the "Guest" user with no password.&nbsp; If this succeeds, then you connect.</li><li>I believe that if the Guest user has a password, then access is denied</li><li>If Guest user is disabled [on Computer 1], then a logon screen pops up asking for your logon credentials.</li></ol>
<p>If Simple file sharing is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">enabled</span> (or XP Home) on Computer 1, then authentication is *forced* to be the Guest user (#3/#4 above).&nbsp; If that fails, so does the connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, the first thing that I would check (assuming Simple File Sharing is enabled)&nbsp;is that the "Guest" User is enabled on Computer 1 and that it does not have a password.&nbsp; The second thing I would check would be that the folder that is being shared
 has permissions that allow the Guest user to access it.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for the prompt reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the computers are XP Pro logged in as administrators, all are using simple file sharing, all have the guest account enabled without passwords, all show up on the LAN when viewing the workgroup computers in the Network Places.&nbsp; Two computers (#1 &amp; #2)
 hardwired to the wireless router.....laptop(s)(#3) access router wirelessly without problems.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem may be more complicated than first described.&nbsp; And I will say straight up that these are somewhat older systems and can be glitchy from time to time. Generally reliable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general it seems that only one computer is being able to be accessed by the others.&nbsp; For instance.....let's call the accessible computer #2...this can be viewed/shared by computers #1 and #3 .....but...#1 can't access #3(laptop), #3 can't access #1.&nbsp;
 I have tried the network set-up wizard several times....re-booted, checked file sharing, and in general pulled out my hair as well.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When authenticating is XP looking for the user account login name to be the same....or just the type of login, such as administrator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please chime in again with any other ideas or things to check out.</p>
<p>

            <p>First, try the following Knowledge-Base (KB)&nbsp;articles and see if they help at all for the machines that don't allow inbound connections.&nbsp; Keep in mind that since you have Simple File Sharing enabled, it doesn't matter what authentication you use as Simple
 File Sharing *always* forces authentication as the "Guest" user.</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for taking time to try to help me figure my issue out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read your detailed response.&nbsp; Despite the level of detail and complexity I think I have worked thru the MS Support links you provided.&nbsp; I intend to review them again....one at a time from the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point nothing I've tried in the links allows me to access the computers on my LAN.....I continue to only be able to access #2.&nbsp; I don't think ICS pertains to me as all the computers access each other thru the router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can successfully Ping all the computers from each other....so something is working OK...ie router is assigning IP's correctly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The command prompt to access by name...\\computer\sharename tells me&nbsp; "....can not find the path specified".&nbsp; Each computer can see their own shared files/folders but only computer#2 can be seen or accessed by the others thru the command prompt.&nbsp; So name
 resolution is messed up....</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't find any net log file errors on any of the computers.&nbsp; When I check the event log, some errors were found but none seem to be related to this issue.</p>
<p>
I am bit lost at this point.....</p>

            <p>Sorry for the delay...&nbsp; I think you are correct in that the name resolution is having a problem.&nbsp; One way to confirm this is to use the IP address of the machine instead of the machine's name.&nbsp; If this works to connect to the other machine, then it's likely
 address resolution. Assuming Computer 3 has IP addres of 192.168.0.3, try the following syntax:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net&nbsp; use&nbsp; \\192.168.0.3\sharename</p>
<p>
</p><p>One possible, but not common, cause of this is addressed in the following KB article:</p>
<p>&nbsp; "You cannot view other workgroup computers on the network on a Windows XP-Based computer"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903267/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/903267/en-us</a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>This conditions happens more often in laptops that move from one location to another and is caused by the DHCP Server which misconfigures the Node Type.&nbsp; When you type the following in at a command prompt window:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ipconfig&nbsp; /all</p>
<p>Look at the top of the printout for the "Node Type" line.&nbsp; It should be "Mixed", "Hybrid", or "Broadcast".</p>
<p>
</p><p>You say that the computers ping each other OK.&nbsp; Instead of "Ping", try the Microsoft Networking equivalent of a ping "nbtstat".&nbsp; Try&nbsp;this from Computer 2 to Computer 3&nbsp;with the&nbsp;computer name&nbsp;(-a) and again with the IP Address (-A) and see if the response
 is different:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat&nbsp; -a&nbsp; computer3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (no "\\" is necessary here)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat&nbsp; -A&nbsp; 192.168.0.3</p>
<p>If successful, it will print a few lines describing the Microsoft Networking parameters of the other machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH,</p>
<p>&nbsp; JW</p>

            <p>Wunders.....Thank you for your patience and durability while hanging with me on this frustrating problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to re-cap....as much for me as you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am working off of 4 computers....2 desktops and 2 laptops. Trouble accessing each other (file sharing) over the network....either hardwired to router or wirelessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #1...wired to router...XP Pro.....this computer can access #2 and #4....but not #3 by clicking the network/workgroup icons.&nbsp; Can ping both IP and name to all computers....1,2,3,4.&nbsp; nbtstat can access 1,2,3,4&nbsp; by name &amp; IP. with accurate machine
 name tables.&nbsp; Net Use command to 1,2,3,4&nbsp; \\IP\sharename yields "system error 67...network
<strong>name</strong> not found".&nbsp; Node type = hybrid</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #2....wired to router....XP Pro....this computer can access #4 only.&nbsp; Pings names and IPs OK to 1,2,3,4.&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat can access 1,2,3,4 by name and IP with accurate name table.&nbsp; Net use cmd to 1,2,3,4 by \\IP\sharename yields "system error 53...network
<strong>path</strong> not found".&nbsp; Node type = <strong>unknown</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #3.....wireless Laptop....XP Home....this one can access #2 and #4.&nbsp; Pings names and IPs OK to all.&nbsp;&nbsp; nbtstat can access 1,2,3,4 by name and IP with accurate name table via wireless connection.&nbsp; However, response also shows "LAN connection 2: Node
 IpAddress [0.0.0.0]&nbsp; Scope Id [ ]....<strong>Host not found</strong>"&nbsp;&nbsp; Net use cmd to 1,2,3,4, by \\IP\sharename yields "system error 67....network name not found".&nbsp; Node type = broadcast</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer #4....wireless Laptop...Vista Home.....this one can access #2 only.&nbsp; Pings names and IPs OK to all.&nbsp; nbtstat can access all by name and IP with accurate name tables.&nbsp; Net use to 1,2,3 by \\IP\sharename yields "system error 67....network name not
 found"&nbsp;&nbsp; Net use to #4 (itself) yields "system error 64...network name no longer available"&nbsp; Node type = hybrid</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reviewed your prior responses and have again tried what you suggested.&nbsp; Simple file sharing on all.&nbsp; Guest accounts on or off doesn't seem to change anything.&nbsp; I have re-read the kb#'s you sent again.&nbsp; BTW, your last kb link....903267 was no longer
 available.&nbsp; It seems like the un-accessible machines are the ones rejecting access.....as they can be pinged and nbtstat'ed OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as it stands.....I can see the files on #2 (wireless XP) and #4 (wireless Vista) with all machines but can't&nbsp; access #1 and #3 from anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can things be jiggered or changed by direct registry editing?&nbsp; Are there any other techniques or commercial software that can help me troubleshoot further?&nbsp; Seems like this should be easier.....I think at one point in the past I could access them all....could
 be wrong on this though.&nbsp;&nbsp; Funny thing is that when I added the Vista Laptop (fresh install on previously corrupt machine) to the mix it was seen and accessed by all the computers right away.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other tips, websites or commercial paid tech support places would be welcome.....your efforts are very much appreciated......this may be unsolvable short of new OS installs which is really not practical.</p>

            <p>You provided a very nice summary...</p>
<p>It seems that your Computer #2 and #4 are working just fine.&nbsp; It also appears that Computers #1 and #3 are not allowing incoming connections for some reason.&nbsp; This could be due to a configuration issue or a Firewall issue.&nbsp; Some things you may be able to
 verify on Computers #1 and #3:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bring up the "Services" window (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "services.msc").&nbsp; When the window appears, scroll down and make sure the line labeled "Server" shows that it is "Started" with Startup Type "Automatic".&nbsp; If not, double-click on it and make it that way.&nbsp; Do
 the same for the "Computer Browser" line, but I don't think that is your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming you are using Windows Firewall only on these machines, open up the Firewall settings</p>
<p>&nbsp; (Control Panel -&gt; Windows Firewall).&nbsp; Verify that the "Dont allow Exceptions" box under the General tab is
 command uses UDP 137 only and it appears at least that port is open.&nbsp; If you are using another firewall, try to temporarily disable it and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go to Settings -&gt; Network Connections (or Control Panel -&gt; Network).&nbsp; Right-click on your active network connection and select "Properties".&nbsp; In the window verify that "File &amp; Printer Sharing" and "Client for Microsoft Networks" is present and checked.&nbsp;
 Click on "TCP/IP" to select it&nbsp;and Click "Properties" -&gt; Advanced -&gt;WINS (tab) -&gt; and make sure "Enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP is checked.&nbsp; Move to "Options" tab -&gt; TCP/IP filtering -&gt; Properties and verify no check beside "enable TCP/IP filtering".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure that you have a folder that a Guest user has permissions to that is shared.&nbsp; If there are no folders or printers shared, then connections won't work.&nbsp; Just to make sure, create a new folder in your "My Documents" folder, right-click on it, select
 "Sharing", give it a share name,&nbsp;and share the folder with all permissions and see if you can now connect to that machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope something up there helps.</p>
<p>I don't know why the "net use" does not work for you.&nbsp; There must be a syntax error because you should have no trouble with "net use" to computer 2 or 4 -- being that you can connect normally anyway.&nbsp; I don't believe you can "net use" to the same computer.&nbsp;
 Try just "net use" all by itself.&nbsp; It should give you a list of current connections.&nbsp; Maybe it will fail if there is already a connection.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your "node types" all look good.&nbsp; Even "unknown" is usually acceptable.&nbsp; I can get to KB903267 with no difficulty but
 this is not your problem because you have good node types.&nbsp; Computer #3's "HOST NOT FOUND" looks like it is because you have a 2nd network connection on that machine that is not currently used.&nbsp; There should be no difference between wired and wireless connections.</p>

            <p>Any solution to this yet?&nbsp; I have same problem immediately upon bootup. It happens whether I use the computer or leave it idle. It happens when I use 3 or 4 different applications, which includes MS Office 2010 (Word).&nbsp; My concern is why it happens immediately
 upon bootup.&nbsp; The only thing&nbsp; I see&nbsp;after restored to factory image (and&nbsp;removed Widows Features for Fax-Scan and Games) is both&nbsp;C++ 2005 Distribution AND C++ 2008 Distribution in Control Panel/Programs&amp;Features. Unsure if that is a conflict or acceptable
 to work together.&nbsp; Unsure what in Win7 Pro installed it (was nothing in Control Panel/Programs after installed Win7 Home Premium, before the upgrade to Pro).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using 2yr old (1yr 11mo) Dell laptop with Win7Pro (upgraded from Win7 Home Premium when purchased), default IE8. Tried IE8 and IE9., CPU 2.2M, RAM 4Gig (all I need for this computer's usage).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Used&nbsp;all defaults for&nbsp;both IE versions, restored to factory
 image twice, and just re-installed OS anew from CD.&nbsp; Same errors.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;NOTE:&nbsp; I am a "heavy" computer user. 6-10 hrs a day. Use laptop almost exclusively for text and internet access.&nbsp;Sometimes to&nbsp;extract data from one program to another, sometimes to calculate complex Excel spreadsheets. Often computer is left on&nbsp;overnight
 to complet tasks or to perform long-term maintenance and virus scans. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details below.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; About Jun 7, 2912, after seeing&nbsp;problem&nbsp;in my Win7 Pro for few months, Errors still there.&nbsp; No&nbsp;solution that I could find.&nbsp; Unsure, but suspected it might have caused the increasingly&nbsp;frequent IE adn other program lockups/freezes.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Also Event Log showed&nbsp;several hard faults, fault bucket errors and&nbsp;'leakage' errors. Unsure of causes for those.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restored Dell laptop to&nbsp;factory image.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Dec 23, 2012, same errors. Lockups started increasing again.</p>
<p><u>Restored Dell laptop to factory image again</u>, then redid Win7 Pro upgrade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Same
<u>errors immediately after 1st 'normal' bootup to use</u>.&nbsp; Then Windows Updates,&nbsp;accepted
<u>all Win7 updates</u> except Silverlight and Bing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Same errors</u>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Jan 3-4 many updates, accepted them.&nbsp; Next morning both (2) laptops had extremely slow shutdown (over 2min).&nbsp; I see several
<u>many users</u> and <u>many threads</u> recently with same problem (in MS forums, self-help support). After detailed troubleshooting with via forum thread like this,&nbsp;I am now contacting&nbsp;MS support for updates for this issue, as i have pinpointed specific
 date of updates causing the errors.&nbsp; However, even with all those updates, the same side-by-side errors are in the Event Log. No Change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 1 laptops&nbsp;are different. The:</p>
<p>--Dell (1yr 11mo old) is identified above.</p>
<p>--HP (4mo old), Win7 Home Premium, 8Gig RAM, CPU 3M.&nbsp; Worked well, no lockups/freezes,&nbsp;until Jan 3-4 updates.&nbsp; Got extremely slow shutdown, and handful of lockups (Mostly IE, but 1 was Windows Explorer itself).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Dec 31, 2012, HP restored to&nbsp;factory image.&nbsp; Same side-by-side errors as soon as I used computer the first time.&nbsp; Did all&nbsp;Win7 updates again. Same errors. Also, extremely slow shutdown problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Jan 4, sent back to HP&nbsp;Tech Support under warranty to test; no&nbsp;hardware&nbsp;problems.&nbsp;Indicates trouble stems from&nbsp;OS, not their installation or other software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Jan 20, 2013, Dell, re-installed OS anew from CD (not restored to factory image; installed home premium 1st, then upgrade to Win7Pro).&nbsp;&nbsp; Same errors.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Without <u>any </u>Win7 and MS updates, I have no slow shutdown and good, fast bootups.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this time, I have&nbsp;NOT accepted any Win7 or other MS updates,&nbsp;because I do not want to get the Shutdown problem again (still trying to identify the update(s) causing that problem).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 questions:</p>
<p>a) What&nbsp;further troubleshooting can I do for&nbsp;this 'side-by-side' problem? </p>
<p>B) Would UAC changes cause or influence either side by side errors OR long shutdown time?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have one analysis software (complex calculations) that&nbsp;changes UAC.&nbsp; I uninstalled it, but&nbsp;no change in errors or slow shutdown.&nbsp; On factory image, I had already went to User Accounts&nbsp;UAC to be sure to "turn off" any constraints.&nbsp; No change on side by
 side errors.</p>
<p>--Since Jan 20&nbsp;complete OS re-install on Dell, I did <u>not</u> install that software or any other personal software except System Mechanic Professional, version 11.5 (recommended earlier in 2012 by Dell Tech Support and by Iyogi Tech Support).&nbsp; It removed
 'clutter', temp, and junk files, did virus scan. Using this as only virus &amp; adware/spyware scan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>c) Since I reinstalled the OS, do I need to do anything to verify UAC settings?
</p>
<p>d)&nbsp;Could an OS&nbsp;default in there be causing a problem?&nbsp; I previously found a CAPI2 fault in Event Log caused by the OS. Fortunately&nbsp;there is a fix on the MS support website that works.&nbsp; [[I do not know how to check UACs anyway.]]</p>

<h2>            Windows10 Calendar shows wrong day error</h2>
                    <p>My PC is set to </p>
<p>Set time Auto = ON</p>
<p>Set Timezone Auto = On (or OFF makes no diff)</p>
<p>Set Timezone SAMOA UTC+13.</p>
<p>My region is set to SAMOA</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the settings screens and text field show THURSDAY 9TH JUNE 2016. &nbsp; This is correct.</p>
<p>When you click on the lower right time/date field it brings up a graphic showing the current full Calendar month.</p>
<p>This graphic is out by one day and shows FRIDAY 9TH JUNE 2016. &nbsp; &nbsp;WRONG !! &nbsp;This Is IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If change to any other country, problem goes away and Calendar graphic correctly shows 9th is Thursday. &nbsp;It dont matter about zones or times or daylight saving... A Thursday is a Thursday and the 9th of June 2016 is a Thursday EVERYwhere not a FRIDAY . &nbsp;As
 per below..spot the difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Samoa and Kiritimati seems the only 2 countries in the list that are faulty.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Peggle 2 Multiplayer-Problem</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Ich spiele nun schon eine Ganze weile das Spiel Peggle 2 für XBox 360</p>
<p>Auch der Multiplayer Funktioniert soweit ganz gut, nur habe ich zwischendrin immer wieder (für längere Zeit &gt; 30 Minuten) das Problem,</p>
<p>das wenn er ein Spiel Gefunden hat, und die Meldung "Zur Lobby" erscheint das Spiel Irgendwie in einer Endlos schleife Hängt.</p>

<p>Dann kann ich nur mittels der Guide Taste das Spiel Beenden und Neu Starten.</p>
<p>Wenn ich Glück habe geht es dann mal.</p>
<p>Ich habe jetzt ~ 3 Stunden Ohne Probleme Spielen Können doch nun Hängt es bei jedem Versuch.</p>

<p>Im XBox One forum habe ich Gelesen, das es Leute mit Ähnlichem Problem gibt, welches wohl von der Fritzbox kommt.</p>
<p>Allerdings habe ich weder die dort Erwähnte Fritzbox, noch Tritt das Problem immer auf.</p>
<p>Auch habe ich an der Netzwerk Konfiguration Nichts Verändert.</p>

<p>Hat jemand Ähnliche Probleme und kennt vielleicht eine Lösung, oder liegt das am Spiel Selber ?</p>

<p>Danke.</p>

<h2>            HP Deskjet printer will not connect to Windows 10 Outlook Mail after 1703 version Creators update</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Two days ago my computer with Win 10 went through the Creators update to version 1703. Since that time my HP Deskjet</p>
<p>1510 will not print anything in my Outlook email.&nbsp; It works great with Win 10 everywhere else. I have reinstalled it but it still wont work in the email program.&nbsp; When trying to print&nbsp; a message says that it Is either not on or connected to the printer network.
 It worked three days ago before the update just fine. The printer drivers are up to date. The printer is listed as the default printer under network devices. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Any help would be appreciated as this problem has me stumped&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;Thanks, Doomster</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your issue is quite interesting and we want to know more:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you confirm that your are trying to print emails from Outlook.com?</li><li>What browser are you using when accessing Outlook.com? </li><li>Can you confirm that you can print using other application except for Outlook?</li></ul>
<p>For the meantime, we can select Print from the Mail menu, then instead of selecting my printer select "<strong>Microsoft Print to PDF</strong>". Save the resulting document and open with a PDF reader from where you can print the email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need anything else. </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you for trying to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The app that I'm using is called Outlook-Mail.&nbsp; There is no web address shown but I can access the account through IE 11 and the web address&nbsp; is outlook.com. The mail is the same and I can print from that</p>
<p>location. Note that the two websites? are totally different in how they look.&nbsp; The mail app was on the computer when I bought it almost a year ago and has Windows 10 pro updated to 1703&nbsp; version 15063.483</p>
<p>currently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have found that I cannot print anything from the Edge browser while there is no problem at all with IE 11.</p>
<p>I have also noticed a few websites have grey areas where photos should be on both Edge and IE 11.&nbsp; Once you click on the link to get to the story, the photos show up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The mail program that wont print is the one that's on the start menu with the envelope. I thought it was the same as the one in the app store? The outlook.com mail looks like it does on a windows 7 laptop I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I've noticed a few other things that are changed too, a game I have wont start up and the three system</p>
<p>restore points I had from the last year are gone with only one from before the&nbsp; install of the Creators update</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I'm thinking of rolling back to the previous one in recovery which I believe would be the Anniversary update but wont this new update just rear it's ugly head again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Thanks again for your efforts, Doomster</p>

<p>I get an error Message when attempting send emails. "some errors occurred while processing the requested tasks. Please review the list of errors below for more details".</p>
<p>But it sends the message anyway...multiple copies and it also gets put in the "outbox" in Outlook Express as if it's not sent.</p>
<p>To stop the email from being repeatedly sent to the recipient, I delete it from the "outbox" but a) you never know if they really got it&nbsp; b) it's annoying to the receiver c) is this a bug I can fix?</p>
<p>thanks for any help.</p>

<p>You have some dbx file corruption easily fixed.</p>
<p>Move most of your messages out of the Inbox and then create new Outbox and Sent Items folders after you move any messages you wish to save to a local folder you create.</p>
<p>Tools | Options | Maintenance | Store Folder will reveal the location of your Outlook Express files. Write the location down and navigate to it in Windows Explorer or, copy and paste it into Start | Run.</p>
<p>In WinXP, Win2K &amp; Win2K3, the OE user files (DBX and WAB) are by default marked as hidden. To view these files in Windows Explorer, you must enable Show Hidden Files and Folders under Start | Control Panel | Folder Options Icon | View, or in Windows Explorer
 | Tools | Folder Options | View.</p>
<p>With OE closed, find the DBX files for the Outbox &amp; Sent Items and delete them.&nbsp; New ones will be created automatically when you open OE.</p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>General precautions for Outlook Express:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />

<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs, slows down sending and receiving, and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs, account setting changes and has even been responsible for
 loss of messages. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently. For more, see:<br />

<p>Note that for some AV programs, it may be necessary to uninstall the program and reinstall in Custom Mode and uncheck e-mail scanning when the option arises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Compact often as specified above.</p>
<p>And backup often.</p>

    <title>BlackBerry 10&#47;Windows 10 problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bill pierce  say:</h3>
<h2>            BlackBerry 10&#47;Windows 10 problems</h2>
                    <p>For the past year there has been an undercurrent in the BlackBerry user community regarding problems with Windows 10 and the BlackBerry Link application intended to allow connections, sync, backup, restore, etc. between BlackBerry 10 smartphones and Windows
 PCs.&nbsp; In the past month or so, the number of such problems reported has increased greatly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For three years I have been using BlackBerry Link successfully with my BlackBerry Q10 phone and various&nbsp;versions of Windows ranging from Windows 8 to Windows 10 (currently running 64-bit Professional Anniversary Edition).&nbsp; Now suddenly (approximately two
 weeks ago) BlackBerry Link will not load, saying it has encountered an error and stopped working.&nbsp; It worked fine for a little more than a month after I upgraded to the Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first searched the BlackBerry support forums and found that the generic solution for these types of errors is to completely uninstall all BlackBerry software (apps, utilities, drivers, etc.), followed by a manual pruning of all BlackBerry references in
 folders/files and&nbsp;the Registry.&nbsp; Then reinstall the latest versions of the BlackBerry 10 drivers and the BlackBerry Link app.&nbsp; At least some users reported success with this method.&nbsp; However, since the release of the Windows 10 Anniversary Edition this is
 no longer solving the problem for anyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Particularly&nbsp;frustrating is that BlackBerry is ignoring all requests for support regarding&nbsp;this problem.&nbsp; It's pointless to speculate what the reason might be because BlackBerry's response is complete silence.&nbsp; As might be expected, there is a rising wave
 of user distress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, Microsoft, don't respond by referring users to BlackBerry for support.&nbsp; There is none on their part.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's clear that nothing has changed in terms of the BlackBerry software, but something has changed with Windows.&nbsp; So surely Microsoft bears some responsibility for a solution by identifying what has changed and what the resolution might be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm more than happy to supply the relevant entries from the Windows Application Event Log.&nbsp; I'm not an expert in these matters, but it would seem the error is occurring due to a fault&nbsp;in KERNELBASE.dll with
</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>Exception code: 0xe0434352.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be glad&nbsp;to work with Microsoft on this.&nbsp; I just don't want to be passed off to BlackBerry because at this point that road is an absolute dead end.</p>
