            <p><span>Hi BarbaraMortson, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This error occurs due to Improper registration of a WMI dll (wmiutils.dll). This dll might have been unregistered manually or by a third party program such as a registry cleaner tool.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would first suggest you to run the following commands and check whether you can resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button</span></p>
<p><span>b. From the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> Menu, type <strong><span>Run</span></strong> in start search and press enter</span></p>
<p><span>c. Type: <strong><span>regsvr32 wmiutils.dll</span></strong> (You should get a prompt that the file was registered successfully)</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type: <strong><span>net stop winmgmt</span></strong> (press y to stop the service)<br />
e. Type: <strong><span>net start winmgmt</span></strong> (automatically starts the service)</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If the above steps don’t work, then check if the Volume Shadow Copy service is running.</span></p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was attempting to start a program called TeamViewer but it wouldn't startup. After running the program as admin, it gave me the following error:<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ebec619f-c589-4a0b-a94a-e079cab059a6" /></p>
<p>As you can see the application is clearly there even tough Windows cannot find the program/directory. I tried re-installing/moving the folder but this didn't help.</p>

<h3> jakkej14  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I keep my display on 24&#47;7</h2>
                    I have a computer that people at work need to be able to look at anytime of the day without having to log in. This means I need keep my display on 100% of the time. I have messed with every option I can think of but it still ends up at the lock screen
 requiring my password. I have screen savers turned off, my "power and sleep" settings are set to "never" for turn off and go to sleep, in the "advanced settings" I have every setting set to "never" fall asleep, and never turn off. Still I am being forced out
 and required to log in for some reason. What am I missing?

            Hi Jakkej.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />In addition to Display and Sleep needing to be set to Never in Power Options, Hibernate needs to be set to Never as well.  See here for how to adjust these:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change-power-plan-settings-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2843-change...</a>
<br />
<br />Let's take a look at all other places where Windows can suspend to find the culprit:
<br /> 
<br />If your Power Options settings are set correctly then the next suspect is the screensaver which is mysteriously setting a 1 minute timeout to blank Screensaver when some Themes are chosen. Check that now at Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Lock Screen &gt; Screen Saver Settings.
<br />
<br />This could also pertain to an issue of Unattended Sleep Timeout setting in Registry.  See the Marked Answer here for what has worked for others:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-keeps-going-into-sleep-after-1-minute/787e8cea-32ce-4ea0-a281-13c32a75352d?auth=1">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Whenever modifying the registry, first set a System Restore point:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If System Unattended Sleep timeout is not present here's now to access it:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/72133-add-system-unattended-sleep-timeout-power-options-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/72133-add-s...</a>
<br />
<br />More troubleshooting when PC keeps shutting down:

<br /><a href="https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000689.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000689.htm</a>
<br />
<br />If you suspect overheating which can shut down the PC, then install CoreTemp to monitor temps from System Tray:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi jakkej14,
<br />
<br />You mention its a work computer. Your IT department may have forced a password on wake-up in the Group Policy. Depending on your company it may not be an option. Best bet is to contact the IT department. I know at the company I do IT support, it is forced to enter a password after 20 mins of inactivity. This has been the way as well at the other companies I have worked at. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.
<br />
<br />-Tamara

<p>Hi Greg, thanks for your response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hibernate, sleep and turn off setting are all set to 'never'. I've even gone into advanced setting and turned anything relevant to 'never' as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen saver is turned off for this computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked into the registry, but when I got to step 5 in the link you provided, there is no 'Attributes' tag to click on. Is there another spot I can look for it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is not shutting down while I'm working on it and it is not overheating. I'm sure there is a setting that is I am overlooking that is forcing it to the lock screen, I just don't know what it could be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help</p>

<p>This is easy-peezy. You can have the best of both worlds - power savings and easy access:</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Control Panel &gt; Power Options, set 'Turn off the display' to 20 minutes or whatever is more suitable; and set 'Put the computer to sleep' to Never.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the next step, you'll need to sign in to a user account with Administrators permissions. Now go to Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign-in options &gt; Require sign-in &gt; Never</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, if the monitor is sleeping, any time someone wants to look at what's on the monitor, all they have to do is wiggle the mouse or press a key on the keyboard. (Spacebar is probably best.)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reinstall it will pick up the Product Key and activate the system&nbsp;automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not, follow these steps:</p>

<h3> simonearr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard and mouse unresponsive</h2>
                    <p>My problems started last week after a Windows critical update. First it got stuck working on the updates so eventually had to restore the system. Now it boots fine, takes a while to log in (it was never slow previously, only had it a year or two) then the
 keyboard and mouse become unresponsive. Something is obviously going wrong at that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now on the last attempt to try different ports for the mouse and keyboard on start up, I logged in and the screen is now black. I can just see the mouse cursor, still mobile at the moment.</p>
<p>What's happening???</p>
<p>N.b. I can't get to device manager...ctrl alt del does nothing, escape doesn't work....</p>

    <title>I can not open Attachments from Windows Live Mail 2012 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leonard hrabar  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can not open Attachments from Windows Live Mail 2012</h2>
                    I can see the attachments, and they have the correct file associations. .xls will show Excel, .doc will show Word.<br />
When I double click on them, nothing happens. If I right click on them, I get the sub menu with options. If I click on open, again, nothing happens.<br />
I can click Save As, and the attachment will be saved to my PC. I can them open the folder, double click on the file, and it will open using the default program.&nbsp; I should be able to open the attachment directly from Windows Live Mail.
<br />
<br />
This seems to have just started. I have searched the web, but none of the "solutions" seems to work for me.<br />
I already tried the "uncheck the Do not allow attachments to be saved or opened that could potentially be a virus."
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am running Windows 7 32 bit. Home Premium.<br />
I have all of the latest Windows Updates.<br />

            <p>Hi Leonard Hrabar,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Let me assist you with using your accounts on Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible that there are corrupted files on your Windows Live Mail that could be causing the issue. We recommend that you try repairing Windows Live Mail to check if it fixes the issue. Before you repair Windows Live Mail, you can backup your files
 to make sure that you do not lose any of them. You can click on this <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/mail-import-backup-restore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> for steps on how to backup your files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once your files have been backed up, you can then follow the steps below to repair Windows Live Mail.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>On your computer, go to <font><b>Control Panel</b>.</font></span></li><li><span>Click on <font><b>Programs</b>, then <b>Uninstall a program</b>.</font></span></li><li><span>Look for <font><b>Windows Essentials</b>.</font></span></li><li><span>Right click on <font><i>Windows Essentials</i> and click on <b>Uninstall/Change</b>.<br />
A window will pop up asking to either remove or repair Windows Essentials.</font></span></li><li><span>Choose <font><b>Repair all Windows Essentials program</b>.</font></span></li></ol>
<p><span><font>If repairing does not work, then we advise that you uninstall and reinstall Windows Live Mail. You can follow the same steps above but choose Remove instead of repair. You can then visit this
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-live/essentials-other#essentials=overviewother" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> where you can download a fresh copy of Windows Live Mail.<br />
<br />
Let us know if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</font></span></p>
<p><span>Johan</span></p>

            Thanks Johan,<br />
<br />
I tried the repair, and still had the issue. So I did the uninstall/reinstall.<br />
I still have the issue. <br />
<br />
I also had a new error, WLDCore.dll and WLDLog.dll were not being found.<br />
I researched this online and found that the install for Windows Essentials puts them in this folder:<br />
C:/Program Files/Windows Live/Shared.<br />
<br />
The programs look for them is their on folders. For Example Mail looks for them in:<br />
C:/Program Files/Windows Live/Mail.<br />
<br />
I wonder if the problem I am having is because some dlls are in the wrong folder?<br />
<br />
If you have any other ideas, just post them. I can work around the problem by saving the attachment to my HDD and them opening it from there. It's just that I should be able to open it in mail.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Len<br />

The safe mode reboot did not fix the issue.<br />
It actually told me that Live Mail could not be started because it was not installed correctly, or that I did not have enough free space on my hard drive.<br />
<br />
I will try the clean boot tomorrow.<br />

            <p>Len,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having this same issue as of a few days ago.&nbsp; It is not happening on all of the machines that we have in the business, just a couple.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if you ever found a fix for this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Was the location of the dll's the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss, I've tried repairing, reinstalling, changing user rights, just about everything i can think of and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that I have noticed is the common factor on the pc's that do not work, they are all 32-bit.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My 64-bit machine has no issues what so ever and we are all running the exact same versions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you ever found a fix please, I'm desperate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Courtney</p>

            The only solution I have found for this is a temporary one at best - the problem does come back at random intervals, and I have a 64 bit Win 7 Home Premium system. Basically the fix&nbsp;seems to be to go to "Default Programs", then "Set program Access and
 Computer Defaults", then "Custom" and then click on Windows Live Mail as the email default program. Then restart Windows Live Mail and it should work. This is what I do and it works every time, but as I say I have not found the underlying cause of the problem
 unfortunately and it comes back after an indeterminate time - sometimes a few days, sometimes several weeks.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Courtney</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I'm sorry I don't know how to do this as a standard user - I login as an administrator so don't have any issue - I would have thought it would have asked you for permission and the admin user's password but obviously not. The whole thing is a pain - its
 unfortunate no one seems to have been able to work out the root cause of the problem, then we might be able to come to a permanent solution.</p>

            It's very odd that it does not prompt for admin credentials to change these settings.&nbsp; Almost everywhere else in Windows it asks for admin rights and you can change settings without logging off and back on as an admin user.&nbsp; This setting does not give
 the option and it's extremely frustrating because I have about 5 pc's that have decided to not open attachments anymore.&nbsp; They are all standard users so changing these defaults is not as easy as it could be that's for sure.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.

<h2>            Display Corruption Using VGA Adapater</h2>
                    <p>Only just started having problems with a attached monitor using the VGA adapter.&nbsp;Also using&nbsp;an attached USB mouse and keyboard to giving me access to a full screen PC setup.&nbsp;&nbsp;Display picture&nbsp;on the monitor contains corrupt pixels of either blue or green
 dots. I have been unable to identify any other corruption so far.&nbsp;If you unplug&nbsp;from the VGA adapter&nbsp;then the screen is fine using the&nbsp;Surface display. Think this is a&nbsp;corrupted driver update problem and nothing physically wrong with the Surface or the attached
 monitor. Any help would be welcomed. </p>

            By the way, do not assume I am a newbie to Microsoft operating systems. &nbsp;I've worked with Windows versions and setups for over 20 years. &nbsp;In this case the OS behavior is in some cases refusing to save and in others just not &nbsp;by settings having to do with
 screen lock and screen saver options. &nbsp;You would need to come up with a pretty obscure setting for me to be unfamiliar with it. &nbsp;

<h3> oto_  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows boot manager doesn&#39;t recognize AHCI&#47;SATA SSD</h2>
                    <p>I have an older HP laptop with Windows 10 and SSD disk. It boots in IDE mode but not when AHCI. There is issue in BIOS that I am able to set disk controller to AHCI mode but then drive is not recognized in BIOS. As the drive is not recognized I get error
 that "operational system is not found". If booted from Windows USB/CD repair or recovery disk then I see that disk is present so it is only BIOS problem that it doesn't recognize the disk. I had an idea that I could create a USB stick with Windows Boot Manager
 which would boot Windows installation from SATA. Created a bootable USB stick using bcdboot and bcdedit tools but it doesn't boot from AHCI and shows error that "boot device is not present" but the same stick works for legacy IDE booting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a AHCI driver for Windows boot manager? If not maybe some 3rd party boot managers/loaders support AHCI boot like GRUB2,GRUB4DOS, PLOP,SARDU?</p>

<p>Hi Oto_,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that your concern is related to changing the system's boot sequence. For your reference, here is an
<a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c00364979" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>article</strong></a> from HP's support website on configuring the boot order in the system BIOS. Otherwise, I think it would be best to get in touch with HP's support for more options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further concerns, let me know.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen multiple instructions to do this, but can't find the ones I saved, but I did find this...
<a href="https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-switch-from-ide-to-ahci-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://winaero.com/blog/how-to-switch-from-ide-to-ahci-in-windows-10/</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a registry setting that needs to be switched to ACHI while booted in IDE... Then restart... enter Bios, and switch to AHCI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The article in the link describes a different method involving Safe Mode that bypasses the registry tweak... Supposedly after booting to Safe Mode and restarting the machine... entering Bios... switching to AHCI... and then restarting... The switch should
 be made to ACHI automatically...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go by the article though... I have personally never had to try this..</p>

<p>This is not the case as the BIOS doesn't recognize disk in AHCI but Windows is already configured with msahci driver.</p>
<p>As BIOS can't boot it directly because it doesn't see SATA disk so I would like to have a helper bootloader which boots from USB and then chain loads windows from SATA drive. HP will not help as the PC is out of warranty and the bug in BIOS won't be fixed.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess that I misunderstood your issue...</p>
<p>I don't know that Windows Boot Manager works with Legacy Bios... maybe if dual booting two Windows OSs...</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is primarily used with UEFI Bios, at least to the extent of my knowledge...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem could actually be the SSD... A lot of SSDs will not even boot\function in IDE Mode... One or two of my 8-10 SSDs will function\boot in IDE Mode. All the rest require AHCI...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be that windows&nbsp;needs to be installed on the SSD while it is set for AHCI for that to work...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should mention that if the machine is set to UEFI Bios the Boot Drive will not be recognized as a "Boot Device" in the boot order... The Boot Device will be Windows Boot Manager...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another suggestion if you are interested... You mention that this may be a inherent problem with the Bios... You might do some searching concerning your problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that some 3rd party has tips\instructions as how to modify your actual Bios... Adding info that would overcome your problem that is\was extracted from the Bios of a machine that has what you need...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A example I encountered...&nbsp; I also have a older machine in which I wanted to try a NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD... The drive was recognized after installing drivers from the device's manufacturer, but was not recognized by the Bios as a Boot Drive, whether legacy or
 UEFI Bios...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I happened across a forum that focuses on Bios type stuff and found instructions on how to edit my Bios file, where to find the stuff that needed added, and how\where to enter the line in the actual Bios file so that the motherboard would recognize it..</p>

<p>Thanks this could be interesting. I think DUET uefi boot could do the trick will check if it will see AHCI drive not relying on BIOS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I read that <span>older WinNT/2K/XP bootloader included option to sideload SCSI (<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/305595/how-to-create-a-bootable-floppy-disk-for-an-ntfs-or-fat-partition-in-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NTBOOTDD.SYS</a></em>/</span><span><em>Ntstartupdd</em></span><span>)
 drivers(to find non-BIOS int-13 SCSI drives) which maybe could be used to load some AHCI driver(maybe F6 driver will fit) so could boot newer windows. Seems that new BOOTMGR doesn't have such option anymore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>In NT4 ATAPI was a SCSI miniport. In this OS, you can copy ATAPI.SYS to NTBOOTDD.SYS and use scsi() syntax for usual IDE drive.
</span></p>
<p><strong>Seems this could work:</strong></p>
<p>The Signature(<em>diskpart&nbsp;uniqueid disk command</em>) syntax instructs Ntldr to locate the drive with a disk signature that matches the value in the parentheses, regardless of which SCSI controller number that the drive is connected to.</p>
<p>The naming format in Boot.ini starts with Signature syntax. For example:</p>
<p><code>signature(8b467c12)disk(1)rdisk(0)partition(2)\winnt=description</code> </p>
<p>The Signature syntax is used only if one of the following conditions exists:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The partition on which you installed Windows&nbsp;2000 is larger than 7.8&nbsp;gigabytes (GB) in size, or the ending cylinder number is higher than 1024 for that partition, and the system BIOS or boot controller BIOS does not support Extended INT13.</p>
</li><li>
<p>The drive on which you installed Windows&nbsp;2000 is connected to a SCSI controller

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be a problem with that in that the Boot.ini is no longer used...</p>
<p>There may some type of editing tweak that may be able to incorporate it though...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to edit Boot.ini files all the time with XP to manage multiple OS's on different partitions, but is no longer the boot file that is used... I don't remember if that started with Vista or Win 7...</p>

            I will test this concept in XP and then let's see. But yes seems it will look for NTLDR on target drive in case if it will find the drive at all.<br />

<h2>            Windows search indexer has stopped working and was closed</h2>
                    
<p>Original Title: <span>Windows search indexer issues</span></p>
<p>For the past few weeks I have been getting "Windows search indexer has stopped working and was closed" errors on my laptop. I am using Vista with service package 2. I have tried following all the available instructions online regarding this issue, however
 nothing has helped so far. When I go into Indexing Options, it says that the Indexer is not running. There are no index details at all and when you go into advanced, there is no rebuild option only the restore one, which does not seem to work. Clicking on
 the properties of the C:\ it says that I am allowing the drive to be indexed, but this is not happening. I have not made any new changes to my computer at all, only the windows updates have been installed. Any ideas on how to fix this issue?</p>

<p>Here's one possible solution to the problem: <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/26/fix-windows-vista-search-indexer-has-stopped-working-with-kb952093/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/26/fix-windows-vista-search-indexer-has-stopped-working-with-kb952093/</a>.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, go to Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Services / scroll to Windows Search and make sure it is set on Automatic and started.&nbsp; If not, do so.&nbsp; Since this service depends on Remote Procedure Call (RPC), go there as well
 and do the same thing.&nbsp; Then reboot and see if&nbsp; that resolves the problem.&nbsp; Try going into Indexing Options and see if the functions are restored and working.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rebuild the search index just to be sure and to catch up after being down so long.&nbsp; Hopefully,
 you will be all set now.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, we'll need to try some general troubleshooting to try to find the problem since it is obviously something else:</p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.&nbsp; If it's been a few weeks, that's a long time and you may want to consider this option depending on how many changes you've made in that time (installations, updates, uninstalllations, configurations
 and such - your data is fine and will not be affected by this process) and if you even have a restore point going back far enough.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is often an excellent solution to such problems which is why I generally suggest it first, but it doesn't
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please<strong>post</strong> any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;search indexer (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:</span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System and the Application sections.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp;</span><span>Use removal
 tools when appropriate</span></span><a href="http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.raymond.cc/blog/archives/2009/05/05/comprehensive-list-of-uninstallers-or-removal-tools-for-antivirus-software/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Once
 you've uninstalled your current AV program, download, install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless
 you decide to switch which I did when I first tried it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work,</span><span><span>try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this
 you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I am unable to recall when this first started as I have been ill for a number of weeks and it is only now that I am starting to become better that I have really noticed it. System restores in the past have been known not to work either on

<p>I tried this as well today, yes the files deleted in safe mode, however the index did not rebuild. The error is still occuring and I am now at a total loss as to what to do now, short of throwing the computer out and starting again.</p>
<p>Thank you for your help, but unless you have any other ideas, I guess I will just have to start again with a new computer as it is clear that this problem is not going to fix itself no matter what I try.</p>

<p>I have just gone into the c:\ properties and have made sure that the Index this drive for faster searching was clicked. It wasnt for some reason, so I clicked it and pressed apply, It started to apply, but then came up with an error message</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>An error occured applying attributes to the file:</em></p>
<p><em>c:\boot\memtest.exe</em></p>
<p><em>Access denied</em></p>
<p>What does this mean, and could it have something to do with my indexing issue?</p>

<p>I suspect you can't index the root drive of C:\ without some serious changes in permissions (and you don't really need to index that location because pretty much nothing you'll ever be searching for will be located there anyway).&nbsp; I do not believe this has
 anything to do with your problem (as I don't think this was a problem as much as a programmed restriction governed by permissions and ownership in the root drive folder).</p>
<p>You noted that my first option in my initial post had aleady been tried and didn't work.&nbsp; I'm with you. Did you pursue the remaining suggestions which may help determine if there is a problem with the search indexer and may resolve it - even if you need
 to go all the way to the end and do a system repair/upgrade to accomplish it?&nbsp; If not, give those options a try before you decide the computer cannot be saved and buy a new one.&nbsp; There's even one more option I didn't mention (a clean install) that is possible
 and should at least be tried before tossing out the computer (I'll provide those instructions if none of the previously provided options work or are possible).</p>
<p>Don't give up.&nbsp; I believe the problem can be fixed (even if it takes a radical procedure) and that you do not need to buy a new computer.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Thank you for your help and belief that it can be fixed. I will admit that this laptop has been a great education for me as I have had nothing but issues and problems with it since I brought it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to your question, I did a disk check and it turned up no errors or bad sectors, I checked for malware and there was nothing there either. As I explained earlier, Restoring the system is an issue as I dont know when exactly the error first started
 and am thinking that I am likely going to need to go back 6-8wks or more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am struggling with the other options as I still only have basic knowledge on computers and to be honest, they scare me just a little. What is the next easiest thing that you can suggest?</p>

<p>Try the SFC scan and then try the clean boot.&nbsp; Don't be worried.&nbsp; The procedures are explained in detail (by me or by links or both) and you'll be fine if you just take your time and follow the directions one step at a time.&nbsp; The only scary ones are the
 last couple, and we're going to skip those for the time being.</p>

    <title>Gamerpic selfie - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sword style  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamerpic selfie</h2>
                    
<p>I think we should be able to use kinect to snap pictures of ourselves (or whatever) to use as our gamerpics. Then we could decorate them with different backgrounds and what not. Of course there is the potential for abuse with dudes trying to show people
 their junk. But that's no different than people who dodge the censor to create profane gamertags. They would be reported and dealt with. I think this could be a cool way to personalize our gamercards. What say you?</p>

<p>I don't see why someone would be compelled to purchase a $500 device only have it turn into a giant paper-weight for doing something they shouldn't be doing in the 1st place. It amazes me how stupid some people can be.</p>
<p>If anything, I would be afraid that if this was made into a feature, a friend could easily sign into my console under my profile &amp; take an inappropriate picture for my gamerpic - then I would be the 1 getting banned as a result. This scenario, while unlikely,
 is something that has happened to innocent people on the Xbox 360 with stupid friends. Although there are steps I can take to protect my account, I'd rather not have to put a password in EVERY time I sign in.</p>
<p>Customization is good, but I think I would rather just stick with the standard gamerpics &amp; avatar pics. It's more easily controlled while still having a modicum of customization &amp; choices available to Xbox Live users.</p>

<p>On one hand, I understand why they should just block it outright. &nbsp;A lot of children use the Xbox and this would prevent them from ever seeing those images.</p>
<p>On the other hand, nearly every social media website that is out there includes a profile picture with your face on it.</p>
<p>Perhaps, MS could implement some kind of approval system? &nbsp;Take picture, upload, needs to get approved, then it's your gamertag pic.</p>

<p>One thing that they could to stop some of the problems mentioned is children wouldn't be able to post pics and they could also make it that if family settings are on (which they should be for children) they could not see any pics only the normal gamer tag
 ones. You would hope then that the adults/people of the appropriate age would not abuse the system, but we all know that is just not going to happen.
</p>
<p>While I like this idea I can see so many problems for it. Beating someone in a game getting abusive message by them in regards to appearance. People seeing recent players pics then decide they want to be knobs and abuse people over appearance etc. There
 is too many problems that could come from it. It could turn into a gold mine cyber bullying abuse. &nbsp;</p>

            I'm having the same problem. Before I upgraded from windows 8.1, I could right click on the podcast download button and then save as and select the location I wanted to save the podcast to. Now, when I right click, I don't have the save as option in the
 mouse accelerator.

            Yes, this is a nightmare. I used to be in the habit of dropping a few podcasts onto an SD card to listen to on a variety of devices but now the "save as" option seems no longer to be available. I regard this as sufficiently serious as to revert to 8.1!

            <p>But here's a solution to this that was posted on another thread. I'm here to tell you it works great, but not quite as convenient as&nbsp;being able to right click and then select 'save as'! And, you can save the podcast anywhere you want too! Once you&nbsp;do it&nbsp;a
 couple of times you'll be good to go! Let's hope there's a better fix down the road!!!</p>

<p>Obviously the answer is simple, Firefox here we come. </p>
<p>Okay, forgot the smart **** answer above. I have solved the problem. </p>
<p>1. Open the podcast in new tab or window. </p>
<p>2. Select "more options" that's the "---" in the upper-right corner </p>
<p>3. Select "open with internet explorer" </p>
<p>The "view and track your downloads window will open" You will be given the option to save the podcast.
</p>
<p>Done.</p>

                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Why is Cortana always running even when I "disabled" her? Every single time I try to disable the wretched program it keeps coming back, I'm not playing halo why does she have invulnerability. Why is it
 that I can't even uninstall her or remove certain files that pertain to anything that shes involved in. It's my COMPUTER and I should have the ability to disable her. Shes just running in the background eating away at my memory like the succubus that she is.
 I'm all for you guys trying to improve your AI and all but could you at least allow us to you know turn off a process that has nothing to do with the functionality of windows. What do I know i'm just a pissed off windows user, maybe i'll just switch to mac

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience caused. I will be glad to answer you query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to make sure I understand correctly, you are able to disable Cortana from the search bar however, it keeps running in the background process in task manager, is that correct? Also, what is the memory usage of Cortana?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, please be informed that Cortana cannot be disabled from the background process because it is integrated to the operating system and it is necessary for some apps to have Cortana running in the background therefore, it will automatically get enabled
 even if you try to disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this answers your query.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just bought a brand new Lenovo, and I soon as I thought MS figured improved Windows 8 with the advent of Windows 10, I get Cortana popping up on my screen every two seconds (even after I disabled it). &nbsp;IT IS AN ABSOLUTE JOKE. &nbsp;No wonder. &nbsp;The only think
 keeping me faithful to Microsoft is the death of Steve Jobs, and the slow demise of Apple. &nbsp;Please explain a clear and concise way to remove Cortana and keep it from being the worst bug MS has ever created.</p>

            This is completely incorrect. You can stop it from running in the background. You have to shut down the program in task manager, then QUICKLY rename the Cortana file before it reinitializes. Search online for more in depth directions. You have to be quick
 about renaming the file. It took me a few times before I got it done quickly enough.

One of the many things I find annoying about this is that not only has MS forced us to install their resource hungry **** on our computers, but then their support "engineer" lies to people about disabling it.

<p><span><span>Hello Kally Werven,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There are different places in the Internet Explorer from where you will be able to change the font size:
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hold down the CTRL key on the key board , then scroll up with the mouse to increase the font size on the Internet Explorer page.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Method 2:
</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>From the menu bar, click on the “View” menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Point to “Text Size”, choose the text size that best meets your needs.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Method 3:
</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>In order to change font size of web pages that with “hard-coded” font size, you must override their font settings. To do so, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Internet Explorer as usual.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click on the “Tools” menu from the menu bar, select “Internet Options”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>The “Internet Options” window will then pop up, click on the “Accessibility” button located at bottom right corner.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>In the “Accessibility” window, you can choose to:
<br />
Ignore font sizes specified on Web pages.</span></span></p>

<h2>            surface pro4 - translucent imagine of closed screens remain visible</h2>
                    Unboxed surface pro 4 a few days ago. Noticed immediate&nbsp;issue with screen flicker that has been mentioned&nbsp;in other posts, did updates etc., but still seems to be an issue but may be not as apparent. However much bigger problem is translucent 'ghost' imagines
 of closed apps screens and browser&nbsp;pages remaining&nbsp;on screen.&nbsp; This prevents you viewing the next page properly for anywhere&nbsp;between 5 seconds and up to a minute or more.&nbsp; The windows&nbsp;10 menu does the same, i.e. remains&nbsp;visible&nbsp;underlying&nbsp;the next screen that
 has been opened.&nbsp; Has also happened&nbsp;scrolling down through&nbsp;web pages using edge browser.&nbsp; This is making this device unusable.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am not a techie so need some help with this.&nbsp; I have only installed&nbsp;MS office 365 and nothing&nbsp;else. Thanks.

<p>That's great, but Guide --&gt; Settings --&gt; Family does not work. &nbsp;(It pushes you back to Xbox.com "to give parents permission") Hence why I am searching forums for how to create an account/add them to live.</p>

<h2>            Audio getting stuck while playing constantly-Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have a dell inspiron 1545 laptop running on Windows 7 home premium version. Recently, I re-installed the windows using the dell backup utility to the factory settings and after that, my audio started getting stuck while playing music (audio feels like
 the computer hangs). I have tried updating the IDT sound driver using the device manager, but says the driver is up to date. I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the driver, but no use. Will that be the problem of my sound driver or any hardware problems.
 Please suggest something so that I can resolve this issue....</p>

            <p>Hello Sudarsan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you made any hardware changes to your computer recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make sure your speakers are correctly connected to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many computers have three or more jacks that connect to a sound card or sound processor, including a microphone jack, line-in jack, and line-out jack. Your speakers should be plugged in to the line-out jack. If you're not sure which jack this is, try plugging
 your speakers in to each of the jacks to see if any of them produce sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker effects that are known as enhancements. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, you might need to update your audio driver.</p>
<p><br />
I would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
<strong>Run Playing Audio troubleshooter</strong><br />

<h2>            Account won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t accept payment options</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I tried to buy the special for one month of xbox live for 1 dollar and I got an "invalid card" error. Then my boyfriend put his card in and got the same error. We kept trying. He has used his card on his xbox live account. There is no reason why it shouldn't
 work. We&nbsp;tried to have xbox call us (the request call service was down) and eventually got through to someone after calling manually&nbsp;who told us that the account probably has a soft block on it and we should try in 24 hours. 24 hours later and here we are.
 I put in my card again, my boyfriend put in his, both the same error, again. Then, we hooked up a paypal account to live to try and buy the current special on the xbox live marketplace. Still no luck. The marketplace can't find a method of payment even when
 a valid paypal account is hooked up.</p>
<p>All this has been a huge inconvenience to me and my boyfriend.&nbsp;I don't understand why the system won't take my money! Does anyone have a solution for me? Can you offer me some kind of compensation for the trouble I've had to simply BUY a product necessary
 to use virtually any online function of the 360?</p>

<p>i was having the same issue! it was really starting to **** me off but the kid who said to go to account.microsoft.com was spot on. from there i had to add my paypal account i made just for this. then it asks for your credit card number to attach it to your
 paypal because this is the only way microsoft can wire money through it. after you enter your card in click complete transaction (there is a transaction of $0 to store your info). then on your xbox when checking payment methods your new paypal account on should
 appear. thanks osorojo for the help finally back online!</p>
