            You can't stop someone from sending you emails.&nbsp; You can probably configure your email account or your email program to block or discard messages.&nbsp; If you'll tell us how you access your email, we can make some suggestions.

<h2>            missing task bar and shortcut icons</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>After starting and logging into my computer using Windows Vista Home Premium, my desktop appears with the following:&nbsp; clock gadget on the right and small rectangular box on top allowing me access to web mail, pictures, movies, security, help, trash.</p>
<p>I have no way of getting to start menu to system restore.&nbsp; On occasion when this has happened, I have been lucky to recover after a full shut down.&nbsp; However, I have used that good luck up.&nbsp; I believe vista has a glitch regarding accessing control panel,
 which is when this whole mess began.&nbsp; Once I went to control panel by shortcut, this problem has remained.</p>
<p>Now I need to be able to backup computer (which I will need help with later) and upgrade to windows 7.&nbsp; But first need access to my computer.</p>
<p>I look forward to your responses.</p>
<p>Thanks alot,</p>
<p>hopegeorgia</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>If the Win key doesn't bring up the Start Menu, try booting into Safe Mode (repeatedly clicking the F8 buttton during bootup until the menu appears) and see if you have access there.&nbsp; You can run the System Retore from Safe Mode.</p>
<p><span><span>Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a
 Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer).</span></p>
<p><span>If we're lucky these procedures will resolve both the taskbar and icon problems at the same time (whatever caused them as long as you can get in front of it with
 System Restore).</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; If not post back with results and we'll try some other options - there are many possibilities to still consider if these procedures don't do
 the trick.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            Hi Arcanien,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Welcome to the Windows Vista Answers Forum.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I would suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and then try installing the updates. One of the third party services may be interfering with the installation of updates.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>To place the computer in a clean boot state, follow teh steps below:</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;
<ol>
<li><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></li><li><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" />, type
<span>msconfig.exe</span> in the <strong><span>Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.
</span>
</li><li><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fSecurityShield.jpg" />&nbsp;If you are
 prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.
</span>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>On the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click
<strong><span>Selective Startup</span></strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong><span>Load startup items</span></strong> check box. (The
<strong><span>Use Original Boot.ini</span></strong> check box is unavailable.)
</span></li><li><span>On the
<strong><span>Services </span></strong>tab, click to select the
<strong><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></strong> check box, and then click
<strong><span>Disable all</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></li><li><span>Click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Once your computer restarts, try installing the updates.</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>Reset the computer to start as usual</span></strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click
<strong><span>Start</span></strong> <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fVistaStartButton.jpg" />, type
<span>msconfig.exe</span> in the<strong><span> Start Search</span></strong> box, and then press ENTER.
</span>
</li><li><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fsupport.microsoft.com%2flibrary%2fimages%2fsupport%2fkbgraphics%2fPublic%2fEN-US%2fSecurityShield.jpg" />&nbsp;If you are
 prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong><span>Continue</span></strong>.
</span>
</li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>On the
<strong><span>General</span></strong> tab, click the
<strong><span>Normal Startup</span></strong> option, and then click
<strong><span>OK</span></strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<strong><span>Restart</span></strong>.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;<br />
If clean boot does not work, follow the steps in the link below:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong><span>How do I reset Windows Update components?</span></strong><br />

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the issue is concerned to any apps and not any program or software’s, refer these methods.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to run “</span>Windows 8 UI<span> App Troubleshooter”
 to diagnose the exact issue.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following link to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may also temporarily disable security software and check if the issue persists. Make sure to enable that security software on the computer
 after checking.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span>
 Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>What to do if you have problems with an app</b></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Follow the steps to run SFC scan.</span></b></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.</span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘sfc /scannow’.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method
<span>&nbsp;</span>5:</span></b></p>
<p><span>You need at least
<b>1024X768 resolution </b>for Metro apps to work.</span></p>
<p><span>Confirm if the issue reproduces with all user accounts. Metro apps
<b>aren’t supported if you are running with a built-in administrator account</b> (happens mostly when upgrading).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check Screen Resolution:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I):</span></strong><span> Do a right-click on Desktop and select
<strong><span>Screen Resolution</span></strong> option to open Screen Resolution window.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;<strong><span>II):</span></strong> You will see the current screen resolution next the Resolution
 box. If the resolution is lower than 1024 x 768 pixels, you can set a higher resolution, if your PC supports. To change the current resolution, click on Resolution box and select a higher resolution.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 6:</span></b></p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><span>Perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps
 in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘</span><b><span>Windows
 + R</span></b><span>’ key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘</span><b><span>Run</span></b><span>’ windows type ’</span><b><span>MSCONFIG</span></b><span>’
 and click ‘</span><b><span>Ok</span></b><span>’.<br />
c) Click the ‘</span><b><span>Boot</span></b><span>’ tab and uncheck ‘</span><b><span>Safe
 Boot</span></b><span>’ option.<br />
d) On the ‘</span><b><span>General</span></b><span>’ tab, click to select the option ‘</span><b><span>Selective
 startup</span></b><span>’, and then click to clear the option Load startup items check box.<br />
e) On the ‘</span><b><span>Services</span></b><span>’ tab, click to select the ‘</span><b><span>Hide
 all Microsoft services</span></b><span>’ check box, and then click ‘</span><b><span>Disable
 all</span></b><span>’.<br />
f) On the ‘</span><b><span>StartUp’</span></b><span> tab, click ‘</span><b><span>Open
 Task Manager</span></b><span>’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘</span><b><span>Disable</span></b><span>’.<br />
g) Click ‘</span><b><span>OK</span></b><span>’, and then click
</span><b><span>Restart</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps
</span><b><span>1a</span></b><span> and
</span><b><span>1b</span></b><span> to start the
</span><b><span>System Configuration utility</span></b><span>.<br />
b. Click the </span><b><span>Services</span></b><span> tab, and then click to select the
</span><b><span>Hide all Microsoft services</span></b><span> check box.<br />
c. Click to select </span><b><span>half of the check boxes in the Service list</span></b><span>.<br />
d. Click </span><b><span>OK</span></b><span>, and then click
</span><b><span>Restart</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 3:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining
 check boxes that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected
 service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 4:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Enable half of the Startup items
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine
 which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 5:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check
 boxes that you originally selected in the Startup Item list.<br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.<br />
If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.<br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 6:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer
 to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><b><span>Step 7:
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
 After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
a) Press the ‘</span><b><span>Windows + R’</span></b><span> key on the keyboard.<br />
b) In the ‘Run’ windows type ’</span><b><span>MSCONFIG</span></b><span>’ and click ‘</span><b><span>Ok</span></b><span>’.<br />
c) On the ‘</span><b><span>General</span></b><span>’ tab, click the ‘</span><b><span>Normal

            I have followed your directions and none of these fixes have corrected the problem.&nbsp; I did recently restore my computer after a virus shut down my system.&nbsp; Everything else is now working fine, and I only have this nagging keyboard issue.&nbsp; The problem is
 not related to an external mouse or other device as I have disconnected these and the problem continues.&nbsp; I beleive the problem is directly in the laptop keyboard. I would appreciate additional suggestions to resolve this issue.&nbsp; Thanks,

            It's possible to cause Touchpad cursor movement by putting weight on the casing near the Touchpad&nbsp; while you are typing.&nbsp; Temporarily disable it to isolate this as a potential cause of your problem - Control panel, Mouse, Touchpad tab.

<p>Hi Stephan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For <strong>Dell XPS 12 9Q33</strong>, then NFC driver is only available for Windows 8.1 and not Windows 10. You may go to
<em><a href="https://www.dell.com/support/home/in/en/inbsdt1/product-support/product/xps-12-9q33/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Support for XPS 12 9Q33</a></em> and choose
<strong>Windows 8, 64-bit</strong> from the drop-down list of Operating system and you will be able to see the
<strong>Intel NFC Driver</strong> for your laptop, but NFC Driver is not available for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, if you want to use NFC on your laptop, you can try downloading the <strong>
Intel NFC Driver</strong> on your Windows 10 computer and install it in <strong>Compatibility Mode</strong> by following the below steps and check if this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Step 1</strong>: Once you download the <strong>
Intel NFC Driver</strong> onto your computer &gt; <strong>Right-click</strong> on the driver setup that you downloaded &gt; Click on
<strong>Properties</strong> &gt; Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab &gt;&nbsp; Choose <strong>
Troubleshoot Program</strong> &gt; Check the options <strong>The program worked in earlier version of Windows but won't install or run now</strong> and
<strong>The program requires additional permissions</strong>.<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong>: Then, choose <strong>Windows 8</strong> for <strong>Which version of Windows did this program work on before?</strong> &gt; Click on
<strong>Next</strong> &gt; Then, follow the on-screen instructions.<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong>: Once the driver is installed, <strong>restart the laptop once</strong>, and check for the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give it a shot and let us know of any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

    <title>Importing pictures and videos Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeeke999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Importing pictures and videos Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>In windows 7. I could connect my camera or insert a SD card, select import pics/videos using windows and the Pics would go to a defined pic folder and the videos would go to defined video folder. I could define the folder, date and tag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In windows 10. I can connect the same devices, select import and it dumps everything into one pic folder. I can define a folder and have some limited options on grouping by date, month etc but it still will put pics and videos in same folder. For most devices
 this is OK but for th files imported from my I Phone the video files will not play properly. For example, a 1 minute video taken at a concert plays about 1 sec jittery and is complete. it doesn't stop mid play back but it's like it only copied 1 sec of the
 concert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I import the same devices files onto my old computer using windows 7. It imports as I described above the same file plays perfectly. If I copy the same file imported via the windows 7 computer and paste it to the windows 10 computer the file then plays
 perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried importing using the basic import using photos and movies. I've tried importing using the Photo gallery. same results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either the windows media software has changed and I don't know how to get the I need or this software is terrible!!!!&nbsp; and has taken a giant step backward in its capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be prompted to import when I attach or insert media and Have it send photos to a photo folder and videos to a video folder with capability to define folder, date grouping and tag??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in windows 10 the photo import does not adjust/ right the photo. For example in windows 7 imports photos taken with a vertical or horizontal aspect were rotated automatically during the import. In windows 10 they do not. Are there any settings to correct
 this?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge that you are experiencing with importing your files can occur due to several reasons, such as, unsupported file formats, file corruption, etc. To better assist you with your concern, kindly answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is the file format of the videos that you are importing to your Windows 10 PC?</li><li>Which video player are you using to play the imported players?</li><li>Is this happening to all of the videos on your PC?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly send us screenshots regarding your concern about your computer putting all of the videos and photos in one folder so that we can isolate the issue further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern with your imported photos not correcting themselves during import, Windows 10 was not designed with the feature to automatically rotate photos during import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>
        </p>

<ul>
<li>The format that is the most problem described previously is .mov from files imported from an IPhone 6.
</li><li>Will not play properly using movies &amp; TV app or windows media player.</li><li>The .mts files from my camera seem to do ok. The .avi files from my go pro when using movies and TV will play but no video only sound. The .avi files play properly when using windows media player.</li><li>Screen shot below simply shows the .mov files and .jpg files get imported to the same folder. With windows 7 the windows import gave the ability to specify a specific target folder for photos and a separate folder for videos. Is there a setting I can change
 to direct videos to import to a different location than the photos?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85eac702-42d8-44ef-b25e-b720c05f7206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/85eac702-42d8-44ef-b25e-b720c05f7206" /></a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I had downloaded a different media player recommended by MS (forgot the name) but the results were the same. I uninstalled it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would MS not keep the feature to correctly rotate photos? In fact the currently import has less features than previous version. Why?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With windows 7 import. I could easily set the default folders for my videos and photos. Then it was an easy two step process: connect the device when prompted add the tag hit enter and everything else was put where I directed and the photos were automatically
 fixed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to check all files, import to a different machine and manually transfer files to the new (main) computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again I'm either doing something wrong or the part of windows is terrible!!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 have features that are not working properly, we suggest that you run the System File Checker tool and the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool to scan and correct any Windows 10 component issues. System File Checker (SFC) is a built-in
 tool in the operating system. SFC checks for system file corruption. Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) is a command-line tool that can be used to service a Windows image or to prepare a Windows Preinstallation Environment image.<br />
<br />
Kindly follow the steps in this article posted by <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/083c9ada-567f-4b1e-ba21-8a0585616bee" title="ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)">

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had ran the SFC from suggestions on a previous response with no errors found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the DISM check, scan and restore. No component store corruption detected. The operation completed successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe the answer is in a corrupt file. I simply can't find the features that I used in Windows 7 pertaining to importing pic and videos. I don't know if the features exist or been removed altogether in W10 or if they can be found by a different
 method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also for some reason when I import video files (primarily from my IPhone) the v files will not play properly. If I import them using the older computer using W7 they play fine on that computer and when I then move them to the computer using W10 they play
 fine as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Another problem that just came up a few days ago</span>. The windows accessory "paint" and Adobe Photoshop will not longer open on the W10 computer. These components have worked fine for several months previously.&nbsp;
 The other components, I've checked so far, in the adobe suite work fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With multimedia being more &amp; more prevalent in the everyday use of computing, Windows 10 in my experience has failed miserably in this area. Either that or I need a lot more help in understanding/employing it, which has not been the case in the past versions
 since the beginning of Windows and before!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>Importing of photos and videos is handled by an App. In Windows 10, the default application for importing from a device is the Photos application. But that application is pretty "dumb" about how it does it and it basically just puts everything in a monolithic
 folder and lets your Photos app sort out the rest and apply some order. The problem with that is that if you are just looking at your media files in the Windows Explorer, there is no organization.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As noted in the&nbsp;<span><span>Wiki Article:&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/apps_windows_10-photos/complete-guide-to-importing-your-photos-in-windows/d8258fff-729e-45df-8afd-1f1195d7b6c5">Complete Guide to Importing
 Your Photos in Windows 10</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>, there is a way to impose some order to your import. But what isn't mentioned is that it requires you to import using Photo Gallery. Photo Gallery is part of the
 Windows Essentials download along with Movie Maker and some other applications. That's most likely what you had on Windows 7 but you probably haven't installed it on Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the next little bit of bad news, Microsoft has stopped supporting Windows Essentials. The last update was in 2012 and they officially dropped support and pulled it from their servers back in January 2017. Personally, I still use Photo Gallery for
 exactly this reason, that it does a much better job of organizing clips compared to the Photos app. If they were to fix this, I'd switch to Photos, but until then, I'm very happy using Photo Gallery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the download is gone from the Microsoft servers, you can find archived copies of the
<a href="https://goo.gl/kTA0x8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Essentials 2012 offline installer</a>. I'd recommend installing that and then switching your default import behavior so it imports using Photo Gallery instead of Photos.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically you need to change the Autoplay settings for your camera storage and media cards to "Import using Photo Gallery".</p>

<p>I may have had Windows essentials I don't recall. Although I did have an option to import via photo gallery I didn't use it. I chose the option import pictures and videos using Windows. This gave the option where to direct video and photo files separately.
 Also gave option of naming folder with date or date rage or tag or other options in addition to putting a tag on the photos / videos. I'm not sure what component of windows this was but I do know it was not the photo gallery option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the option I described does not exist in windows any longer. I'd like get an app that would work similarly or better to what I had in W7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll continue looking for other options.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to piggyback on this discussion because it's close to what I'm having happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always used the Photo Importer from Windows 7, and I would like to have the same thing in Windows 10 so my file/folder naming convention would stay the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you connect a camera or another device to Windows 10, my understanding is you can still get a similar import, and it allows for creating folders with the date taken plus a tag that you enter during import.&nbsp; However, I can only connect the memory card
 from my cameras, and that import dialog window never opens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get that import feature to work in Windows 10 without connecting a camera?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>--Kent</p>

<p>Hi Kent,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your post, it looks like the <strong>AutoPlay </strong>is not enabled from your PC settings. To get the dialog window when the memory card is inserted, enable AutoPlay by going to the<strong> Settings app &gt; Devices tab &gt; AutoPlay</strong>. You can
 also set the default action for Memory card using the drop-down menu. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you are done, let us know the result. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards. </p>

<p>Enable the built-in Administrator and log into it. After you've gotten into the system, change the other user accounts' passwords and then disable the password expiration requirement if desired.</p>
<p><span>If you have a Windows 7 installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes [press Enter]</span></p>
<p><span>Remove the installation DVD and reboot the computer. You will now see an icon for Administrator on the Welcome Screen. The default password is a blank.</span></p>
<p><span>If you don't have a Windows 7 installation DVD (only have a recovery disc), the computer mftr. may have given you the Windows 7 System Repair option (not a System Recovery!) on the diagnostic menu. This diagnostic menu is the
 same one where you can choose Safe Mode. Get to this menu by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting up. If you don't have this option you can make a bootable Windows 7 Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />

<span><br />
Note: All the Neosmart recovery disc downloads are torrent files. There is a good explanation of torrent files at the Neosmart website. You will need a torrent client such as<a href="http://www.utorrent.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">muTorrent</a> to get the files. The torrent client
 will download the .iso file with which to create the bootable DVD. If you are creating the bootable DVD in an older operating system (XP, Vista), you will need to use third-party burning software such as Nero, Roxio, or the free ImgBurn (<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com</a>
 ) to burn the .iso as an image, not as data. Windows 7 can burn .isos natively.<br />
<br />
Once you have fixed things, log into the extra administrative account you will make per the suggestions at the end of this post and disable the built-in Administrator account again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>To disable the password expiration requirement:</span></p>
<p>Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click and choose "Run as administrator"<br />
<br />
Stop the Password Expiration - at the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net accounts /maxpwage:unlimited [enter]<br />
<br />
You will get a message box: “The command completed successfully” and then you can close the command prompt.</p>
<p><span><span style="font-weight: bold">User accounts - Recommended Setup</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold">Vista</span> and<span style="font-weight: bold">Win7</span> )</span>
<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista and Windows 7 are multi-user operating systems with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, and Guest. These accounts should be
 left alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista and Windows 7 because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily
 work and that account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it may require more work than you want to do. Best not to get into a bad situation to begin with.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. Running as a Standard user is best practice for security
 purposes and will help protect your computer from infection. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</p>

<p>Ce code erreur indique que, soit le codec video ou audio n'est pas pris en charge par la console, soit l'un des deux flux est endommagé.</p>

<p>Quoi qu'il en soit ce code erreur est issue d'une video <strong>Zune</strong>, en conséquence je te conseille d'appeler le Support afin de soit trouver une solution pour lire cette video, soit te faire rembourser ton achat.</p>

<h3> dan_367  say:</h3>
<h2>            How Can I use Windows 10 to Run a program written for Windows 98&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm sorry if this is the wrong place to ask, but am not up to date with computers. &nbsp; My question is I have a program from many years ago written for Windows 98 and Windows NT. &nbsp;Of course it won't work on Windows 10 Home Version. &nbsp;Is there something I can
 purchase (other than an old windows 98 computer) to run it on Windows 10? &nbsp; It would work on Windows XP also, but would NOT work on Windows 7. I know this is probably difficult and may be impossible on Windows 10. But I have nothing to lose by asking..</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>Depending on how popular a program was its fans may have created patches allowing the software to be run in newer versions of Windows. A web search should turn that up if&nbsp;such a thing&nbsp;exists for your program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most common way to deal with this kind of situation though is to use&nbsp; virtualization software to create a virtual computer&nbsp;within Windows and install a copy of Windows 98 in that. There are free versions of VMware Player and Virtual Box, possibly others,
 which you can install in Windows 10 Home edition (Pro edition&nbsp;includes Hyper-V). It may have changed but the last time I used Virtual Box it had poor or zero support for MSDos based Windows versions (win3.x through 98) so my preference is VMware. You'd have
 to source&nbsp;a copy of Windows&nbsp;98 (or whatever other OS)&nbsp;separately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of things to note, first being that the virtual computer will use a fixed configuration of virtual hardware components.&nbsp;Your program's performance (thinking games) might not be&nbsp;as high as you're used to. The second thing is that a lot of older programs
 were written for displays that were only&nbsp;640x480 pixels, or 800x600 pixels, so that is&nbsp;the size that&nbsp;they would typically appear on your screen however large it is. If the program is able to run in windowed mode then you could stretch&nbsp;the virtual PC's display&nbsp;to
 a larger size on your screen. Some programs will only run at a fixed display size, which could leave you&nbsp;limited to running the program in&nbsp;a small&nbsp;640x480 program&nbsp;window.

<p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In cases like this, your best bet would be to run the program in Compatibility mode. Please be advised that most programs created for earlier versions will either run poorly or not at all in Windows 10 since the coding and functionality that made them run
 in older versions are no longer supported in the latest version and build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you mentioned that it worked in Windows XP, you may try to choose that in the compatibility options. For reference and more information, check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article
</a></strong>to learn more about how compatibility mode works.</p>

<p>Sure, no problem and it's free: Run your program in a Windows 98 virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setting up a virtual machine with VirtualBox or VMWare Workstation player is easy - there are many tutorials on the web. Install Windows 98 in the VM and then install your program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also create a VM with Microsoft's own Hyper-V but the process is more tricky to understand.</p>

</p><p>Microsoft has identified a known issue that may swap the battery order in the battery status fly out after installing the Creators Update.&nbsp; We are currently working on resolving this in a future version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some customers have reported they were successfully able to set the battery order in the battery status display by uninstalling the batteries with Device Manager and then reinstalling them in the desired order.&nbsp; To do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.&nbsp; (Type <strong>Device Manager</strong> in Cortana, and then select the Control Panel item in the search results.)</li><li>Expand <strong>Batteries</strong>.&nbsp;</li><li>You should <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">see one or more items that say Microsoft ACPI-Compliant Control Method Battery (or something similar).&nbsp; Right-click each one and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Physically disconnect the secondary battery and make sure only the primary battery that you want to be displayed as “Battery #1” is attached.&nbsp; Then, in Device Manager, select
<strong>Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<strong>Scan for hardware changes.&nbsp; </strong>The secondary battery should now be displayed as Battery 2.</span>

<p>Why the hell would you want to play with someone in France if you're in the US?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It's a NAT problem, guarantee it. Some setting of yours, or theirs, is making your NAT less-than-perfectly-flexible. Unfortunately, I am not sure what it would be and there's no way to tell whether it's on your end or theirs.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My advice would be that you check your modem/router's settings, research on NAT issues and go through every setting you can think of via your computer, seeing if anything helps the issue. If either of you have had obvious changes to your network, like a
 router/modem swap, then that's something to look at.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>"we both have a really good connection".</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This is absolutely irrelevant.</p>

<p>Yo man</p>
<p>my NAT is OPEN, it just this friend that i can't join, i can join everybody else but him no. I need someone else to be a leader of the party or the game so i can join and play with the friend, i used to play regularly with him. i haven't changed nothing
 and i am more than sure that he didn't. could this be a region problem ??? since i think he used to keep it as a German region ????</p>
<p>and BTW why do u care if i am playing with someone in the french region ??!?!?!?!?!?!</p>

 My husband looked into the problem and saw that for some reason, the internet connection was not opened by the computer, while I tried to log in with my profile. My ASUS PC is running Windows 10. The following update was&nbsp;run the previous day - first it had

<h2>            Win Media Player 12 won&#39;t start</h2>
                    I have a huge problem with Win media player 12. It won't start at all. It tells me Windows Media player is not installed right and to re-install it. I've searched and have tried everything I read so far. Below is all I tried.<br />
<br />
I went to control panel / programs and features / features<br />
Removed wmp and wmc. Rebooted. Added it back once with and once without wmc and both times rebooted after.<br />
<br />
I've also tried the commands in the cmd as administrator sfc /scannow<br />
<br />
Cmd as admin I also tried puttng in unregmp2 /updatewmpverion and unregmp2 /updatewmp<br />
<br />
Last thing I have tried is using a program called fixWMP.<br />
<br />
I've even tried doing the wmp 12 you can get from the microsoft site Windows6.1-KB968211-x86.msu but won't let me install.<br />
<br />
Please help<br />
<br />

            Truehawk, open the Start Menu, go to&nbsp; <strong>All Programs</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong> , right-click&nbsp;
<strong>Command Prompt</strong> , and select&nbsp;<strong>Run as administrator</strong> . In Command Prompt, type the following:
<p><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p>and press Enter. Let it run until it completes. Does it find any problems, and if so, is it able to fix them? Does the issue still occur afterwards?</p>
<p>If that doesn't help, use System Restore to roll back to a restore point from before the problem started happening.</p>

            <span>Hi,</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the device has a FailReasonString value in its hardware key, that string is displayed as the error message. The driver or enumerator puts this registry string value there. If there is no FailReasonString in the hardware key, you receive the following
 error message: </span><span>This device cannot start (Code 10).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to contact</span><span> HP Forum Support for getting further assistance.</span></p>

            <span>Hi All</span>
<div>I thought I would bring you all up to date in the spirt of the forum( even though know-one offered any help)</div>
<div>I solved the BOOTMRG issue as follows:- using the windows 7 recovery disk. But before doing the steppes below insert the repair disk select Repair Startup and click enter.&nbsp;</div>
<div>I did this and it worked but I had to run it three times before it worked. If this fails then the next steps should be tried:-</div>
<div>
<div>When you use the Recovery Environment (Windows RE) to troubleshoot startup issues, first try the Startup Repair option in the System Recovery Options dialog box. If this does not resolve the issue, or if you have to manually troubleshoot additional issues,
 use the Bootrec.exe tool. This article talks about how to use the Bootrec.exe tool in the Windows RE to troubleshoot and repair the following items in Windows Vista or Windows 7:</div>
<div>A master boot record (MBR)</div>
<div>A boot sector</div>
<div>A Boot Configuration Data (BCD) store</div>
<div>You can also use the Bootrec.exe tool to troubleshoot a Windows Boot Configuration Data file is missing required information error.</div>
<div>How to run the Bootrec.exe tool</div>
<div>To run the Bootrec.exe tool, first start the Windows RE:</div>
<div>Put the Windows Vista or Windows 7 media in the DVD drive, and then start the computer.</div>
<div>Press a key when you are prompted.</div>
<div>Select a language, a time, a currency, a keyboard, or an input method, and then click Next.</div>
<div>Click Repair your computer.</div>
<div>Select the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next.</div>
<div>In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt.</div>
<div>Type Bootrec.exe, and then press Enter.</div>
<div>Note To start the computer from the Windows Vista or Windows 7 DVD, the computer must be configured to start from the DVD drive. For information about how to do this, see the documentation that was included with the computer, or contact the computer manufacturer.</div>
<div>Bootrec.exe options</div>
<div>The Bootrec.exe tool supports the following options. Use the option that's appropriate for your situation.</div>
<div>/FixMbr</div>
<div>This option writes a Windows 7 or Windows Vista-compatible MBR to the system partition. It does not overwrite the existing partition table. Use this option when you must resolve MBR corruption issues, or when you have to remove nonstandard code from the
 MBR.</div>
<div>/FixBoot</div>
<div>This option writes a new boot sector to the system partition by using a boot sector that's compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Use this option if one of the following conditions is true:</div>
<div>The boot sector was replaced with a nonstandard Windows Vista or Windows 7 boot sector.</div>
<div>The boot sector is damaged.</div>
<div>An earlier Windows operating system was installed after Windows Vista or Windows 7 was installed. In this situation, the computer starts by using Windows NT Loader (NTLDR) instead of Windows Boot Manager (Bootmgr.exe).</div>
<div>/ScanOs</div>
<div>This option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. It also displays the entries that are currently not in the BCD store. Use this option when there are Windows Vista or Windows 7 installations that the Boot
 Manager menu does not list.</div>
<div>/RebuildBcd</div>
<div>This option scans all disks for installations that are compatible with Windows Vista or Windows 7. Additionally, it lets you select the installations that you want to add to the BCD store. Use this option when you must completely rebuild the BCD store.</div>
<div>Note Use the Bootrec.exe tool to troubleshoot a "Bootmgr Is Missing" error. If rebuilding the BCD store doesn't resolve the startup issue, you can export and delete the BCD store and then run this option again. By doing this, you make sure that the BCD
 store is completely rebuilt.&nbsp;</div>
<div>To do this, type the following commands at the Windows RE command prompt:</div>
<div>bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup</div>
<div>c:</div>
<div>cd boot</div>
<div>attrib bcd -s -h -r</div>
<div>ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old</div>
<div>bootrec /RebuildBcd</div>
<div>Hope this helps Andy</div>

<h2>            CoD 4 filled with hackers...</h2>
                    
<p>Hi. I played CoD 4 recently and ran into a lot of hackers online (like in public matches, playing Domination and that stuff) and I've been filing complaints on every hacker I find.</p>
<p>My first question is if Infinity Ward is going to fix this anytime soon. CoD 4 used to be a great game and would have balance but now with all these people using these hacks/exploits/what ever you want to call them, it's hard to actually play the game without
 being killed every 2 seconds.</p>
<p>I've been reading that a lot of people have been having themselves deranked because of these people. Will that happen to me if I play a public, online match now? Can they mess up my CoD 4 game?</p>
<p>Thanks. Just wanted to know. If I find it's dangerous playing CoD 4 online now, then I'll head back to MW2 and play on there. (even though there are a lot of noobtubers on there...)</p>

<p>Thanks for the help. I didn't dashboard during the middle of the game, but left the lobby and then turned off my Xbox immediantly afterwards. I haven't checked my rank on CoD 4, but I don't really care if my rank was reset or anything. I didn't have that
 high of a rank anyways. My MW2 and Black Ops ranks seem to be intact, so I'm happy about that.
</p>
<p>I did report the GT. I also got a message later on in the day about an infections lobby and reported and blocked communications with the person. Glad the XBL team is finally getting rid of these guys.</p>
<p>Thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            HOW DO I STOP PHOTO&#39;S MOVING AROUND AFTER i HAVE EDITED THEM</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
After I have edited my photo's how do I stop the photo's from moving around? I like my photo's to appear in their respective folder as per photo taken (date)<br />
But I have noticed that once I have edited my photo's with some comments and then close the file, the next time I open the file the phot's appear random and not as per date taken.<br />
I then have to drag the photo's to where they belong in the folder which is very time consuming and frustrating. Once I have dragged the photo's to where I want to them to be, the next time I open the folder again they are not where I "left them"<br />
Thanks
