    <title>Network connection fluctuates on Windows 10, signal range not standing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diegocaerda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network connection fluctuates on Windows 10, signal range not standing on more than 4 meters from the router</h2>
                    <p>By now I have tried several of the solutions or methods to treat this trouble. I have seen YouTube videos on how to maximize the signal range but all of them are not useful to me. I have tried to change the channel of the router and reset the passwords,
 shamefully still the network connection fluctuates. I downloaded WiFi channel scanner to see how much it fluctuates and the signal goes up and down constantly from 15% to 50%.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you an idea of how far I have gone:</p>
<p>I tried to reinstall the Drivers to my Inspiron 3437 and install the Dell Update to detect any Driver update</p>
<p>I tried most of the methods of this link&nbsp; (http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-network-connection-issues )</p>
<p>I had to run programs to view fluctuations: WiFi channel scanner and ComIntRepair</p>
<p>I turned off the Windows Update Interference</p>
<p>I changed the energy plans to reassure that my connectivity is fully directed to the router</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conclusion, I don´t know if my trouble is attributed to my device brand, or incompatibility of Windows 10 to my device modem.
</p>
<p>Help me please I can´t work perfectly wherever I go with my computer and I need Internet connectivity.

            <p>The last couple of weeks this has started happening to me.</p>
<p>The connection constantly fluctuates and no longer hits maximum for more than a second.</p>
<p>This laptop with the problem, sits a few feet from my desktop wireless win 10 system, that is working just fine like normal.</p>
<p>No hardware of any sort has changed lately.</p>
<p>Now on a large update, (i have a connection speed monitor) it should be maxed and staying there, but now it just fluctuates up and down constantly.</p>
<p>I've only noticed this in the last week.</p>

<p>Just wondering how people prefer to play ?</p>
<p>I've noticed, especially with the new Map packs, that a lot more Ratio Kill rates are high while Deaths are low suggesting a more tactical ( BC2 ) style of play</p>
<p>Do you Camp for the whole ten minutes ?</p>
<p>Do you play tactical - Camp and Move ?</p>
<p>Or do you run round like an eight year old Halo player ?</p>

<p>I try to finish with a positive k/d ratio by the end of the game, thats about it. I run and try to play quick. If I am on my game I play intuitively which would be my normal fast pace of game but I know when to slow down or turn back etc etc. When not on
 my game I just run into death. So far I have been doing well score wise. I could top the game off TDM maybe 6 out of 10 times and end up with only a few kills more than deaths. Thats just my style. The whole camping in one spot for me is not gaming so I don't
 do it, I like to move and look for kills at a risk. I think that why Objective games like BF suit me better. Because maps are not small and its not about just getting kills so I am able to push fast and carry out objectives, shock &amp; awe style.</p>

<p>Im a bit of a tactical player. Not really camp, but move around an are that I can cover well, then move to a new area after the other team knows what im doing. If my team is doing bad and i don't feel like getting pwnt hard, I'll camp one building or small
 area.</p>

 find out and I will do the same. &nbsp;This is so frustrating!</p>

<p>I'm having same issue and Xbox chat support kept transferring me all over the place then finally told me to contact Microsoft support and they worked on it remotely for over an hour before deciding that it was "a very complex issue that requires advance
 tools and troubleshooting" and wanted $99 for the "basic" or $149 for the "deluxe" version of support to fix it. &nbsp;I told them to forget it I just wouldn't be playing it anymore!</p>

<p>That is an outrageous (although not too surprising coming from Microsoft) response! &nbsp;This not a terribly isolated problem judging by the number of people with the same issue on the forum. Nor is it something any one of us has caused -- obviously it has a
 glitch/bug somewhere in either Xbox or Microsoft's programing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Foe what it is worth, I am using a fairly new (3-4 months) Acer computer which came with Windows 8.1 already installed. &nbsp;What are other people trying to play Solitaire on?

<p>Same problem. Running Windows 8.1 on an Acer PC. Has only happened since last round of Windows Updates a couple of days ago. Something similar happened several months ago and it took Microsoft weeks to sort it out. So don't hold your breath.</p>

<h2>            Black Screens and now, hal.dll and ntoskrnl.exe error from Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>I'm not exactly sure where to begin, But i've had a decent amount of computer issues lately. I build this PC in 2012 it lasted till about 2014 and i had to replace the Seagate 1TB hard drive cause it has bad sectors I Assumed that's why my PC was Black Screening,
 But now with a brand new Seagate 2TB and new graphics card i'm getting Random Black screens, It can happen while i'm playing a Graphically intensive game on Max graphics Or while it's on Low graphics. It can happen when i'm away from my PC(little to nothing
 running) or when i'm watching a Youtube video(On any browser) And just now For the first time since my new hard drive i got a Blue screen out of it. So i'm hoping this will help tell me something, Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's my specs:<br />
OS: Windows 7 x64bit<br />
Motherboard: ECS A880LM-M(bought in 2012)<br />

==================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
Tests &amp; Speculations:<br />
I'll try to go into this as far as i can think atm, But i've tried alot of stuff.<br />
<br />
When my PC Black screens my monitor turns off(Like i unpluged it from the PC, But it still has power) and my keyboard and mouse lights turn off, And if there was any audio playing it stops But my PC still has power to it, the fans still run and the lights are
 still on. No odd noises Or any power issues in the house(That i can tell). It also does it Completely random It can happen 15 times in 30mins-1hour or it can happen once every 2weeks-1month, This most recent time happened while i was installing new graphics
 drivers(Even wiped the current and new ones and installed older drivers, Still got the black screens and finally a blue screen while installing the drivers)<br />
<br />
I First thought it was black screening cause of me over powering my Onboard graphics card while playing games, So i bought a new graphics card and installed it. But then it started happening more often for awhile Untill i updated windows and installed the new
 graphics drivers then it slowed down for awhile<br />
i Kept going in circles thinking it was the graphics card, but even after unplugging it, it still happened. I also tried unplugging ALL fans,CD rom drives,Extra Hard drives, And removed 1 stick of ram at a time. No matter what it still happens. I also checked
 this new HardDrive for bad sectors and nothing comes up, i've cleaned the registery, Defragmented scanned for viruses(with 4 programs).<br />
And i constantly keep an eye on the temperatures And nothing out of the ordinary, compared to my old graphics card that idled at 160F and went up to 200-210F this one idles at around 80-90F and rarely hits 100F(My old graphics card was a flawed make from Nvidia)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i figure it's either my PSU,CPU, or Motherboard. i've been highly suspecting my PSU but i'm really not sure.</p>

            <p>To be able to troubleshoot what might be causing your system to crash, we need the dump files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In an ideal situation, more than one file would be needed to establish a pattern so if you do have more than one, please upload them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to the link below for steps to retrieve, zip and upload them to the file sharing site like onedrive, google's "dropbox, etc.</p>

When you are done, make the folder public and share the link here.</p>

 However i don't feel comfortable uninstalling Avast as it's the main thing that protects my computer(Kept my previous PC running for 4 years with no re-installs of windows, and i was able to upgrade to a new PC instead of trashing it.) Also i've experienced
 Avast to detect much more then MSE, so i've uninstalled MSE for now and i guess i'll just wait and see if i get any further problems, if i do i'll be sure to come back here!. Thanks again for your help.</p>

            <p>*sighs*.... It seems it's still happening, since it's started back up i've been trying to keep a record of what's been happening(As best as i can remember with as many possible meaningful details as possible), All of this is after i un-installed MSE etc,
 records As follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>06-16-15, June Tue:<br />
PC was frozen at 7:04AM, internet went out much earlier due to heavy rain.<br />
Rebooted PC and roughly 20-30mins later got a black screen, it froze on the window's icon before it could fully form.<br />
Rebooted again and it paused on the BIOS and said<br />
" a Hyper transport sync error occured on last boot. hit enter to continue" fine afterwards and updated Graphics drivers to latest, and updated&nbsp;windows with no probs.<br />
|^|<br />
Something odd: Windows Update after downloading and installing the updates before hitting "Restart Now:, it says&nbsp;"Most Recent check for updates: Today at 7:03AM" Wonder if that has something to do with it?<br />
<br />
06-17-15, June Wed:<br />
Around 9:00-10:30AM PC Black screened, restarted and nothing since.<br />
During: while i was sleeping, it was Idle with only Steam,skype and chrome open, but there were 9 DA tabs open(DA Cluster Adds).<br />
Checks: Windows update said nothing odd and had yesterday's date.<br />
<br />
06-17-15, June Wed at 11:20 PC black screened while watching youtube, rebooted, then at 06-18-15(Thur) 12:58AM(1Hour 38 Mins later) it froze(While idle, i probably left my PC at about 11:30/11:40).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rebooted and nothing so far. used TDSS Killer to do a full scan, it found Nothing. scanned with malware bytes nothing, scanned some important/more&nbsp;recent areas with avast, nothing.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------End</p>
<p>It seems like it's freezing more then it did before and it black screens about 2 times a day now. or 1 black screen and 1 freeze. the freezing HAS happened while i've been actively on my PC but lately it's while i'm away from it(And no one tampers with my
 PC...Physically atleast, but i doubt i have some kind of control spyware i'd notice if stuff was moved around) it almost seems like something causes a huge lag spike on my PC when it freezes like that it's instant and will last in-definite, left it for about
 12 hours and nothing. the mouse wont even move, No ctrl+alt+delete, Nothing. i'm wondering if anything else stood out on those files? also i've still got no extra minidumps and no blue screens since then. I could try making sure stuff is secure and turn off
 Avast's active protection or uninstall it for afew days and be careful of my browsing, maybe avast is sometimes scanning something big or encrypted on my PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also when i did this harddrive i almost cloned it from the last one but couldn't do a proper clone cause of the bad sectors in the previous hard drive so i did a Manuel one(Which i've done before with no probs) but i took a good amount of stuff from AppData
 this time, all of them including the "Local","LocalLow","Roaming" i left behind anything that seemed useless and just tried to keep the rest and combine it with the new stuff(Like trying to keep FireFox's history/bookmarks, and game saves and other stuff)
 but i of course didn't take ANYTHING from the windows folder. and aside from appdata i grabbed Everything. I wonder if that could have something to do with it? If it would tho.. how would i go about cleaning up AppData?.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And now that i think about it i didn't do a check disk yet, i'll do that tonight but i doubt it'll find anything cause Seagate's software found nothing. i'll let you know the outcome and in the mean time let me know if you can think of anything @__@ i swear
 this is driving me nuts!</p>

    <title>vista update problems following SP2 installation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miked123uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            vista update problems following SP2 installation</h2>
                    I have had to reinstall windows completely following a crash on my laptop which is about 4 or 5 years old - no problems from a hidden partition on my hard disk. SP1 installed ok (after a few minor problems). SP2 installed with no problems whatsoever.&nbsp;
 This has however left me with about 120 windows updates to do - Have tried twice now and all seem to get installed but then crashes on restart. On board repair option in hidden partition couldnt fix it but did take me to system restore which got me up again.
 I have restored to the previous restore point just after SP2 installation which now says I have never updated since SP2 was installed, with no updates installed showing. Can I manually do these 1 at a time (tried to do about 10 and that wouldn't restart) and
 if so in what order? If anybody can offer any advice it would be much appreciated<br />

            Apologies if as a novice I never posted enough info.<br />
Am trying to reinstall Vista Home premium from a hidden recovery partition on my laptop<br />
Always re installs ok but thats when the problems start. First off I let windows update go through all its process but no option to install SP1 was ever offered and SP1 never actually got installed<br />
Looking through your forums&nbsp; I then ran Microsoft fixit tool and then KB947821 update from a clean boot and after a couple of tries SP1 standalone eventually loaded properly. Ran SP2 standalone which then installed first time ok. So by then my system showed
 that I was running version SP2. However first attempt at windows updating therafter showed all updates installed ok and required restart which promptly crashed again.&nbsp; Managed to load up and do a system restore which took me back to SP2 showing as installed
 but also showing no updates ever being installed . Let windows update proceed buit same problem reoccured on restart.<br />
Reinstalled Windows Vista home premium again and crashes continue and now cannot even get SP1 to install. Windows Update shows SP1 having succesfully installed but progs and features doesnt show it so I cannot unistall it. Windows Update keeps trying to reinstall
 despite running fixit and&nbsp; KB947821 again <br />
Any help or further advice much appreciate.<br />
<br />

Please answer <em>each of the following diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, perferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. When did you purchase the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. When (exact date) did you do the last "reinstall" using the hidden Recovery partition?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite (if any)&nbsp;and
<em>when (approx. date) does your current subscription </em>(if any) <em>expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>
        </p>

            1. Purchased c2007<br />
2. Last Windows install from partition 19th September 2013<br />
3. Knowing of the problems I never installed any security suite until after Windows had finished updating - though I did make sure Windows firewall was on and then I later installed AVG Internet Security 2014 (free trial for 30 days) so my grandson at least
 could "play" with it<br />
4. No other security software to my knowledge was on the laptop preinstalled (or at least none offered on start up which I imagine would have done if it had been there)<br />
Thanks for your help and time<br />

<p><br />
A1. Even with the Windows Firewall enabled, a computer should <em>not</em> be connected to the internet for extended periods (i.e., more than a minute or two) without a functional, anti-virus application installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that puts you between the proverbial rock and hard space since most anti-virus applications &amp; security suites
<em>require</em> Vista SP2&nbsp;- <em>including AVG Internet Security 2014</em> although
<a href="http://www.avg.com/us-en/internet-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this&nbsp;page</a> doesn't specifically state that.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tip: If the AVG free-trial is still installed, chances are it's not working properly!</li></ul>
<p>However, <strong>Microsoft Security Essentials</strong> (MSE; free!) <em>can</em> be installed on a Vista&nbsp;Gold (i.e., no Service&nbsp;Packs) computer:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security-essentials-download</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A2. Chances are a Norton or a McAfee free-trial <em>was </em>preinstalled on the computer when you bought it. If so, the free-trialware would be installed again every time you reinstall Vista via the Recovery partition. If such is the case, you must (a)
 uninstall free-trialware [if listed in <strong>Programs and Features</strong>] AND THEN (b) download/run the
<strong>Norton Removal Tool</strong> [1]&nbsp;or the&nbsp;<strong>McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool</strong> [2] &amp; reboot (c) BEFORE you install an anti-virus application (e.g., MSE)&nbsp;<em>AND BEFORE</em>&nbsp;you install any Windows Updates (including Service Packs &amp; Internet
 Explorer upgrades).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So your best bet at this point is to do yet another clean install then proceed per the above.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note 1: <strong>Support for Vista Gold (no Service Packs) ended on Tuesday, 13 April
<em>2010</em> and support for Vista Service Pack 1 (SP1) ended on Tuesday, 12 July 2011.</strong> Computers still running Vista Gold "will no longer receive software updates [i.e., updates released on &amp; after 22 April 2010 so now the computer's missing over
 three years' worth of critical security updates!] from Windows Update" until SP1&nbsp;and then&nbsp;SP2 have been installed (which will require that several Prerequisite Updates for each Service Pack be installed first).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note 2: <strong>The computer should NOT be connected to the internet <em>or any local networks</em> (i.e., other computers) in its current state. All of your personal data (e.g., online banking &amp; credit-card passwords) should be considered at-risk, if not
 already compromised. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need additional assistance with the clean install, please begin <em>your own new thread
</em>in this forum &amp; ask for guidance: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system">
<font color="#0072c6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-system</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If these procedures are outside of your technical "comfort zone" - and there is no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the computer to a local, reputable and
<em>independent</em> (i.e., not a "BigBoxStore" or the Geek Squad!) computer repair shop &amp; let them do the work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS: Do NOT restore <em>any</em> data backups to the hard-drive until you've scanned the data with at least two (2) reputable online scanners (e.g., ESET; Kaspersky; BitDefender).</p>

Method 3: Uninstall Windows Vista service pack from a Command Prompt
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this table</span><span>Expand this table</span></div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Note</b></td>
<td>If you have used the Disk Cleanup Wizard, it may have removed some temporary installation files which are needed to uninstall the Windows Vista service pack. If this is the case, this method may not work for you and you should go to method 2.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><br />
This section is intended for advanced users. Use this method if you are running the prerelease version of a Windows Vista service pack, or if you cannot see the uninstall option for a Windows Vista service pack listed in the
<strong>Program and Features</strong> window. If you cannot see the uninstall option for the Windows Vista service pack, you may still be able to uninstall the service pack at a command prompt. To do this, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Open an elevated Command Prompt window. To do this, click <strong>
Start</strong>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this image</span><span>Expand this image</span></div>
, type <span>command</span> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, right-click
<strong>CommandPrompt</strong>, and then click <strong>
Run as administrator</strong>. </li><li>Run the following command, as appropriate for the version of the Windows Vista service that you want to uninstall:
<ul>
<li>For Windows Vista Service Pack 1: <b>
<div>C:\temp\Windows6.0-KB936330-X86.exe /x:C:\temp</div>
</b>
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this table</span><span>Expand this table</span></div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Note</b></td>
<td>This command assumes that the Windows6.0-KB936330.exe folder is in the C:\Temp folder</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li><li>For Windows Vista Service Pack 2: <b>
<div>C:\temp\Windows6.0-KB948465-<i>NNN</i>.exe /x:C:\temp</div>
</b>In this command, <i>NNN</i> represents x86, x64, or IA-64.
<div>
<div><span>Collapse this table</span><span>Expand this table</span></div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Note</b></td>
<td>This command assumes that the Windows6.0-KB948465-X86.exe folder is in the C:\Temp folder.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</li></ul>
</li><li>You have to create a sandbox environment before you can continue to step 4. This helps you safely run an untrusted program. To create a sandbox, type
<span>md <var><i>sandbox</i></var></span>. </li><li>To remove the Windows Vista service pack, type, or copy and paste the following command, as appropriate for the version of the Windows Vista service that you want to uninstall::
<ul>
<li>For Windows Vista Service Pack 1<b>
<div>start /w pkgmgr.exe /m:c:\temp\Windows6.0-KB936330-X86.cab /up /s:sandbox</div>
</b></li><li>For Windows Vista Service Pack 2 <b>
<div>start /w pkgmgr.exe /m:c:\temp\Windows6.0-KB948465-NNN.cab /up /s:sandbox.</div>
</b>In this command, <i>NNN</i> represents x86, x64, or IA-64.</li></ul>
</li><li>After Pkgmgr.exe finishes, you are prompted to restart the computer to complete the uninstall process.</li></ol>
<p>If these steps successfully uninstall the Windows Vista service pack, and this resolves the issue, you are finished. If these steps do not uninstall the Windows Vista service pack, or if these steps uninstall the service pack but do not resolve your issue,
 you will have to restore the system to a previous state. To do this, go to method 3.</p>

<div><strong>Standard Hardware Troubleshooting</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</font>
<div>
<div>First lets test what hardware we can. Hardware faults can appear as many software faults, therefore we need to test hardware first..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Please do the following in order. Memory faults can cause disk corruption, disk faults can cause disk corruption. Disk corruption causes corrupted files (which SFC may be able to fix). If you get an hardware error stop and post back.
<strong>Do not run chkdsk with faulty memory</strong>.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Memory Diagnostic</strong></div>
<div>If you haven't run a memory diagnostic then please do so. Click <em>Start</em> -
<em>Control Panel</em> - choose <em>Classic View</em> in left hand pane - choose <em>
Administrative Tools</em> -&nbsp; then<em>&nbsp;Memory Diagnostics Tool</em>.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>S.M.A.R.T</strong></div>
<div><em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;(or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Disk drives in Windows monitor themselves for impending failure.&nbsp;The feature is&nbsp;called S.M.A.R.T. It will detect impending&nbsp;failure&nbsp;30% of the time.&nbsp;In an elevated command prompt type (it's one line)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>wmic /namespace:\\root\wmi PATH MSStorageDriver_FailurePredictStatus get active,predictfailure,reason /format:List</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it's on Active will be true, if not on turn it on in the computer's BIOS.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Predict Failure should be False if everything's ok.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In Vista and later if SMART predicts failure Windows prompts the user to run Backup.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><strong>Run Chkdsk</strong></div>
<div>In <em>Computer</em> right click all your drives and choose <em>Properties</em>, then

<div><font><strong>Dump Files</strong></font></div>
<div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Dump files are files containing the state of the machine when it crashed. We can analyse the file to identify the driver (or program) causing the crash. See the last section on how to get them analysed by a volunteer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Analyse Dump Files</strong></div>
<div>If you want to analyse your own dump files.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You need to start Explorer as Administrator to access the files in <strong>C:\windows\Minidump</strong>. Right click Explorer and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>.</div>
<div><br />
Download and install Debugging Tools for Windows<br />
<div><font color="#0072c6">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/hh852363</font><br />
<div>Install theWindows SDK but just choose the debugging tools.<br />
<br />
Create a folder called <strong>Symbols</strong> in C:\<br />
<br />
Start <em>Windbg</em>. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Symbol File Path</em> and enter</div>
<div><br />
<em>srv*C:\symbols*http://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Close and reopen WinDbg. <em>File</em> menu - <em>Open Crash Dump</em><br />
<br />
This will analyse the crash dump. You need to close and reopen WinDbg for each dump file analysed. Because you are downloading symbols from the internet WinDbg will appear to be doing nothing. But it's downloading. Be patient.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You are looking for a driver or system library that the crash occurred in at the end of the listing. Find the file, right click then
<em>Properties</em> - <em>Details</em> tab. If it shows a driver you'll need to update the driver identified. Most drivers are in c:\windows\system32\drivers.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Search the Drive for a File.</strong></div>
<div>
<div>Click <em>Start - All Programs - Accessories</em> - Right click <em>Command Prompt</em> and choose
<em>Run As Administrator</em>. Type&nbsp;replacing <em><strong>drivername.sys </strong>
</em>with the name of the file being searched (or copy and paste by right clicking in the Command Prompt window and choosing
<em>Paste</em>).</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>dir c:\<strong>drivername.sys</strong> /a /s</em></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it shows a system file see if you can get a program from analyze -v.<br />
<br />
Type in theWinDbg command prompt</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div><em>!analyze -v</em></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-v stands for Verbose and if&nbsp;the crash was originated by a program, as opposed to hardware or a driver,&nbsp;it will appear in the middle of the listing.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>eg</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><font>PROCESS_NAME:&nbsp; java.exe</font></div>
<div><font>IMAGE_NAME:&nbsp; ntkrnlmp.exe</font></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>PROCESS_NAME only appears in the analyze -v output and only if a program originated the call that faulted.<br />
<div>

    <title>recovering profile help - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan5794  say:</h3>
<h2>            recovering profile help</h2>
                    
<p>I need some help on what to do here. My brother lost the memory card his profile was stored on, so the only way to get it back would be to recover it. Only problem is when i searched about recovering profiles every scenario was when the profile was able
 to be physically deleted then recovered. Here though there will technically be 2 profiles in existence, will this matter at all?</p>

            My computer is my fax.&nbsp; And yes, I was able to send faxes with jpg and pdf attachments easily before I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; The problem has nothing to do with the equipment, but the fact that I upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; I have experienced several problems
 with drivers and incompatibilities with other apps that have had to be dealt with&nbsp;because of the upgrade.&nbsp; Everything worked very well until I upgraded.&nbsp;

            The software is Windows Fax and Scan.&nbsp; My Dell computer is my "fax machine".&nbsp; That is the reason I am using Windows Fax and Scan.&nbsp; I don't need a stand alone fax machine with that software (until now).&nbsp; I am not very computer/hardware literate, so if you
 can specify what you mean by hardware, I might be able to better describe my setup.&nbsp; Thank you for responding.

            <p>The modem is internal.&nbsp; I have a Dell OptiPlex 7010- can't access the model number right now.&nbsp; To send a fax, I open the app by clicking the icon on the task bar.&nbsp; When the app opens, I click "new fax".&nbsp; The cover page comes up and I select a contact.&nbsp; I
 type my message and then attach the file.&nbsp; This message appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>"Windows can’t fax or preview the attached file type.&nbsp; Try installing a program that allows you to print .tif files, save the attached file as a .tif file, and then try again."</span></p>

 before I upgraded.&nbsp; Windows 10 seems to be the problem here, not my equipment.</p>

            Dang!&nbsp; It didn't work.&nbsp; Windows Fax and Scan does not recognize my scanner, although when I troubleshoot it, I get a message that says it is working properly.&nbsp; I tried to add a device to add my scanner, but no luck there either.&nbsp; I am sad to say I was
 forced to use a stand alone fax machine that belongs to another company down the hall.&nbsp; The frustration builds.....

<h2>            Windows 10 Ping Peaks &#40;Spikes&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since 3-4 months i have a problem with my wifi connection but since 3 weeks it got worse. Im getting every 3-5 minutes some really high pink peaks from 5000ms. After 3 sec. Everything is fine again for another 3-5 minutes. I figured out that the problem
 has to be windows 10. I tried 2 windows 10 systems over wifi with different wifi cards and i got the same results every time. But then i tried a windows 7 system and it worked fine, no ping peaks (spikes) at all. A stable connection. I tried almost every fix
 that is out there in the internet but nothing worked for me. I double checked the router and everything elese…</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone had the same problem but found a fix for it… Its making me crazy..</p>

            <p>Try using your Windows Search several times (even if it doesn't respond). Just click the search bar and try typing. Do it a few times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to your <strong>Administrative Tools -&gt; Even Viewer -&gt; Windows Logs -&gt; Applications.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see a sequence of red error marks for error like "<strong>Event 1000, Application Error", "</strong><strong>Event 5973, Apps"</strong>?
</p>
<p>

            <p>I've done this before and doing it again now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixed Cortana once a couple of days ago, now fixing it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously this is really sub-optimal. &nbsp;I can easily do without Cortana but the search box is pretty much vital. &nbsp;Why would the SearchUI crash so frequently on a machine which is rock-solid and used Windows 8 for many months with no problems at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run a Google/Bing search, 1000s of people are experiencing the problem of Cortana and/or the search box crashing or stopping, is there any news on this fairly common problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not going to "reinstall Windows" to solve the problem - that's not a solution is it? &nbsp;I'm a developer, I can't be spending hours fiddling around trying to fix a basic feature which is failing in the O/S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do Microsoft have a handle on what is causing the problem and any eta on when it will be fixed?</p>

            <p>I also have this problem. Several times a day, Cortana stops working, and what I am doing is to kill the process. It automatically restarts and works again...until it later fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, it doesn't make sense to reinstal Win 10 (it was a real pain!), nor to create new accounts. Cortana is the main feature of Win 10 and it has to work properly !!! I've been googling/binging and there are (as mentioned by IanB) 1000s of people with
 this problem !!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying the repair image + sfc...doubt it'll work (and its been only 2 days with Win 10 to have to repair image ??) Will post result.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the comments....I hope someone will come up with a fix that is really a fix.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>To add to my issue, I also discovered at the same time I became unable to print....to anything.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>What I did was attempt a restore to an earlier point.&nbsp; In this case a point prior to the most recent Microsoft update.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I got a message that the attempt was not successful (now this is a problem).&nbsp; It said that one file was unable to access.&nbsp; It said this failure to access this particular file might have been caused by a anti-virus software.&nbsp; It might be correct.</p>
<p>Anyway...after this process I am now for now able to use search and Cortana.&nbsp; I am also able to print.&nbsp;
<br />
But... I am not willing to do anymore Windows 10 updates...unless one of the technicians here can provide some input on what might be the issue to fix these (this) issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts???? Anyone?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>I've done as instructed, but the "Startup repair" has failed.</p>
<p>SrtTrail.txt says all fine, except that the versión of the OS is not compatible with the Startup Repair...</p>
<p>very odd indeed (and a bit frightening!).</p>

            Hi WIly, below is the advice from Lenovo Support:
<br />
<br />Press Windows + X
<br />Select Device Manager
<br />
<br />Find the Touch screen driver under Mice and Other Pointing Devices - USB Touchscreen Controller(A111) 
<br />
<br />You're going to uninstall this and check the box that says "Delete the driver software for this device". Restart your computer.
<br />
<br />If the feature is still not back, open Device Manager -&gt; Human Interface Devices. Right-click HID compliant touch screen, then uninstall. When you restart the PC, it will reinstall.
<br />
<br />Or if you cannot locate any USB Touchscreen Controller(A111), please try to look for an option called "USB Root Hub (xHCI)" under USB Controllers or Universal Serial Bus. If it was labeled as disabled (a little faded or lighter shade of gray that means it is disabled). 
<br />
<br />Right-click on it then select enable. That may bring the touchscreen back.

            Hi, christineblackburn
<br />
<br />You checked that your computer is recognizing the scanner and if so, you have to download the updated drivers from it, it may be that your other computer if it has updated that's why it recognizes the scanner

            Hi Christine.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is the printer/scanner so old that it needs to use the Windows utility which is mainly for scanners that don't have modern software that handles this?  
<br />
<br />Go to the Printer's Support Downloads web page to download and install the latest full software package.  Keep the printer USB cable unplugged until prompted to plug it in.  
<br />
<br />If after installing the latest driver it doesn't open the printer's own scan utility then try again with Windows Fax and Scan as it normally only needs a basic driver to work.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.  
<br />

<p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a painful situation with an old Cannon PIXMA MX436 multifunctional device. I installed it so many times and Windows does not seem to pick-up the right version (picks up MX430). I have an installation CD which I cannot use on my new laptop as I have
 no CD rom.&nbsp; The scanner app in Windows 10&nbsp; used to work.</p>
<p>I don't know what happened this week (maybe a Windows update) but now the Scan app does not find my scanner, all of a sudden!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to contact Microsoft but they want more money to give me just an indication of what could possibly be wrong! Some service! I feel they do it on purpose, come up with new versions and updates to mess up our systems and ask us to pay more and more
 for crappy solutions. Seriously considering Apple at this stage....</p>

 This is extremely annoying. I work in an office and cannot have the new chat sound turned on all the time. Please advise.&nbsp;

            I don't get a notification bubble when anyone texts me, kind of makes the whole thing pointless. Because sometimes Skype doesn't even update conversations until I open it.

<p>What do you mean "this option is not available for the new version of Skype" ?? The whole point is that i turn on my mobile screen and see if i have (a) new message(s) on Skype without having to open the app! I have already missed chats because of it, as
 I too, can't have the app open all the time. Before this new (horrible) update, things worked perfectly well. Someone skyped me, i'd see the tile (which is completely gone now) showing me i have a new message. Honestly, this is one of the key requirements
 of a chat app and if this problem doesn't get solved, i will have to start looking for other options.</p>

    <title>Refund refused - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Refund refused</h2>
                    <p>Good day. I hope everyone is having a great holiday. I am writing mostly to vent before i am forced to deal with a ridiculous situation that seems to be common with Microsoft and many big companies. So i am ranting here before i pick up the phone and start
 **** out some poor soul in India.</p>
<p>&nbsp; My son accidentally bought the 30th Anniversary Edition to Street Fighter instead of the newest version from a Christmas gift card. In its self now a big deal. As a single parent with split custody i only have him for a set amount of time. So i followed
 the instructions given for a refund to buy the newest version of the game. After 4 days of waiting (they are supposed to respond in 72 hours, 3 days) it was turned down for no refund because it did not comply with Microsoft rules.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; So here is the issue Im having. I want to buy a game from the same creater, same company, same system, same price, so everyone gets exactly the same money but my son gets the game he wants not some antiquated old game. Now instead of me and my son enjoying
 a gift from my parents we are left with him having nothing and me upset. On top of this my son will be leaving for a week before I get this settled. So it has zero value as a gift right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Now he has been ok with it. Has not complained or given me a hard time about it other than asking if we have heard back yet. He knows i am on a fixed income and so does not push the issue. So in my eyes he has handled the situation beautifuly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; So to wrap this up I am tired of getting screwed by big companies because their customers mean nothing to them. I will end up getting the money and tge game back in the end but will now have to spend hours on the phone fighting for something that should
 be a simple fix. But because Microsoft is counting on people just giving up the fight and settling with being screwed they treat their customers like this. This is why i hate dealing with this company.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Sigh</p>

            Hello!<br />
<br />
It's definitely a tough situation, though I'm not sure how it would be considered "being screwed" by a company.&nbsp; A digital purchase for media is similar to physically buying media in a store.&nbsp; If you buy a CD, Movie, or game, open it, then use it, and realize
 you purchased the wrong one, usually you can only exchange it for the exact same product.&nbsp; This is the reasons there's verification screens to confirm it's the correct product prior to purchase for digital orders.&nbsp; You can submit a request for a digital refund,
 which is making an exception to the standard refund policy. Often these requests are approved assuming the game hasn't been played much, was recently purchased, etc.

            Once a refund has been refused there is nothing more that can be done. It would be a wate of time phoning support as they do not handle refunds they are managed by the refund team who only use the refund form you have already filled in and has been refused.<br />
<br />
In my experience you would only be refused a refund if you have played the game longer than the 2 hours permited or you have had a previous refund in the last 12 months&nbsp;

            Some publishers do no support digital returns, it's not entirely up to Microsoft in this case. Capcom may not allow refunds on digital content.

            Thank you. But we didnt play at all. He missed the small print that the game was only good for xbox360 not the xbox one. So to me a game that has not even been played and deleted should be able to do something.

                    <p>I have recently upgraded my Packard Bell EasyNote TS laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 8 Pro.</p>
<p>It has been working perfect up until last week, when i power on and it reaches the start menu, the on screen volume indicator shows the volume automatically reduce down to 0%.&nbsp; When I increase it with the onboard volume key, it reduces back down to 0%.&nbsp;
 This happens every now and then, not constantly though.</p>
<p>I hope it is not a problem with the laptop itself as I just bought is mid December 2012.</p>
<p>Please help urgently as this get very frustrating especially when listening to something on th laptop or working and the OSD pops up distracting the screen.</p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a7f41e1b-ac78-4f79-af68-fbb925824837" title="LarrySnyder1">
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting an error whenever you try to type a message or it is not responding at all?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried reinstalling the Skype application? If not, please reinstall the app first to make sure you have the latest version installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know which version number of Skype application is currently installed so I can provide you further troubleshooting steps if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward for your response.</p>

            No error message. my cursor shows being in the text field but when I type a letter nothing at all appears. My version I believe is the latest and I feel this occurred after a recent update that with Skype I always allow. Version 12.13.257.0. I have considered
 uninstalling and reinstalling but wanted some feedback before going that route.

<p>That's the 1st time I've heard of this issue myself. Maybe if you reset Skype.</p>
<p>Right Click Start and go to Apps and Features. Scroll down to SKype and click to highlight. Click the Advanced link and then the Reset button. You will need to relaunch SKype and type in your username and password so be sure you know it first.</p>

<p>Have a look at the option above where you type text. lets make sure you're trying to send messages via Skype to Skype and not SMS.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/167cae21-7b88-483e-84a2-7d0fa4a08447" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/167cae21-7b88-483e-84a2-7d0fa4a08447" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, make sure the contact you're trying to message is a Skype Contact and not something else in your contact list. Right click on their name over on the left and choose View Profile. Skype users have a special Skype line in them.</p>

            Yeah, I just included Echo as an example profile with a Skype line. I don't have to edit that one for privacy. I'll keep thinking on your issue. But do check one of your own skype contacts that you can't message to see if the profile has the Skype section.

            They are the contacts i have always had. This issue came up out of the blue. I might have thought the uninstall/reinstall would have done it. But a point of note upon reinstalling I didn't have to enter a user name or password making me wonder about that
 process.

            Yes, uninstalling/reinstalling does nothing to the local database the Skype app uses. Only a Reset of the app deletes this. But the Reset was my 1st recommendation and I guess that didn't help.

    <title>Xbox One with A&#47;V receiver &#63;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chefeagles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One with A&#47;V receiver &#63;s</h2>
                    
<p>I have my DIRECTV HDMI out&nbsp;plugged into the Xbox&nbsp;One&nbsp;then Xbox HDMI out to a Sony A/V receiver and then HDMI out from receiver to my TV.</p>
<p>The thing is now I can not control my audio setting with my A/V receiver. The Sony receiver has all kinds of different setting for movies, music and games and different sound settings like concert and stereo and different things like that.</p>
<p>The problem is now with Xbox one I try to change the settings on the A/V receiver and the receiver says those settings are "Not used". Regardless if I'm playing Xbox or witching TV.&nbsp;So basically I can not control how my stereo sounds. It seems the xbox one
 is over riding this. So everything sounds the same when I want movies to sound one way music another and Xbox games yet another way. Just like I could do with&nbsp;my 360 simply be plugged into the A/V receiver.</p>
<p>So is anyone else also having this problem or maybe know a way to fix it besides not running Directv through the xbox?</p>

<p>Even though I have Cinema system that supports all formats. I still only rout my Xbox One Audio through it via Optical (DTS). the actual Xbox One goes straight to my HDTVs HDMI. I find that rout far better for my setup.</p>

<p>I have a sony av receiver conected to my xbox one and it works fine, the xbox hdmi out is connected to my game hdmi input in the back of the receiver and the hdmi out of the receiver to my tv. I went in the xbox sound settings and changed the settings to
 the correct ones, i dont know what the directtv hdmi is that you mention, i just have the leads connected that i have said above, i have had some issues with my equipment fitted in the past because of poor quality leads, you could try swapping them around

 sounds again lol..</p>

<p>I don't have the problems that you have, I just have the problem that my TV overrides the xbox ones signal and my receiver goes to TV sound instead of the xbox. It is very annoying. &nbsp;Going through HDMI does not give me DTS sound to the receiver because the
 xbox is sending a completely uncompressed signal (PCM) to the receiver. Then I can manipulate the signal how I want to on the receiver.</p>

<p>What irritates me is that turning on the console does not auto-switch INPUT on the AV. Of course I only knew that such a thing was possible after getting Apple TV and that does send a signal through the HDMI to do that. Game on Microsoft!</p>

 and see what that finds ( if anything ).</p>
