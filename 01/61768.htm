<h2>            Screen goes black on Lenovo Flex 3 Laptop</h2>
                    <p>My computer recently has been having an issue where if I walk away from the computer for a few minutes and come back, the screen is black but the computer is still on as if it is on sleep mode. The problem is that I have turned off the in the power saving
 option in my settings so that it does not. No buttons on my keyboard or the mouse do anything to wake it up. Is this an issue relating to the recent Windows 10 update or might this be a manufacturing problem. Please, I am at my wits end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. Also, no matter if I have it plugged into the charger or its on the battery, it does it.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Change the windows installer service startup type to manual.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Type <strong>SERVICES.MSC</strong> in the search box.</span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></li><li><span>Scroll down to the service called <strong>Windows Installer</strong>. </span>
</li><li><span>The startup type should be <strong>MANUAL</strong> and the service should not be started. If this is so, then that is not the problem. But, if the service
<span>is started</span> do next steps.</span></li><li><span>Stop the Installer Service. Then set the startup type for it to <strong>
DISABLED</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Reboot your system.</span></li><li><span>Go back into Services and set the startup type to <strong>MANUAL</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></li></ul>
<p><span>If the issue still persist, try method 2 and method 3.</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: I suggest you to empty InProgress Registry Key.</span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Warning: </span></strong><span>You should only edit these registry entries if you really know what you're doing. Back up your hard disk first. We take no responsibility for any damage this may cause.</span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Check the following registry key:</span><strong> <span><span>&nbsp;</span>HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\InProgress</span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>and clean any entries that you find.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Empty PendingFileRenameOperations Registry Key</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Check the following registry key: </span></span><strong><span><span>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\PendingFileRenameOperations
</span></span></strong><span><span>and clean any entries that you find.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps in resolving the issue. If the issue persists, do get back to us. We will be happy to assist you.

            Windows 10 will notify with different 3rd party applications... especially if you added your Gmail to windows 10.
<br />You can turn these notifications off.
<br />Go to start - settings - system - notifications and actions.
<br />Turn off Get notifications from apps and other senders.

<p>After doing some searches online find out this was a "feature added to google chrome" on win10, a deal with microsoft and google.</p>
<p>Conservative links in the notifications list only close the&nbsp;&nbsp;notifications with no results,; pure way to silence the right and conservative view.</p>

<p>So one pc it shows google notifications for 3 seconds then vanishes&nbsp; before I can even click it, doesn't matter what the notification timer is set too.</p>
<p>Another pc, 20 notifications stay put, but clicking on them does nothing, links or message just removes the notification with&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing opening.</p>
<p>I have my default browser already open, so launching it is not an issue.</p>
<p>Another microsoft and google partnership not fully tested .</p>

Windows Live Movie Maker stops recording after an hour and a pop up asks you to save the video and record again. There's a more info link that points to a search of "c945002c", but the search doesn't find anything. (I don't have the exact error message, and
 it will take me an hour to repro. Will add)<br />
<br />
I need to record 4-8 hours of video without someone pressing record every hour. Is there a way of changing the maximum record time?<br />
In Windows Movie Maker (XP), you had the ability to adjust video quality and the maximum file size so you could change the maximum record time. Is this functionality still around somewhere?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />

            Hi <span>InfiniteGame, <br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Windows Live Global Escalations Team. Regarding your concern, the application would only record the first 60 minutes and so far this is by design. As for increasing the limit, I am currently consulting this&nbsp;matter with the product experts
 whether this can be adjusted or not. I'll update this post as soon as I receive a word from them about this issue.<br />
<br />
Your patience is highly appreciated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards!</span>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Hello everyone. I have a related question. I was working with a client who was recording
 something remotely using Windows Live Movie Maker and an external webcam. She hit the one-hour mark and received the prompt "Recording has stopped because the maximum time for recording video has been reached. Save your recorded video to continue." Unfortunately,
 instead of clicking "Close," she closed the pop-up by clicking the X in the upper right-hand corner. Is there any way to recover what we recorded during that time?

            <p>In Romania, at final high-school exams, the surveillance is done by using Windows LifeCam HD-3000 systems on Windows 8.</p>
<p>Surveillance means recording the full exam, that is some 6 hours.</p>
<p>The instructions are to use for recording Microsoft Live Movie Maker and to save at the end of the day, on each computer separately, the recorded file on one or some DVD-s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunatelly, the Windows 8 driver for LifeCam HD-3000 has no more the previously existing record mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recording through Microsoft Live Movie maker brings up this "Înregistrarea s-a oprit, deoarece s-a atins limita maximă de timp pentru înregistrare" message (The recording stopped, because it has reached the maximum time limit for recording"</p>
<p>Recorded data shows that this limit is set to 60 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to record the full exam time using Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000, with the Windows 8 driver and Windows Live Movie Maker?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It must be mentioned that last year this issue was not present, the previous driver for the same MS LifeCam HD-3000 had the option of unlimited recording</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting here.&nbsp;I understand that you also want to record videos more than 1 hour using Movie Maker. Currently, the maximum record time is still 60 minutes as what John Ray_M mentioned above. What you can do for now is to use a third-party program
 that has an option for unlimited recording.</p>

            Hi Raj.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />So the prompt you're getting is User Account Control prompt for the Admin password in order to make any changes, and/or the Sign IN prompt for Admin account?  Who is the Admin on the PC, you?  
<br />
<br />You really have to have an Admin acccount to have any account on the PC.  Did you have one that disappeared, or did this one lose it's Admin status?  
<br />
<br />Try this:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this: <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10#comment-334148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> 
<br />
<br />It may be necessary If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this.  If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account.  If not try another of these methods: <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            That's why I gave you the exact steps how to create and boot the Windows 10 installation media to access it's Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin Account, from which you can assign Admin rights in netwplwiz, or create a new Admin account to replace yours which has likely corrupted.  
<br />
<br />You can ALWAYS boot media.  In perhaps 5000 times I've been told in forums that someone couldn't boot media, there's not a single one who worked with me who didn't get it booted.  Start by following the precise steps I gave.  Report back any failure behavior or errors.

<p>Dear Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your feedback, however see my reply in bold....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the prompt you're getting is User Account Control prompt for the Admin password in order to make any changes, and/or the Sign IN prompt for Admin account? Who is the Admin on the PC, you?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Yes its my personal PC and i am the only user.</strong><br />
<br />
You really have to have an Admin acccount to have any account on the PC. Did you have one that disappeared, or did this one lose it's Admin status?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>I never added any admin username to my PC and it all happened due to the recent update from Microsoft on Windows 10.</strong><br />
<br />
Try this:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>I have already tried this, however the netplwiz option is not working..</strong><br />
<br />
Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab. click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Its not coming actually<br />
<br />
If that doesn't help then try this: https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>I can't access System Recovery Options too</strong><br />
<br />
If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works: http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Can't access this site</strong><br />
<br />
Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Don't have the CD for windows 10, as got upgraded online.</strong><br />
<br />
If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Startup Options, first try System Restore to a point before this. If that fails then choose Command Prompt to follow the step above to access Built-in Admin Account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>The boot system was already normal</strong><br />
<br />
Sign into Hidden Admin account, see if you can use netplwiz now to elevate the account. If not try another of these methods: https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not then set up a new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>As told earlier the option Family &amp; other people is not showing in Accounts column in settings.</strong><br />
<br />
Let me know then......</p>

            Try another browser to access the link you couldn't.  I can access it.   
<br />
<br />I gave you the precise steps to create the bootable media,  and then I reminded you about that in my last post!  Hello?
<br />
<br />Then I gave you exactly how to boot that media and access the needed repairs from outside of Windows, but for some reason you still think I'm referring to working within Windows.  I am not.  I am showing you how to make and boot media, do the same repairs from Repair Mode.

    <title>Big problem related to child accounts and online gaming, pls help. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nasssss001  say:</h3>
<h2>            Big problem related to child accounts and online gaming, pls help.</h2>
                    So, first of all, I bought an Xbox One X bundle and made an account with my real DOB, and played some offline games, while I was trying to understand why online wouldn't work on games like FIFA where it wouldn't even let me connect to the EA Servers. When
 I understood that the problem was the child account I made another one with a fake DOB and tried to go online, and it worked.<br />
Now, I'm wondering if there's a way to change my first account from child to adult (I already tried to change the DOB on the "My Account" section and tried to put billing information on it, and I still can't play online with it), I can't just use the new adult
 one because I would lose saves from a couple of games I already played, and more importantly while I'm trying to find solutions to this problem, the Xbox Live reedemable subscription is still active but useless.<br />
<br />
And to make it even worse I can't even transfer game saves between 2 accounts, from what I found.

<p>It's not possible to change the age of an Xbox account once it has been created. So until the age of the account reaches 18, you won't be able to promote it to an adult account.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, just to note, that restriction is from EA themselves. You should still be able to play online with other games through the child account.</p>

<p>Unluckily it's not only from EA, I previously tried other games too ("The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel" for example) to check if the problem was only because of EA restrictions, but it wasn't.</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />This generally happens when sound is set to 5.1 or stereo incorrectly and ported through Stereo output, the missing channels containing the audio for other objects is lost 
<br />
<br />Please check the in-game audio settings to make sure sound is set correctly or your setup (Stereo, 5.1 . . etc.)
<br />
<br />If the issue is not in the game, then please check Windows 10 sound output to make sure that is also set correctly . . .

<h2>            My Windows 10 does not detect microphone plugged in, Lenovo</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have new Lenovo P51 with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see this as an ongoing issue with many other users and it seems like Microsoft bug , when you plug your headset in the jack, windows never detects that headset in recording or playback devices, though it works fine for sound but not for Microphone. My
 recording level stays quiet low in connected headset and other person cannot hear well. I have tried with different headets, Sony, Beats and skull candy but same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need a fix from Microsoft or if the community has an answer since this is really bothersome. Lenovo tested my sound-card and verified everything is good and have referred me to Windows Support!.</p>
<p>

            Hi Sal.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try these fixes next:  
<br /><a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br /><a href="https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recognize-headphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsreport.com/windows-10-wont-recog...</a>
<br />
<br />Some report that what worked is turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt;  Change Settings Currently Unavailable &gt; uncheck the box for Fast Startup, Save Settings.  Restart and then disable Hibernate file to clear it, restart PC again and enable Hibernate again:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hibernate-mode-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/enable-hiberna...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a> 
<br />
<br />You might also be able to System Restore back to a point where this worked:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not know how to do this...you know, start a new thread ... that sort of thing. So, I apologize from the bottom of my heart. I do so hate just jumping into the middle of someone else's issue. So, again, I am, so, very, very sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just have an issue and I don't know how to address it. Someone keeps getting "permission" to get "remote access" to my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a pretty good idea of what is going on however, I cannot discuss it in an "open forum".&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, can you kindly tell me what didlogical is? Obviously, I found it while the Credential Manager in the Control Manager.&nbsp; There have been a lot of very strange things going on there. I am presently in a law suit with a major corporation. This
 is only the beginning.</p>
<p>

            The registry tool is uniblue's Registry Booster and the ammount of errors on a new system was quite large and therefore i ignored using it to fix anything at the time. having not used it for a long time i wondered if things had changed and it showed about
 450 or so errors. Having worked in IT but retired now I wondered what sort of errors these were. Hence the above question. Did you actually read what was put. It doesnt matter what registry tool you use if the registry entry says the help file is at some location
 and when you check it, it isn't it's a couple of directories away. so where should these files belong. Did they get changed at sometime on a new build? There does seem to be too much of the pass the buck around the internet all I asked was why is the registry
 corrupt when I have not used ANY tools to edit it.

Stay away from Registry Cleaners!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Registry cleaning programs are *all* snake oil. Cleaning of the registry isn't needed and is dangerous. Leave the registry alone and don't use any registry cleaner. Despite
 what many people think, and what vendors of registry cleaning software try to convince you of, having unused registry entries doesn't really hurt you.
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">The risk of a serious problem caused by a registry cleaner erroneously removing an entry you need is far greater than any potential benefit it may have.

<p><span style="font-style: italic">Let me point out that neither I nor anyone else who warns against the use of registry cleaners has ever said that they always cause problems. If they always caused problems,
 they would disappear from the market almost immediately. Many people have used a registry cleaner and never had a problem with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Rather, the problem with a registry cleaner is that it carries with it the substantial *risk* of having a problem. And since there is no benefit to using a registry cleaner,
 running that risk is a very bad bargain.</span></p>

<p>WHY does Microsoft have a Registry if LOTS of entries are pointing at Files that&nbsp;are in C:\Windows\Help\mui\0409\&nbsp;&nbsp; when the registry says this program will find them at
</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Help</p>
<p>Is there any developers out there that can answer this.</p>
<p>Please NO MORE about the disadvantages of Registry Tools that is not what this is about.</p>
<p>Is this an error thats been there since day 1.</p>

<p>Eveyone presumes the registry is perfect on initial install, I WONDER?</p>
<p>We take the registry for granted this was an easy error to spot, can you imagine what errors could be lurking when trying to interpret GUID CLSID ProgID errors that can't be related to just a simple file location. Does anybody KNOW the Registry or perhaps
 that is the problem no one does so dont touch, after all we are all told if it aint broke dont fix it.</p>

<p>Lets try to give an analogy</p>
<p>You live in Great Britain</p>
<p>Health Service is provided free under the NHS.</p>
<p>They store all your medical records on it, but the clerk entered the data incorrectly.</p>
<p>You entered hospital and was prescribed the wrong medicine and died.</p>
<p>Scenario 1</p>
<p>This error would never have been found if you had not gone into hospital and wouldn't have slowed the hospital responce to any other patient</p>
<p>Scenario 2</p>
<p>Somene was checking the database one day stumbled upon the errror and corrected it, the previous patient survived and no one ever new.</p>
<p>Does anyone get that this is just WRONG? Microsoft are you listening, I know the registry is large but what is the point of telling you where the help files are when they are just not there.</p>

<p>This is not Microsoft. This is a forum provided by Microsoft to enable users of their software to share experiiences and solutions to common problems. No one here is going to say we understand your problem and we will change Windows to suit your requirements.
 We may or may not share your views but all we can do is suggest a workaround or point out where you are mistaken, if indeed you are.</p>
<p>I am not sure what evidence you are basing your statements about the registry but even if they were true it is pointless trying to make changes. Certainly it is unwise to rely on statements made by those wishing to sell you a registry cleaner. Using a registry
 cleaner gives neglible tangible benefits and risk creating insoluble errors which can only be resolved by reinstalling Windows.&nbsp;You cannot rely on a statement by a registry cleaner that it has found an error. They claim to have found 100's of errors but it
 is impractical to sift through all the errors for one that really matters. Which Registry Cleaner are you sure is so right?</p>
<p>Do these reported errors really make a significant impact on performance? There are many more practical ways of achieving better system performance.</p>

<p>Well I also realized I have this problem it hasn't affected my gameplay in any way. I have seen countless posts on this subject and people giving advice on how to take care of your disc. I am an adult and sadly i mostly just play black ops so it sits in
 the xbox more than anything. I have rarely put it back into it's case and have done so carefully when needed so imagine my surprise after reading about all these posts that i thought they just didnt take care of thier stuff that i would find the same thing
 when i looked at my own black ops disc. This is upsetting that the quality of materials used to make a $60 dollar game + $60 Live subscription to enjoy the game would be so poor.</p>

<p>Ya this was my first xbox and i am cheap and bought the 4GB kinect bundle so black ops wont install to my hard drive. It also hasn't affected playability yet. I was just posting because i see some people get harrassed for this thing happening and just realizing
 there might be some truth to the quality of the case and or disc being the culprit. because i too am falling victim to these cracks around the inner disc i just never noticed them before until i read the forums and took a look myself.</p>

<p>Yup, the new "eco friendly" cases cause more wear and tear on the discs if you don't take them out perfectly. Pisses me off too, I even installed mine to the hard drive and still had to buy a new one two weeks ago.
</p>
<p>I must have taken cod4 in and out of the case 300 times, and yet I can still pop that game in and run it fine today, and it's not even installed to my hard drive. That was before these new cases came out.</p>

<p>Eco friendly, that's funny. Those cases were more then likely made to *** your game up. So you have to buy another one. Think about it, if you installed the game, and only used the disk to starts it, the disk would last forever. REMEDY: make it so the case
 breaks the game in a way so the disk can't spin. Making you buy another copy.</p>
<p>Personally, I think you should be able to download the file from xbox live if you already have the game. I mean, you'd need a code inside the case or something. Which could lead to misuse. There's gotta be a solution though. We shouldn't have to figure out
 ways of ripping off blockbuster or anything because someone ripped us off. ***</p>
<p>I just keep my games in paper sleeves now though. *** those cases</p>

<p>Like everything else these days. cheap cheaper cheapest. you cant buy anything worth a dime these days. I had to replace my disc because of crack. The case design has never been very good. You shouldnt have to buy insurance for a game disc that is made to
 remove from a case anyway</p>

<p>i put mine in the x box and downloaded it. i rarely take it out and when i do i dont put it in the case. it has scratches on it but also for 2 or 3 dollars cd trade post will take them out. i refuse to put my games in those cases i usually go to garage sales
 and buy dumb @@@ movies for a quarter and then throw the dumb @@@ movies away and keep the cases good luck to you though</p>

<p>I know alot of people like to blame it on the end user when their disc cracks. But I have over 70 Xbox 360 and original Xbox games. None have ever cracked on me except Black Ops. I was at GameStop just yesterday to buy another copy ( can't go with out Zombies)
 And they told me that all of their copies of Black Ops were recalled. The guy behind the counter said he has never seen anything like it. He and his coworkers had to find all the copies of Black Ops and box them up, and send to to corporate. &nbsp;HOWEVER, I was
 in luck (kinda) and someone had just traded in a game that day and I bought it. HOWEVER I inspected the disc before I bought it. And guess what there is a hair line crack in the center circle already forming. I did knowingly buy it witha &nbsp;crack. I will just
 watch it to see if it gets worse. and it was only $20 bucks. </p>
<p>My real point is that mistakes happen and engineers mess up. I do not believe this is a plot by anyone to drum up sales. HOWEVER, Microsoft and Activsion and who ever could man up and do a recall and replace. It sucks but people will trust them more for
 fessing up. ALSO they should have a more clear replace policy. If you send back the game that has all the official stickers that shows it is an original game they should replace it for about the cost of shipping and a new disc. maybe make it a perk of having
 an Xbox live account? Register your games in your XBOX account much like your Xbox(s) and they can replace for a small fee.
</p>
<p>Just thinking.....</p>

<p>Did you purchase Nuketown Zombies or Nuketown 2025? &nbsp;I've seen plenty of people mix them up. &nbsp;I've also seen a few people not be able to find it in game. &nbsp;When you go to zombies, and press "Solo Play," a map should come up and default on a tire with bones
 symbol, if you scroll to the right, you should get a Nuketown symbol, press "A" on there and you should be able to play it.</p>
<p>If it really just isn't showing up, then delete Nuketown Zombies and clear the system cache(press Y on the HDD when choosing a storage device).&nbsp; Then, redownload the map and see if that helps.</p>

            <p>Hey Zombee, did you try Thunder's suggestion of deleting the content, clearing your cache, then redownloading it? If not, try it out and let us know how that works for you!<br /><br />Also, as ngocphi suggested, make sure that your account location matches your physical location. I understand that your other COD dlc works fine, but it doesn't hurt to check the region when you're encountering a DLC issue.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;Hi Oldnev, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div><br />
Thank you for your post and giving us an opportunity to assist you.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description, I understand that you want to copy a CD from disk drive to Windows media player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's start with some questions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which CD are you referring to?</div>
<div>2. Which program are you referring to?</div>
<div>3. Are you trying to rip the CD?</div>
<div>4. What does CD contain?</div>
<div>5. What type of data does the CD contain?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are trying to rip the CD then follow the steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can rip (or copy) tracks from your audio CDs to your computer using Windows Media Center or Windows media player. After that, the tracks that you rip become digital media files on your computer. Settings such as the format of the file—for example,
 Windows Media Audio (WMA) or MP3—and bit rate for the files are determined by the settings specified in Windows Media Player. For more information about changing the settings in Windows Media Player,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Follow the steps.</div>
<div><br />
a. Insert an audio CD into the CD-ROM drive on your computer, and then open Windows Media player.<br />
b. On the start screen, click now playing, and then click Copy CD.<br />
c. If you have not ripped audio CDs before in Windows Media Player or Windows Media Center, follow and complete the steps on the Copy Options screens.<br />
d. In the Copy CD dialog box, click Yes to rip the tracks to your computer. The ripped music tracks are automatically added to your music library.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
You can also refer to the link as well</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Locked out of Admin account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bromleyh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Locked out of Admin account</h2>
                    
<p>Something strange has occurred with my Windows 7. We had two user accounts on there: mine (which was also the Admin account) and my wife's. Neither of these accounts had a password. (Perhaps not a good idea, but nobody else uses our computer.)</p>
<p>Last night, my wife's account wasn't showing up on the opening sign-in screen, but there was a blank profile called "Other User". When I logged onto that and entered my wife's user account, it let us log in.</p>
<p>I went into Users to see if I could see what was going on, and I'm not sure how it happened, but the next thing I knew, without entering anything at all, it was saying that there was a password on my Admin account.</p>
<p>So I logged back out to the use login screen and now my wife's account shows up, and there's only the blank "Other User" profile showing up for me. If I log into it and enter my username, it prompts for a password - a password which I never created and thus
 do not know. So now I'm locked out of the Admin account for my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything I can do?</p>

            There are two things you can do:<br />
<ul>
<li>Reboot your machine into Repair Mode, using your Windows Repair CD, then use System Restore to set Windows back to a point before your problems started.</li><li>Plan ahead. Having a single admin account involves some obvious risks. You must have two fully tested admin accounts, with their details recorded on paper.</li></ul>
Post again if you require more details.

            <p>Thank you for clarifying all those details. We suggest that you update your printer drivers. If the printer driver says it's updated, you may run an update within the manufacturer's website.

    <title>Windows 10 mouse and keyboard error message. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevefriedlander  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 mouse and keyboard error message.</h2>
                    <p>Three months ago installed Windows 10 on my HP computer.&nbsp; At start up and sign in I get a message that the keyboard (wired HP) and mouse (Microsoft wired trackball optical mouse) are not working properly.&nbsp; Both seem to be at optimum levels.&nbsp; Still I tried
 diagnostics and drivers and all indicate all up to date and keyboard / keyboard operating without problems.&nbsp; This never occurred with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>1) Source and reason for message?</p>
<p>2) How to eliminate message or check to see if there is a so far undetectable issue.</p>

            <p>Hi Steve,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">We would be glad to help you with the issue you are facing today. I understand the difficulty with the problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I would suggest you to check if the keyboard &amp; mouse are connected&nbsp;to the computer properly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check if the issue persists, in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that&nbsp; starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
<span>Safe Mode</span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.
</p>
<p>
